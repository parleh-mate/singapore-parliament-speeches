<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENS TAKING UP DUAL CITIZENSHIP</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether

the  Government  allows  Singapore  citizens  to  take  up  dual

citizenship, i.e. the citizenship of another country as well  as

that of Singapore's.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof.  Ho  Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Minister  of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof.  Ho  Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b>  Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Government  does  not  allow Singapore  citizens  to  have  dual

citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a young nation. We have not reached the stage

of  nationhood  where  a Singaporean with a  second  citizenship

would still retain his identity and loyalty to Singapore as  his

homeland wherever he goes, his second citizenship being only  of

secondary importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners are granted Singapore citizenship only if they

are committed to making Singapore their home, and see their long-term future with Singapore, in which case they should readily be

prepared to give up their foreign nationality.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Does the Minister of

State  envisage  that there would be any policy  change  in  the

conceivable future?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the answer is no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Would the Minister of

State  indicate  to the House the countries in  which  Singapore

citizens have acquired citizenship?  And if the Government knows

that  they have acquired a foreign citizenship, what steps would

the  Government take to see that they either give  up  Singapore

citizenship or the other country's citizenship, because  I  have

known of countries where this has happened?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, if the Government comes to

know  of such people, they will be told to give up their foreign

citizenship if they want to retain their Singapore citizenship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> What is the

Government's position as regards youths and others  who  acquire

citizenship abroad by birth, in that sense, they are given  dual

citizenship?   I am thinking here primarily of Singaporeans  who

go  to  work or live abroad for long periods and their  children

acquire  citizenship  by  birth or  other  reasons  under  those

countries' laws.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, for cases like that,

children  who are born overseas to Singapore parents, they  hold

dual  citizenship until they have reached 21 years old and  they

are  required  to  affirm an oath of loyalty before  their  22nd

birthday.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (26th February, 1999).

"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government

for the financial year 1st April, 1999 to 31st March, 2000.".  - [Minister for Finance].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>12.34 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support  the motion standing in the name of Dr  Richard  Hu,

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic crisis we are going through today is the

worst  the world has seen in 50 years.  Every economy  is  being

put  to  a  real  test  and they will come  out  with  different

responses.   Take, for example, Hong Kong and  Singapore.   Even

though both of us are among the world's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>

freest economies, yet we come out with very different responses.

Just  last week, the Hong Kong Secretary for Trade and  Industry

explained  the  different responses between Singapore  and  Hong

Kong  by  saying  that  it was because the Singapore  Government

controls  the people, the trade unions, and so on,  whereas  the

Hong  Kong people are more creative, more innovative.  I have  a

different explanation.  I think the core issue is that  for  the

last  100  years, Hong Kong has been busy building a competitive

economy, whereas in the case of Singapore, in the last 33 years,

we have been busy building a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big difference between building an economy and

building  a  nation.   In the case of Hong Kong,  the  focus  is

purely on competitiveness.  In the case of Singapore, we adopt a

balanced approach between competitiveness and cohesion.  Because

of  this equal emphasis on competitiveness and cohesion, we  are

able to achieve unity in purpose, have a cohesive people and one

united people.  That is why we are able to move together in  one

force.  Sir, there is a saying that people do not care how  much

the  government  knows until they know how much  the  government

cares.   If  you  were  to look at the two  off-Budget  measures

announced by the Minister and the Budget announced this year, if

you  look  at  the three Budgets in totality, it is quite  clear

that,  firstly, this Government does know how to run the economy

and  the  kind of difficulties the business community is facing.

Hence   these   various   cost-cutting   measures.    But   more

importantly,  it also clearly demonstrated that  the  Government

does care for the people knowing the kind of pain the people are

going  through  as  a  result  of wage  reductions  and  so  on.

Therefore,   the  Government  has  introduced  a  total   rebate

amounting to about $485 million.  It is a clear concrete  action

on  the part of the Government to demonstrate that it knows  how

to run the economy and it cares for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as a labour MP, I fully support the financial policy

announced by the Minister.  Sir, this Budget 1999-2000 is a very

significant one for two reasons, at least.  Firstly,  this  will

be the first time that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>

we  are  going  to  run  into a significant  operating  deficit.

Secondly,  this is the Budget that will take us  into  the  next

century.  I feel it is very important that we make full  use  of

this  Budget  to spur Singaporeans to embrace a new  mindset  in

preparation for the new millennium.  To transform the mindset of

the  population, I think it is very much like trying  to  change

the  shape  of  a  block of solid ice.  One way  to  do  it  is,

firstly,  "de-freeze" the ice, because a solid block of  ice  is

very  hard  to reshape.  But if you can de-freeze  the  ice  and

reshape  the water and then re-freeze the water, we can  end  up

with  a  new mindset, like a new block of ice with a new  shape,

without  losing  too  much water.  Looking  at  the  mindset  of

Singaporeans,  over  the last 33 years, we  do  form  a  certain

mindset  after  all  these  years.   And  now  this  mindset  of

Singaporeans  is  de-freezing under the  heat  of  the  regional

crisis.   In  a  way, I think our challenge is to capitalise  on

this  opportunity  now  to reshape the mindset  of  Singaporeans

before  this mindset is being re-frozen again.  The next two  to

three  years is really a window of opportunity for us to do  so.

Even  though the cyclical recovery of the Singapore  economy  is

likely  to  happen, maybe over the next six months  to  a  year,

structural  recovery is not likely to take place until  after  a

period  of  a  few  years of concerted effort  by  all  parties.

Therefore, it is very important that over this period of two  to

three years, we make full use of the financial policies to  spur

all  Singaporeans, business community, civil servants towards  a

new  mindset, so that we can move together in one force, in  one

united direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I feel that there are three areas we can do

with more emphasis in the implementation of the financial policy

this coming year.  These three areas are the public sector,  the

private  sector and the people sector.  Firstly, in  the  public

sector,  I feel that 1999-2000 is a good time for us to forge  a

new  mindset in the public sector among the civil servants.   In

the  past,  we have always looked at unspent budget as something

bad because it adds further to budget surplus.  But this year is

different.  We are going to have a budget deficit,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>

which  means  any Ministry that is able to save  on  the  annual

budget  is,  in  fact,  going to help us to  reduce  the  budget

deficit.   So  any unspent budget should be viewed as  something

good rather than bad.  In fact, if the civil service can improve

spending  or  achieve a saving of 1% alone, it  will  amount  to

about  $292 million.  It is a lot of money.  If we are  able  to

achieve a 5% improvement in cost optimisation, the total  saving

will  come  to  $1.5 billion, which is about 30% of  the  budget

deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my main point here is this. I am actually very comfortable

with the $5.1 billion budget deficit, but my point is that I  am

not  convinced that every civil servant is putting every  dollar

to  the best use.  We are putting the money to good use but  not

necessarily to the best use.  My suggestion is why  not  send  a

clear  message  to all civil servants to take  this  year  as  a

beginning of the new year to challenge ourselves on how we  can,

as   a  public  sector,  achieve  better  outcomes  with  lesser

resources.  And here I have two suggestions on how this  can  be

done.  Firstly, send a clear guideline to all Ministries to  cut

down  on  the  "nice-to-have" spending on  hardware  facilities.

Because I feel that over time, our hardware facilities, like the

schools,  hospitals,  including bus stops, are  getting  better-looking  year after year.  There is a danger that  we  may  have

gone over board.  Choosing between a public institution of a  5-star  hardware facility and a 3-star software capability  versus

one   with   5-star  software  capability  and  3-star  hardware

facility, I think any time I will go for the one that is able to

offer   5-star   software  capability  because   this   software

capability  is  what will make a difference in  the  quality  of

public  services  to  the members of the public.   By  making  a

constant  check on cost control on hardware spending, hopefully,

we  would be able to reduce the cost of public services  to  the

members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is that as far as the hardware design and hardware

spending  are  concerned, let us remind ourselves that  we  must

continue    to    focus    on    functionality,    buildability,

maintainability,  and so on.  Better still,  why  not  set  cost

standards and challenge the Ministries to try

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>

to achieve saving over the next few years?  At the same time, we

have  to  challenge the Ministries to set clear targets  on  how

they  can improve on software capability.  Today we already have

the  Budgeting For Results system in place.  Why not we  require

all  Ministries now to clearly spell out exactly  what  kind  of

software  capability targets they are going to achieve over  the

next  few  years.   Hopefully, by re-orientating  our  focus  on

software  capability,  making a check on hardware  spending,  we

would be able to offer better public services at lower cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that in the coming years, can we not do

something   to   encourage  inter-Ministry   collaboration   and

innovation in the public sector?  We are going to face many  new

economic and social challenges in the coming years and  many  of

them  will be very different from the kind of challenges we  had

faced  in the past.  Take, for example, from an economic  angle,

our  challenge  to move towards a knowledge-based  economy.   So

many  Ministries will have to be involved, whether  it  is  MTI,

MOM, Education, and so on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social front, our challenge is to overcome such issues as

aging  population  and the emergence of an information  society.

Again,  many  Ministries will have to be involved in  order   to

make sure that the social need, economic issues and so on of  an

aging population are addressed.  The Inter-Ministry Committee on

the  Aged  is  a  step in the right direction.  We  have  to  do

likewise for the information society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the nation-building point of view, we also have new

challenges,  like  the one being addressed by the  Singapore  21

Committee,  chaired  by  RAdm  Teo  Chee  Hean,  regarding   the

strengthening  of  the heartware of Singaporeans.   Again,  many

Ministries  have  to  be involved if we want  to  truly  make  a

quantum leap in strengthening the heartware in the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point here is that be it knowledge-based economy or

information  society  or aged population  or  strengthening  the

heartware of Singaporeans,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>

all  these are multi-dimensional issues requiring inter-Ministry

collaboration, over a sustained period of time.  If we  want  to

really  achieve the kind of outcome we are looking for, we  will

need  to  set  clear  targets, assign clear  responsibility  and

support  them with adequate resources.  In other words,  we  may

have  to  look into ways of creating a separate budget for  such

inter-Ministry projects and, hopefully, this new budget will not

be  created at the expense of increasing our budget deficit.  My

suggestion  is to reduce all Ministries' budget  by  10%.   With

that, we will be able to create a fund of about $3 billion.  Put

this fund under the direct charge of the Ministry of Finance and

use  it to support inter-Ministry projects and collaboration  so

that,  over  time,  the issue of knowledge economy,  information

society,  and  so  on, can really be addressed  in  a  concerted

effort by all Ministries and all civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that there is also a need to strengthen

the  new  mindset in the private sector.  Up till now,  we  have

often heard the business community complaining that the cost  of

doing  business  in Singapore is too high and that  we  need  to

lower cost.  But how low can we go?  At the end of the day, what

is  the purpose of economic progress if we keep on talking about

cost cutting, wage cutting, and so on?  Over time, I am not  too

sure  how  we  can  sustain  our  competitiveness  through  cost

cutting.  It is quite clear that innovation and adaptability are

really  the key if we want to sustain our growth in a knowledge-based economy.  But we have to recognise that process towards  a

knowledge-based economy is going to be an evolutionary  approach

and  the  process will take time.  The change management  expert

will  tell us that any change process would go through at  least

five  stages.   We start with the pioneers, the early  adopters,

the  early majority, followed by the late majority and then  the

laggard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for Singapore is not to try to achieve the

change   overnight  but  rather  how  we  can  speed   up   this

evolutionary  approach.  How can we help the early adopters  and

pioneers to succeed in setting the pace so that, hopefully, they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>

will  give encouragement to many more others to come along?   In

this  regard, I feel that the off-Budget measures last year  and

the  Budget this year have sent a very clear message only to the

financial  community.  The feedback from the business  community

is  that they are not hearing the same strong message being sent

to  all the other sectors, whether it is manufacturing or retail

or communication, and so on.  So my suggestion is this.  Why not

revise  all  the incentive packages managed by all the  economic

agencies  to encourage companies to move towards knowledge-based

companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I have two suggestions. For companies to be

knowledge-based companies, firstly, they must be able to develop

total   capabilities,   hopefully  base  their   operations   in

Singapore.    We  have  to  encourage  them  to   deepen   their

capabilities  in  individual areas,  whether  it  is  technology

development,   market   development,   innovation   development,

organisation  development  or mass customisation.   In  each  of

these areas, obviously we have to encourage them to deepen their

capabilities.  But what is even more important is  to  encourage

them  to  nurture their capabilities in all these five areas  so

that  they  will  be  able to function truly as  knowledge-based

companies  to be able to respond quickly to market  changes  and

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the existing incentive schemes in

Singapore   today   are   basically   targeted   at   individual

capabilities.   Maybe  it is about time  that  the  Ministry  of

Finance  reviewed  the need on whether we should  repackage  all

these  incentive  schemes so that, while on  the  one  hand,  we

achieve  the deepening of capability objective but, at the  same

time, we achieve the broadening capability objective.  Maybe  we

should also look into whether there is a need to reorganise  the

duties and responsibilities of various economic agencies because

it  is  no longer possible for each of the economic agencies  to

promote  their  own areas of interest in isolation.   Take,  for

example,  for  any  company which wants to be a  knowledge-based

company, henceforth, when they want to deepen their R&D

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>

capability, they talk to NSTB.  When they want to enhance  their

innovation capability, they talk to NCB and EDB.  When they want

to  go into mass customisation, they talk to EDB and JTC.   When

they  want to go to market development, they talk to TDB.   When

they  want to go to organisation development, they talk to  MOM.

Over  time, if we continue to let this develop, we are going  to

lose  our  capability  in  offering one-stop  service  to  these

leading  investors of the world, whether they are MNCs or  local

enterprises.   So  I  hope  that  this  is  something  that  the

Government would think about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area, in promoting the change of mindset in the

private  sector  is  that,  for  knowledge-based  companies   to

succeed, for them to have this total capability, obviously  they

have  to invest more in manpower development.  If I were  to  be

objective  about this, today, there are three ways  at  least  a

knowledge-based company can develop their manpower.   The  first

is  by  retraining their existing workforce.  The second  is  by

getting  rid  of  those  who cannot fit  in  and  recruit  young

Singaporeans who are better educated.  The third is  to  recruit

foreign  talents.   I  think all three  approaches  are  equally

relevant.   But  my point is that, from the company's  point  of

view,  the cost of redeveloping the existing workforce  is  most

time-consuming and, in fact, can be most expensive.   Therefore,

it  is  very  important that we do something  to  help  them  to

balance  the  cost equation so that it will make business  sense

for  companies to reinvest in manpower rather than  to  displace

them with younger or foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that what we have to do is to set up a manpower

development assistance scheme.  When we decided to promote  R&D,

we have the Research Development Assistance Scheme (RDAS).  When

we  promote  innovation,  we  have the  Information  Development

Scheme  (IDS).   When we want to promote market development,  we

have the Market Development Assistance Scheme (MDAS).  Today, we

want  to promote manpower development, why not set up a Manpower

Development Assistance Scheme so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>

all  companies  will  find it to their  commercial  interest  to

invest  in  manpower  development.  Hopefully,  over  time,  the

training  and  development of knowledge workers  will  become  a

joint  responsibility of not just the Government and  the  union

but all companies as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third area, which is the people

sector.   Likewise,  we need to find ways  to  inculcate  a  new

mindset  in the people sector as well.  We are going to  face  a

lot  of new challenges in the area of social cohesion as we move

ahead.   In  the past, when we talked about social cohesion,  we

focused  on  areas  like,  for example, racial  harmony,  wealth

sharing,  and so on.  But, in future, there will be  new  issues

that would challenge us in terms of social cohesion.  Take,  for

example, the potential widening of social gap between the  young

and  the  old;  the widening of wage gap between  the  knowledge

workers   and  the  unskilled  workers;  and  the  widening   of

communication  gap between the connected and the unconnected  in

the  population.  The greater inflow of foreign talents and  the

increasing number of structurally unemployable Singaporeans will

add to social tension as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is: what can we do to further strengthen

this  greater  sense  of  caring  and  sharing  in  the  age  of

globalisation and technology?  I remember that in the past, when

we  wanted to change the mindset of Singaporeans towards  family

planning, when we wanted them to go beyond two, to go for  three

or  four  if  they could afford it, what did we do?  We  offered

them  a  whole  host  of  incentives  like  priority  in  school

registration.   We  even offered them tax  rebate  amounting  to

$20,000.   In  fact,  many people said that you  could  actually

start  a bigger family to enjoy pioneer status for four to  five

years,  and  so on.  Now the question is: at a time  like  this,

when we are going to encounter many more social challenges,  why

not consider to provide some kind of incentives to encourage and

reinforce  some  of these social values which will  help  us  to

strengthen our social cohesion in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>

future?   Take, for example, this year, we are going to  give  a

10%  tax rebate to all taxpayers.  My question is: why not  just

give 5% rebate to everyone?  For the other 5% equivalent, we can

return  it  to the taxpayer, for example, in the form of  higher

tax relief for parents and dependants.  So, hopefully, this will

help  to  send  across the message that the  family  is  a  very

important building block of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. We want to encourage people to continue to

contribute to charity and community projects.  Why not give them

tax allowance just like the way we give investment allowance  to

companies  who  invest  in  capital equipment?   The  difference

between a company investing in capital equipment versus somebody

who gives money to charity is, in my view, that one is investing

for  economic  return, whereas when giving to  charity,  we  are

investing for social return, ie, social cohesion.  I think  both

are worth supporting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some of the suggestions. My point

basically  is  that  we can think about how  to  use  all  these

taxation  incentives, rebates, and so on, to also  help  reshape

the  mindset of Singaporeans so that they will be more aware  of

the need to take on a greater sense of social responsibility  as

we move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, 1999 is a golden opportunity for us to

inculcate  a  new  mindset in all the three "P"  sectors  -  the

Public  sector,  the People sector and the Private  sector.   We

need  to  inculcate this new mindset because, for  Singapore  to

succeed,  we  need to have many more new change  agents  in  the

Government,  the  business community and the people  sector,  so

that the pace of change will be faster.  It is my hope that,  in

the implementation of this year's financial policy, we will send

a  very  clear  signal  to  all Singaporeans  and  the  business

community  that only by constantly reinventing our economy,  our

society  and  our  civil  service,  can  we  become  even   more

competitive  as  a  knowledge  economy,  more  cohesive  as   an

information society and more united as a developed nation in the

21st century.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

those  of  us who have visited New York City, we may  have  come

across  the display of "The National Debt Clock" on a wall  near

42nd  Street  in midtown.  Amongst other things,  it  tells  the

American  people  how  big  the country's  interest  burden  is.

Apparently,  this  clock  serves  as  a  stern  warning  against

wasteful Government spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over here in Singapore, the Government is expecting to

record  a  budget deficit of some $5 billion for  the  financial

year  beginning  1st  April 1999 which is almost  11  times  the

projected  deficit  of  $466 million for the  current  financial

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Singapore recorded a budget deficit was during the

downturn  in  the  mid-80s.  Since then, we  have  booked  in  a

surplus averaging more than $4 billion a year, reaping the  full

benefits  of  the boom cycle between 1994 and  1996.   This  has

enabled  us  to  take a definitive step forward towards  further

development of capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two successive years of budget deficits should not

be  taken lightly.  And we note that they are not the result  of

wasteful Government spending.  Neither are they the result of  a

bailing  out of the corporate or banking sector but of carefully

planned  expenditure  to  help position  Singapore  for  further

growth beyond the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors and Singaporeans alike would have noted that the

cumulative deficits for FY98 and FY99 will draw down the bulk of

the  FY97  reserves,  which have provided adequate  cushion  for

pushing ahead with long-term plans on the one hand and extending

short-term  assistance during this crisis on the  other.   As  a

result, I do not think investors are asking how we are going  to

fund these deficits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned 10% jump in development expenditure to $13.9

billion  is the strongest demonstration of a commitment  towards

building  economic capabilities in spite of the current regional

crisis.  In the context of a depressed economic region, this  is

quite a luxury.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this crisis has triggered many structural changes

within  the  region, not least within Singapore, and within  the

financial sector.  Many big corporations have undertaken massive

restructuring  towards becoming leaner and meaner organisations.

In  the  process,  many have no choice but  to  divest  non-core

businesses or write off substantial sums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserving businesses caught in a credit crunch have been

acquired by investors frequently of foreign origin.  There is  a

quest  towards streamlining operations for better  economies  of

scale or towards strengthening capitalisation to better position

for  a  fast-changing economic landscape.  These  have  inspired

several mergers of corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore is spearheading a bold, but

necessary,  blueprint  for changes to the  financial  sector  in

Singapore.   We  aim  ultimately to  be  a  financial  hub  that

involves  major  players  offering a whole  gamut  of  financial

services.   This  has  already spurred the  merging  of  several

banks.   There  is  no doubt that the ensuing  consolidation  of

strength  will  facilitate the capturing of  a  bigger  role  in

domestic and regional banking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to focus on the implications of some

of   these  changes,  particularly  for  the  small  and  medium

enterprises (or SMEs) in the short-term, and entrepreneurship in

the longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As banks consolidate and streamline efficiencies, in the current

climate,  there may be a tendency to move in favour of servicing

the  bigger  customers.   No  doubt, some  banks  have  actually

defined  the middle market as a niche segment but it  is  highly

conceivable  that  smaller companies may wind  up  being  under-served or poorly-served by the restructured banking system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SMEs are already feeling the heat of a cashflow

squeeze  brought about by a credit crunch.  Many  are  lamenting

the  tight, if not fast disappearing, credit terms.   Whilst  we

can logically expect banks to exercise prudence at this time, so

as to minimise the level of non-performing loans, many SMEs are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>

concerned   that   given   the  massive   restructuring,   their

traditional bankers may have abandoned them altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps some of these fears may be exaggerated but this

raises an important question.  Is it time to revisit the need to

provide some form of development financing, similar to the  role

played  by  the  Development Bank of Singapore in our  formative

years  of  growth?  Although various assistance  schemes  exist,

they  tend  to  cater mainly to manufacturing of electronics  or

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship frequently gets tripped up by a lack of funds.

Beyond exploring the question of a sustenance of the traditional

bank  credit or availability of development and financing,  more

needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, multi-national corporations have

hitherto been a substantial employer, often offering challenging

jobs  on  attractive  terms.  This has reinforced  the  tendency

amongst  Singaporeans towards being an employee rather  than  an

entrepreneur  or  a shareholder.  If this trend  is  allowed  to

persist  over a prolonged period of time, the paucity  of  home-grown entrepreneurship can only be more pronounced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture entrepreneurship, I believe that the Government

should drive the following initiatives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to define and promote the role of venture capital among the

SMEs;  help  educate  the  owners and  facilitate  the  matching

process;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) enlarge the investor base beyond the Economic Development

Board  (EDB),  and beyond electronics.  This may entail  working

with parties in the private sector; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to design incentives for such investments, such as tax

concessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy of the

Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is

going  through  a  very difficult and momentous  period  of  our

history.  Today, we face two issues:  (1) economic; and (2) geo-political.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic front, we are in recession while on the geo-political front, we are facing regional political uncertainties.

This  budget is packaged in the midst of this economic recession

and  political uncertainties of the region.  If the  problem  is

pure  economics as in 1985, it is easier, because  we  can  find

answers  to economic problems.  But today, because it  is  mixed

with   politics,   there   are  too   many   imponderables   and

uncertainties.  Thus, it was only until recently  that  we  were

able  to  move  in and out of Indonesia, Malaysia  and  Thailand

without  giving  it a second thought to safety  and  cost.   But

today,  we see a different Malaysia, a different Indonesia,  and

we  no  longer visit their countries so frequently, as we  would

like to.  It is sad and worrying too because we now see a change

in  attitude in Indonesia and some of their leaders  are  saying

things about us which were never said before.  I would not  want

to  repeat  what  was said because it serves  no  good  purpose.

However,  the  Straits  Times  Editorial  of  3rd  March   1999,

headlined "Indonesia Tests Singapore", reflects the feelings  of

many  Singaporeans.  I would like to quote one of the paragraphs

in the text:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indonesia and Singapore remain friends. It is to their

mutual interest that this be the case.  But friendship must  not

be  construed as weakness.  Singapore does no more than state  a

fact  of  international  life when it  reiterates  the  inherent

equality  that must continue to underpin relations  between  the

two  countries.  Indonesians must understand that this  is  non-negotiable for Singaporeans".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As political events unfold in Indonesia, we are seeing more

attitudinal  changes towards us, most of it so far  not  in  our

favour.   We  must  therefore be alert, remain  calm  and  react

rationally and cautiously.  The sad part of it all will  be  the

slowing  of  trade,  the  curtailing of  investments  into  this

region,  the reduction in tourism and the breakdown of  business

links.   This  is a sad time for ASEAN, also Singapore.   Having

said that, we want to wish

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>

Indonesia  well so that we can avoid further social  unrest  and

turmoil and enjoy peace.  Peace leads to economic prosperity for

all.   Malaysia's closure of Clob has affected many  Singaporean

investors.  Many Singaporeans lost money.  Capital control,  the

Anwar  trial and a changing Malaysian political scene will bring

problems  for  our  businessmen.  We hope that  capital  control

measures will not prevent tourism between the two countries, let

alone  doing  business  there.   For  the  coming  elections  in

Indonesia and Malaysia, we can expect more uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the uncertain geo-political scene as the background,

we  have  now  to  take care of our recession.  For  the  second

consecutive  year, we have a budget deficit and the  deficit  is

growing from $466 million last year to $5 billion this year.   A

budget  deficit would mean having to draw on our reserves  which

fortunately is not a problem.  Last year, we have come  up  with

off-budget  measures costing $10.5 billion.  Taken together,  we

can  see  that  it is the Government's intention to  tackle  the

recession  through  a combination of managing  costs,  upgrading

skills  and  infrastructure, facilitate access  to  capital  and

promote investment, especially knowledge driven industries.   To

bring  relief  to companies and individuals, this budget  offers

some  short-term relief to companies and individuals with a  10%

tax  rebate granted to both categories of taxpayers.  There are,

included  in  the budget, tax changes to further  stimulate  the

bond  market and fund management industry.  These, together with

the  tax  exemption on global OHQs, are part of  the  continuing

drive  to reinforce Singapore's competitive position as a centre

for financial services and to attract more MNCs into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unemployment on the rise and cut in workers' CPF, and

salaries  in some cases, the 10% rebate on personal  income  tax

and  rebates  for S&C charges for HDB dwellers as  well  as  the

rebates  for  utilities would be most welcomed by the  taxpayers

and   non-taxpayers.    This   budget,   to   many   Singaporean

businessmen, is a non event and it was reported as such by one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>

of  the  business writers in the Business Times.   As  expected,

there were not much goodies left for the businessmen.  But it is

a  cautious budget, not too little or not too much.  And as  the

Second  Minister for Finance said in an interview given  to  the

press,  the Government, if need be, if the recession gets worse,

will  take more measures.  I think this is wise - to err on  the

side of caution.  However, as I said earlier, this budget should

be  taken together with the earlier measures given, that is, the

$10.5 billion package.  It will be more balanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans from all walks of life have in a way been

affected  by  the downturn in the economies of  the  region  and

Singaporeans  are  beginning to feel and to face  this  economic

crunch  beginning this January because January this  year,  they

see their take-home pay reduced, their CPF contribution cut, and

their  HDB mortgage loans harder to service.  Then there is  the

prospect  of  some having to lose their jobs.  For most  non-HDB

dwellers,  they worry about their obligations to pay  for  their

house  loans,  car loans, children's university education  fees,

hospital  bills  and  for  the  small  businessmen  hit  by  the

recession,  their bank overdrafts, their workers'  salaries  and

rental for their premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, we have to try to respond to their fears

and  concerns.  We cannot solve each and every individual  case.

However,  at the local ground level, most CDCs must  have  their

own recession package to help out and, as far as Bukit Timah CDC

is  concerned, we are beginning to see more and more such  cases

of  people  who  cannot pay their utilities bills,  kindergarten

school fees, flat rentals and of course job requests.  I am sure

many  of  us are faced with requests for assistance at  our  own

meet-the-people sessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I now come to a frequently discussed

sensitive subject - recruitment of foreign talent.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  in good times, people are more rational, they do not  have

unemployment,  pay  cut  or CPF cut to cloud  their  minds  and,

therefore, they are more prepared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>

accept  our reasons to take in foreigners to increase our talent

pool.  But today, we need to be more sensitive on the issue.  In

fact, we must tone down the message.  Instead, our emphasis as a

Government  is to reassure them how we take care of  them.   Our

message  to Singaporeans must be clear and loud.  We  will  help

Singaporeans  to get back the lost jobs.  We will take  care  of

their  basic  needs.  We will give support to  their  children's

education  by  increasing bursaries and scholarships.   We  will

have  schemes for our citizens to upgrade their skills  training

and  education and they will get priority over others  including

PRs.   This  is  a  more important priority  call  than  foreign

talent.  I can understand the rationale and need to inject  such

talents to our society.  I accept and I support this.  But  many

still do not, and especially in this time, such calls make  them

feel  threatened.  Bearing in mind that a good  number  of  jobs

lost  are from the middle management level, I feel that at  this

juncture, this call for foreign talent might be a bit misplaced.

Let us think Singaporeans first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the management of this recession does not mean

dishing  out  rebates but also includes the  management  of  our

people's  psyche,  their  fears, their  doubts.   We  must  give

Singaporeans no quarters as to where our priority lies.  We need

to  give them a sense of security and keep their morale high  in

order  that they will work with us to overcome this crisis.   We

should not take them for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have to emphasise to our people, as we have

been  doing,  why we put so much money on education  and  skills

training  during a recession.  Education's total expenditure  is

$5.72  billion, up 13.6%.  Many are still not keen on  upgrading

and  improving their skills.  We want them to feel with us.   We

want  them  to  understand why we do this.  We must  impress  on

these  Singaporeans that this is to prepare them when the upturn

comes.  This is good forward planning and I support strongly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to impress on those reluctant Singaporeans

that  if  we  prepare  well, we will overtake  others  fast  and

whatever  losses  we have suffered during this crisis,  we  more

than  make  up  during a recovery.  We must not  wait  till  the

recession ends.  And not many countries in the world can exploit

an economic downturn in this manner.  We can because we have the

means,  the  know-how and, most important, the  political  will.

Many years of careful economic policies and strategies can allow

us  to  be in this position, to use the economic downturn  as  a

breather   for  consolidating  and  re-examining  our   economic

strategies.   We did the same in 1985.  We took a critical  look

at  our economic competitiveness and reformed our wage structure

and because of this, we find easier acceptance this time when we

do our cost cutting measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made many strategic moves in the past. We switched

from an entrepot trade to a financial and industrial centre when

we  found  that the entrepot trade which we acted  as  middlemen

cannot  sustain.  Then we went regional.  We wanted an  external

wing.   We  were not that successful but never mind, failure  is

part  of  life in doing business.  Now we may have to go  beyond

our  neighbouring  shores, into Europe, America,  China,  India,

etc.  We will surely find more markets in these areas as we  are

not moving into unfamiliar grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, our two hinterlands - Malaysia and

Indonesia   -  are having both economic and political  problems.

They  are amongst our biggest trading partners but today,  trade

between  them and us has trickled to a low level.  It is  beyond

us  to change the outcome of events arising from our neighbours,

but whatever happens in both countries affects us.  Singaporeans

must  take  an  interest in what is happening in  Indonesia  and

Malaysia.   A  good  grasp  of their political  scenarios  would

better prepare ourselves to handle the regional situation as  it

comes.   There have been times when our leaders were put to  the

test, and there will be times when our leaders will again be put

to  the  test.  So long as we have been fair in our  conduct  of

regional affairs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>

we  will  be  able to enjoy respect and honour.  We  must  stand

behind our leaders during such times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in  support  of  the Budget Statement  presented  by  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year this time, when we debated the 1998 Budget, the

economic climate was very uncertain.  Unfortunately, since then,

many momentous and sweeping events have occurred all around  the

world  and  especially in some countries in this region.   These

events  had affected us adversely  and will continue to  have  a

major  bearing on how things will develop in the near and medium

term.  Our economic outlook is therefore still not any clearer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation is certainly better than even six months

ago.   Many are saying that the worst may be over.  I sense that

there are quite a number of Singaporeans in certain quarters who

are  cautiously  and quietly happy.   They are still  drawing  a

decent  income, in a secure job, in a stable or growing industry

with little risk of retrenchment.  Interest rates and hence debt

servicing  costs  are low; property prices and  car  prices  are

substantially  lower  than a couple of  years  back;  the  stock

market has recovered somewhat from its lowest; and airfares  are

at  an  affordable level.  So, for those who are still  employed

and  getting  paid  a  decent  and  steady  income,  things  are

beginning to look brighter again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before we get carried away and celebrate, we must

bear  in  mind  Minister  Richard Hu's reminder  in  his  Budget

Statement  that  there  are  still  many  uncertainties  in  our

external  environment   -  volatility in  the  global  financial

market,  the  health  of the US economy,  the  prospects  of  an

economic  recovery in Japan and the socio-political developments

in  this region.  Any one of these can unfold very suddenly  and

unexpectedly  with severe repercussions for those  who  are  not

prepared.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the factors cited by the Minister in

his  Budget  Statement,  another  concern  is  China's  economic

situation.   I  understand that exports from China are  slowing.

There is massive unemployment in the country, mainly as a result

of  structural reforms to the state economy.  The budget deficit

is  soaring.   There are concerns about deflation  as  consumers

become more careful and tighten their purse strings.  Some  fear

a  devaluation of the renminbi leading to yet another  round  of

competitive  devaluations by other developing  countries.   Many

investors  are jittery over this issue and have held back  their

investment  commitments in China or have reacted  negatively  on

any hint of a devaluation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Premier Zhu Rongji has again reaffirmed China's

commitment not to devalue and few are predicting instability  in

the renminbi exchange rate in the course of this year, I believe

we  cannot ignore the developments in China.  Could the Minister

give  us his assessment of the Chinese situation and the  likely

impact of the developments there on Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this uncertain backdrop, I fully support the

need to focus on the long-term development of our infrastructure

and  capabilities, while at the same time render some relief and

assistance  to  those who have been severely  affected  by  this

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget has been described as one with no-frills and even dull. From post-Budget feedback, I found the

perennial  calls for more goodies to be quite muted  this  time.

This  is  quite  different from last year when  a  $2.7  billion

surplus  was first announced.  There were accusations  that  the

Government  was  not doing enough.  This year, people  are  more

realistic  in  the face of a $5.1 billion budget deficit.   They

appreciate the increase in the personal tax rebate to  10%,  and

the  rebates and grants for service and conservancy charges  and

utilities.   They are also conscious of the external  influences

on  our  economic  well-being, and  understand  the  impact  the

economic  slowdown  and  the  previously-announced  cost-cutting

measures have on Government revenues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what else can or should we do for the individual? I

would  like  to  offer my views on three issues.   First,  HDB's

subsidised  loan rates.  This is on the amount of  interest  HDB

home-owners  are  paying  on  their  HDB  subsidised  loans.   I

mentioned  earlier  that  interest  rates  and  therefore   debt

servicing costs are substantially lower now, even when  compared

to  just  a few months ago.  Most home-owners are happy  as  the

lower  debt servicing cost has somewhat softened the  impact  of

the  reduction in their CPF contribution, ie, most  home-owners,

except  the  vast  majority  of HDB home-owners  who  have  HDB-subsidised  loans.   According to a 5th  March  article  in  the

Straits  Times, they are currently paying up to  $90  more  than

under the non-subsidised rates for every $100,000 of loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various suggestions have been offered on how the HDB can

solve this problem.  But I think the issue goes further than the

HDB.   It  is  a  financial issue relating to how  interest  for

Central Provident Fund deposits is calculated.  The funds needed

for  HDB subsidised loans are derived from CPF deposits  with  a

margin of 0.1 percentage point.  So, the HDB loan rates have  to

be  pegged  to  the CPF deposit interest rate;  otherwise  there

would be a mismatch.  And any revision to how the HDB subsidised

loan interest rate is calculated should originate from revisions

to the determination of the CPF interest rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the principle of pegging the HDB rate to the CPF

interest  rate is fundamentally sound, but the determination  of

the  interest rate can be further fine-tuned.  Many of  us  will

remember  that  a  few months ago, millions if not  billions  of

dollars  were withdrawn by CPF account holders to take advantage

of  the higher deposit rates offered by commercial banks.   Now,

of  course, there is a reverse flow of funds back to the CPF  to

earn  the  higher interest on CPF deposits.  What this means  is

that  these CPF depositors are benefiting at the expense of  HDB

home-owners   who  have  mortgage  loans.   This  situation   is

undesirable  and I hope the Minister would consider measures  to

address this problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another area which affects the finances of the

individual  and  should be reviewed to lessen  the  individual's

financial  burden is stored value cards.  Presently,  there  are

many  stored  value cards issued by a multitude of agencies  for

various  purposes   -  MRT fare card for daily  transport,  cash

card  for  ERP payments, coupons for parking, phone cards,  etc.

This  requires a person to put aside a fairly large sum of money

to  be  stored in the different cards.  A few dollars  here  and

there add up to a lot of money for the average family.  And if a

card  is  lost, he has lost cash.  I would like to  ask  whether

some  form of coordinated national plan could be implemented  to

streamline the different card systems and reduce the  number  of

cards which the consumer needs to carry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point on the individual relates to the need to

take  time and effort to acquire the requisite skills so  as  to

remain  relevant  in  our fast-changing world.   Residents  have

approached  me  during my meet-the-people sessions  to  ask  for

assistance on employment opportunities.  Very often, I find that

if the resident is a female, she would ask for a stall, not just

any  stall but a tuckshop stall in a school because there  is  a

captive  market, and not any tuckshop stall but a  drinks  stall

because the margins are higher and there is less work and skills

required in preparing drinks.  If the resident is male, he would

often  times  ask  for  a taxi driver's licence  because  if  he

already has a driver's licence to drive a private car, it is not

difficult to drive a taxi for a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot be a nation of tuckshop operators or taxi

drivers.   Our workers must be encouraged not to take  the  easy

and   short-sighted   solution  to  their  immediate   financial

problems,  but to invest time and energy to upgrade and  acquire

valuable new skills that would stand them in good stead  in  the

economy  of  the  future.  I believe we need  to  find  out  the

reasons  why some people are reluctant to go for retraining  and

skills upgrading, and see if steps can be taken to address these

problems specifically.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the concerns of businesses.

Notwithstanding  the introduction of the cost reduction  package

and  the  benefits  arising  from  the  cost  cutting  measures,

employers  are  suffering and saddled with  concerns  about  the

survival  of  their  businesses.   If  their  business  revenues

continue to decline, cutting expenses alone will not be able  to

turn  it  around.  I therefore welcome the various announcements

to  help businesses to seek out new markets and expand, examples

of which are the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme and recently,

the  Economic  Development Board's $100 million Promising  Local

Enterprises Investment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise three points on which we can or

should  do  for  local businesses.  One area of  assistance  for

businesses which I hope the Minister would consider is  allowing

losses  incurred  by one subsidiary of the group  to  be  offset

against  profits  made  by  another subsidiary.   Following  the

Government's  initiative, many companies have  diversified  into

other  businesses  and expanded into other countries.   Some  of

these business units are still profitable while others are  loss

making.    At   present,   our  tax  regulations   treat   these

subsidiaries within the same group as separate taxable  entities

and  losses  in  one  cannot be used to reduce  the  profits  in

another.   The  corporate  tax rate of  26%  on  the  profitable

subsidiaries  is  a heavy burden on the whole  group,  as  these

subsidiaries will have less ability and resources  to  help  the

other  non-profitable  companies within the  same  group.   This

would increase the pressure to shut down unprofitable operations

even  though  they  have good long-term  prospects.   Could  the

Minister   consider  allowing  companies  to  file  consolidated

returns  as  is  done in the UK and the United States?   Even  a

temporary relief would be most helpful to these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to touch on our high-tech ventures.

In  the  arena  of new technological developments,  no  one  can

predict  with certainty how things will turn out in  future  and

which  technology will succeed.  Out of the many  technopreneurs

"born" every day, only some of them will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

hit  the  big time and be winners.  We should therefore  promote

even more entrepreneurs to start up companies and the Government

should  exercise more flexibility in assisting and incentivising

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, the Government has established a number of

technology  and venture funds, the latest initiative  being  the

$100 million fund for Promising Local Enterprises.  However,  my

fear is that while the objectives of these programmes are noble,

their  success  depends, firstly, on the people  who  administer

these  funds  and,  secondly, on the  other  efforts  which  are

required to bring the product to the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether an investment is made or a grant is approved

depends  on  the people who evaluate the project and  administer

the  programme.   They should not simply focus  on  the  product

under  development and pass judgment on whether  it  will  be  a

success  in  the future or not. Such a top-down, inflexible  and

highly  prescriptive approach is inappropriate  and  potentially

harmful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high-tech, it is not merely investing in the technology

per   se,  but  more  importantly,  in  the  people  behind  the

technology because even if the present intention does  not  take

off  and fails, the true entrepreneur will pick himself up,  and

try  again  and again until he succeeds.  The administrators  of

the  programme  must  therefore have  the  ability  to  identify

entrepreneurs who have ideas, creativity, imagination, integrity

and the determination and drive to make it big.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, the people who administer these funds must

themselves  possess  some  of these attributes.   Alternatively,

these  funds  should be used to seed a broad  range  of  budding

start-up companies and hope that some of them will succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the success of a product does not depend merely on

how  good  it  is  but  also  on its  promotion,  marketing  and

distribution.  The 3M Post-it Notes, first conceived by Art Fry,

did not become an instant success but took many years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>

hard  work  before  it gained popular acceptance.   When  I  was

pursuing  my Physics undergraduate degree in the United  Kingdom

about  20  years  ago, my professor told me  that  although  the

British  were  good  scientists  and  researchers,  it  was  the

Americans   who   were  better  at  realising  innovations   for

commercial applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, great innovations do not sell by themselves. In

addition  to financing to promote innovation, we must also  fund

and  assist the commercial exploitation of these innovations and

develop them into great products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point on businesses relates to some of our

traditional   industries.   Although  I   am   advocating   more

assistance  to  be  given  to entrepreneurs  to  start  up  more

ventures  in  technological development, I believe  a  different

approach should be taken to restructure and consolidate some  of

our low-tech businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One common complaint among businessmen is that everybody is

undercutting  and lowering prices even to the extent  of  losing

money on specific projects just to keep its workers occupied and

stay  in  business.  The question is how long can  this  go  on.

Besides, undercutting is not necessarily good for the consumers.

It  does  not  mean that cheaper means better value  for  money;

undercutting  of  prices may bring about a  decline  in  quality

standards and a greater risk of default and non-performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many sectors, for example, construction and retail, the

local turf is over-crowded and over-saturated.  There are simply

too many local players fighting among themselves for a piece  of

the   local  market.   Malaysia,  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  the

traditional  overseas  markets  for  these  small   and   medium

enterprises have been badly affected and these companies have no

choice but to beat a hasty retreat to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present market environment, if left to the natural

course of the economic cycle and pure market forces alone, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

will   be  a  blood-bath  and  a  lot  of  suffering  and   lost

opportunities before the survivors eventually emerge.  More  may

be  out  of  business  resulting in  a  greater  loss  of  jobs.

Everyone will end up the loser, either dead, half-dead or dying.

Even hitherto strong companies, after fighting among themselves,

will  be depleted of vital energy.  They will have less strength

to face foreign competition and future competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should therefore facilitate the

restructuring and consolidation in some of these industries, not

by force, but by good sense accompanied by the strong persuasive

powers of grants and incentives.  Bosses, being bosses, will  be

reluctant  to be taken over to merge or to form joint  ventures.

They  must  be  encouraged to cooperate with others  for  shared

resources, for synergy and for economies of scale. The worldwide

trend  is  towards  bigger,  leaner and  stronger  companies  to

compete  effectively, if not globally, then at least regionally.

Only   then  can  we  have  the  critical  strength  to  compete

successfully  in  the  face  of changing  classic  business  and

economic paradigms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of opportunities out there for grabs. This

is  an  opportune time to capitalise on our strengths and  build

world-class   multi-nationals.   Other  small   countries   have

succeeded.  The Swiss control major international pharmaceutical

companies.   The  Netherlands has oil giant Shell  and  Philips;

Finland  has Nokia; Sweden, Ericsson. We can build our own  true

multi-nationals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy presented by the

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Budget this year

has  been  described by the press as a non-event.  I  think  the

press looks to it as a non-event because of the lack of measures

that  were needed to give a stimulus to the economy.   That  has

been  done in the two cost-cutting measures.  The first was  the

$2  billion package announced by the Minister in June 1998,  and

the  second  was introduced in November that year when  a  $10.5

billion package was presented in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>

Parliament  by  DPM Lee.  Those cost-cutting  measures  and  the

measures  announced  in the Budget are not expected  to  give  a

boost   to  the  economy  to  any  significant  recovery.    The

prediction  is that GDP for FY99 shall either have a  growth  of

only plus one percent or a shrinkage of minus one percent.   The

situation  of the economic downturn is not expected  to  improve

markedly  because  the  problem is not  internal  but  external.

Internally, Singapore is said to have done whatever it needs  to

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1985 recession, what Singapore needed to turn the economy

around  was simply to cut down costs and the following year  and

subsequent  years saw business picking up.  Foreign  investments

also started to flow back to Singapore.  But this time round the

recession is not due to our lack of competitiveness but  due  to

external factors, one of which is the collapse of the economy of

the  countries in the region.  Even should Indonesia be able  to

get  its economic infrastructure in order, business may not pick

up because of the serious social and political problems there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is supposed to hold its general election in June

this  year, but it may be postponed.  Civil unrest is still rife

in  that  country.  Every country in this region hopes that  the

June  election  will be held as planned and  goes  on  smoothly.

Then  a  legitimate Government can be elected with a mandate  to

carry  out the measures to restore the economy.  We in Singapore

wish  Indonesia and its people well.  We all hope that Indonesia

can  get  its  politics in order and that peace  is  once  again

restored  to that country and its people be given an opportunity

to rebuild its economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stark reality of this recession is that it has taught

Singaporeans a valuable lesson, ie, relying only on  traditional

methods  of  overcoming the recession do not work.  Cost-cutting

to  make Singapore more competitive and pump-priming in the past

were  able to get Singapore out of the recession.  But this time

round those methods alone are not able to solve the problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recession also saw the drastic drop in value of the East-Asian currencies against the American dollar. Goods and

services  appeared to be oversupplied. However, it  is  observed

that despite these problems, Taiwan's economy is not affected to

the  extent  as  other East-Asian economies are  affected.   The

difference between Taiwan and the other East-Asian countries  is

that  Taiwan  has embarked on a programme of giving  its  people

more democracy and more freedom.  That, I believe, is the key to

its resilience against this round of recession.  That country is

able  to  show  a  high level of creativity, innovativeness  and

initiative.   Taiwan is able to produce the goods  that  despite

the  competitive market is able to sell those goods in  America.

Its  business  people are also dynamic.  The people  there  have

leadership qualities and are able to build a network  and  break

into the American market and push the sale of their goods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas in Singapore, our business people, though through long

years  of paternalistic Government, are like lumbering dinosaurs

waiting  for the Government organisations like the EDB, TDB  and

other  trade  bodies to get things done for them.  Our  business

people  lack  the  individual courage, drive and  initiative  on

their  own  to push and seek out markets for themselves.    They

appear to be waiting for the Prime Minister, the Senior Minister

or  DPM  Lee  to  show  the way for them  through  their  visits

overseas.   In  normal times, our style of doing business  seems

all right.  But as the world gets more competitive, and at times

like  this  when the recession sets in, it is the extra  quality

that  our business people should have but are lacking which will

make the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to advocate to the Government again is that the

political style of governing Singapore needs to be changed.  The

people  must  be  given more political space  to  develop.   The

people  must  be given more freedom to develop their  leadership

and  entrepreneurship qualities and need to be  given  a  bigger

say.   For  a  start,  the  Government should  consciously  tell

Ministers and Members of Parliament not to take part or lead  in

any  public committees, for example, the cost-cutting committee.

Allow the business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

people   to   deliberate  on  their  own  and  make  their   own

recommendations  without  Ministers  or  Members  of  Parliament

overseeing them.  Business people and their Chambers of Commerce

should  be  given lots of leeway to take the lead in identifying

the problems affecting the economy of the country and be allowed

to  form  public committees to deliberate entirely on their  own

and to put forward recommendations rather than, like the present

time,  the  Government appears to be the only one who is  taking

the  lead and business people meekly agreeing and following what

the   Government   has  recommended.   I  know  Ministers   will

definitely  rebut  what  I say but the  fact  is  that  whatever

participation business people in Singapore seems to be  involved

in, the Government always has full control of the proceedings of

whatever public committees and has the final say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to touch on another area. The Government, in

every   Budget  Statement,  does  not  fail  to  preach  against

welfarism.   The Budget Statement this year specifically  states

"We must resist the temptation to allow ourselves to succumb  to

the  lure of welfarism."  On the one hand, the Government  warns

us  against  succumbing to practices of welfarism  but,  on  the

other  hand, at the constituency level it is doing the opposite.

At Potong Pasir, Mr Andy Gan, the prospective PAP candidate goes

from  house to house handing out sums of $200 to each family  in

cases  where the head of the family is out of job for  at  least

one  month.   He  also  hands out $5  vouchers  to  families  to

purchase grocery. Mr Andy Gan is acting like a Father Christmas,

going from household to household, handing out public funds.  He

says  that  the  funds  are  from  the  Potong  Pasir  Community

Development  Council (CDC).  I presume that it  must  be  either

taxpayers'  money or money contributed by the  public.   In  any

event,  what I am saying is that the official position  is  that

the Government does not encourage welfarism but, in reality,  it

is practising welfarism in its most raw form,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>

that  is,  giving  away money freely, of  course,  where  it  is

politically advantageous to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I see the disbursements of money to the HDB flat

dwellers in the so-called rebates on the Town Councils'  service

and  conservancy charges and the HDB monthly rentals as outright

practices  of  welfarism.  The only difference in the  welfarism

that  is practised in Singapore and those practised in the  West

is  that  in  Singapore's  case, the money  given  away  by  the

Government is targeted for vote catching, but those in the  West

are  done  as  a matter of right if one meets the criteria.   As

regards  the  amount of rebates given to HDB  flat  dwellers,  I

would  say  that  the Government should be more generous.   They

should, in fact, double it, because I am to a certain extent for

welfarism,  because  you must have compassion  for  the  people.

There  were about 28,000 of our workers, as reported,  who  were

retrenched  last  year.  I believe it is a further  20,000  this

year who will be retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my 15th year in Parliament. Year after year, the

Government  budget  shows  ever-increasing  surpluses.   I  have

spoken  out  against the policy of ever accumulating more  money

for  the Government which only means that the people shall  have

less money and consequently less savings.  But this year, I  see

that  there  is  a  budget  deficit  of  $5.1  billion  in   the

development  account.  I do not think that the Government  needs

to  be  apologetic or be ashamed of it.  Hong Kong, I  see  this

year,  also has a deficit account.  I believe this is the second

year  of budget deficit in Hong Kong.  In Singapore's case,  our

Government  has accumulated surpluses in its term of office  and

probably  it has nothing to worry.  In fact, I say that although

the  Government's  stand  is not to overdraw  on  surpluses,  it

shall, as I say, do so when the necessity arises.  Just like its

pronouncement  on refusing to cut workers' CPF which  eventually

it did.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion in the name of the Finance Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is almost a non-event, as described by

many.   This is because of the two off-Budget measures  in  June

and  November  last year when packages of $2 billion  and  $10.5

billion worth of cost-cutting measures were announced.  Some  of

these measures announced will only be effective from this fiscal

year.   It is understandable, therefore, that we must give  time

to  these  measures  to work its way through the  system  before

deciding  on  whether we need new measures, and if so,  in  what

form,  and for what purpose.  Nevertheless, I would like to  ask

the  Minister what kind of time-frame would be necessary for  us

to see whether these measures work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this Budget in March is more like a routine one

to  approve  the expenditures for the Government Ministries  and

departments to function smoothly.  There are not many major  tax

policy  changes,  except  for some for  the  financial  services

sector  to  encourage and promote the bond  market,  dealing  in

Government  securities, syndicated facilities and boutique  fund

management.   There  are  also a few tax incentives  for  global

OHQs,  contract  manufacturers and traders, and  exhibition  and

conference organisers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some companies and businesses as well as

individuals  are  in  financial hardship  during  this  economic

downturn,  in many ways, I feel this period of testing  is  good

for  us  and  holds many valuable lessons.  The  last  recession

between  1985  and  1987  was  rather  short  and  many  people,

especially  the young, have either forgotten or not  even  known

what  a recession is.  There was so much of euphoria in the last

10   years  that  many  have  taken  economic  growth  and  good

government  for  granted.  Many have now learnt  painfully  that

asset  prices  that go up can also come down.   This  must  also

apply  to what we see in the US markets today, which is  why  we

are  a bit nervous about the consequences of a downturn on Asia.

Before this recession, there was so much job hopping during  the

days  when  the labour market was very tight that  many  workers

never bothered to upgrade themselves or stay long enough in  one

job to master their craft or trade well.  Such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

workers  are  most  affected in this recession.   This  economic

crisis  in  the  region  has also shown  us  how  important  the

political   and  economic  stability  and  prosperity   of   our

neighbours are to our very own economic prosperity. It has  also

highlighted to us how fragile our markets are, and how important

it  is for us to venture further afield to new markets so as  to

broaden our market base and enhance our economic stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage is now set for economic recovery this year and

the  next.  It is important, indeed critical, that our  policies

and systems should provide the foundation for the next phase  of

economic growth.  In this respect, I am pleased to note that the

Government  has  identified correctly the main  crucial  issues,

namely,   to  maintain  the  framework  for  continued  economic

activity;  secondly, to help companies tide over the crisis  and

minimise    unemployment    and   enhance    capabilities    and

competitiveness for future growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell a little bit more on helping

companies survive this downturn.  Many local companies have been

hard  hit by the sudden and drastic decline in demand for  their

goods and services from the region.  Many of these companies are

not  new  and small ones.  Some of the ones I know of have  been

operating for more than 10 years.  Nevertheless, they are  still

in  trouble and under grave pressure, especially from the  banks

that  have reduced their credit lines.  Worse still, some  banks

have  even  withdrawn  those  very bank  lines  vital  to  their

survival.  Although the Government has said that they would like

to  leave  credit  assessment  totally  to  the  private  sector

financial   institutions,  we  must  remember  that  these   are

extraordinary  times, probably the worst since our independence,

and hence we may need extraordinary measures to help these local

companies  from  folding under.  Many jobs are  at  stake.   Our

objective  of strengthening the base of local enterprises  would

also be set back by quite a few years if the Government does not

extend  a helping hand.  I know the EDB has the Local Enterprise

Finance Scheme (LEFS) as well as a scheme to co-invest in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>

promising   local  enterprises  to  help  them   enhance   their

capabilities  and growth.  However, the schemes are  limited  in

scope as not many of these companies in trouble can make use  of

them.   Given  the current situation, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether  any new measures can be  introduced  to  help

troubled  local  companies that currently  do  not  qualify  for

either one of these two schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FY 1999 will yield a budget deficit of $5.1 billion. Given

the severity of this current economic downturn, this deficit  is

not  really  alarming.  This deficit is only  the  size  of  our

budget  surplus in a fairly good year.  In fact, I would say  it

is  commendable that at a time like this, there is still no need

for  this  Government  to draw upon the  reserves  of  the  past

Government.   The  Government's budgeting has always  been  very

prudent,  yielding substantial surpluses and  reserves  in  good

years.   At  a time like this, Singaporeans begin to  understand

and  appreciate our prudence much better, although  I  have  not

changed my stand that in good years, we still have to be careful

not to suck too much money out of our system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on some specific tax issues in greater

detail.

<br><br><i>Corporate Tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, the Government stated that its long-term

target  corporate tax rate is 25%.  We are now still at 26%.   I

would  like  to ask the Minister whether we still maintain  this

long-term  target rate of 25%, and if so, when  do  we  plan  to

achieve  this long-term target rate.  Would this year not  be  a

good year to do this in order to help investors achieve a better

return on their investments?

<br><br><i>Tax Incentives for Businesses Going Abroad</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current decline in demand for goods and services from

the region, because of this economic crisis, companies have been

asked  to venture further afield to tap new markets.  As we  all

know, marketing can be expensive,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>

especially in faraway markets.  I would like to ask the Minister

to  consider  giving  more tax incentives for  companies  to  go

marketing overseas.

<br><br><i>Tax Grouping for Property Developers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this issue of allowing property developers, who

are  now required by law, to set up a new company for every  new

project,  to  allow  them to group profits and  losses  for  the

purpose of tax reporting.  It seems a bit unfair that tax has to

be accounted for on a project by project basis.  Other companies

not  compelled by law to set up new companies for every line  of

business  can  do  so  now, irrespective of  the  size  of  each

business.   I believe there is some anomaly here that should  be

addressed.   I  hope  the Minister will  look  again  into  this

matter.

<br><br><i>Waiver of Stamp Duty for Property Transactions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the property market seems to have

stabilised.   However, one impediment to a smooth and  efficient

market  is  the stamp duty for property transactions.   I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister to consider waiving the  stamp  duty

until  further  notice  in  order to help  the  property  market

recover further.  In the November 1998 cost-cutting package, the

stamp  duty  on  contract  notes  for  share  transactions   was

suspended  and will now be extended by another year.  I  believe

the  rationale for such suspension is similar for  the  property

market.

<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the 55% property tax rebate is only extended to

commercial  and industrial properties.  Is there any reason  why

it  should  not  be  extended  also to  residential  properties?

Owners of such residential properties have also been hard hit by

a   very   soft   market  for  rentals  that  have   come   down

substantially.   A rebate will help such owners tide  over  this

difficult period and survive the downturn.

<br><br><i>Goods and services tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail and tourism sectors have been very hard hit by

this economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>

downturn.  In fact, the retail sector has been very weak  for  a

number  of years.  Our retailers are not competitive,  not  only

because  of the high rentals and wages, but also partly  because

of the Goods and Services Tax.  I would like to ask the Minister

to  consider  lowering  the GST at  this  time  to  2%.   It  is

important to keep the GST mechanism in place.  A cut of 1% would

not  impact the revenue collection too much, but would go a long

way in helping restore confidence in the retail sector.

<br><br><i>Personal Income Tax Reliefs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the onset of this economic crisis, unemployment is

rising.   The Government is encouraging more workers to  go  for

skills upgrading and redevelopment.  To give further emphasis to

the  importance  of lifelong learning and skills upgrading,  the

Government  has  decided to raise the tax deduction  for  actual

expenses incurred by individuals for such upgrading from  $2,000

to  $2,500,  an  increase of $500.  While the  gesture  is  much

appreciated, I must point out that very few courses qualify  for

such  tax deduction.  I would like to ask the Minister to  relax

the  criteria  on the type of academic and professional  courses

that  would  qualify for such tax deduction.  For  many  of  us,

upgrading  may  not  be  by formal courses  that  will  lead  to

diplomas,  certificates or any other professional qualification.

In  this  IT age, many of us would like to upgrade ourselves  in

the IT area through more informal courses, but such expenses  do

not qualify for tax deduction.

<br><br><i>Personal Tax Rate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with my call for the Government to consider adopting the

long-term  corporate tax rate of 25%, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  to do likewise for the long-term maximum personal  tax

rate of 25%.  We are still 2% away from this target.  This would

make  us  more competitive vis-a-vis Hong Kong and  help  us  to

position  ourselves as a more attractive centre for finance  and

other commercial activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for

giving me this opportunity to speak in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in times of a buoyant economy, it is not an easy

task  for the Minister for Finance to present a balanced Budget.

The task is more difficult in times of recession.  Nevertheless,

the Minister has presented a very pragmatic Budget.  There is  a

deficit  of  $5.1  billion  and, as Mr  Chiam  has  pointed  out

earlier,  I  do  not think the Government has to  be  apologetic

about  it.   Its  prudent policy in having  surplus  has  to  be

changed.    This  is the time when the country  needs  the  $5.1

billion, and I think the Government has done the right thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must credit the political leadership for presenting

this  Budget.   But there is another institution which  I  would

like to pay tribute to and that is the civil service.  An honest

civil  service  has made Singapore proud.  It is very  important

for   us  to  maintain  this  integrity  because  the  political

leadership  cannot  survive unless we have  a  very  strong  and

honest civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have rightly not cut our expenditure on defence,

education and social service.  Without a good defence,  we  will

have  no security and, without security and political stability,

we  will not have foreign investments.  We are fortunate in this

because,  looking  at our neighbours, investors  know  where  to

choose.  Similarly, in order to create the manpower for the next

century, we must spend our money wisely on education.  It  is  a

life-long  learning process and we must strive not to stinge  in

this area.  I am glad that the Government has been very generous

and it should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we as a people can take pride that, despite job

retrenchments,  loss  of  business and  a  not  very  favourable

economic  condition, we have maintained our social cohesiveness.

It is times like this that we can test the people's will, and we

can pride ourselves, and we hope that even in a worse situation,

we can take the same stand.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a likelihood that more jobs will be lost this

year.  I appeal to the Government to take care of those who will

be  losing  their  jobs.  We must see that the families  do  not

suffer  because the breadwinner has no job, the children do  not

miss  school  and that they have textbooks and the amenities  of

life  to  keep  them  going.  It is the  responsibility  of  the

community  and  the people as well to help those who  are  going

through  this difficult period.  But, eventually, the Government

must  take  the  leadership.   Once  the  Government  takes  the

leadership, the people themselves will follow through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my earlier colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has

pointed  out,  the  situation in Indonesia  is  difficult.   The

Indonesian people are going through a difficult period.  We hope

things will change for the better after the election.  Singapore

wishes  Indonesia  well because a buoyant economy  in  Indonesia

will  help  us  and we have every reason to see  that  Indonesia

comes through the difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area I am a little worried is the economy in

China.   I  do  not  know what is going to be in  store  in  the

future.  Perhaps, the Minister may be in a position to enlighten

this House.  Should the situation change for the worse in China,

what would be the repercussion on the Singapore economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area which I would like to share my concern

is  the property sector.  Sir, so much of our citizens' money is

tied  in  the  property market and it is worrying that  property

market  values are going down month by month.  Most  people  who

buy  properties in this country have borrowed from the banks and

we  have yet to see what is the exposure of the banks should the

property  market  go  down any further.  In certain  areas,  the

property  market is going at half price.  May  I  plead  to  the

Government  to study the market and to plan in such a  way  that

the  property  market does not collapse.  I am  not  asking  the

Government to bail out those who have speculated.  But there are

citizens  who  have  genuinely bought  property  for  their  own

occupation, while

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>

some  may have bought for investment.  It is only fair that  the

Government  intervenes when the property goes up  and  when  the

property  goes down, it should see that it does not go  down  to

such a state that it will affect the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are proud of the Government's record that it has

built  houses  through the Housing and Development  Board.   But

there  are  certain sectors of the community that  need  private

houses  and  their need has to be planned and  looked  after  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the economic recession, people are very

cautious as to how they are going to spend.  Even those who have

the  money  tend  to  be  very cautious and  this  can  be  very

counterproductive.  If there is not enough money in the economy,

it  will  be  self-defeating because it is important, especially

for the retail sector, to have money in the economy.  We have to

see  how  we  can pump some money into the economy so  that  the

retail  sector will not be affected because many people tell  me

that  some  of  them are having such a hard and difficult  time.

They find it very difficult to keep their business going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our tourist sector is also affected. It is very

important  for  us  to  see how this area is  not  affected  any

further.   Our hotels and restaurants are all tied up with  this

sector.   It is very important for us because tourists  are  not

going  to  our neighbouring countries.  As a result of that,  we

are also affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to repeat that, if there

should be a need in future, the Government should be prepared to

draw  on  its  reserves.   I  am not  asking  that  we  withdraw

everything  that  we  have kept.  If there is  a  necessity,  we

should be prepared to draw on the reserves and help our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to say a few words on Mr Chiam's

comments.   Hong Kong is as free a market as one  can  get.   If

what Mr Chiam said that economic progress

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>

solely depends on the so-called democratic system is true,  then

Hong  Kong should do much better than Taiwan.  I do not want  to

comment  on how Hong Kong is doing.  Even Mr Chiam can  see  it.

Mr  Chiam is being too simplistic and naive in generalising such

a complex subject of economics in such a shallow manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many have described the Finance Minister's Budget

Statement  as  a  non-event, as expected, or even  boring.   But

notably, hardly anyone has expressed disappointment.  Unlike  Mr

Chiam,  it is because everyone has come to expect the Government

to  take  a prudent and long-term view when faced with a  crisis

and  therefore share a sense of confidence towards  this  year's

Budget Statement.  Most Singaporeans agree that this is not  the

time  to  over-react, but rather to act sensibly and  purposely.

In  the end, the right policies, carried out with determination,

would ensure that perseverance will prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the population is comfortable with the macro and

long-term strategies, there is a feeling of deep concern at  the

more  micro  and individual levels.  Many are faced with  short-term  financial  problems.  For individuals, the possibility  of

retrenchment  looms over most employees.  Company-wise, many are

struggling  to  stay  afloat.  Although the off-Budget  measures

have to a great extent helped, 1999 would be a real test.  While

1998's  performance  was  not good, many  businesses  are  still

buffeted by the spillover businesses of the better years of 1996

and   1997   and  are  managing  to  survive  on  the   reserves

accumulated.  By now, they would have depleted this reserve  and

even  if the economy should turn around, as generally predicted,

many may not be able to ride through the next two rough years of

1999 and 2000 to enjoy the recovery.  Therefore, the Government,

having  put  in  place all the strategies  and  points  to  take

advantage  of the economic upturn when it comes, should  address

the  short-term difficulties these individuals as  well  as  the

companies are facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no quick fix to these problems and it is not

expected of the Government to guarantee every company's survival

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>

and  find a job for each and every individual.  The cost cutting

package  and,  significantly,  the  introduction  of  the  Local

Enterprise Finance Scheme have to a certain extent given hope to

many  SMEs  and local companies to survive.  But the  Government

can  still do more to assist those who are affected to tide them

over this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can ease the pressure of competition from many

GLCs  on  the local enterprises.  I am not suggesting that  GLCs

should  give concession to local businesses.  But many of  these

GLCs,  whose original objective is to mainly compete in overseas

markets  and  to  spearhead the building  of  the  second  wing,

somehow  became  very aggressive and competitive  in  the  local

market.   Although we have always been assured that they compete

on a level playing field, somehow the perception is that because

they  have such superior strength, in terms of human as well  as

financial resources, they can kill off any private company  they

choose  to  compete with, especially during these trying  times.

The decision by JTC to suspend most of their industrial building

projects  in  the next few years so as to ease the  over  supply

situation  in the industrial property market is a  move  in  the

right  direction.  This will give some breathing  space  to  the

private developers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the recession, the Ministry of National

Development  has  indicated that as  a  result  of  accelerating

education  programmes, many new schools would have to  be  built

and  that  they  will  be farmed out to the private  consultancy

firms  to  do.   Sir, I want to declare myself as  a  practising

architect.  But to-date, I was informed that few, if any, of the

firms  have  received such commission even though  the  economic

situation  has  deteriorated  rapidly.   Perhaps,  the  Ministry

should speed up the process instead of holding back.  All  these

decisions  will  help  towards easing  the  difficult  situation

somewhat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual, the projected unemployment figure is not

encouraging.    Last  year,  there  were  a  total   of   28,300

retrenchments and this year's figure is projected at, at  least,

20,000 and that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>

unemployment  figure will be higher because this does  not  take

into  account  the  new  entries to  the  workforce  each  year.

Although  there are many avenues where financial assistance  can

be   obtained   -   from   MCD,  CDCs  and  various   grassroots

organisations, of course, from Andy Gan - however, more  can  be

done.   For example, HDB has been very amicable in restructuring

mortgage  payments, some from 15 to 20 years  longer.   In  most

cases,  HDB  also allows the owners to pay instalments  for  the

arrears   they  owe.   However,  if  the  sole  breadwinner   is

retrenched,  he  or she would have no income and  therefore  the

above  concession  would not solve their problem.   Perhaps,  in

such cases, HDB can consider suspending payment for a period  of

time  until  these  flat owners can meet their obligation  after

they have been re-employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenchment problem is not confined to the lower

middle income group.  Many of those retrenched are professionals

or  executives.  They are likely to have a sizeable account well

above  the Minimum Sum in the CPF and because of their temporary

setback,  they may not be able to meet their mortgage obligation

on  their  homes  or their children's education.   I  would  ask

whether  the Government will consider for this period only,  and

on  a case-by-case basis, whether a portion of their CPF can  be

withdrawn  for these two particular purposes so that they  would

not  inadvertently  lose  their  own  properties  or  having  to

terminate their children's education, especially those who  have

children studying overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by moving away from the economic

aspect  of  the Budget Statement.  For decades now, Singaporeans

have  spent  much  energy and placed much emphasis  on  economic

progress.  Even with the crisis, Singapore is one of the leading

examples of how a nation can achieve economic success and  bring

a   better   life   to   her  people  under   most   challenging

circumstances.  But in doing so, we have lagged behind  somewhat

in the development of our culture,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>

the  arts  and  other intellectual pursuits such  as  music  and

literature.   Understandably so, perhaps  this  period  of  slow

growth  will give us an opportunity to catch up in this area  of

our national development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most western countries, especially in Europe, have gone

through periods of economic recession and even depression.   But

somehow,  the  population  spirit and  morale  have  never  been

severely  hampered.   I  think it is  because  during  times  of

adversity,   they  can  turn  their  attention  to  other   less

materialistic  aspects of their life and derive  much  enjoyment

and  inspiration in the arts, music and literature.  Of  course,

in   the  field  of  arts,  with  all  the  great  masters  like

Michelangelo  da  Vinci,  Picasso,  and  in  music   they   have

Beethoven,  Wagner,  Strauss.  They also have  great  poets  and

writers  like Shakespeare, Keats, Tennyson.  The list  goes  on.

These countries have thousands of years of history, culture  and

tradition  behind them and that enabled them to find  fulfilment

in  the  intellectual and spiritual fields even in the  face  of

severe economic hardships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should seek this opportunity of the slowdown

to  intensify the promotion of the arts, stimulate our awareness

of  the richness in the less materialistic aspects of our  life.

Our  Government, especially the Ministry of Information and  the

Arts,  should  intensify its programmes to promote our  cultural

pursuit,  organise more art activities, concerts and  dramas  to

stimulate the intellectual inspiration in us.  We should promote

our local artists and writers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are usually overwhelmed by the pace of our economic

progress.   Perhaps, it is timely for us to turn  our  focus  on

cultivating  a more gracious society, something we  have  always

been  aiming to achieve, instead of always being branded as  too

rigid and materialistic.  More importantly, when confronted with

such  economic adversity, we could have something else to  focus

on,  to draw inspiration from.  Otherwise, our whole world  will

just  collapse  around  us  if we only  live  for  our  material

possessions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent news from our neighbouring countries is not

encouraging,  especially in Indonesia.  The cautious  optimistic

prediction  of our economic crisis being bottomed  out  may  not

materialise.   The volatile situation can explode  suddenly  and

Singapore may inadvertently be right in the middle of  it.   The

comforting sign is that we have weathered this crisis well as  a

nation  and  that there is no reason for us not to be  confident

even  if  things get worse that our Government would be able  to

lead us through the crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Chen has accused me of having a

shallow thinking.  I would like to ask Mr Chen whether or not he

thinks  that  Singapore needs a qualitative change to  give  its

people  more political space, more freedom to develop  qualities

of creativeness, initiative and leadership.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I do not want to enter into

a  lengthy debate with Mr Chiam.  I was simply saying that since

he  said  the pre-requisite of economic progress is a democratic

system, I have just proven him wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I did not say that. I was saying

that  conditions have changed and the situation has changed now,

and  we need to change at the same time.  I gave the example  of

Taiwan.   Taiwan has changed to more democracy and more freedom,

and that is probably why it is so resilient now.  It has managed

to  make things more innovatively that can be sold in America in

competition with the other low-wage countries.  I am saying that

Singapore should also need a qualitative change.  Does he  agree

with me?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I have given the example of

Hong Kong.  If he wants another example, it is Russia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  giving  me this opportunity to speak.   To  answer  Mr

Chiam,  perhaps he has not lived through the days of  the  Great

Depression in the United States where the greatest democracy  of

the world was having great unemployment and hunger and people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>

queuing  up  for  food.  So does it mean that because  you  have

great   democracy,  therefore  your  economic   situation   will

necessarily be the better?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must first proceed to address the motion by the Minister

for  Finance.  I welcome the caution of the Minister for Finance

in  his  Budget speech.  Such a caution, delivered with  a  $5.1

billion  deficit,  is  to be welcomed after  so  many  years  of

surpluses that the Minister had delivered in this House.  And it

is  quite likely that with a CPF cut of 10% and a $10.5  billion

injection into the economy through competitive cuts in  November

1998  which,  it is estimated, can add to about $2 billion  into

our  economy this year, there is good chance for the economy  to

move around.  The cut in the CPF of 10% can mean an injection of

about 5-6% to the economy.  Why do I say that?  Wages constitute

about  60%  of the GDP.  If you have a 10% cut of the  wage  all

round, there is likelihood that there can be a 5-6% injection in

the  economy.  Add to the $2 billion competitive cost cuts  that

we  have  and last year's $10.5 billion, a turnaround  therefore

can  be  expected.  But as the Minister said, barring unforeseen

regional or international disturbances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a famous Economist Herbert Stein, who was one

time  advisor to the US President, and he said, "What cannot  go

on  forever  must stop."  And I have just noted that  our  Prime

Minister just mentioned in Australia about the great bubble that

is going on in the United States.  Perhaps, Mr Chiam should wait

his  time  to see what will happen.  There are great  unforeseen

international  and regional disturbances that can really  affect

whatever  plans  we  have, even now that we are  moving  towards

steering  our economic towards a turnaround.  Even the necessary

conditions in our own domestic economy, we must make  sure  that

whatever  effects  we  are introducing in the  economy  must  be

filtered  down  so that everybody down the line in  the  economy

gets  a  part  of  the  share  in  this  cost-cutting.   If  the

Government  cuts statutory costs and only the landlord  makes  a

gain  by  saving the cost but not filtering it down to the  sub-tenants, the economy is going to face

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>

a  lot  of  difficulties because down the line small  businesses

will continue to face such difficulties.  To make sure that such

cost-cutting  measures that we do filter down the line  is  very

important.   How to do so is something I believe the  Government

should  try  as  best  as  possible  to  monitor  what  are  the

implications of many of these statutory costs on the  businesses

down the line and to see what kind of redress they can have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also ensure that whatever cost and price

cut  that  we  have must boost consumer and investor confidence.

Whenever there is a price-cut or saving in wages, there is also,

on the other side of the coin, a tendency towards a recessionary

spiral.   So  we must balance the two.  It is like a  fine  edge

that  we  must balance and Government must somehow  manage  this

task.  Consumer and investor confidence must be ensured so  that

at  the end of the day, our export competitiveness will also  go

hand in hand with this consumer and investor confidence to build

back the growth in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to address this topic on our foreign

exchange  rate which is an important policy instrument.   I  can

understand  the  Minister  for  Finance  in  his  responses   in

Parliament  at  various times to be quite  ambivalent  or  vague

about this foreign exchange rate policy instrument.  It is quite

acceptable for the Minister for Finance to say that  we  do  not

manage our exchange rates because we are an open economy.  But I

would  say that even in spite of this, the fact that our economy

is  very  open  and that there is a great need  for  import  and

export,  there is possibly some scope for some foreign  exchange

leeway  rate  movement.  A cheaper Singapore dollar can  attract

capital,  a  capital account in the balance of payments  through

people coming in to buy up assets.  A lower Singapore dollar can

also  operate through our goods and services sector where export

competitiveness can be built up and the whole impact of all this

will  be essentially on affecting our money supply which at  the

time of potential recessionary spiral is something that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>

should  not forget to look at.  So, while we are reducing  costs

and reducing income, we must also drive exports and spending.  I

see  that  this exchange rate variable therefore is an important

factor, and it should not be left only to the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $5.1 billion deficit in this current Budget should not

be viewed as too alarming.  After all, we have had many years of

surpluses  and  reserves have been built up and  a  considerable

part  of  this  deficit spending is in the area  of  development

expenditure.  Yet, I must point out that the growth rate of  our

development expenditure over the last three years from  FY  1997

to  FY  1999 is actually slowing down.  We should also be  aware

that  the leakage component of our development spending  can  be

quite  high  because of the open nature of our economy.   Hence,

the  multiplier effect of our Government budgetary  stimulus  is

much  smaller than what these figures are wont to show.  So,  we

also  have  to  be aware of the limitations of fiscal  spending.

Therefore, I see this role of trying to balance fiscal  spending

with our foreign exchange rate policy quite important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the regional financial difficulties, our private

sector  has  seen  a  significant part of  its  assets  diminish

through stock and property collapse or business failures.  While

companies  are struggling to repair their balance sheets,  there

is  a  significant reduction in the wealth effect of our private

sector  in  the economy.  This reduction in the wealth component

of  our economy can lead essentially to a down-turn in spending.

I  think  this  is  an  important  element  that  we  must  look

specifically.   We  can  see  now  the  diminished  demand   for

restaurant services, for boutiques, for cars and in the property

market.   So we need to give back as much as possible  to  drive

the  private economy to repair back its spur and to create  back

the wealth that has diminished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans today are poorer than they were 1-2 years ago.

So  we  welcome  the  various  schemes  that  the  Minister  has

highlighted  of  efforts by the Government to  redress,  through

upgrading of various skills training programmes for our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>

in  the  workplace in order for them to get on to higher skilled

jobs to earn the income that they require.  Various training and

grant  programmes  exist today, the skills development  training

centres,  for example, run by the ITE and other skills  training

centres. I would urge that a skills training scheme or programme

that can attract more private sector effort be studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various grants or voucher payment schemes can be devised

for  modular training programmes that can be run by the  private

companies  which can use their facilities and their  plants  for

various modules of the training programme.  The Government  body

can  then  concentrate more on administering  these  programmes,

their  certification and tests.  With this more flexible system,

we  can  train the kind of people that we need for  the  private

sector economy, so that it could be more dynamic by engaging the

right  type  of  people.   With a more flexible  private  sector

oriented training scheme which I hope can be developed soon,  we

can expedite this important need for training and development in

our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Minister in his motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has taken a pot

shot  at  me.  He said that America had a deep recession.   That

was  in 1929-1933.  I think we all know about that.  Taking  the

year  1933, it was 66 years ago, and I believe America, being  a

country where there is freedom, people make studies and come out

with  all  kinds  of theories.  I think now they understand  why

there was a recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the Prime Minister, he made a

prediction that the bubble will burst.  But soon after  he  made

that  prediction, the Dow went up 200-over points and now it  is

in its 92nd month of its uptrend.  Of course, anything that goes

up  will come down.  This is easy to say.  But the point is that

it  is  still holding strong.  And the reason why it  can  reach

that  point  is because America is so great and because  it  has

creativity.   It makes a film and it earns US$500 million.   Can

Singapore earn that kind of money?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the point that we really want to

address  out   of  Mr Chiam's statement is: does  it  mean  that

democracy will bring more economic growth?  I think this is  the

big  issue  that we have to look at.  I just pointed out   about

the  depression that happened in the US economy.   They  were  a

democracy.  But why then did this thing happen?  So we have  got

to  look at the issue more in depth and not just say because  it

is  Hong  Kong  or  Taiwan  with more democracy,  therefore  the

economy is resilient and we are not resilient.  I think there is

something to it that we must challenge.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, speaking in Singapore's context, I

believe  Singapore  has reached a stage  where  the  people  are

already  educated enough.  We have reached a high level  of  per

capita  income and I think it is time for us to make  a  quantum

leap to get us to a higher level of development, producing value

added  goods that are involved with IT, goods that are  involved

with  knowledge and Singapore can then be as rich as one of  the

western  nations, and not competing with Indonesia and the  rest

of the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

effects  of  the economic crisis and financial turmoil  in  this

region  are  reaching into the economic field.  The  economy  of

Singapore is no longer enjoying more and more good years as said

by  the PAP in the last elections.  This year's Budget will have

more  than $5 billion in deficit.  Actually, this $5 billion  is

not  a  true  deficit, because our estimated  revenue  is  $24.1

billion and operating expenditure is $15.2 billion.  So if we do

not  include  the  development expenditure,  there  will  be  no

deficit of $5.1 billion as played up by the media.  There  is  a

deficit  because of the increase in the development expenditure.

If  we maintain the development expenditure to the 1997 level of

$9  billion, there is no need to touch our accumulated reserves.

However,  from the macro economic point of view and  the  future

development  of our country, we should make use of the  time  of

the  downturn  to prepare for a better take off in  the  future.

Also, at the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>

time,  we  can  help  the  people to  tide  over  the  difficult

situation.    From the economic policy point of  view,  the  PAP

Government has all the time, whether the economy is good or bad,

even when people are suffering from unemployment and the economy

is  in  recession, not been prepared to use fiscal  measures  to

lighten  the burden of the people.  Regrettably, the economy  is

now  facing great problems and people are facing great  pressure

and the Government is not lowering the charges but is continuing

to increase water tariffs, refusing to repeal the GST and do not

care  about the people's survival and they continue to  tax  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called rebates on HDB rentals and S&C charges and so on

are  to alleviate and to cushion the hardship caused by the GST.

Rebates  on  utilities bills are to offset  the  impact  of  the

increases  in  water tariff.  The "Special SC/CC rebates"  which

will  last for a year and announced at the budget this  year  is

only  a  symbolic  concern  shown  by  the  Government  to   the

livelihood of the people affected by this economic crisis.  This

is only in real terms $2-$6 compared to the cost cutting measure

implemented  by  the Government.  The workers' wages  have  been

reduced by more than 10% and their incomes have been reduced  by

more  than  $2-$6.   Now, when there are more  and  more  people

becoming  unemployed,  with $2-$6 to  help  people,  is  it  not

ridiculous?  Can I ask:  what can this $2-$6 rebate do for  such

people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the present economic crisis and the difficulties faced by

the  people, I am reminded of the year 1997 when the PAP brought

up  the platform to say with confidence that it would be able to

achieve  5-7% growth every year and to create more  wealth,  and

this  was  the  main plank in the platform of the  PAP  for  the

elections.   Generally speaking, the people  do  not  have  more

wealth.  Instead, because of the downturn in the property market

and  the share market, their assets will not appreciate but they

have  also  lost  a lot of money.  And the so-called  subsidised

loan obtained by the people have to pay higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>

interest than the commercial banks.  The share ownership  scheme

has   become  a  share  losership  scheme.   Worst  still,   the

unemployed  people and the business losers are facing bankruptcy

and  are in a helpless state.  The PAP should apologise  to  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Budget, to help the business community, I think the

Government is unfair.  They pay special attention to look  after

the  financial community and big companies, and to provide money

making  companies a lot of rebates and special tax tariffs,  tax

concession  and  so  on and so forth and  to  be  exempted  from

certain  taxes  like  GST.  But to the small  and  medium  sized

enterprises, the Government has not given any specific  measures

to help them tide over the present difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what we must pay attention to is that there is a

special  feature  in  the Budget that the  Government  wants  to

provide for $125 million to provide for some new programmes.   I

feel, in principle, that all kinds of provisions must be clearly

stated   for   their  objectives.   And  without  the   specific

objectives  and  it wants Parliament to give  the  provision,  I

think  it should be debated in this House before it is approved.

I want to ask the Government how we are going to use this money,

what  kind of services will it be spent on.  Otherwise, this  is

amounting to giving them an open cheque of $125 million from the

Government.  This is not prudent and is against the  spirit  and

principle  of  Parliament scrutinising and debating  the  budget

before it is approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we must look at the people's difficulties from

this  present  situation.   In the good  times,  the  Government

continues  to  tax the people and to accumulate surpluses.   But

when  times are bad, the Government continues to tax the  people

but  to  help the people it is only giving $2-$6.  On the  other

hand, the media is playing up to say that it is alleviating  the

burden  of  the  people.  I can say that,  to  use  the  Teochew

phrase, it is good looking but it is useless.  All that glitters

do not shine!

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  every year on Chinese New Year's eve, the Finance Minister

and  his  grassroots leaders will go to the  bank  of  Singapore

River to perform a ritual of releasing live fish into the river.

That  was why over the last few years,  we had a surplus because

the word "yu" (fish) in Chinese sounds the same as yu (surplus).

The  Chinese  say  nien  nien  you yu,  meaning  there  is  fish

(surplus) every year.  However, this year our economy  has  been

hit  by the financial crisis in the region, and we have a budget

deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang said that our deficit this year

is not a genuine deficit.  To me, a deficit is a deficit.  There

is  no such thing as genuine or not genuine.  If you have a bank

account and you  spend  more than what you have in your account,

you run into a deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing worth mentioning is that there are not many countries

which can still increase education and defence expenditure  when

impacted  by a financial crisis.  Singapore can.  While  we  are

moving towards a knowledge economy, we  increase our expenditure

on  education and training so as to look after the  interest  of

our  workers to ensure their life-long employability. At a  time

when  our  neighbouring countries are facing turbulent political

unrest,  we  increase our defence spending.  This  is  something

which everyone in Singapore can understand.  Our deficit is  not

one  of consumption type.  It is a development expenditure.   In

the long run, it will enhance our competitiveness.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just now, the Member for Hougang said that the PAP

Government  should apologise to the people.  In fact,  over  the

last  one  to two years, our political leaders, from  the  Prime

Minister  to the Ministers, and from the labour MPs to the  NTUC

leaders,  have been explaining to our people  the impact of  the

economic   crisis  on  us,  and  that  many  people   may   face

retrenchment  and  unemployment.  We have worked  very  hard  to

explain  to our people the problems that we would be facing  and

all  the  external factors that would have an adverse effect  on

us.   The  people understand.  When the crisis hit us, they  did

not  ask us for an explanation.  Nobody has asked the Government

to  apologise.  We were able to implement the CPF reduction  and

wage  cut  without a hitch. The foreign media were amazed.  They

could not understand how we managed to carry out such a delicate

exercise  so smoothly, and with hardly any  resistance from  the

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang also said that the

Government  did  not care  whether the people live  or  die.   I

would  like  to  ask how many people had died  because  of  this

crisis.   On  the contrary, the PAP Government has  shown  great

care  and concern for the people.  Our leaders have been  making

door-to-door visits to the  residents and anyone found to be  in

hardship,  assistance will be on hand to help him out.   We  are

helping  our  people when help is most needed by them.  This  is

like  sending hot-burning coal to a freezing person in the snow.

I  think if the Member for Hougang cares to make a visit to  our

PAP constituencies he will understand what we are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that this Budget is "good to see but not good to

eat".   In Chinese, there is a saying that good medicine may  be

bitter to the taste but it cures your sickness.  In a way, he is

right.  This Budget may not be "good to eat", but it heals.   So

it is good medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Potong Pasir tried to link democracy

with  economic prosperity.  If the superpower USA is hit  by  an

economic crisis, can he then  say that there is no democracy  in

the United States?  I do not know how he came to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>

conclusion that Taiwan is more democratic than we are.  Perhaps,

he  was  referring to  newspaper reports on how Parliamentarians

fought  in  Parliament.  They even went up to  the  Speaker  and

threatened  him.   Such  an  incident  will  never   happen   in

Singapore.  Is that what he meant when he said Taiwan  was  more

democratic than Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam should know that our economic situation is different

from  that  of Taiwan.  In our economy, 73% comes from  external

demand;  12% from domestic consumption, and 12% from investment.

But  Taiwan  is different.  Their market is mainly confined   to

Europe, the United States and mainland China.  They are  not  so

much affected by the regional crisis.  I hope the next time when

Mr  Chiam wants  to make such a remark, he should pay a visit to

Taiwan  first.   I  do not know how many times  he  has  visited

Taiwan (twice or three times or never?). He should go there  and

find  out for himself what the actual situation is.  Take a look

at  the  Philippines.  They are supposed to be very  democratic,

but is their economy better than ours?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this crisis, many people are beginning to realise that they

need  to  go  for training, retraining, and skills upgrading  in

order to enhance their employability.  However, I feel that  the

public  sector seems to be "half-a-beat behind" in the promotion

of  training  plans  for its staff.  Now  with  many  Government

departments  corporatised or privatised,  very often  the  staff

have   to   be   transferred  to  the   other   departments   or

organisations, and many of their existing skills  could  not  be

utilized.   So,  I  feel that we should speed  up  the  training

programme  in the public sector so that more civil servants  may

benefit.   I  also  feel that the Government should  allot  more

funds for training so that every Singaporean could benefit  from

the training and be geared to face the challenge of transforming

into a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong remarked that

Singaporeans  were  not  so good in singing,  unlike  our  ASEAN

counterparts.  At many public functions, when asked to sing, our

Singapore  officials had nothing in their repertoire, and  ended

up  singing   Majulah Singapura.  But nowadays, I   notice  that

most  Singaporeans can sing at least one or two songs.   One  of

the main reasons is that in all our RC centres there are karaoke

facilities.  Perhaps we could make use of these RCs to encourage

Singaporeans to go for continuing learning by conducting various

courses at the RC centres.  For those training courses which  do

not  involve the use of large apparatus or equipment, they could

be  conducted  at  the  RC centres for the  convenience  of  our

people.   At  the  same  time, ITE and the various  polytechnics

should  also conduct more part-time courses so that Singaporeans

who  are  willing  to  learn could have  more  opportunities  to

improve  themselves. The admission criteria can be  relaxed,  so

that  more  Singaporeans  can qualify  for  admission  to  these

courses,  and  work for some sort of diploma.   Of  course,  the

students  must attain a certain standard in the course of  their

studies before they can be awarded the diploma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this year onwards, many Singaporeans have accepted a

10% CPF reduction and their salaries were also reduced by 5%-8%.

I  think  this is a very good manifestation of the Singaporeans'

trust  of  our Government.  Our people are beginning to  realise

that they have to go for training.  Because if they do not, they

will  be  in  trouble.  This crisis has made this  problem  more

acute.   Just now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock  mentioned that  Government

should  be  very cautious and  tone down our efforts to  attract

foreign  talents.   He was right and I agree  with  him.   As  a

member   of   the   Singapore  21  Committee,  with   particular

involvement   in  the  sub-committee on  attraction  of  foreign

talents,  I  fully agree that we should be cautious  in  dealing

with  this  matter, so that we would not make Singaporeans  feel

that  the foreigners are coming here to take over our jobs.   We

should  explain  to our people that when  the foreign  investors

come, they set up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>

new  establishments  and create more job opportunities  for  our

people.   When the foreign workers come, they take up jobs  that

Singaporeans  could not do or do not want to do.   They  do  not

actually deprive us of our job opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the good years, we have good economic growth and the

Government has been giving a lot of rebates to our people.  That

is  to share happiness with our people.  It is something good to

eat.  However, there are many successful Singaporeans who do not

need such rebates.  Even in this difficult time, not everyone is

affected.   In fact, many Singaporeans are still enjoying  life.

They  are  still having a good life.  Therefore, I suggest  that

the  Government should review our rebate policy.  For those  who

do  not  need  such rebates, they can choose to donate  them  to

charitable  organisations.  In fact, in this economic  downturn,

the  charitable organisations are having problems raising funds.

Our  successful Singaporeans are generally very generous.   They

will  be  willing to donate their shares of the rebates  to  the

charitable  organisations,  and  by  so  doing,  the  charitable

organisations will greatly benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who are facing difficulties, the rebates given by

the Government are giving them a shot in the arm.  With the help

given by the CDCs and the town councils,  many Singaporeans  are

beginning  to feel the care and concern given to them  by  their

community organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NWC recommendations have already been

implemented   this   year  in  order  to   restore   Singapore's

competitiveness.   There are signs that the economy  is  turning

for  the better.  However, our measures of wage restraint should

be  continued  so  that we can ensure that we still  retain  our

competitiveness.   I  think the most  important  thing  is  that

Singaporeans should actively take up training courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one thing I am concerned with, and although

many companies and property owners have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>

enjoyed   the  various rebates given to them by the  Government,

they do not pass on the benefits to the people by revising their

charges  and  rentals.  I feel that the Government  should  take

active  steps to ensure that the people would also benefit  from

these cost-cutting measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of

the Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission

to clarify certain matters mentioned by Mr Seng?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Seng was asking me how

many  people had died as a result of this crisis.  I can say  at

least   two  people in my constituency have died.  One committed

suicide  because of heavy losses in the stock market, the  other

became  very  ill  when  the  property  market  plummeted,   and

eventually  succumbed to his illness.  Mr  Seng  said  that  the

Government  had  attempted to explain to the  people,  but  many

people  still could not understand.  This is because,  just  two

years ago, at the General Election in 1997, the PAP was full  of

confidence  that Singapore would enjoy 5% to 7% growth  for  the

next  few years.  One of the important platforms of its election

manifesto is to create wealth for the people.  Now, not only  no

wealth is created, in fact, people are losing their wealth.   So

many  people do not understand.  I think perhaps Mr Seng  should

cause more publicity to be made through our media on this point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Low told

us  that two people had  died in Hougang - one committed suicide

because  of  speculation in the stock market and the other  fell

ill  when  property prices went down. This may not be  the  only

cause of their demise. Perhaps they did not have regular medical

check-ups  and  they  had heart attacks.   There  may  be  other

factors.   They cannot blame the Government for their losses  in

the  stock  market or the property market.  I do not  think  the

Government should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>

made  to  apologize to them.   In fact, it is Mr Low who  should

apologise  to  his  voters.  We have been  working  so  hard  to

explain  to  the people about the vulnerability of our  economy.

Why  did Mr Low not explain to his constituents that they should

not  speculate in the stock market or the property  market?   He

should apologise to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for creating wealth, I think we have to look at the whole

cycle.   In everything, there are always the ups and downs.   We

have  our downs because we are affected by the regional  crisis,

but  this is only a short-term matter.  So long as we work hard,

we  can  see  the light at the end of the tunnel.  But  for  the

other  countries in this region, they do not know when they  can

recover.   As to creating wealth together, the target  is  still

there.   So  long  as we put in a concerted effort,  we  can  go

through  the  tunnel and we see light at the other  end  of  the

tunnel.   It is not like what Mr Low said that there is no  hope

at all.  We cannot see any light at all.  I do not think so.  So

long  as  we can tide over these difficult times, our  increased

investment  in education and national defence will lead us  into

the 21st century with better lives for our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Of course, Mr Seng said

there  are ups and downs.  We all understand that at the end  of

the tunnel there is light.  But we do not have to publicise that

this  is  due to the efforts of the PAP Government.  During  the

General  Election,  the  impression  was  that  you  have   more

prosperous years ahead, more good years ahead.  So when there is

a  crisis, you cannot put the blame on others and say that it is

because  of  the  regional  crisis  that  our  economy  takes  a

downturn.   When times are good, you say, well, it  is  the  PAP

Government which is very efficient and very good, and  therefore

you  have  these good results.  How do you reconcile  these  two

arguments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know,

Singapore  is  a  small  country.  All the  time  we  have  been

emphasising that we have to venture

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>

outside.  Before and during the election we had been telling our

people  that  our target was to venture outside  Singapore.   We

have  to  go  for  a  bigger market.  Now the world  market  has

weakened.   So  definitely we would be affected.  Singapore  has

and  must  be affected by the regional crisis.  We are  not  the

only  country  that has been affected.  But as for  Mr  Low,  he

mentioned  that  the PAP Government has made a  promise  and  it

cannot  be fulfilled and the PAP Government must apologise.   He

must  understand  that  during  the  last  one  year,  how  many

political leaders in this region were forced to step down.   Why

is  it  that  the political leaders in Singapore need  not  step

down?  This is because we have proved to the people that we have

the  fundamentals right!  In other countries, when the  workers'

salaries,  or  even  the bonuses, are reduced,  there  would  be

demonstrations and even  riots.  But our wage reduction exercise

was carried out smoothly and  peacefully without a hitch.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Budget Statement presented by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his review of the economy, the Finance Minister stated that

while the Government was deliberating over policy options,  they

identified  that  the  critical  issues  were  to  maintain  the

framework  for continued economic activity; help companies  tide

over  the  crisis  and minimise unemployment;  and  enhance  our

capabilities  and  competitiveness for future  growth.   In  his

Budget  speech, the Finance Minister stated that the expenditure

would be focused on fostering future growth by investing heavily

on  developing  our human resources, in economic  infrastructure

and other areas which yield lasting returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the issues identified - the need to invest for the

future  and the basic thrust of the Budget.  And I take  comfort

that  the  proposal is to maintain the same level of expenditure

on defence and to increase expenditure on education.  My concern

is principally on whether enough is being done to help those who

are  now  in  a  desperate financial situation.  I am  concerned

about those who have tried

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>

to  help  themselves and are now at wits end.  Last  year,  some

28,000  people were retrenched, and expectation is that  another

20,000  people  will  be retrenched this year.   The  number  of

people  joining  the  rank  of the bankrupts  is  growing.   The

rebates  on rental and S&C charges will certainly be a big  help

to  many.   However,  there is a need for direct  assistance  to

those  in a desperate financial position.  Some of these  people

are  those  who have lost their jobs and are having difficulties

getting  re-employed.  It is too easy to sweepingly assume  that

those  who remain unemployed are being fussy.  There are  people

who,  because of their age, lack of paper qualification or  some

other  discriminating  reasons, are forced  to  live  off  their

savings,  if  any.   Their family members are  affected  by  the

sudden loss of income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just one of the schools in which I am serving, there has

been a request for financial assistance from nine pupils in just

the  first  two months of 1999.  The Ministry of Education  does

assist  with  waiver  of  school fees but  assistance  is  still

required  for  things like supplementary fees.  In  some  cases,

help  is  being sought for bus fares, books and meals.   We  are

right  in  investing in our people for they are  our  resources.

However, whilst we focus on the future, we should not lose sight

of  the  present.   For  all those who are  having  difficulties

making ends meet, the future is but a vague dream.  It is  heart

breaking  to  hear  of  students who  decide  to  abandon  their

education and leave school to find work to help the family  deal

with finances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have always been people with difficulties and they are

being  helped  by  a  network of voluntary  organisations.   The

current  economic downturn has added stress to  the  operational

capabilities.   Many VWOs have had their budget  slashed  by  at

least  10%  across  the  board because of  the  difficulties  in

raising  funds.  During these difficult times, there are  people

who  have contributed to our economy in the past and who are now

pleading for help, help to survive the present and thus creating

hope  for the future.  In helping people to survive the present,

we are but investing for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>

future.   It  is  clear that something extra is  required.   The

total budget expenditure is $29.1 billion of which only 1.66% is

allocated  to  Community Development,  or  0.34%  of  GDP.   The

statistics  would  hardly be affected if $10  million  could  be

found  to  act  as  a safety net fund against  which  people  in

desperate need could apply for some help.  This would be a  one-time  contribution and such a fund, if administered purely as  a

safety net, would go a long way to helping a lot of families and

could  last  until  the economy turns around.   I  urge  serious

consideration for this appeal.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for  allowing  me  to  participate  in  this  debate.   My

intention   is  to  appeal  for  bigger  and  sustained   budget

allocations for the Ministry of Health yearly.  I would like  to

beseech  the  Minister for Finance to give  my  request  earnest

consideration  in  view  of the fast and  vast  improvements  in

science  and technology within the medical field and in view  of

the  social  changes within our society.  Sir, the  Ministry  of

Health,   as  a  non-profitable  and  "expense  only"   economic

contributor, may have received a low priority not only this time

round  but also in the future.  However, I feel that this should

not  be  the  case  because  we  may  compromise  our  excellent

healthcare system.  The Ministry of Health deals with life - the

very  essence of our being.  We would have accomplished  nothing

if  we  lag  behind  in providing excellent  healthcare  and  in

maintaining our people at their best in health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, Singapore's national health

expenditure has remained stable at about 3% of GDP.  However,  a

recent NUS/IPS study commissioned by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>

the  Ministry  of  Health  indicates that  Singapore's  national

health  expenditure, at the current level of  health  servicing,

will  rise  to  7%  of GDP by 2030, due to the  `ageing  factor'

alone.   Sir,  the  economic  pressure  is  also  likely  to  be

aggravated by rapid advancement in medical health science  which

brings,  in  its wake, the introduction of many life-saving  but

expensive new medical technologies and innovations.  The present

generation of Singaporeans is more savvy and will be  even  more

so  in the years to come.  They will have higher expectations of

our  healthcare  system and will demand much more  in  terms  of

their healthcare needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cope with the changing social trend, there is

an  urgency  to  revamp  some areas in  our  current  healthcare

system.  Mr Speaker, Sir, our current healthcare system is  very

much  orientated  for  a  "young population".   Our  demographic

profile  is  undergoing rapid changes, and our  population  will

become  a  mature one within the next generation.  By  the  year

2030, the elderly would constitute a tremendously increased  20%

of  the total population.  There will be an increased prevalence

of  chronic  diseases with conditions like dementia doubling  in

incidence.   Sir,  the elderly, those aged 65 years  and  above,

consume  a  disproportionate amount of our healthcare resources.

This   increasing  trend  of  demand  will  strain  our  present

healthcare system.  We have to be proactive to meet the needs of

a `mature population'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest that more funds be

allocated to the following areas at the very least:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) More funding, and an urgent one too, is required for

building more nursing homes.  We are short of 1,600 nursing home

beds  and we shall need about 15,000 more beds by the year 2030.

Facilities  for long-term care either in the institutional,  day

care or home care settings will have to be strengthened to cater

to  the  needs of a "more mature" society.  Sir, since voluntary

groups run the majority of our nursing homes, and we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>

need  a  speedy  boost  in  the number  of  nursing  homes,  the

Government  may  have to review the present method  of  funding.

There is a need to encourage more voluntary groups to build more

and  reduce our shortfall.  The present 50:50 sharing of running

costs  may  be  a little too arduous for many voluntary  groups.

The  cost  of  building a new nursing home  runs  into  tens  of

millions  of dollars.  The capital sharing of 90% by Government,

which is still too onerous, may have to be reviewed as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sir, increased funds for setting up more disease

prevention  and intervention programmes will reap us rewards  in

the  future.  The key to successfully reduce projected  cost  of

future  healthcare burdens is to promote healthy lifestyles  and

provide  preventive healthcare.  The rewards can be  immense  if

this  is done swiftly and targeted towards the whole population.

It  has  been shown that, among the middle-aged in Finland,  the

number of deaths from heart attack and cerebral stroke could  be

decreased to less than half through preventive measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Another area that needs more funding, Mr Speaker, Sir,

would  be  in the training of more healthcare professionals  and

other   informal  caregivers  for  the  elderly.   Training   in

geriatrics for doctors has to be accelerated and the opportunity

for  such  training must be extended to all doctors and  nurses.

All  these  efforts will not only provide better  care  for  our

elderly  but also facilitate the availability in due  course  of

home  care.  The gist of "elder care" is to keep our elderly  as

ambulatory  for  as  long  as possible,  to  keep  them  in  the

community  for as long as possible, to tap the care of families,

friends  and voluntary groups in the community for  as  long  as

possible.   Institutional care should be used  only  as  a  last

resort.    In  order  to  achieve  this,  promotion  of  healthy

lifestyles  and preventive medicine to our elderly is essential.

More trained personnel is needed to work at the grassroots level

island wide for this to succeed.  Sir, this will require  a  lot

of time, effort and funding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Support is also needed to address issues of prevention,

early  detection, treatment of many diverse conditions.  A  good

illustration  of  this  would be in the management  of  cancers.

Many  cancers,  examples of which would be cervical  cancer  and

breast  cancer,  are  curable  if  detected  early.   Pap  smear

screening  tests  which are available readily in  Singapore  for

many  years  have reduced the incidence of cervical cancer.   We

have  now  got  to address the situation with other  conditions.

The  prevalence of breast cancer - the most common cancer  among

Singapore women - is a good one to start with.  We must see that

funds  are  allocated  towards more public  awareness  promotion

programmes    and   mass   mammography   screening   programmes.

Accelerated provision of personnel and mammography machines  are

necessary  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  breast  cancer.   The

Government must increase the aid given to voluntary groups  that

work for and support those with breast cancer in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Singapore has a growing reputation as a premier

regional medical centre.  High professional standards and a pool

of  well-trained  doctors  and healthcare  workers  have  to  be

maintained to provide quality medical services.  There had  been

a stream of foreign patients being treated in Singapore prior to

this economic crisis.  Although the numbers of such patients may

have decreased, we should continue to maintain our reputation as

a  premier  regional medical centre.  To do this,  more  funding

must  be provided for more training and research, especially  in

those  areas  fast improving in science and technology.   It  is

better  for Singapore to keep abreast of new knowledge,  perhaps

even generate new knowledge, in order to remain relevant in this

medical  arena.   This cannot be achieved without  adequate  and

timely funding.  Maintaining men and machines means money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a tremendous challenge facing us

in  the scope of healthcare in Singapore.  The earlier we embark

on  meeting this challenge, the lesser we will feel the pinch of

the  expense  and the better we can cope with the needs  of  our

people.  Sir, the provision

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>

of  more money, and in steadily increasing amounts each year, is

emerging  as  the  way  to successfully  deal  with  the  future

healthcare  needs of Singapore.  Sir, the Minister  for  Finance

holds the key to the money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  two  features  in  the  1999  Budget

presented  by Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu last week  which  I

think are noteworthy and praiseworthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is Singapore's first deficit budget in many years,

and the deficit is some $5.1 billion,  equivalent to 3.5% of our

GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in order to further strengthen the long-term growth

potential of our economy, and to encourage the development of  a

knowledge-based economy, the Government has provided for  $13.94

billion  as  development expenditure for the various ministries.

The development estimate this year has grown by 9.8% as compared

to  last year.  This is the highest development estimate in  the

history of  Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, last year, when I spoke in this House, I made a plea

on  behalf of the business community to the Finance Minister for

a  balanced budget, rather than  emphasising how much surplus we

have  in our budget each year.   I am pleasantly surprised  that

in  the Budget for FY 1999, the Finance Minister has gone a step

further than what I asked for - he has adopted a deficit  budget

rescue  strategy  for our economy.  On behalf  of  the  business

community, I would like to say we welcome this decision  of  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering our economic foundation and strength, even in this

economic downturn, it is still not impossible for us to maintain

a balanced budget,  but there is a price to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, there is a $5.1 billion deficit. This

means,  if  the Government wants to maintain a balanced  budget,

it  would have to cut down its expenditure by $5.1 billion.   In

other words, the Government has to cut down

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>

spending on social and community development (39%), security and

defence  (32%),  economic infrastructure development  (19%)  and

other  expenditures  to  save $5.1 billion  in  order  to  bring

about a balanced budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this is not feasible. The consequences will only be

lower   quality of social and community services, weaker defence

and   security,   and  slower  development   in   our   economic

infrastructure,  and our international competitiveness  will  be

affected.   Therefore, I feel that formulating a deficit  budget

is  a  very wise decision by the Finance Minister.  On  the  one

hand, it looks after our people who are facing  difficulties, to

solve  their  short-term problems; on the other  hand,  all  the

various development plans can continue to be implemented to look

after the long-term interest of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people hold the view that many countries in this

region  are  facing  economic difficulties  and  have  cut  down

substantially  on defence expenditure in order to  squeeze  more

money to finance other development projects.  They advocate that

Singapore should also do the same and cut down substantially  on

defence expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with such a view. In fact, I feel more

comfortable  that  the budget has allocated  32%  of  our  total

expenditure  for  defence  and  security  because,  after   all,

security  is  of utmost importance.  If we have no security  for

safety,   then   all   our  achievements   accumulated   through

generations  of toilsome hard work   may be wiped out  overnight

at  any time.   Some people are concerned that at this time when

the  other  countries in this region are cutting down  on  their

defence  spending, Singapore is increasing it, and we  may  give

others  the  wrong impression that we are a bellicose.   I  feel

such a view is 100% wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 2,000 years ago, during the spring

and   autumn    warring  states   period,  the  great   military

strategist,  Sun  Tzu,  had already proposed  that  ever-winning

strategic idea of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>

building up a superior army while not at war.  That is  to  say,

at peace time, we must strengthen our defence to ensure that our

defence strength will always be superior to any potential enemy.

Realizing  that their armies are not as powerful  as  ours,  the

potential enemies will not dare to act rashly and will leave  us

alone.   Only  in this way, can we enjoy true peace.   In  other

words,  by maintaining a large defence expenditure, it does  not

imply  that Singapore is a nation which is wantonly engaging  in

military  aggression.  On the contrary, we are  just  practising

Sun  Tzu's  ever-winning theory of "building up a superior  army

while  not  at  war".   Our purpose is to  provide  security  to

ourselves and to maintain peace and security in this region  and

the whole world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I support this deficit budget to pay for sustained

development  of  the  various  ministries,  including   Defence,

Education, Health, Trade and Industry, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to media reports, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed

out  in  Melbourne last Friday that even if we continued to  run

into  a  budget  deficit  for the next one  or  two  years,  the

surpluses accumulated by this current Government would still  be

adequate   to   support   our  necessary  national   development

programmes, and there would be no need to dip into the  reserves

accumulated by the previous governments.  As such, we  need  not

be  overly  concerned with the deficit of $5.1 billion  in  this

year's  budget.   The  Prime Minister  also  said  that  if  the

external  factors remained unchanged, the effect of this  year's

budget  and  last November's $10.5 billion cost-cutting  package

would come into full play in the second half of this year and it

was  envisaged  that  our economy at that time  would  see  some

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business community understands that

this  deficit  budget and last year's cost-cutting package  will

take  some  time  before there will be effects on  our  economic

system.   While  waiting for these measures to bring  about  the

desired  effects  to  our  economy, the business  community  has

refrained  from making too many requests, less we be accused  of

showing no understanding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>

of  the  times.    However, the Government must not  ignore  the

plight  of  our small and medium enterprises and leave  them  to

swim or sink by themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a friend who is a small

entrepreneur  with  investments in the  neighbouring  countries.

Because of the regional factors well known to all of us, he  had

no  choice  but to wind up his overseas business and  return  to

Singapore.   Upon his return, he wanted to lower his standard of

living, but he cannot get any buyer for his house.  He tried  to

look for a job,  but he could not secure any.  His wife who  had

not  been working for many years wanted to come out and work  to

help  support the family, but nobody was willing to employ  her,

because  the type of industry which she was formerly working  in

had  been  phased  out because of economic restructuring.   This

friend  of  mine  has never been an employee.  His  wife  was  a

salaried  worker who resigned from her job many years ago.   Now

both husband and wife are unemployed.  They have no business  to

do either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many such families in Singapore at the moment.

Therefore, I would like to ask the Government whether there  are

any  statistics to show how many people in Singapore  today  are

neither bankrupts nor listed in the unemployment list, but   are

actually   jobless.   How  many  such  families  are  there   in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should look at this problem squarely.

It must seriously consider the plight of these families and help

them  as  far as possible.  Otherwise, very soon, a very serious

social problem may soon emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot help the entrepreneurs at a time when they are

not doing well, we should give them a chance to be "born again".

Otherwise,  how could we be able to encourage more  Singaporeans

to  take  on  greater risks of venturing overseas?  How  are  we

going  to pave the way for our knowledge-based economy?  I think

this  is  a critical question that the Government cannot  ignore

and must find a solution to it as early as possible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the

Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in  support of the motion standing in  the  name  of  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that some positive signs have

emerged   over  the  last  three  months  that  the  crisis   is

stabilising.   The Minister also said that the quick  succession

of  the  US federal rate cuts and the coordinated interest  rate

reduction  initiated by the European central banks  towards  the

close  of last year helped to allay concerns of a global  credit

crunch  and set the stage for a rapid recovery of the  financial

markets in early 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the assurance of the Minister that the

world economic outlook seems promising despite his concern  that

there  could be sharp discontinuities for Singapore in the  year

ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Singaporean, I would like to share the optimisitc

outlook  of our Minister.  However, recent economic developments

outside the region may serve to dampen much of our optimism  for

the  future.  In the last few months, we have seen the  relative

volatility  of  the financial markets not seen in recent  times.

To  begin  with,  we  have seen the financial instability  which

started in South East Asia spread in the last year to Russia and

Brazil.   Russia  suffered a massive loss of confidence  in  its

economy  when the government defaulted massively on its external

borrowing which included the default on the US$40 billion rouble

bonds,  and the interest and capital repayment which is  due  to

the  International  Monetary Fund and the World  Bank.   By  its

default,  Russia has placed itself in the same  company  as  the

other  third world countries like Sudan, Afghanistan, and Congo.

It  is  a reflection of the poverty and weakness of the  Russian

economy, which arguably is also a reflection of the state of the

world  economy today.  Fortunately, the default of  the  Russian

government  has had a limited effect on the rest of  Europe  and

the  world economy, in part, because of the relative size of the

Russian economy compared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>

the  rest  of the developed world.  Nonetheless, it is  arguable

that  the collapse of the Russian economy portends that not  all

is well with the world economy at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the floatation of the Brazilian real recently

does  suggest that the world economy is still fragile and prone,

to  use the words of the Minister, to bouts of nervousness.   In

fact,  the  devaluation of the Brazilian real initially  brought

about  some  anxiety  that a new round  of  contagion  could  be

triggered.  Although, the Brazilian crisis did not turn  out  to

be  as  bad as was anticipated, it nonetheless drives  home  the

point of fragility and interdependence of the world economy.  We

are  not,  by  any measure, shielded from that which  is  taking

place  elsewhere.   We  are still very  vulnerable  to  external

factors which are beyond our control.  Much as we would like  to

think that present indicators show a stablising situation in the

region,  we  should  not be too sanguine about  things.   Things

could still go wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, at the moment, some signs that the world may be

heading  for  a  more serious downturn.  The  Economist  in  its

recent  publication  argued that in much of  the  world  outside

America  the  risk  of deflation is at its  greatest  since  the

1930s.   Japan  is  suffering  from deflationary  pressure.   In

China, prices are continuing to fall as with some other parts of

East  Asia.   Continental Europe's inflation rate  is  close  to

zero.  Prices are coming down, thanks in part to the effects  of

new  technology  and  to  falling  commodity  prices.   Although

deflation is generally benign, the long term effect of unbridled

deflation,  caused  by excess capacity and  weak  demand,  would

easily  lead to a depression, with prices and output falling  as

they did 70 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both Europe and the United States join Japan in the

current deflationary trend, I would say that we have a lot  more

reason to worry for the coming year.  This would be contrary  to

what the press had reported earlier of the Ministry of Trade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>

and  Industry's  statement  that the  economy  in  Singapore  is

expected to turn around by the middle of the year.  In fact,  my

assessment  is a more pessismistic one if recent indicators  are

anything to go by.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent comment by an official from the Trade Development

Board has indicated that Singapore's share of the US electronics

market, excluding consumer electronics, had fallen from 12.8% in

June  1997  to 10.6% by September 1998.  The decline  in  market

share may be attributable to Singapore's loss of competitiveness

against exporters from China and Mexico, among others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sassoon, in a recent report, argued that the loss of

competitiveness  has  its  roots as a result  of  the  following

developments in global trends:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the advent of the budget PCs which are below US$1,000, as

PC  makers  compete fiercely with each other to  give  consumers

more value for money;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the resultant plunge in prices of components such as disk

drives  and  semi-conductors over the past two to  three  years,

which  reduces  the  high-rise, high margin  products  to  high-volume, low margin commodities; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the constant pressure on manufacturers to outsource and

supply at even lower cost, which lead contract manufacturers  to

locate   their   operations  in  places  where   the   cost   of

manufacturing  is  substantially lower  than  Singapore.   These

countries include, for instance, China and Mexico.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are faced therefore with a serious situation where we

are  losing our competitiveness to the other emerging economies.

This  is a challenge which should not be taken lightly.   It  is

right  that  our Government should recently adopt  the  measures

which   the   Committee   on  Singapore's  Competitiveness   has

recommended.  Hopefully, these measures will help to provide the

much  needed boost to our competitiveness.  Unfortunately, these

are  still  early  days.   It would be  difficult  to  determine

upfront  at  this  moment whether the measures  adopted  by  the

Government will yield effective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>

results   in   bolstering  the  competitiveness  of  Singapore's

economy.  At the moment, there are clear indications as we  have

seen  in  the  electronics  sector,  that  we  are  losing   our

competitiveness to our rivals.  In the long run, this  does  not

augur well for the Singapore economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this difficult climate, it is heartening to note that

our Government takes a long-term view of keeping our economy  on

track.  In particular, our Government has identified several key

strategies which included cutting business costs, easy access to

working   capital   for   the   smaller   enterprises,    market

diversification, investment promotion and capabilities building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, our Government announced a series of

cost  cutting  measures aimed at helping the  businesses  during

this economically difficult period.  The cost reduction packages

include  key elements of business costs such as wages,  rentals,

utilities  and transportation.  The $10.5 billion cost reduction

exercise  shows  the  resolve  and  the  speed  with  which  our

Government has responded to the crisis; at times, to the envy of

some  other  countries.   We have no  choice  but  to  make  the

necessary sacrifice if we want to stay ahead of competition.  As

the  Minister has said, only time will tell whether the measures

introduced by our Government will have any beneficial impact  on

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost cutting measures have had a significant impact on

the wages of ordinary Singaporean workers.  Our workers have  to

accept  a  15%  reduction in overall wages.  Such  a  reduction,

while  painful for many, is important, and I would say  that  we

really do not have a choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a recent economic survey of Singapore showed that in

1998,  the  economy continued to experience rising costs.   This

was  due  to  the  divergence between  labour  productivity  and

nominal  wages.   Labour productivity shrank by  1.3%  in  1998,

while  nominal  wages continued to increase  in  1998.   Nominal

average monthly earnings grew by 2.8% in 1998.  As a result, the

unit labour cost index for the overall economy continued

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>

to  increase for 1998.  The November cost cutting measures  will

only  begin to have an impact on the economy this financial year

and we will only know the results in the next financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should bear in mind that if we had not done anything to

our  unit labour cost, our workers may price themselves  out  of

the  market.   In  the long run, we may not be able  to  compete

effectively  against our rivals in the world economy.   We  know

that  the  unit labour cost comprises approximately 49%  of  the

unit  business  cost.   This is certainly  quite  a  significant

figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, our workers understand the position we are in.

If  we  want to improve our wages and enjoy a better quality  of

life  and  security  of employment, there is  really  no  choice

except  to  ensure that our workers' productivity  continues  to

outstrip  our  wage  increases.  If we do  not  understand  this

principle  and choose instead to militantly demand higher  wages

without the corresponding improvements in productivity, we  will

end up poorer for it, especially when one takes into account the

changing trends in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of our key strategies which will underpin our

long  term  competitiveness is to focus on our labour  resource.

In capabilities building, our Government is right in saying that

we  should  focus on skills development to prepare our workforce

for   the   next  wave  of  industrial  revolution  which   will

prominently feature information technology.  As the Minister has

said, this is a pressing issue.  A disproportionate share of the

retrenched  workers  in  1998 were 40  years  and  older.   This

indicates a worrisome trend.  We are seeing an increase  in  the

profile  of  ageing employees in our workforce.  In  order  that

they  should  be  placed in a position to  be  relevant  to  the

workforce, it is imperative that our Government should  continue

to  pour in resources to retool our workers for the next wave of

industrial  revolution.  In this regard, I note that there  have

been  many  non-Singaporeans who have benefited from our  worker

training programmes.  I would urge that in looking at this  area

of   worker  retraining,  priority  should  continue  to  go  to

Singaporeans,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>

especially  older  Singaporeans, for whom seeking  re-employment

upon  retrenchment is made so much more difficult on the account

of age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have expressed the concern that this

year's Budget has run into a substantial deficit, the biggest we

have  seen in recent years.  If anything, there is much  concern

that if we continued to spend in this manner, we would soon  run

out  of  the reserves that we have accumulated for ourselves  in

this  current term of office.  This would not be seen as prudent

management on our part and should therefore be dealt  with  much

care  and  concern.  While I too would admit  that  our  present

budget deficit is large by any measure, standing at more than $5

billion,  we should in fact see our budget deficit in a positive

light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should note that the $5.1 billion budget deficit arises

mainly  because operating revenue is expected to  fall  by  $3.1

billion.   On the other hand, development spending has increased

by  a  significant  $1.2  billion.   As  was  reported  in  last

Saturday's  Straits Times, our deficit comes after  10  straight

years of surpluses.  We should also note that our budget deficit

spending is dedicated to capacity building, and is not used  for

consumption  spending or for shoring up insolvent companies  and

financial institutions.  The Government has always cited caution

in  planning our budget, ensuring that we do not spend more than

we can afford.  Accumulating surpluses in the good years to tide

us  through the lean years is a principle that seems like a leaf

from  the  story  of  Joseph in the Bible when  he  advised  the

Pharaoh to save the excesses of the seven years of bumper  crops

in  order  to  provide for the seven lean years  that  followed.

That  proved to be sound advice for the Egyptians, and it  saved

them  from famine.  For us, we are in a similar situation.   The

lean years have come and we should now dip into our savings.   I

would therefore support the deficit without any hesitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an effort to help Singaporeans through this

recession, we have focused

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>

in  this  Budget  on the man-in-the-street.  To  this  end,  the

Government  has decided to provide such assistance  as  the  10%

rebate  on  income tax for those who are paying  taxes  and  the

rebates  on  service and conservancy (S&C) charges to  help  the

majority  of  Singaporeans who do not pay  taxes.   While  these

measures are well meaning, I would submit the assistance is  not

comprehensive  enough.  I am referring to Singaporeans  who  may

not  be paying taxes and who are not fortunate enough to own HDB

flats and be in a position to enjoy the S&C rebates.  What do we

do  to  help them?  Sir, these are Singaporeans who are no  less

deserving  of our assistance during this difficult  period.   It

has  been  said that for those who are not caught  by  the  net,

there is the CCC Assistance Scheme to help them.  The scheme is,

I  believe, for those who are the abject poor and are  therefore

deserving  of  our  assistance through the  CCC.   However,  the

people whom I am referring to are those who do not belong to the

category  of  the  abject poor, neither do they  belong  to  the

category of the taxpayers.  Should we not do something for  them

as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister in a recent statement stated that we

should  encourage a new breed of technopreneurs;  investors  who

can put technology and business together.  Towards this end,  he

said  that  we  should review our bankruptcy laws  to  encourage

people  to  go  into  business  so  that  they  should  not   be

stigmatised  by failures.  Sir, I cannot agree more.   Over  the

years, we have been so enamoured by the culture of success  that

we  see  failure as a disgrace or a blot in the record of  those

concerned.  That is wrong and should now be changed.  We  should

learn to give others a second chance in life and should learn to

change  our values to accommodate that change in principle.   We

should  build a culture where failure is not always  seen  as  a

slight on the character of a person, but as a pillar upon  which

the  foundation of success is built.  Sir, I was  told  that  in

Silicon  Valley,  success is often measured not  only  by  one's

achievement,  but  by the number of times a person  has  failed.

That, Sir, is the true spirit of technopreneurship; the kind  of

spirit that we want to engender in this country.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from reviewing our bankruptcy laws, we can use tax

incentives,  as we are in the habit of doing, to encourage  such

spirit  of  enterprise.  We know that start up  companies  would

take  several  years  before they  can  see  profits.   This  is

especially true with information technology companies where  the

incubation  period  for the hardware or the  software  can  take

several  years before any prospect of profit may be entertained.

Sir,  where there are tax incentives for these companies to help

them  to  establish  their footing in  the  industry,  it  would

certainly help these investors in a positive way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all living in rather tumultuous times. The

economic  crisis  may have gone into remission for  the  moment.

However,  as I said, the worst is not yet over.  There could  be

another round of contagion to hit the region.  We have seen  how

the  economic crisis has given way to political crisis  in  some

countries.   We,  in  Singapore, are  also  affected,  although,

fortunately, not of the same extent.  We are indeed fortunate to

have a leadership that provided this country with the ballast to

sail  through  this stormy economic weather.  We should  at  the

same  time  also note that the economic crisis in  Chinese  also

means  a  crisis of opportunity.  Our Budget shows the strategic

direction  taken  by our Government for the long  term  to  take

advantage of the opportunity.  We are on the right track, and it

leaves us only to support the Minister's Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion as proposed by the Finance Minister.  This

year's  Budget  clearly shows that our Government is  farsighted

and  cautious.  As mentioned by the Finance Minister, "1999  may

well  turn out to be another difficult and challenging year  for

Singapore."   The  Minister reminded all Singaporeans  that  "we

will  live within our means."  This is indeed a timely  reminder

for  all Singaporeans who have been enjoying positive GDP growth

for many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although economic growth has increased the affluence of

many Singaporeans, it has certain setbacks.  Years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>

economic  growth  have  also  made  Singaporeans  to   be   over

optimistic and sometimes wasteful.  This is evident through  the

large  amount  of  bulky  waste such  as  furniture,  electrical

appliances, and renovation debris dumped by HDB residents yearly

over the last 10 years.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.12 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many town councils noticed a drastic fall of

between  25%  and 50% drop in the bulky waste collection.   This

clearly  shows  that  many  HDB  dwellers  have  understood  the

severity  of the regional crisis, and are more prudent in  their

spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is experiencing a difficult period of

uncertainty.   I  agree that we should seize the opportunity  to

strengthen our economic competitiveness.  But this is  also  the

time for the Government to extend a helping hand to Singaporeans

who  are in need.  The crisis has affected many Singaporeans  of

all income levels in both the HDB and private estates.  Thus,  I

hope the Minister could consider the following suggestions:

<br><br><i>Personal tax rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Budget has provided a one-off 10% personal

income  tax rebate that is fair.  But there is no relief measure

for Singaporeans who were retrenched.  Those who were retrenched

may  face difficulty to pay their income taxes.  Thus,  I  would

urge  the  Minister to consider allowing retrenched Singaporeans

to delay paying their income taxes.

<br><br><i>S&C and utilities rebates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, working Singaporeans supported the cost

cutting measures as proposed by the Government.  Many have taken

a  10% CPF contribution and wage cut, thus facing more financial

strain  to  support their families.  Feedback from HDB residents

showed  that many expected the Government to provide higher  S&C

and utilities rebates so as to alleviate their financial burden.

Many have regarded the Budget as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>

"non-event"  which does not provide much relief to reduce  their

living costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the cost cutting measures have saved jobs, many

Singaporeans felt that businesses have not passed much of  their

cost  savings  to consumers.  Prices of goods and services  have

not   been  reduced  accordingly.   As  such,  Singaporeans  are

experiencing a reduction of purchasing power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, utilities rebate provides an effective and simple

means   to  assist  Singaporeans  in  difficult  times.    While

Singaporeans agree that water conservation is crucial, they hope

that  the Government could adopt other non-monetary measures  to

encourage  water  conservation instead of increasing  the  water

tariffs  during  this  difficult time.  The  increase  will  add

further  burden to all households, especially those  with  large

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing a

$300  utilities  rebate to all households in HDB  estates.   The

rebate  shall  be paid on a monthly basis over a  period  of  12

months.   The monthly rebate will serve as a minimum payment  to

Power  Supply so that families in hardship will not  face  legal

action  or  utilities  supply cut by Power  Supply  during  this

difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has also increased the number of

welfare cases in many constituencies.  In Bukit Panjang, welfare

assistance  was  provided to 59 families  during  the  last  six

months.   Of  these cases, 53% are from 3-room, 39% from  4-room

and  8%  from 5-room flats.  The figures show that 3- and 4-room

flat  dwellers  face more financial strain during  this  period.

Thus,  I hope the Finance Minister can understand the plight  of

these  two  groups of residents and increase their  S&C  rebates

accordingly.

<br><br><i>Development expenditure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the development expenditure has increased by $1.2

billion  to  $13.9 billion, more could be allocated to  expedite

the  development  of  a  world-class land transport  system,  as

proposed in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>

White Paper by the Land Transport Authority in 1996.  As stated,

LTA  will  provide a seamless land transport system, which  will

offer   convenience,   reliability,  ease   of   use,   comfort,

affordability, and competitive travel times to all commuters  of

public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered linkway is identified as one of the features in the

seamless  land  transport system.  Although LTA has  implemented

many  covered  linkways, it is also an  opportune  time  now  to

expedite  the construction of linkways for all bus  stops,  taxi

stands  and  MRT  stations  to  the  housing  estates.   Covered

linkways  provide a vital link between our transport system  and

the  housing estates.  It has also become a way of life for many

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage more Singaporeans to use the public

transport system, we should expedite the construction of covered

linkways.   Therefore,  I would like to  urge  the  Minister  to

increase the development budget for covered linkways.  This will

not  only  provide much convenience to commuters but  also  save

some jobs in the building related industry.

<br><br><i>Incentive to replace diesel vehicles</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the provision of a one year accelerated

depreciation  allowance to replace old diesel driven  commercial

goods vehicles and buses.  To further protect the air quality of

our  environment, I would propose that the incentive  scheme  be

extended  to  all  diesel  plants and  equipment  used  outdoor,

especially those at construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar incentives could be given to encourage construction

firms  and  plant  suppliers to upgrade their  fleet  of  diesel

driven   plants  and  equipment  such  as  cranes,   excavators,

compactors, rollers, and concrete mixers.  All these plants  and

equipment are sources of air pollution.

<br><br><i>Approve IT training grant</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a knowledge-based economy, we need to encourage

Singaporeans to acquire life-long learning skills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>

Information technology provides an essential tool to  facilitate

knowledge  acquisition.   In the near  future,  e-commerce  will

become a part of life for many Singaporeans.  But there is still

a  large  proportion of our population who is not familiar  with

information technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should provide more incentives to increase

the  IT  awareness of Singaporeans.  To achieve  this,  I  would

suggest that an Approved IT Training Scheme be formed to provide

low  cost  IT courses to Singaporeans, especially those  in  HDB

estates.   In  addition, a capital grant could be given  to  all

community  clubs  to  set up a Community  IT  Centre  which  can

provide training and access to computers for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These IT courses can also be conducted at Residents'

Committee  Centres,  thus  making  them  easily  accessible   to

residents.   The  People's Association can manage  the  proposed

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in support of the Budget Statement for the financial  year

1999-2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is also a difficult one. For the first time

in   more  than  a  decade,  the  Government  is  presenting  an

unprecedented   budget  deficit  of  $5.1  billion   and,   more

importantly,  it  is  not  letting  off  on  spending  aimed  at

investing  in  the future.  For the first time in  more  than  a

decade,   we  are  also  in  a  recession,  which  is  primarily

attributable to the financial crisis which afflicted the  region

since  mid-1997.  At this juncture, a heavy cloud of uncertainty

continues  to hover in the horizon with Japan yet struggling  to

nurse  themselves out of their prolonged economic downturn  and,

more  so,  with the economic, political and social situation  in

Indonesia  yet unresolved.  As the Finance Minister, Dr  Richard

Hu,  has  said, it is  very difficult to predict the future  and

how  long  the  current recession is expected  to  last.   As  a

consolation,  I  am at least relieved that the Finance  Minister

has  indicated that the Government might introduce  yet  another

package of off-Budget measures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>

in due course should the economy take a turn for the worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as earlier speakers have acknowledged, our business and

industry groups are generally satisfied with the Budget  as  the

majority  of  them feel that they are beginning to benefit  from

the  host  of cost-cutting measures introduced in November  last

year.  Time is needed to allow the package to show its effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take issue on our vision to develop into a

globally  competitive knowledge-based economy (KBE).   With  the

world  fast  changing  from an industrial  based  economy  to  a

knowledge-driven  one, and with Singapore by and  large  already

plugged   to   the  global  economy,  we  are  now  exposed   to

increasingly  aggressive competition and challenges  from  every

corner  of  the globe.  To stay ahead of the pack,  we  need  to

quickly  learn  and  master  new  and  emerging  knowledge   and

technologies  and  creatively harness  this  into  products  and

services  demanded by the world.  While I am in full support  of

the  host of programmes we already have and are putting in place

to proceed in this direction, I do have some concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, although much has been said about the important need for

us  to transit into a KBE to stay ahead, I am not convinced that

the majority of businesses, especially smaller ones, and also  a

large  pool of individuals, know what a KBE entails.   Many  are

still confused, with the majority associating a KBE with IT  and

feel that as long as they are competent in using computers, they

are   therefore  already  doing  their  part  in   KBE.    While

information technology (IT) is the key enabler for  the  KBE,  a

KBE  itself  is  much  more than that.  It  is  primarily  about

unleashing  and  optimally employing knowledge that  resides  in

people's heads or captured in IT systems and processes, and then

tapping and applying this to work, or economic activities which,

in  turn,  contribute to the nation's competitiveness,  GDP  and

economic growth.  It is not confined to certain sectors  of  the

economy only, but permeates the entire economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Government and the media to embark on

another  phase  of  public  education  to  clearly  explain,  if

necessary,  in simple and caricature form of what a KBE  is  all

about  so  that  businesses and individuals alike  can  properly

execute  their  roles in successfully transforming  our  economy

into a KBE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is the impact of KBE on unemployment. As we push

ahead  to transform Singapore into a KBE, it is inevitable  that

some degree of structural unemployment will result.  Even if our

present  recessionary  economy is on the track  of  recovery,  I

still  feel  that  structural unemployment is  unavoidable.   We

therefore  need to do everything within our means, at  least  to

minimise  this effect.  I am happy that substantial  amounts  of

funds have been set aside through major programmes, such as  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme, to press on with knowledge  and

skills  upgrading to tackle this problem.  Here, I  think  there

will always be people who would adopt a wait-and-see attitude in

the  hope  that  they would get back their  old  jobs  once  the

economy  recovers.  The fact is that with our stepped up  effort

to  attract  and create higher value-added jobs and  activities,

the  old  jobs these people have would have disappeared  forever

and  therefore  these people, especially the old and  the  lower

skilled ones, will continue to remain unemployed.  This group of

people, therefore, needs to be continually warned of the  danger

of becoming irrelevant to the economy and remaining indefinitely

unemployed  if  they do not take heed of the repeated  calls  to

upgrade  themselves.  The NTUC and self-help groups and training

providers could help in propagating such information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SRP programmes are aimed at preparing our workforce to

remain  employable  in  the  changing  employment  and  economic

landscape, managers and professionals too need to upgrade  their

academic  and  professional knowledge to keep  up.   Doing  this

through specialised or post-graduate courses can be very  costly

and can run into tens of thousands of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>

dollars.   I  feel  that  Government could  have  done  more  in

allowing  a  higher  amount  than  the  revised  $2,500  in  tax

deduction  for course fees to encourage professional  adults  to

improve their skills and knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to now turn to the subject of technopreneurship.

The   Government's   recent  step   to   support   and   promote

technopreneurship  is consistent with our KBE  positioning.   We

need  to nurture home-bred SMEs so that they can grow into world

class  companies  capable of competing  globally.   We  need  to

create  more Sim Wong Hoos and diversify our economy so that  we

can  become  less dependent on multi-national companies  (MNCs).

While  MNCs  have played a key role in providing foreign  direct

investments (FDIs), create jobs and significantly contributed to

our  economic  growth, we must bear in mind that most  of  these

investments are mobile and can be quite easily relocated.   This

exposes  us  to  economic vulnerability.  With  an  increasingly

educated workforce, we are in a better position now to encourage

more sophisticated entrepreneurship to decrease our reliance  on

MNCs.   Taiwan supposedly has been able to escape the  worst  of

the  financial  turmoil because of its government's  ability  to

create the conditions in which SMEs thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Economic Development Board is

setting  aside funds to co-invest in Promising Local Enterprises

to  provide them with management expertise and capital  infusion

needed  to grow their businesses.  On the other side of  it,  we

must not forget the smaller businesses with big ideas which also

need cultivation.  The move towards revising bankruptcy laws  to

provide  businesses which failed the first time around a  second

chance,  as Mr Sin Boon Ann, Member for Tampines GRC  has  said,

and   the   set  up  of  a  high  level  committee  to   promote

technopreneurship chaired by DPM Tony Tan, are  all  encouraging

steps  towards  evolving  a  vibrant technopreneurship  hub  for

Singapore.  However, all these efforts could come to  nought  if

we  move too slowly.  What is important to bear in mind is  that

even the best of ideas needs seed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>

capital to get moving.  Venture capital should be encouraged  to

focus  on  promising  business dreams and help  turn  them  into

realities.   The  Government  could assist  by  encouraging  the

pooling  of  start-up  funds by individuals  and  SMEs  to  fund

promising  ventures or co-share in small loans to  provide  seed

money  for  businesses  which are risky but  innovative.   In  a

recession  where jobs are less plentiful, this is the best  time

to arrest the risk-averse mentality and encourage such ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to make a point on life-long learning

which is also tied to KBE.  I am thrilled with Dr Lee Boon Yang,

the  Minister for Manpower's recent announcement of Manpower  21

which addresses the strategy formulation for the development  of

a  globally  competitive workforce aimed at driving a knowledge-based  economy.   While  the  six key  features  supporting  the

concept  of  a  school of life-long learning  announced  by  the

Minister  are  well conceptualised, I have one key concern,  and

this  is the ability to reach out to older workers, particularly

those with only primary and lower secondary education to embrace

this concept.  I believe it will require the continuous combined

efforts of the Government, unions and employers to persuade this

group  of workers to upgrade themselves, so that they can remain

relevant for the remaining balance of their economic life.  Self-help  groups  and  grassroots organisations could  also  play  a

meaningful  role  to  assist  the  tripartite  parties  in  this

endeavour.   I  would  also  like to suggest  that  for  greater

effectiveness, life-long learning centres be brought to the  HDB

heartlands where reach-out can be more extensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Government's emphasis on

development expenditure targeted at long-term benefits  in  this

Budget.  However, I wish to note the need for us to monitor  and

strike  a fine balance between managing the economic crisis  and

the  push towards a KBE as there will be individuals as well  as

businesses  who will become victims of the crisis to  whom  help

needs to be given to prevent them from losing hope.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy laid down

by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Budget  announcement has been well received by the business  and

industrial sectors and the community.  The Minister for  Finance

and  his  colleagues must be commended for the efforts to  steer

Singapore's economy through trying times.  I must say  that  the

Minister  does not have an easy task nor does he  have  a  magic

wand to wish the problem away.  He is indeed trying his best and

we  must  commend  him  for his efforts,  because  many  of  the

problems  are outside his control.  Because it is a  problem  of

the  region I therefore feel that what is most important is  for

Singaporeans - workers, employers, entrepreneurs and all that  - to  work  together and not bicker about the problems and  issues

and  blame one another for them.  In doing so, we are not  going

to  do good for Singapore.  What is most important for us is  to

brace  and  face  the  challenges ahead.  I  see  that  is  most

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam, who is not around here now, has argued that

democracy  would provide economic growth and promote good  life.

But  from  what  I know many democracies have not produced  good

life.  And democracy without economic growth would not provide a

good  life  and  promote  better livelihood.   I  assert  it  is

fundamental  that  we have good economic growth  in  order  that

democracy  can survive.  I would also like to state that  it  is

very  important that we have our fundamentals right in the sense

that  we  will  have  to generate economic growth  in  order  to

increase  the  pie, so that this could be redistributed  in  the

interest  of  the community to achieve a better life.   We  know

that  in  many places, if you look around, eg, in Asia, what  is

important is not just democracy itself.  What is crucial  is  to

have  good social institutions and good leaders to manage  them.

And  unless  and  until we have people with good  integrity  and

honesty  to manage these institutions and to be able to  prepare

ahead, to have good social and economic plans, I feel good lives

cannot be achieved.  Many democracies have that empty talks and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>

not  fulfilling the dreams and aspirations that the  people  are

aspiring  for.   We know that democracy cannot  just  depend  on

empty  stomachs.  We cannot do that, because democracy on  empty

stomach  means nothing.  We will first have to try and meet  the

basic  needs of the people, and it is very critical that we  try

to  find different ways to generate economic growth.  If we  can

do  that,  then we will be able to promote better life  for  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I must say that our Government is

doing  the best it can, given the constraints that Singapore  is

facing.   We must admit that we are facing trying and  difficult

times.   There is no easy answer to the problems.   But  what  I

hope is that Singaporeans can rally around, work together, think

of  new innovative and creative ways, and find new opportunities

ahead,  to  help  us tackle the difficult and challenging  times

that we are facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we need to look at the Budget more closely

and  I would like to pick up a few pockets of people whose needs

have  not been looked at more closely.  The first group  is  the

employability of older workers, ie, people who are less skilled.

I  see  that the problems are real, and some of them  have  been

retrenched.  We need to look at their needs more closely and pay

attention  in  terms of how this group could  be  helped.   Many

older workers are likely to find difficulty in getting jobs  and

it  is a pity that their contributions are not tapped.  In  this

respect,  it would be desirable to provide more tax rebates  and

incentives  for companies that are more prepared to  employ  and

retain  older workers.  If we can do that, we will  be  able  to

provide a wider opportunity for our unskilled and older workers.

Older  workers  who  are unskilled are also vulnerable  to  lose

their jobs through relocation of companies to cheaper economies.

It  is  therefore  necessary at this point  to  try  and  create

employment  to  tap  some  of these semi-skilled  and  unskilled

workers who otherwise find great difficulty in employment.  So I

hope  that  there  could be greater public  sector  creation  of

employment for this group of workers,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>

because  in  the  private sector the jobs  are  shrinking  quite

dramatically.  Therefore, I hope that one would be able to  look

at this group of workers and see how they can be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to urge that the training grant be

reviewed, particularly the tax rebate of $2,500 which  is  given

for  workers.   We  need to be more generous.  Perhaps  I  would

suggest  that the Minister for Finance increase this tax  rebate

to  $5,000  so  that  the older workers can  take  advantage  of

retraining,  as some of the courses which enhance  their  skills

would  cost  more than $2,500.  Some generosity in this  respect

would be useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection too, I urge that the training

allowance  for older workers at $500 could be reviewed,  because

it is very difficult to encourage workers to go into training if

the  allowances  are marginal and are not attractive  enough  to

sustain  them.   Sir,  the  next group  of  people  who  deserve

attention are the pensioners who draw very low pension  of  less

than  $200.   Monthly pensions of less than $200 might  make  it

difficult  for them to manage under trying times.   I  see  that

these  pensioners are stretched, if they have no other means  of

support.   They are, in fact, no better than those  who  are  on

public   assistance.   Sir,  surely  this  group  of  pensioners

deserves  a better deal as they have given sterling services  to

the  Government and many of them served their best for  over  30

years.  I see that there is justification for a base-up revision

of  their  pensions to meet at least a minimum  requirement  for

their living.  These low income pensioners deserve a review -  I

have  been making pleas on their behalf over the years -  and  I

hope  that this will touch the Finance Minister's heart  and  he

would be able to do something for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another group is the 1- and 2-room families who have

been  given PUB rebates from $50 to $100.  Many of these  people

are in seasonal employment and they are also hit by the economic

recession.  They do deserve a review in terms of the PUB rebates

and perhaps the PUB rebates for 1-, 2- and 3-rooms could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>

be  standardised to $200.  This, I think, will help to alleviate

some of their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last group which requires our attention is those families

which  have to look after their aged sick parents.   I  am  glad

that  the  Ministry  of Health is planning  to  subsidise  these

families.   However, this move would not be able to  reduce  the

burden of those families in the sandwich income group who  faces

financial  burden in the increasing cost of nursing  care.   The

number  of families with aged sick parents will increase steeply

in  the near future.  In this case, we have to try and find ways

in  which  we could relieve the burden through more tax rebates,

so  that  their aged sick parents need not be institutionalised.

Substitute  care can be implemented and other alternative  forms

of  support  can be mobilised in order that they can  be  looked

after within the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister would be able to look at the few

suggestions that I have given.  It is not going to cost too much

outlay.   But it will cost some outlay.  I hope that he will  be

able  to extend assistance to these groups of people who I  have

requested him to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I would like to support the Budget Statement,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, the Budget announced by the Finance Minister  this

year  has  not drawn much reaction from our people because  last

year  the Government had already announced packages to deal with

the  currency and economic crisis.  The reaction by  our  people

illustrates  the maturity of our people and their confidence  in

the  leaders  of  Singapore.   More  importantly,  whenever  the

Government  makes  any  important  decision,  they  would  first

communicate   with   the   people  so   that   they   could   be

psychologically prepared for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, this Budget has basically looked after the needs of

our  people  in this time of crisis.  According to some  of  our

workers, many seminars or talks were conducted over the past one

to two years,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>

and  they  are  aware that the Government has been planning  for

their future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are concerned with more long-term issues. From the

feedback we have received, it appears that our workers want  the

Government  to provide them with more opportunities  to  acquire

the  necessary skills to cope with the challenges ahead  as   we

are evolving into a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When computer was just a calculating machine, our Singapore

Government  has already established the National Computer  Board

(NCB)  to actively promote computerisation.  So when IT is going

to  be the security for our survival, should we not upgrade  NCB

to a higher profile Ministry of IT Power?  I feel that we should

have  a  Ministry  to be overall in charge of all  our  computer

resources.   We  should have a designated Ministry  to  monitor,

supervise  and  manage the upgrading and evaluation  of  our  IT

needs  and also to maximize the effects of IT on our social  and

economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Technology (IT) has advanced very rapidly and

has  a  great impact on our life.  From telephone to television,

from  study to work, from shopping to investment, from  Internet

to e-commerce, IT has affected almost every aspect of our lives.

Various  ministries,  statutory boards, departments and agencies

of  the Government, such as the NCB, PSB, Ministry of Education,

TAS, SBA, MITA have also put in a concerted effort to popularise

IT  among  our people.  Looking at the future, would it  not  be

better if we have a centralised authority to  take charge of the

overall planning and implementation of the national IT policies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have to actively and strenuously promote IT

technology?   We  need  to do so because this  will  give  us  a

leading  edge  in  a  knowledge economy.  As  a  small  country,

whether or not we could lead in the world of a knowledge economy

would  depend  on two factors:  first, the general  standard  of

education  of  our  people, and secondly, the general  level  of

application of IT among our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>

people.  When we have more people using IT, productivity will go

up.  For example, engineers or doctors could use 3-D imaging  to

more accurately and quickly make diagnosis and decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, e-commerce has become a new mode of business transactions.

With more people possessing IT skills, they will be able to work

smarter and faster. They will then have more leisure time to  be

with  their families or to upgrade themselves.  With more people

possessing  IT  skills, their employability will be  better  and

productivity of the various companies and factories would go up.

This would enhance our competitiveness, and our world ranking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help Singapore to attain such a target and to

supervise the implementation of such an effort?  There are  many

foreign organisations that have been evaluating us from time  to

time.  But  which ministry or agency  in Singapore can  evaluate

our level of application of IT in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we would have to promote IT to our students

because   the  students  are  the  life-force  for  our  future.

Recently,  the Minister for Education announced the IT Education

Master  Plan  and  the Finance Minister has generously  allotted

more  than $5 billion to invest in education.  I think we should

have  more resources available to promote IT in our schools  and

then our school principals would not have to worry that there is

not enough money to use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the

establishment  of the E-commerce blueprint and NCB  set  up  the

Singapore  ONE  integrated network.  EDB,  TDB,  PSB  have  also

introduced  various incentive schemes.  NTUC and  PA  have  also

been very active in promoting IT and related skills training.  I

do  no think there is any other country in the world that has so

many ministries and government agencies working hand in hand and

with such a high profile to promote IT among the people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the non-professionals, they are the people with potential

economic  values.  Our housewives have helped us to manage  warm

homes  for the families, and  to pass on our traditional  values

to  the  next  generation.   As  for  the  retirees,  they  have

contributed towards the building up of our nation to what it  is

today.  They  have a rich experience which we did not  have  the

opportunity to live through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are housewives or retirees, or even the less

fortunate  handicapped people, so long as they have the  ability

to  apply  IT,  they  can  upgrade  themselves  and  make  their

contribution to our knowledge-type production activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have provided a lot of hardware to our

grassroots  organisations.  However, in  order  to  receive  the

arrival  of  the  era of a knowledge economy, we should  provide

more  training to the grassroots leaders and their staff so that

they  could  have a more systematic knowledge of  IT,  in  order

that  they may be able to effectively  lead a new generation  of

Singaporeans.  Perhaps, if we look five or 10 years  ahead,   we

would  wonder  if it would not be more effective if  we  have  a

Ministry  to  be  overall  in  charge  of  IT  applications   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not an expert but just an ordinary user of IT. I would

like  to make some suggestions.  How do we promote? In the past,

our  Singapore  Government has its "Home  for  Everyone"  scheme

which  is  well  known throughout the world and our  people  are

happy to have their own homes. Perhaps, as we step into the 21st

century,  we could have a "Computer for Every Home" scheme.   We

may  perhaps  want to help every family living in a 3-room  flat

and  below  to own a computer.  At present,  about  50%  of  our

families have their own computers.  We are slightly better  than

London because London is only 37%.  Perhaps, we should set up an

unprecedented target of 80% of our families owning computers  in

three years' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we could have smart-type HDB flats. Under NCB's IT

2000 scheme, Singapore is going to become an intelligent island. At

present, many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>

commercial buildings are being rebuilt

as  intelligent buildings.  HDB may perhaps try a pioneer scheme

to   design  some  intelligent-type  flats  conducive   to   the

application of computers at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, JTC may perhaps develop some "intelligent-type

factories", providing our  SMEs with e-commerce packages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we may look into the possibility of providing

intelligent-type bus service or intelligent-type MRT service  on

board buses or trains so that commuters could use the facilities

to  surf  the Internet or send e-mail on their way to office  or

returning home after work. Students could also make use of these

facilities to do their own work even before they reach home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to promote IT, we must promote it to

everybody.   Today,  in  Singapore, even  the  vegetable  seller

aunties  could  make use of the TV Teletext to check  their  4-D

winning  numbers.  Perhaps, in future, we can help the vegetable

seller   aunties   to   access  the   websites,    to   download

correspondence  course  materials  and  submit  their   homework

through  the Internet.  Some workers told me that if we want  to

encourage  everybody  to  use IT,  to  use  Internet,  the  most

effective method is to allow them to place their bets on 4-D  or

TOTO on-line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, our people hope that one day, our home can be a

"intelligent" home.  Even when we are working, we  can  remotely

control the appliances at home, for example, to cook rice,  bake

a  cake, etc.  So it will become an IT-type style of living.  We

must  let everybody possess the skills to use computers so  that

they  could  more  effectively  participate  in  all  these   IT

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: who should be overall in charge of all the IT

applications  in  Singapore?  If we want to provide  world-class

information service, like our airport and seaport, we must  have

a  world-class information infrastructure.  Take,  for  example,

our  "Information Super Highway" system.  It is  like  our  land

transport.  There must never be traffic jams along the  highway.

So  when  our  people surf the net from one website to  another,

they should  be  able  to  access the desired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>

website  within  three

seconds.   According to feedback from some users,  although  our

information  infrastructure  has attained  a  leading  standard,

sometimes  we still need  to wait 20 to 30 seconds  to  go  into

certain  websites  in  Singapore.  There  are  frequent  traffic

congestions.   We  must  constantly  monitor  and  upgrade   our

facilities  so  that our people will not have to waste  precious

time  waiting for the congestion to clear.  So, which Government

authority  should be in charge or be responsible to ensure  that

there is no traffic jam, and when traffic congestion appears  to

be  building  up, to  upgrade our information infrastructure  to

clear the jam?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also set up new indexes and some means to measure the

level  of  application  of IT in Singapore.   For  example,  the

Lianhe  Zaobao website has more than 30 million hits per  month.

Apart  from people in Singapore, there are also people from  all

over the world who browse and visit the Lianhe Zaobao site.   So

with  more  people  accessing  our Lianhe  Zaobao  website,  the

newspaper's  status  would  go up  and  it  would  attract  more

advertisements,  and  hence  more  revenue!   With  more  people

accessing the Singapore websites, the status of our nation  will

also  go up and our economy will be stronger.  We should perhaps

set  up  a  certain  target  to measure  how  many  websites  in

Singapore has received more than 20 million visits per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the Ministry of Education, MOM, MTI, MITA,

Ministry  of Communications, MND, are all developing  their  own

plans  to promote the use of IT.  I feel very strongly  that  we

should  have a Ministry to coordinate all these activities.   At

the moment, every Ministry is carrying out activities to develop

their  IT  applications,  using the guidelines  issued  by  NCB.

However,  there  should  be more practical  guidelines  to  keep

abreast of the times. For example, I know of a civil servant who

took  his  children to Funan Centre to buy a Pentium  III.  But,

back in his office in a Government department,  the computer  on

his  desk  is  just  a  486.  If you go to  Funan  Centre,   the

shopkeepers there will tell you 486 is so far obsolete  that  it

has become

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

extinct in Funan Centre,  but this 486 is still very much  alive

on the office desk of this poor civil servant.  This is no good.

We  should  have some plans to upgrade and replace our computers

in the Government offices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our computer is no longer just a computer. It is a bridge or a

window for our people to have a lifelong learning process or  it

may  even set new policy and direction.  We should set a  target

of,  say,  once  in   every three years,  we  must  replace  the

computers  in our Government offices.  Although this  may  incur

some heavy expenditure, it just cannot be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have a centralised Ministry to be overall in charge and

coordinate  the  replacement of computers in all the  Government

departments, community clubs, community centres and the People's

Association, our civil servants and public officers   will  have

their  computers  replaced, from time to time, with  the  latest

models  and the best capabilities available, it would  certainly

enhance their productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when not many families have computers at home, the

Government used various channels such as the community  centres,

RC  centres,  etc.  to  promote the use of computers  by  making

available  the  facilities  in  their  computer  rooms  to   the

residents.  Five years from now, when almost every family has  a

computer  at home, the CCs and RCs should equip themselves  with

more  high-end  computers  that an  ordinary  family  could  not

afford.   Only then can we attract a new generation of residents

to  come  forward  and  make use of the latest  technology.   We

should  have a Ministry to be overall in charge, to provide  the

budget and to monitor and supervise such projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that when the computer

was  just  an  apparatus for doing calculation, we  had  already

established  the  National Computer Board  to  actively  promote

computerisation.  So now when IT has become the security for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

survival,  should  we not upgrade NCB, TAS, SBA,  etc;,  related

organisations, to become a centralised ministry like a  Ministry

of  IT  Power  to  be  overall in charge of all  aspects  of  IT

applications  in  Singapore?  I hope  my  suggestions  would  be

seriously considered by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, at no

other  time than in the midst of an economic crisis do  we  feel

most  strongly the bond of citizenship that ties us together  as

one   community,  one  nation,  as  Singaporeans.   Through  the

economic and political uncertainties in the region, hardship due

to  retrenchments and reduction in income, and the sheer grit to

be   on  top  of  the  challenges  and  to  stay  ahead  of  our

competitors, I believe Singaporeans have become closer together.

While  the feeling is that the people have become closer to  the

Government, their expectation of the Government has also  grown.

We  begin  to demand much more from the Government than  we  did

when  the economy was booming and growing, when times were good.

So,  in good times people expect a lot from the Government,  and

in bad times, perhaps a lot more.  Perhaps this is expected of a

good  Government,  which means so much more  to  the  people  in

adversity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Government has indeed come through with several

schemes and programmes to assist those in economic difficulty  - to  help  our  people deal with the difficult situation.   These

schemes   and   programmes  comprise  outright   assistance   to

individuals  as  well as indirect assistance to keep  businesses

alive  in  Singapore,  through incentives  and  tax  cuts.   For

businesses, they are structurally well able to take advantage of

the  different  Government  programmes,  some  to  maintain   an

existence  until  good times come again, while others  take  the

opportunity to grow and generate more business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has not escaped the people that this Government

cares  for  them.  The tax rebate and the rebate on service  and

conservancy  charges  are  cases  in  point.   They  are  really

important at a time when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

our  workers have sacrificed in terms of wage and CPF cuts.  The

HDB heartlanders who may not pay income tax or pay little of it,

I believe, do appreciate the rebate on conservancy charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the Prime Minister and some speakers before

me  that  we must help and take care of each other in  times  of

difficulties.  To start with, the social safety net in Singapore

has  been excellent.  No one has been forced to be on the street

when  he  is  out  of  employment as  the  HDB  allows  mortgage

repayment  scheme that is sympathetic to them.  The children  of

such  workers would also not have to leave school as  there  are

assistance schemes for them to pay their school fees.  Those who

fall  sick  and  really cannot pay their hospitalisation  bills,

they  too  have  not been turned away just because  they  cannot

afford  it.   For individuals, especially the sole  breadwinners

affected  by  the  economic crisis,  ie,  those  who  have  been

retrenched, forced into bankruptcy or those who have  had  their

salaries  reduced, a comprehensive scheme of referral  and  help

would  assist  them  to  overcome the  tremendous  psychological

impact of these difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there are several different programmes devised by

the Government or community organisations, but the individual in

despair is usually likely not to know where or how to begin.  To

be  more  effective, organisations like the CDCs could create  a

one-stop  centre  with trained officers to  advise  and  counsel

those  adversely affected by the economic crisis, steering  them

towards  Government and community programmes which are available

and  suitable for their needs.  These officers could then  cater

to  the individual's specific needs as such a person has certain

problems  which are particular and peculiar to him or her.   For

union  members, there are less problems as our network of unions

has  schemes  to help members find alternative jobs  and  render

relief  assistance to the retrenched.  But only about a  quarter

of  our workers are union members, and in the larger context, we

should help our fellow Singaporeans in a more coordinated way.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our vision of a caring society, we need more than just

the  solutions to an individual's predicament.  We also need  to

provide  the  "doctor"  who  will bridge  the  gap  between  the

"disease"  and the "medicine".  We need a systemic  approach  to

the  situation rather than the laudable but ad-hoc actions.   We

should  have  officers in agencies like the CDCs, officers  with

the  heart  in  the  right places, to guide  and  advise  fellow

Singaporeans   who  have  lost  their  jobs   and   are   facing

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an employers' market, the individual is helpless in the

face of discrimination.  Discrimination, be it along the line of

race, gender or age, can become the root of contradiction to the

bonds of citizenship that I spoke about earlier.  When employers

fall  to temptation and take advantage of the present crisis  to

satisfy  their  prejudices against specific sectors  of  people,

then Singapore as a nation becomes a sham.  That is not what  we

aspire  for  Singapore.   Luckily,  this  is  not  a  widespread

practice.   I  do not think that we are seeing the worsening  of

this  situation.   But  when  jobs  are  more  scarce  and   the

retrenched take more time to get alternative jobs, such form  of

discrimination  becomes more glaring.  The  question  before  us

then  is:  should we legislate against discrimination as in  the

United States?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue against this. We do have in place

instruments   to   counter   outright   prejudices,   like   the

Presidential  Council  for  Minority  Rights.   Legislation   to

implement  the kinds of laws that enforce equal opportunity  can

be damaging to race relations which is already a sensitive issue

in   a  multi-ethnic  nation  like  Singapore.   This  kind   of

legislation  can  lead to the polarisation  of  society  through

confrontation  as  it dictates the correct  responses  with  the

likely  result of anger and cynicism.  The better path would  be

education and persuasion, that it is in the best interest of our

society and our nation when there is respect for age, for women,

for  those  who are handicapped and for people of  other  races.

This can and should be taught, especially in a still developing,

young society like Singapore.  I am glad that Government leaders

like Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, have spoken

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>

against  discriminatory practices at workplaces.  We  must  send

the  right  signals that discrimination along the line  of  age,

gender or race is also not acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must be provided with the necessary education

and  training  to  see  that  discrimination  in  any  form   is

detrimental to the refinement of our society.  We should make it

even  more possible for Singaporeans of different racial  groups

and social status to work with and support each other.  Our self-help  organisations should be provided with  the  incentives  to

open  the  doors  of their services to members of  other  ethnic

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should also try to ensure that what I

consider  as `manpower leakage' is reduced.  I am talking  about

drop-outs  from  our  education system.   Over  the  years,  our

education   system  is  designed  to  ensure  that   all   young

Singaporeans obtain a good basic education and skills  training.

At  a  time when we are worried about the vulnerability  of  our

older  workers  to  the structural changes of  our  economy,  we

cannot  afford  to see our young people wasting the  educational

and  training  opportunities open to them  in  our  schools  and

institutions.   Instead, we should push towards  greater  value-added performances by students and schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to go back to a point I made earlier about

how  people expect so much from the Government, both in good and

bad  times.  At a time when we are talking about re-skilling our

workers,  instead  of giving outright rebates,  should  not  the

Government consider giving away the goodies in the form that can

be used for skills training by our workers?  In short, we should

re-visit the idea of "skillsave" for workers along the same line

that we give Edusave to our students.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NMP Mr Gerard Ee had earlier said that while we help

our  people prepare for the future challenges, we must not  lose

sight  of  their current difficulties.  I would like to  take  a

look  at  the other side of the coin.  The point I am making  is

that  while  we  earnestly  help the needy  in  these  times  of

difficulties,  we must not lose sight of the long-term  problems

and  challenges facing our economy.  We must help  our  old  and

young  Singaporeans to re-tool themselves with the  skills  that

are  relevant for the future.  This is in their own interest and

in the interest of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the raising of these issues is fundamental to the

kind of society we wish to progress towards.  It is perhaps  the

silver  lining in the economic recession that we are faced  with

today  when  such issues come into sharper focus and we  realise

the need to address them to advance.
