<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Second Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Question [5th September],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His

Excellency the Governor for his Address  delivered

on  Wednesday,  29th August, 1956."  - (The  Chief Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I was saying

yesterday that the Rent Control Ordinance,  as  it

stands  at  the  moment, does not afford  adequate

protection  to  the  farmers  who  are  termed  as

squatters.  Sir, I am aware that  this  is  not  a

debate on the Rent Control Ordinance but I thought

perhaps  it would be a good thing if I dealt  with

the question of exploitation which is prevalent in

Singapore and which is referred to in paragraph  7

of the Governor's Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to the state of housing development in

the  rural  areas, many of the farmers  are  being

exploited  by the landlords. They say  that  these

farmers are not tenants. They are only allowed  to

stay  on their lands and if the landlords want  to

get rid of them, they are at liberty to do so. The

Rent  Control Ordinance has not been very  helpful

in this respect. The Rent Control Ordinance is not

applicable  to houses that have been  built  after

1947,  and  even in respect of those houses  built

prior  to 1947, the landlords could evict them  by

giving   them  one  year's  notice,  or  if   they

(landlords) have plans of a new layout approved by

the  Singapore  Improvement Trust  or  a  building

authority, they can get these tenants out.  It  is

true,  Sir,  that the courts are given  a  certain

amount of discretion in the matter, but as  I  see

it, the courts themselves are completely helpless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manner in which dealings take place

between  the  landlord  and  the  tenant  is  very

peculiar.  I  have here a bundle of notices  which

have   been   issued  to  squatters  in   my   own

constituency. The improvements that have been made

on  the  land  by  the tenant also arouse  serious

difficulty for the tenant. For the information  of

this  Assembly, Sir,I shall read out the type  of

letters  which,  written in a  most  reprehensible

way,  are being sent out to the occupiers of land.

I  will not mention the name of the landlord,  nor

am  I willing to give the name of the tenant.  The

letter says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This letter serves to inform you that the

company now requires to use this land and you  are

requested to remove the crops and trees  from  the

area.  If  you fail to do so, the said  crops  and

trees will be destroyed."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  efforts have been made in the  past  by  the

landlords   to  bulldoze  the  crops  and   trees,

irrespective of whether or not the tenant  derives

his  income from these crops. Sir, it would appear

that  the Rent Control Ordinance does not  try  to

establish  the  necessary  relations  between  the

landlord  and the tenant. It appears  to  me  that

this   Ordinance  was  enacted  at  a  time   when

landlords  wanted to increase their rents  and  at

the  moment  it  helps  in this  way - that  if  the

landlord wishes to raise his rents, he can  do  so

under   certain  provisions  of  this   Ordinance.

Recovery of possession also appears to be  a  very

easy  matter these days. I would suggest that  the

relationship  between the tenant and the  landlord

should  receive  the immediate  attention  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think for a moment that any minor

amendments to the Rent Control Ordinance can solve

the  problem. What we need in Singapore  today  is

protection  for  the  tenants,  particularly   the

farmers  and  cultivators who are undergoing  this

hardship. I have been able to sort out some of the

difficulties  by the use of tact and diplomacy.  I

wonder  how long I can go on begging the  landlord

to have leniency shown to them. I think it is high

time  that the State steps in and introduces  some

legislation  specifying the  relationship  between

the landlord and the tenant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the land problem. In Singapore

today there are many "landlords" who hold 999-year

leases. I understand that 999-year leases  are  of

various  types.  There are some  which  are  given

purely  and simply for agricultural purposes,  and

if  the landlords holding this type of lease  want

to  make  use of the land for any other  purposes,

then  they  will have to approach  the  Crown  for

permission  to do so. There are, of  course,  very

many areas of land today which have been leased by

the  Crown  to  people on 999-year  leases.  These

people  have  been  paying  very  little  to   the

Government in the way of T.O.L. fees.

The  situation  now  is that these  landlords  are

selling their lands which belong to the people.

All these lands once belonged to the people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



they have been leased out to these landlords for a

specific purpose. Therefore, if a man has, say,  a

hundred acres of land on a 999-year lease  and  he

is not utilising it for agricultural purposes, the

land  must be reverted back to the Government  who

can  make use of it for the benefit of the people.

Sir,  it is time that an examination of all  these

999-year  leases be made and if the  land  is  not

being  made use of for the benefit of the  public,

then  it should revert back to the Crown. In  this

way  there will be a considerable extent  of  land

available to Government for public purposes,  such

as housing, and if the Government is unable to put

up  buildings on its own, then the land should  be

distributed to individuals who could put up  their

own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of T.O.L. land. Many years ago

people  approached the Government  for  pieces  of

land  and  the  position today is that  there  are

people  holding  more than 40 acres  of  land  for

their  own purposes and on that land are  hundreds

of  people  who  are paying rents  to  the  T.O.L.

holders.   I   think   the   position   is    very

unsatisfactory. I also suggest that a revision  of

all  T.O.L. land  be made and that  the  land  be

allotted  to the people according to their  needs.

If a person has ten people in the family, then the

land  allotted to him should be in accordance with

that number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to turn now to rural housing. I

am  sure  the  Government has made an  honest  and

sincere   attempt   at  alleviating   the   living

conditions of the rural people. An example of that

is  the housing project in Bukit Panjang where the

Government intends to build low-cost houses. But I

think  more  improvements should be  made  in  the

rural areas. It strikes me as curious that whereas

the Government is making an effort to build houses

in  order  to  clear slums in  the  city  area,  a

corresponding effort to help farmers and fishermen

in the rural areas is absent. Sir, I am not saying

this  as  a criticism of the Government but  I  am

just  placing these proposals before the  Assembly

so  that  at  a  later date they can be  examined.

There  are thousands of old houses - houses 30 years

old - in  the  rural areas belonging to the  farmers

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



fishermen. These people cannot possibly find money

to repair and keep them in good condition, and the

Government  is unable to help them. I think,  Sir,

in  the interests of farming and fishing, we  must

do something more to help these people earn a good

living. The Government should consider giving them

outright  grants to help them repair and  maintain

their houses in good condition, so that they could

live   a  decent  life  and  do  their  work  more

efficiently.   This   would   help   to   increase

production and create a happy state of affairs for

all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another subject that I would like to touch upon

is  the  question  of poultry inoculation  in  the

rural areas. Representations were made to me a few

days ago asking whether I could do something about

this  proposition. At the moment, farmers  in  the

rural areas find it extremely difficult to come to

town  and  inoculate their poultry.  It  has  been

suggested  to me that a new system may be  adopted

by   Government;  of  licensing  all   large-scale

poultry  farmers and supplying them with  vaccines

at  reasonable cost, so that they themselves could

inoculate   their   own   livestock    at    their

convenience.  It is very difficult these  days  to

bring poultry 6 or 7 miles away in the rural areas

to  a  centre in town, queue up and wait for  your

poultry to be inoculated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another aspect of the rural problem

that  I wish to place before this Assembly.  There

are  various development schemes which  have  been

undertaken  by  the Government and which  hitherto

have  not brought any results. We hope that  these

development   schemes,   efforts   by   individual

departments,  could be co-ordinated so  that  there

would be more efficiency. I am thinking of a Rural

Development Council under the chairmanship of  the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and Housing,

the members of

this  Council  to  be drawn from  the  departments

concerned,   such   as   Agriculture,   Fisheries,

Education,  the  City Council, District  Councils,

the  Singapore Improvement Trust and so  on.  Sir,

the  rural  problem may look curious, but  if  you

analyse  it,  you will find that it  can  only  be

solved if there is more coordination among the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



various departments of the Government. I feel sure

that  Government will examine this problem in  the

light of what I have said and set up machinery  to

expedite rural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to touch upon a subject

which  at first I thought I should not do,  but  I

felt  I  would be failing in my duty if I did  not

bring  it to the notice of this Assembly. So  much

has  been said about multi-lingualism in Singapore

and the formulation of an educational system which

will   nurse  all  languages.  There  are  English

secondary schools, Chinese high schools and  there

are  proposals for Malay secondary schools. But  I

do  not  know whether I am correct in saying  that

there  is  no  Government proposal to establish  a

Tamil secondary school. As we all know, there is a

Chair in the University of Malaya for Tamil and at

the  moment  there is a very wide gap between  the

primary  Tamil school and the University.  I  hope

and believe this gap will be bridged by Government

building some Tamil secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is this question of Singapore's unity

with  the Federation. At first I thought I  should

not  touch on this subject but I now feel  that  I

should  have  a  crack at it. Much has  been  said

about Singapore's unity with the Federation and  I

look  at  the problem this way. We must,  at  this

transitional   period   of   our   own   political

development and the political development that  is

going on outside Singapore, exercise tolerance and

diplomacy of the highest order. If we believe that

we  can  shape  the political destiny  of  another

territory  by exhortation from our own  plane,  we

will  find  great  difficulty  in  adjusting   our

differences later on. I would crave the indulgence

of  this  House  and ask it to  accept  the  Chief

Minister's  way  of approach for  unity  with  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another problem, the question of

external  relations with countries like Australia,

Britain  and  the United States. I  believe,  Sir,

that  an  external affairs policy  depends  on  a

sound   internal   policy  and   again   at   this

transitional  period  we  must  develop  tolerance

within   our  own  territory.  It  may   be   that

unknowingly  we  might have  a  student  theme  on

foreign policy, but then we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



are not writing a political thesis in order to get

a  political diploma. I do hope that  in  all  our

endeavours  to work out a foreign policy  we  will

not  forget our own home first. This is an era  of

international  politics.  This  is   an   era   of

international  co-operation,  and   I   hope   the

Assembly will shape a foreign policy based on  our

own internal policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, yesterday in introducing his motion the Chief

Minister  asked for criticism and particularly  in

two  speeches,  those of the Member for  Serangoon

and  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar, he got  what

he  asked  for. The points made by the Member  for

Serangoon  were  brushed aside by the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar as so many trivialities.  Then  the

hon.   Member   proceeded  to  deal   at   length,

especially  at length, with the inadequacies,  the

inanities,  the omissions and the generalities  of

His Excellency the Governor's Address. Sir, no one

could accuse the Member for Tanjong Pagar of being

a   dull   speaker  and  he  is  frequently   very

entertaining  indeed, though, of course,  some  of

us,  as  we grow accustomed to his forensic style,

are  perhaps not quite so impressed by what he has

to  say  as  we were in the earlier  days  of  the

Assembly.  Yesterday he ran very true to  form.  I

expected  him to lick his chops over the situation

in Suez and was not disappointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amused at his succinct definition of

"Independent"  as seen through  the  eyes  of  the

Chinese,  and  I am sure he could produce  a  much

funnier one for the nominated Independents, but  I

would rather not hear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had previously determined not to take part in

this  debate - "intervention" is the word the Member

for  Cairnhill  (Mr Marshall) called  it - but  you

will  recall,  Sir,  that  the  ex-Chief  Minister

promoted  me through a series of grades to  become

the  representative  of British  capital  in  this

Assembly,  and as capital was touched  on  several

times  yesterday  I  must,  of  course,  watch  my

interests.  The  Member for  Serangoon  said  that

there  had  been a considerable flight of  capital

from Singapore. In my view,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



the  reports  of flight of capital from  Singapore

have  been grossly exaggerated. It is, of  course,

true that there may be some people in this country

who have not the faith in its future that many  of

its  elected  Members have, but I can assure  hon.

Members  that  a great deal of the  capital  which

indeed has left this country in recent months  has

done  so  on  a temporary basis, seeking  to  take

advantage  of the capital markets in the  City  of

London  where  interest rates are  high.  This  is

quite a normal movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Tanjong Pagar told us how

worried  the heads of big business in London  were

about  the future of their capital stake  in  this

country. Well, they will be more worried  if  they

read the full text of his speech and if they think

his  Party is ever likely to come into power. Sir,

one  can  make anything sound silly by reading  it

aloud   rapidly,   laying   false   emphasis   and

dismissing the whole thing by chucking it  on  the

table and saying it is all balderdash. But I think

paragraph  4  of the Governor's Address  is  good,

especially  when it speaks of "a  need  to  import

capital  and,  consequently,  to  attract  foreign

investment". Does the People's Action Party  think

this is nonsense, or are they unable to dissociate

capital from colonialism? If you cannot produce or

create  sufficient capital for your needs  and  if

you  cannot raise it locally, you have  to  import

it.  The  goal of successful industrialisation  of

this  country is a long way off and all the  skill

and  technical know-how that would eventually help

to  create  capital would take time to  build  up.

Thereafter  local  industries  would  have  to  be

highly  competitive  to  compete  with  the   vast

concerns  of  Western Europe. This competition  is

actually  being experienced at this moment  and  I

think  the  Member  for Paya Lebar  had  something

yesterday   when  he  suggested,  I   think,   the

introduction of some modified form of  protection.

[Interruption.] It is interesting  to  note,  Sir,

that we heard the Member for Tanjong Pagar for 2½ hours  without interrupting him but he just cannot

keep quiet when others are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



speaking.  So I think, Sir, it is most injudicious

to  discourage the foreign investor with wild talk

of  what  will happen to the future of capital  in

Malaya.  What  in any case is wrong  with  capital

earning   dividends,  especially  when  Government

collects  30 per cent of the remitted  rewards  in

any case?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar's attack on the

Government   policy   as   delineated    in    His

Excellency's   Address   consisted   chiefly    in

complaining  of the absence of facts  and  figures

and  that it was all rather airy-fairy and  vague.

My  first reaction to the Address was that it  was

rather good, but since I listened to it being torn

to  bits I have come to the conclusion that it was

even  better,  I  think it was  rather  clever  of

Government to present it in the way they did, thus

preventing  the Opposition from indulging  in  any

specific  attack.  The Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar

complained  that there was nothing in it  that  he

could get his teeth into, or words to that effect.

In the circumstances, of course, he was obliged to

use the vehicle of ridicule, a vehicle, of course,

that can be all too easily over-loaded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I personally have no axe to grind, or

perhaps only a very tiny one, and I do not propose

to  comment in detail on His Excellency's  Address

which   one  journalist  of  international  repute

described as containing everything but the kitchen

sink!  I  think  perhaps it might have  been  more

apposite and topical if he had said, instead,  the

gas  cooker!  But may I, Sir, as  a  humdrum  bank

manager,  say  that paragraph 33  of  the  Address

strikes  the  right note? Unlike  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar who castigated Government for a lack

of   figures,  I  am  satisfied  that  Singapore's

finances are indeed in sound shape. Where there is

a  will, there is a way. If Government intends, as

it states, that nothing shall be done to shake the

confidence   and  the  stability  of   Singapore's

economy  and  currency, then the  Government  will

have the support of all ranks, from the daily wage-earners to the rubber barons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And the bankers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Naturally I am in between! Many

hon.  Members will have had the experience of  the

frightful things that can happen when you  have  a

debased  currency, for instance, in  the  Japanese

occupation.  I myself had that experience,  and  I

also  had  the  experience of seeing  the  Chinese

national    dollar   depreciate    in    geometric

progression in post-war China, and have  seen  the

peculiar  immorality  that  inflation  like   that

brings about. It is significant to note, Sir, that

two     currencies    survived    the     Japanese

holocaust - survived    intact,    both     colonial

currencies - the  Hongkong dollar  and  the  Straits

dollar, because they were backed 100 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, I do not intend to comment

in detail on His Excellency's Address. The leaders

of  the  two Opposition Parties have done so,  and

one  of  them complained of the paucity  of  facts

contained therein. If every paragraph were boosted

up  with  facts and figures to the extent desired,

it  would be as long as the Colony's Annual Report

and   goodness  knows  how  long  the   Opposition

speeches  would  have been; and if  the  group  of

Independents all gave it a detailed analysis, then

I  reckon that this sitting would last longer than

the Budget sitting!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return, Sir, for just a moment to the position

of  the  nominated Members. It is, after  all,  in

this  outmoded and anachronistic constitution,  as

indeed  in every other, the votes that count,  and

the votes of the nominated Members on this side of

the House could today have been of almost historic

importance.  In  the event, it would  appear  that

that  will not be necessary and that face will  be

saved all-round.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> What a shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> However, we are not Government

yes-men.  Even the ex-Chief Minister realised  that

when  he  hurled his invective at us, or commended

us  for our statesmanlike behaviour, depending  on

whether we opposed or supported his policy. For my

own  part,  I  vote  according  to  my  views  and

conscience and with due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

regard  for certain loyalties. I will be extremely

vocal  against Government should the situation  so

warrant,  a  privilege  denied  to  my  ex-officio

compatriots, bless their hearts!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, my view on the speed at which this

Colony  should proceed to self-government has  not

changed, but I am prepared to support this  motion

wholeheartedly and to give the Chief Minister  his

vote of confidence. One way of looking at it, Sir,

might  be -  and I do not mean it too  cynically - if

you  will permit the phrase, that the Labour Front

Coalition Government is the devil we know, a devil

whose demoniacal forces have been, to some extent,

modified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  see  that  the Government  attaches  much

importance  to the encouragement and expansion  of

agricultural  production and says, further  on  in

the  Governor's Address, that it will do this  and

do  that  to  help the farmers. That is  all  very

well,  but they can be promises that will  take  a

long time to fulfil. I think it would be very much

better  for the Government now to examine all  the

outstanding  grievances  and  hardships   of   the

farmers.  If  the  Government  really  intends  to

encourage  pig  breeding,  the  first  thing  they

should  do is to do away with the pig-sty  licence

fees.  The amount is small - only $6 a year - but  the

pig breeders consider that it is an imposition  to

restrict  pig  breeding.  That  is  one  of  their

grievances. Whenever they want to build or  repair

their  huts, they have had to undergo considerable

difficulty.  They cannot improve the condition  of

their  huts  by changing from attap to  corrugated

iron sheets. They find great difficulty in sending

for  their wives and children from China  to  help

them  on  their  farms. There  has  been  so  much

trouble   in   getting  their  pigs  and   poultry

inoculated. In many cases they complain that their

farmland  is too small. The 30-year lease  is  too

short.  Bad  roads give them a lot of trouble  and

affect their profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to their hardships. Last year an

epidemic of swine fever, or whatever it is called,

wiped out some $200,000 worth of pigs and piglings

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



my  division  alone. The farmers got  very  little

help  or  no  help  at  all  from  the  Veterinary

Department.  In 1954 the price of pigs  was  about

$90 per picul and the cost of bran was about $10 a

picul.  From  the beginning of 1955  down  to  the

present  day, the price of pigs has gone  down  to

$75 per picul but the cost of bran has gone up  to

$15 a picul. This imbalance in the prices, coupled

with the loss through the epidemic last year,  has

sent many farmers to the verge of bankruptcy. Pigs

and  fowls  are still dying, although not  at  the

same  alarming rate as last year's. I  think  very

soon  we may have a shortage of local pork  if  no

action is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of fishermen, the hardest hit are the

Malay  fishermen  living  along  the  Straits   of

Johore, due to the curfew. These people are in  my

division.  Even in the pre-curfew days they  could

hardly  make ends meet. What is their  plight  now

without  the  means of fishing in the  Straits  of

Johore?  I hope Government will quickly look  into

the  matter,  and if my services are  required,  I

shall be only too glad to help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, throughout the 62 paragraphs of

the  Governor's Address, there is  no  mention  of

electricity,  one  of the essential  services  for

mankind.  I hope that the Government has plans  to

supply  electricity as widely as possible  to  the

rural   areas   and  that  it  was  only   through

inadvertence that it was not incorporated  in  the

Governor's Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I hope that the points I have brought out

about  pigs  and  fowls dying, the  high  cost  of

animal  feed, fishermen in dire straits,  are  not

petty  things, and if the Member for Tanjong Pagar

thinks  they  are,  I  invite  him  to  tell   his

constituents about them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of all I have said, I

wholeheartedly support the Government policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

His Excellency's Address just happened to draw our

attention  to  the fact that Government  has  been

paying  only lip service during the last 17 months

particularly  to the urgent need to stimulate  the

entrepot  trade of Singapore with our  neighbours,

Indonesia and the Federation of Malaya.  Well,  we

have seen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



what had happened before to the last trade mission

to   Indonesia.  After  a  lot  of   fanfare   and

publicity,  the Marshall led trade mission,  which

was  described by Labour Fronters as a  triumphant

one,  had  not produced a single concrete  result.

The  much-vaunted relaxations of  export  controls

from   Indonesia   of  rubber   slabs   have   not

materialised and instead of more rubber coming  in

from   Indonesia   to  feed  our  rubber   milling

industry, there is actually less import of  rubber

slabs.  The  beautiful dream of the  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government of providing more  work  for

the people in this industry has not been realised.

It  remains just a beautiful dream. There  is,  in

fact,  more  unemployment. The queue is increasing

every  day  and what has the new Labour  Coalition

Government  done during the last three  months  to

improve the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no influx of capital, no new industry

has  been  planned,  and there  is  a  diminishing

national  income.  What we were given  during  the

last  17  months were just promises and  mere  lip

service. And now Government recognises the need to

import  or attract capital, but is it just wishful

thinking  in  the light of what has  happened?  No

local  or  foreign capital will be attracted  here

unless   the  Government  can  produce  a  "stable

political climate", and gain the confidence of the

local or foreign investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of strikes, fanned by irresponsible

political  agitators and parasites,  and  with  no

leadership from the Government, all these are  not

likely   to   produce   the  desired   objectives.

Industries  cannot be established on  pious  hopes

and wishful thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would quote the remarks made

by  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, leader  of  the

People's Action Party, when he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No factory that has suffered a strike has shut

down. No factory has decreased its production when

a strike is resolved and the workers resume work."



<br><br>Of  this I can say the Member for Tanjong Pagar is

ignorant. I would ask him to go to his own unions,

the  P.A.P.-Ied  unions, and  check  up  what  has

happened  to  the Hume Industries,  the  Gim  Huat

granite quarries of Jurong, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



Cressonite Industries, the Singapore Cold Storage,

the  Mis-Sino  and  the bus  companies  after  the

settlement of the strikes. The collections of  the

bus  companies, after the settlement of  a  strike

last  year,  in which I was one of the  mediators,

have  dropped  considerably. Can  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar explain why he made those remarks?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party every now and then

shout, "We stand for freedom!" But in actual  fact

the People's Action Party stand for destruction. I

was  in England during the Merdeka talks and  many

times the ex-Chief Minister decided to accept  the

half  loaf which Britain had offered us,  but  the

leader of the People's Action Party was egging him

on and trying to ask him to demand the impossible,

and  therefore  the talks failed completely.  What

did  we get after all? Nothing. We returned empty-handed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does appear to me that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  is  all the while trying to do  his  worst,

particularly when he yesterday tried to decry  the

good  work  of  my hon. Friend and  Colleague  the

Member for Serangoon behind the smokescreen  of  a

pseudo-Merdeka   which  the   P.A.P. is   always

clamouring for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has indicated that the people are

being encouraged to establish community centres on

their own initiative. The present practice of  the

Government  is  to run and staff  these  community

centres entirely by paid members of the Department

of  Social  Welfare, and presumably by members  of

the Labour Front Party, with the assistance of -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Hon. Members must not make

any imputations in their speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Will the

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare  see  that  this

situation  is put right immediately, that  is,  in

accordance   with   the  policy   laid   down   by

Government - that community centres must be  solely

run  by  people  on  their  own  initiative,  duly

assisted  by  paid  staff from the  Department  of

Social Welfare as and when necessary?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I must warn the Government that if

they  display  the  same  kind  of  weakness   and

confusion  and, in some respects, the incompetence

as  they did during the last 17 months, they  will

seek  in vain when they want our backing for their

policy,  but  instead  will  encounter  the   most

vigorous and sustained attack.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  I  would  like to congratulate  one  of  my

oldest  colleagues  in the Singapore  Legislature,

the  Member  for Havelock (Mr Lim Yew Hock),  who

has  attained the highest position in this  Colony

as  Chief Minister. Whilst congratulating  him,  I

must  say that I came prepared yesterday  to  vote

against  his motion as a matter of principle,  but

his   speech  completely  disarmed  me   and   the

assurance which he has given that he will continue

with  his  London  talks in the  near  future  has

changed my mind and I am voting for his motion. On

the  other hand, Sir, the inaugural Address of His

Excellency the Governor given on 29th August  does

not inspire much confidence when it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...continuity of policy and its plans for the

future  are  linked with the achievements  of  the

past 17 months."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those achievements, Sir? 265 strikes of

which the ex-Chief Minister was very proud. Riots.

These things have completely shattered the economy

of  this  little island. If that policy is  to  be

continued, certainly I disagree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday the Hon. the Chief Minister said

that  one  Member always reminded him  during  the

First  Session about a minority of elected Members

running the Government. I did so on principle, and

I  do  so now on principle too. As one of the most

senior Members in the Singapore Legislature  after

the  war  from the B.M.A. period, serving  on  the

Advisory Council, the Legislative Council and  now

the  Legislative  Assembly, I  think  I  am  in  a

position to say a few words on the history of  the

past  Legislatures. I am talking only of the post-war  period. There were only official Members  and

nominated Members. Then in 1948 we had six elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



Members.  The  Government was run by  an  official

majority.  Then  later  on  we  had  nine  elected

Members  and four nominated Members and the  world

was  told by the colonial power that here  was  an

unofficial   majority.  But  the  four   nominated

Members  frustrated whatever the  elected  Members

would like to carry through. That was the Colonial

Office policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have gone further forward. We have 25

elected Members, four nominated Members and  three

ex-officio Members. But what is the use  of  those

25 elected Members if the voice of the majority of

the elected Members is frustrated by the three ex-officios and the four nominated Members? It is  no

use having this constitution. It is a question  of

principle, therefore, when I say if any  Party  or

any Independent Member wants to form a government,

let  him do so, but there should be a majority  of

elected  Members on the Government side.  That  is

quite logical. As I have said, it is no use having

25 elected Members in this Assembly when the voice

of  the  elected majority can be frustrated.  But,

Sir,   I   am  willing  to  support  the   present

Government,  whose term of office  is  very  short

because  it is a caretaker Government  and  is  in

office only for the purpose of carrying on further

negotiations in the Merdeka talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to His Excellency's Address, the emphasis

is  laid on trade. This small island is prosperous

and  I hope it will remain prosperous, because  it

only depends on trade. It has no natural resources

of its own. I challenge anyone who can say it has.

Rubber  and  tin  are  not  ours;  they  are   the

Federation's. Singapore produces nothing.  How  is

its  population of a million and a quarter  people

going  to  exist?  We are simply existing  on  the

entrepot  trade. First, I will deal with  exports.

We  get  goods  from neighbouring  countries,  and

these we grade and re-export. We live on that. Our

labour  lives on that. Our capital lives on  that.

In  the  case  of  imports, we  get  imports  from

various manufacturing countries and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



redistribute  them to the neighbouring  countries.

We  get handling charges. The middle man gets  his

commission. We exist on that. But can we  do  this

always? We can only do this if our cost of  living

is  cheaper,  our  wages  are  lower  and  we  are

satisfied  with lower profits. Then we can  exist,

otherwise God alone knows what will happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we require foreign capital.

Countries like India, Indonesia and Ceylon  always

ask   for  foreign  capital  investment  and  they

encourage it. When we say that we will nationalise

our  industry, the question arises:  What  can  we

nationalise in this small city? Where are we going

to  get  our materials from? How are we  going  to

finance it? We are too small for it. When you talk

of  the  big  countries, you must  remember  these

factors - that   they  have   their   own   natural

resources;  they have their own backing.  We  have

none of these things. Only a stable government can

inspire  confidence, and only that confidence  can

attract foreign capital over here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to the fostering of our small-scale industries and cottage handicrafts. If we

want  to help the little men, I would advise  that

we  get  experts  from E.C.A.F.E. to  teach  them

cottage  handicrafts and how  to  run  small-scale

industries; how to make use of women and children,

who   are   doing  nothing  at  home,  for   these

industries. The E.C.A.F.E. experts can teach  them

and  the Government can finance them, and not that

we  should  go  to their doorstep  and  give  them

money. As in other countries, we should have  here

a marketing board. The people running these small-scale industries can deposit their wares with  the

marketing board and draw an advance against  their

deposit, and when their wares are all sold,  their

accounts  can  be  settled. In this  way  you  can

utilise  the  women  and children  who  are  doing

nothing at home, and possibly the children may  be

kept out of mischief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you cannot compare our economy with that of

Hongkong.  It is definitely wrong. We are  not  in

the same position as Hongkong is. Hongkong depends

on China. The 500 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



population  of  China buy from  Hong-kong  because

they  cannot  get  their  goods  direct  from  the

producing and manufacturing countries, due to  the

sanctions  imposed by the other powers.  Hongkong,

being  a  free port and a free market, can  import

and export. Singapore has no such hinterland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cheap labour, how are you

going   to   compete  in  production  with   other

countries  when you have to import  raw  materials

from  outside? If you have to pay high  wages,  if

you  have to make large profits, how on earth  can

you compete with goods manufactured outside? It is

impossible.  What I would suggest is  this:  Bring

down the cost of living; pay adequate wages to the

workers;  bring down your profits. Only  then  can

you  compete  with other producing countries.  But

once  you impose protective tariffs, you will lose

your  principle of free trade. You  will  have  to

have  controls.  You will have to have  inspectors

and  godowns, and the people buying the same goods

will  have to pay higher prices for them.  Such  a

line  of  action will not be to your benefit,  and

the  Government should put forward suggestions  to

consider  this problem. The advice  of  the  Trade

Advisory Council will be very helpful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, His Excellency touched on the question of

forming a regular battalion. For a small city like

Singapore  I  think a small army, drawn  from  the

local-born, is sufficient. It can be used in  case

of  an  emergency and it can be  of  help  to  the

police  in case of internal trouble, but  I  would

not  advise  having a big army in the  present-day

world.  It  is useless. We cannot stand alone.  We

can   only   live  in  co-existence   with   other

countries,   or  we  can  adopt   the   maxim   of

Panchsheela. What we really need is an Air  Force.

We had our experience when Japanese wooden bombers

attacked  us and we were quite helpless  then.  An

Air  Force might probably be the answer,  and  the

people  could be trained as anti-aircraft  gunners

or in other duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to Malayanisation, I moved a

motion  on  that subject in 1953  and  an  ad  hoc

committee was appointed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



But  the  committee report went into cold storage.

Then we had the Majority Committee's Report and we

have heard nothing about it up to now. I hope that

Report will be debated in this Assembly, no matter

what  the  outcome maybe. But, Sir,  what  is  the

reason  for  Malayanisation? It  is  to  stop  the

payment of high salaries from our revenue  to  the

expatriates.  I  do not blame the expatriates  for

drawing  high  salaries. Why should they  come  to

this  country,  leaving  their  hearth  and  their

homes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Because they could not get a job.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Please allow me to go on. The

reason is that they have to run two homes - one here

and  one  in their own country, maybe in  England,

India,  Ceylon or somewhere else, or  even  China.

They send their children back to their own country

for  education.  That is possibly  why  they  want

higher wages. But my idea of having Malayanisation

is this. We employ local men -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And save money.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> - and save money by paying lower

salaries,   not   the  high   salaries   paid   to

expatriates.  When  we  can  live  on  a   certain

standard,  I  think salaries must be  adjusted  to

that level, not only of the administrative service

but  also of the Ministers. Take the Ministers  of

other  countries. They help their own  country  by

not  building  their  own capital  out, of  their

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any government will put up very nice schemes

for  the welfare of the State. This Government has

done so. I do not blame it. But where is the money

coming   from?   His  Excellency  has   given   an

indication, but that also has its limits. We  want

foreign  capital  investment  but  if  we  tax  it

severely,  it  may want to find  other  places  to

invest.  If that happens, who is going to  suffer?

The workers. Where are they to go to? China, India

or  Indonesia? I think Government should plan very

carefully the taxation system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my good friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar

dwelt  for  two hours on His Excellency's  Address

and  he  said it was all wishy-washy. I  do  agree

that  a  part of it is wishy-washy. But  I  think,

like  a  good lawyer, he went through it  only  in

order  to  bring up his own points. Of course,  he

was  not  stopped. I do not know  why  on  foreign

policy  he  did not bring in Gibraltar,  Malta  or

Aden.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Next time.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Possibly he was afraid that if

this  beautiful island of Singapore  did  not  get

Merdeka, it might be internationalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before this Assembly was constituted, nearly

55  per cent of the colony's revenue went into the

administrative service; in such a small city  like

Singapore.  After  this new Government  came  into

power  in  1955,  you have to add  the  Ministers'

salaries, the Assistant Ministers' salaries, their

travelling  expenses, cocktail  parties  and  what

not.  Sir,  the  first duty of a government  which

wants   benefit  for  the  country  is  to  reduce

expenditure and practise economy itself. Then only

can  we live within our revenue. But as it is,  55

per cent or nearly 60 per cent is shocking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hansard will take note that the Hon. the Chief

Minister  has  said  that the Merdeka  talks  will

start  at  the earliest date possible. I  hope  he

will  not wait till next April. I am sure he  will

have  our  support. The serious way  in  which  he

spoke  about it has impressed us of his sincerity.

If  the Merdeka talks do not succeed, tear up  the

Rendel Constitution and send it back to England!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  I was young I learned the motto that silence

is golden and I decided to adopt that. But when  I

came to the meeting this morning, I was told by  a

Member  that  every Member should  say  something,

whether for good or for bad, as an allowance is being  paid  to every Member of this Assembly.  That

allowance is paid to a Member to speak  and  so  I

think  I  have to say something in order  to  draw

that allowance of $500 a month, or else I may  not

get it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard criticisms, whether constructive or

destructive I will not say, from some Members, and

bouquets  have also been offered to the Government

by  some Members. I can definitely understand  the

attitude of the P.A.P., because it has been  their

policy, whether for good or for bad, to attack the

Government  in order to maintain their own  policy

and to tell the people that they are always right,

even  if  they are wrong. But I cannot  understand

the   attitude  or  the  policy  of  the  Liberal-Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I do not think there is much

in  it.  The Member for Tiong Bahru and the Member

for  Serangoon  attacked the Government,  but  the

Member for Paya Lebar gave a lot of credit to  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Criticism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh, it was credit. I cannot

understand why. Sir, when the Governor opened  the

First  Session  of this Assembly,  I  remember  he

covered  a  little aspect of the question  of  the

civilian employees in the three Services. But when

I  went  through His Excellency's Address  at  the

opening  of  the  Second Session,  it  was  rather

surprising  that  nothing  on  this  subject   was

mentioned. Before this Assembly met, I tabled  two

questions regarding the Services' employees but  I

was  overruled by you because I was told it is not

within the purview of any Ministry.I do appreciate

that,  Sir.  But the Labour Front in its  election

manifesto  did include conditions of  service  for

the  civilian employees of the Armed Services.  At

that time, when I was still a Member of the Labour

Front  and  when the election manifesto was  drawn

up,  I  insisted that should the Party  come  into

power,  it  should  look into  the  conditions  of

service  of  the civilian employees of  the  three

Services. I had been in the Services myself and  I

do  know the sufferings of the civilian workers in

the  Services. It is not a question of whether  it

is  within the purview of any Ministry or not.  It

is   the  question  of  30,000  local  people   in

Singapore whose employment is at stake. If Merdeka

does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



come,  I  am sure that the Services will  withdraw

from  this  country  and go  back  to  the  United

Kingdom,  and when they do, these 30,000  civilian

employees  of  the  Army will  be  thrown  out  of

employment, is  the Government prepared  to  face

such a situation? What is the Government going  to

do  with  these 30,000 employees of the  Services?

They  will  be left unemployed and if  nothing  is

done  for  them, they will definitely go into  the

underworld  and  join the underground  forces,  or

they  may be forced into robbery or any other sort

of   vices  in  Singapore.  I  do  hope  that  the

Government will look into this matter as it is  of

the  greatest concern to this country, whether  it

is  within  any of the Ministries or not.  I  know

that  Singapore  cannot  over-rule  Her  Majesty's

Government's  policy,  because  the  pay  of   the

civilian workers comes from Her Majesty's Treasury

and  not from the Singapore Treasury; but they  do

contribute  a  certain  amount  in  taxes  to  the

colony.  Without these civilian workers, Singapore

would not have received the amount of revenue that

goes  to  the  Government Treasury.  If  they  are

merely employees of Her Majesty's Government, they

should pay tax to Her Majesty's Government in  the

United   Kingdom   and  not   to   the   Singapore

Government. It is a very serious matter and  I  do

hope  the Chief Minister will give it his  careful

and active consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to make, Sir, on the

Governor's  Address is the question  of  community

centres. From what I can see, there is only a very

small  paragraph - paragraph 12 - in  the  Address  on

community centres. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The building of community centres will be

accelerated  in  co-operation  with  the   numerous

groups who are already establishing or seeking  to

establish   community   centres   on   their   own

initiative."



<br><br>Apart  from this paragraph, I cannot see  anything

more  about  it. What is there in that  paragraph?

According to what I have been told previously, the

Government  will  encourage the  establishment  of

community  centres and will give every help.  Just

recently  the  Tiong  Bahru community  centre  was

closed down without rhyme or reason. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



was  no  specific reason given to the Tiong  Bahru

community centre why it should be closed down. The

only reason given was that it was in the interests

of  Government that it should be closed  down.  Is

that  encouraging the establishment  of  community

centres ?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, community centres were started by the

people  themselves without any Government support.

They  were  self-dependent.  The  maintenance   of

community  centres was the work of the members  of

the  public  or members of the estate  or  tenants

themselves. Government did not provide  any  grant

or  help at all to these centres. Recently  I  was

told  that  the  Government has asked  the  Social

Welfare  Department to step into such centres.  If

the Government wants the Social Welfare Department

to  step  into  such centres, then  by  all  means

provide some grant or some funds to them. But none

was provided. When these community centres started

about  four or five years ago, every one  of  them

was  on the verge of bankruptcy because the people

could  not  maintain  them. They  could  not  even

provide a caretaker for the premises. Then why ask

the  Social Welfare Department to step in and  say

that   community  centres  should  be  under   its

supervision?  I  think it is  entirely  wrong.  If

Government  intends to encourage the establishment

of  community centres, they should provide  grants

and  wardens  or officers to guide  them,  not  to

supervise   them.  At  one  time  there   was   an

enforcement by the S.I.T. that an S.I.T. official

should  sit  on  the committee of  such  community

centres.  What privilege does the S.I.T. give  to

these  centres? Nothing at all. And if nothing  is

given,   then  let  the  centres  run   themselves

independently without any supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Minister for Local Government, Lands

and  Housing has repeatedly promised, even  before

he  took  office, that he would reduce the rentals

of  S.I.T. houses. It is now 17 months  since  he

assumed  office  and instead of  the  rents  being

reduced,  they  have,  in  fact,  increased  three

times,  directly or indirectly. The  actual  rents

may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



have  been increased, but the water charges  have.

S.I.T. houses are supplied with block meters  and

the tenants are asked to pay, whether they consume

the   water   or  not,  a  flat  rate   on   water

consumption. That is most unfair, and in spite  of

the  protests made by the S.I.T. tenants,  nothing

has  been  done  by the Minister. What  about  his

promise  to reduce rentals of S.I.T. houses?  Most

of  the  tenants  are of the poor class,  not  the

rich.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> With motor-cars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Well, it is essential to have a

motor-car now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> A luxury.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I do not consider it a luxury,

but I consider it an essential service, because it

is  much cheaper to run a motor-car nowadays  than

to  go  by any other means of transport.  A  clerk

with a salary of $300 a month should possess a car

now  if he wants to have any savings on transport.

I  hope  that  the Minister will  look  into  this

matter  and  keep  his promise  to  reduce  S.I.T.

rentals.   It  is  no  use  making  promises   and

promises.  It  is no more an election  stunt.  The

election days are over now and there is no purpose

in  making  promises. Promises are made during  an

election  campaign  but they will  not  hold  good

after   the  candidates  are  elected.  Once   the

candidates  are  elected, the promises  should  be

made good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ex-member of the Labour Front, I should

oppose whatever the Party does on principle, since

I  have walked across the floor; but today, as Mr

Sutherland has said, I think I should support  the

Government because it is my personal opinion  that

the  policy  framed  by  it  in  His  Excellency's

Address  is  good.  In  its policy  statement  the

Government has shown that it has the interests  of

the  public  in mind and I will certainly  support

and  give  my vote of confidence to the Government

and the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion, but I wish to make  it

clear that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



I do not support the actual wording of the motion.

Sir,  I  am not a petty critic, nor am I qualified

for  a petty politician, but I wish to say that  I

am  a  simple  and  humble representative  of  the

people. I have gone through the Governor's Address

page  by  page and I wish to give my  comments  on

certain  paragraphs. I will start  with  paragraph

60, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first elected Government recognised that the

welfare  of the people of Singapore could best  be

served   by  the  early  attainment  of   complete

internal   self-government  and  union  with   the

Federation of Malaya and accordingly directed  its

efforts to achieving these ends."



<br><br>Sir, although that paragraph is simply worded,  it

covers  all the aspirations not only of the people

of  Singapore but the people in the Federation  as

well, and I hope the people in the Federation will

also  wholeheartedly support those  objectives.  I

say this because the gap between Singapore and the

Federation appears to be going wider and wider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to say something

about political developments in the Federation.  I

am  sure  everybody  was very happy  to  note  the

distribution of ministerial posts just  after  the

Federation  elections, because  it  looked  as  if

racial  harmony and prosperity were  assured.  But

the  position  changed after the question  of  jus

soli was raised. It changed to such an extent that

recently a statement was issued by the Ministry of

Education  in  the  Federation to  Chinese  school

students in the Federation to the effect that when

they   visited  Singapore, they  must  not  visit

certain schools, including two girls schools.  The

reason  given  was  to  avoid contacting  venereal

disease.  I,  for  one,  had  a  great  shock  and

although the incident was little mentioned in  the

English  papers, there was much concern among  the

Chinese   people.   I  sought  advice   from   our

parliamentary experts whether, as Assemblymen,  we

could  do  anything to clear up  this  unfortunate

matter,  but  I  was told that we must  treat  the

Federation as a foreign country and therefore  the

Singapore Assembly could not do anything at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must confess that that was the first time

I  found out that we are so widely separated  from

the  Federation  of Malaya. All this  time  I  was

under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



impression that only the causeway, not more than a

mile  long, separated us, especially having regard

to  the  fact that certain administrative services

were  so  closely connected. For example, we  have

just received a report from the Film Censor, a Pan-Malayan Government official, and we also know that

the Ministry of Fisheries has Pan-Malayan backing.

I  think that politically, geographically or  even

economically   we   cannot   legitimately   divide

Singapore and the Federation, and I hope that  the

gap  between our two territories will be  narrowed

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now touch on the Government's education policy

in paragraph 54, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...will ensure to every child the opportunity of

education in the language of the parents'  choice,

together with a second language which will  enable

him  to  communicate with his fellows of different

race."



<br><br>Sir, this appears to be a very sound and long-term

policy,  but  could  the  Minister  for  Education

assure us that the language of the parents' choice

will  be  fairly represented? I say  this  because

while  the  Government are going to build  schools

which  will  not be English schools,  the  English

language will be one of the media of instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time the Government has come to

recognise  the  importance  of  providing   higher

education for Chinese youths. Paragraph 41 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government appreciates the need of the

pupils  leaving the Chinese middle schools for  an

institution  of  higher  education  in  which   to

continue  their  studies, and the  enterprise  and

enthusiasm  which  brought the Nanyang  University

into being."



<br><br>I take off my hat to the Ministry of Education for

recognising  the need for such an  institution  of

higher learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on, the same paragraph says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government is therefore at all times ready

to help the Nanyang University."



<br><br>Sir,  I  wish to put forward a suggestion.  It  is

known  that among Chinese educational circles  the

Chinese Branch of the Teachers Training College is

not  popular or efficient. Now if the Ministry  of

Education  is really going to honour its  word  to

help  Nanyang University, then why should not  the

Ministry of Education have immediate contact  with

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



authorities of Nanyang University with the  object

of establishing a Chinese Normal Teachers Training

College right inside Nanyang University?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also put forward a second suggestion. We all

know  of  the  great shortage of  Malay  teachers,

especially Malay secondary school teachers, and  I

know  the  authorities of Nanyang  University  are

prepared to open a Malay language branch there.  I

therefore  suggest that the Ministry of  Education

consider  taking immediate action to make  use  of

Nanyang  University facilities to  provide  for  a

Malay language branch in the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the much discussed Government

policy  towards farmers and fishermen,  especially

towards the farmers. Paragraph 7 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The need to provide and to improve farming lands

is  accepted  and  the Government  will  give  its

consideration to measures aimed at giving  farmers

both   security   of  tenure  and   freedom   from

exploitation."



<br><br>The  Member for Seletar and the Member  for  Bukit

Panjang have fully pointed out the immediate needs

of  the farmers, especially the Member for Seletar

who said that new legislation should be introduced

to protect the farmers. I have personal experience

of  their problems. There is a small island  which

was  once occupied by more than 20 families.  They

had  lived  there  for generations  and  they  had

planted rubber and coconut trees. Not long ago the

ownership  of this island changed hands.  The  new

landlord  issued quit notices to all  the  farmers

and  the  farmers were prepared to quit, but  they

wanted  to  know  the terms of compensation.  They

wanted  to  know what was going to happen  to  the

rubber and coconut trees that their ancestors  and

they  had planted. But the landlord said, "I  have

only  received your annual rents. All  the  things

planted  in  the  ground belong to the  landlord."

Sir,  I  am  sure the hon. Members of  this  House

would  feel sympathy for such people who  have  to

suffer injustice. Therefore I believe that  it  is

essential to introduce new legislation to  protect

the  security  of  tenure of the  farmers  and  to

ensure them freedom from exploitation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang mentioned about

farmers  having  to get a permit before  they  are

allowed  to  change the roof of  their  huts  from

attap  to  zinc in order to comply with Government

regulations.  What  is  the  necessity  for  these

inconvenient regulations? These only open the  way

to  corruption. It is the experience of some  non-English  speaking farmers that whenever  they  are

visited  by a teh-gu (Land Office official),  they

must  give  him a "red packet" to satisfy  him.  I

therefore   think  these  regulations  should   be

revised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all the constructive policies laid

down   by   the  Government  in  His  Excellency's

Address, I said at the beginning of my speech that

I  could  not  support the actual wording  of  the

Chief  Minister's motion, but I support the motion

because I was moved by the Chief Minister's speech

yesterday when he asked us to treat his motion  as

a  vote  of confidence. I can explain all this  in

very   simple  words.  So  long  as   the   Rendel

Constitution exists, and so long as the  Hon. the

Chief   Secretary   (Mr  Goode)   is   good   and

influential,  then  I  feel  that  no  matter  how

constructive  are  the  proposals  that  are   put

forward from time to time, it will be hard for the

Assembly  to carry them through. So the first  and

foremost  desire  of  this country  is  the  early

achievement of Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the Gallery of this House, Sir.I do not

know whether it is because our chief actor is  now

in Peking, but anyway even when another celebrated

actor  appeared  yesterday, we still  had  a  poor

audience.   A   poor   audience   when   important

Government policy is being debated, when a vote of

confidence  is  involved! Where  is  the  Consular

Corps? Where is the public? We have reserved seats

for  them. They are not here. Why? It looks as  if

they  do not care to listen to an important debate

on Government policy. If I were not an Assemblyman

but  just an ordinary member of the public, I  too

would  be fed up coming to this Assembly  to  hear

nonsense,  listen to empty promises and  political

propaganda. The whole position is very  simple  to

understand.  It  has  always been  said  that  the

present  Government is no more  than  a  caretaker

Government, more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



especially when the Chief Minister yesterday  said

that  it  would not hold office up till 1959, and

that  if  the Merdeka talks to be held next  April

failed,  he  would  also follow his  predecessor's

example  and  quit office. It is for this  reason,

therefore,  that  I support the  Chief  Minister's

motion,  because  a vital issue is  at  stake  and

because  of the mighty call by our courageous  and

determined Chief Minister for Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I must say that we have enjoyed very much the

two-hour long analysis of His Excellency's Address

by the Member for Tanjong Pagar. The impression is

that  everybody thought he really took an interest

in   the   debate.  But  I  told   him   yesterday

straightaway,  "No, you make use of this  Assembly

to  state  your  P.A.P. platform." He  never  went

carefully through the Governor's Address.  Neither

did  he carefully study the present conditions  in

Singapore.  As the Member for Tiong Bahru  pointed

out  in  his speech, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

did  not know that so many factories had to  close

down due to the strikes. I would like to tell this

to his supporters: How can we expect a man to know

all  this when he lives in a nice bungalow  house;

who  works in an air-conditioned office; who  owns

and  rides in a beautiful American car; who  plays

golf  when he is free; who calls for beer when  he

is  thirsty; and who charges fees for professional

consultation  and  services?  And  this  kind   of

leader,  this  kind of champion  for  the  people,

tries  to  make use of the Assembly  as  his  best

propaganda  ground. But such a type of leader  and

such  a  kind  of  speech  only  brings  about  an

unhealthy situation which will be unfortunate  for

the   people  of  Singapore.  [Interruption.]  Mr

Speaker, Sir, if you will allow me. I do not  mind

to repeat it again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at these many pages of policy

statements,  it will all be an empty dream  if  we

cannot  achieve Merdeka. Now everything  has  been

accumulated into one single movement for  Merdeka.

And how can we achieve Merdeka? I do not think the

Chief  Minister is going to accept the  suggestion

put   forward   by  our - I  would  like   to   call

him - "dictator-designate",  that  is,  to  call   a

convention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



of  all  anti-colonial Parties in  order  to  plan

tactics  for  the  Merdeka talks.  [Interruption.] "Dictator".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I appreciate the excitement at

the moment, but the hon. Member must remember that

he is addressing the Chair, and the Chair only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do not get excited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, we have had experience of

such  people  and such leaders during the  Merdeka

talks  last April, which failed. How can we  trust

them,  whose motives and principles I  think  even

their  close  colleagues  cannot  understand?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if you will allow me to trace  back

all  the  speeches  delivered by  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, you will recollect  that  he  has

never appreciated any Member for doing any good to

the  country.  He has hissed at, joked  about  and

disgraced many Members, except those of his Party,

and yesterday he even went to the extent of trying

to  be  smart in Chinese. He explained that  a  Wu

tang wu pai (Independent) had no standing, but  he

forgot  that  one of his close friends,  who  sits

next  to  him, is also a Wu tang wu pai. You  will

remember,  Sir, that the Member for Sembawang  has

all  the time wholeheartedly supported him.  So  I

would  like to take this opportunity of  reminding

the Member for Tanjong Pagar that if he intends to

joke  about  me  or even try to  run  me  down  in

future,  he  should quickly enrol the  Member  for

Sembawang  as a P.A.P. member before he  comes  to

this  Assembly and disturbs any of the Independent

Members  here.  There may be some people  who  may

look  upon  this  as  a  personal  matter,  but  I

consider   this  as  a  stumbling-block   to   the

achievement of Merdeka, even a stumbling-block  to

a  merger  with the Federation. It is  unfortunate

that  the country produces such a leader who  says

that  the P.A.P. regards the policy stated in  the

Governor's  Address  as only blabber  without  any

facts.  Can  the  P.A.P. produce more  facts  than

this?  You  may  remember,  Sir,  that  the  Chief

Secretary is still good and influential!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



What  we  should  work for now  is  to  forge  all

Parties  together  into a  strong  unit.  But  the

policy  of  the P.A.P. is not so. They  run  every

Party  down.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar  wanted

the  Chief  Minister to call a convention  of  all

anti-colonial Parties. How could he when he called

members  of  the  Labour  Front  opportunists  and

members  of  the Liberal-Socialist Party  stooges?

That  would  leave the P.A.P. as  the  only  anti-colonial  Party,  led by Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew,  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

probably getting a little out of hand. I would ask

him  to  appreciate  that  this  is  a  debate  on

Government policy. I do not think there should  be

a tirade against the Member for Tanjong policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir,but I would

say  that although they do seem very personal,  my

remarks  are closely connected with the Government

policy   which   I  have  already   described   as

constructive; but without the achievement of  full

independence, we cannot do anything to  carry  out

that Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I explained at the last sitting of the

Assembly why I left the Liberal-Socialist Party. I

said  we  must realise that Singapore  is  just  a

small  island;  that  we depend  on  our  entrepot

trade:  that our industry is just equal  to  none;

that  we have no natural resources to support  us;

that  we  have communal grievances and  religions;

and  that,  in  addition, we have party  politics.

Sir,  I  do  not know who was the hon. Member  who

stated yesterday, "If you join my Party, I can  do

everything  for you." This is the  sort  of  thing

which  keeps  our people divided and  enables  the

colonial power to have a better chance to keep the

balance  of power, prolong the colonial  rule  and

delay  the early achievement of Merdeka. Therefore

I  cannot  help expressing my sincere and  fervent

desire  to  call upon all Parties  to  revive  the

Merdeka  Committee, which was set up  last  April,

and   try  to  sign  a  truce,  to  stop  nagging,

scolding, attacking and joking about one  another,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



to  concentrate on the Merdeka movement.  We  must

also  have faith in the Chief Minister. Today many

speakers  have expressed their faith in the  Chief

Minister,  so  let him carry on with  the  job  of

achieving Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook in Singapore today is very bright and

hopeful  and optimistic. First, we are all  agreed

on  a  common  issue - Merdeka.  Then,  all  Parties

believe  in Socialism. So what else can  keep  the

people  divided?  It  is  that  we  have  so  many

political Parties and so many differences. In this

connection,  I  think, if the  Chief  Minister  is

going  to  accept the proposal of the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar to call a convention of  the  anti-colonial Parties, only malice, jokes and fun  will

attend  such  a meeting. We have already  had  one

experience  of  what the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

can  do  when  he goes to London for  the  Merdeka

talks.  He  will  enrol more  students  as  P.A.P.

members. I am sure we cannot stop him from saying,

"Oh,  do not trust Mr Lim Yew Hock, the Hon. the

Chief Minister. He is no more than an opportunist.

And  how  can  you rely on the Liberal-Socialists?

They  go  behind  the scenes  and  talk  with  the

Colonial Office." So what is the use of a  Merdeka

delegation   again?   Let  us   follow   the   old

proverb - Once  bitten, twice  shy.  The  Government

must  not  fall  into the trap again.  I  suggest,

since  all Parties had agreed on certain heads  of

agreement  last  April, they should  be  asked  to

honour  the agreement which they had signed.  Then

the  Chief  Minister could go and see Mr  Lennox-Boyd and say, "Here is our minimum desire. If  you

accept  that, my Government can carry on. If  not,

I,  too,  will resign." We can make the  issue  so

simple that the people of Singapore can understand

it. It is not a question of high politics at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I should like to take this

opportunity of borrowing an expression used by one

celebrated  journalist, "Do not shoot the  pianist

before he begins to play." To this I would like to

add  one  more,  "Do  not make  Singapore  another

France  in the East." Therefore I beg all  Parties

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



support the motion of the Chief Minister,  and  we

wish  him  to  carry out his promise of  achieving

Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Chief Minister has asked that this motion

of  his - a  motion  of  thanks for  the  Governor's

Address - be treated as a vote of confidence in  his

Government. I shall give him full support, but not

because  I am terribly impressed by the Governor's

Address.  As  a  matter of fact,  I  was  terribly

depressed  when I heard it. Never have I  heard  a

more  uninspiring and unconvincing  collection  of

platitudes.  Nevertheless,  I  shall  support  the

Chief  Minister's motion since  he  has  given  an

assurance to this House that he intends to prepare

for  the resumption of the Merdeka talks and  that

he  intends  to press for full self-government.  I

hope  that  the  Chief Minister  and  his  elected

colleagues  on  the other side of the  House  will

take  all the necessary steps to ensure that  when

the  talks  are resumed next year, the  people  of

Singapore  will be in a position to negotiate  for

their rights from a position of strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many matters of importance are left out of the

Address. Nothing is said about the plans for  Malay

secondary  education, and the special position  of

the Malay language as the national language of the

country does not seem to be accepted as Government

policy. The Government must revise its attitude to

Malay education and to representations made by the

Malay Education Council. It must also clarify  its

attitude  towards  the  status  of  Malay  as  the

national language of our country if it wants to be

regarded  as  a  truly  national  government.  Lip

service  to the cause of Malay education  must  be

replaced  by  concrete and practical encouragement

to   the   development  of  the  Malay   language,

education and culture. I fully support the  motion

of  the  Chief Tanjong Pagar that Malay should  be

introduced as a compulsory second language in  all

non-Malay schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of compensation to farmers who

occupy Crown land is accepted in the Report of the

Land Clearance and Resettlement Committee which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



submitted  its Report recently. But  evictions  do

not  take  place only from Crown land. People  are

also  often evicted from private holdings. If  the

principle of compensation for eviction from  Crown

land is accepted as right, then the same principle

must  be applied to eviction from private holdings

too.  For  this,  amendments to the  Rent  Control

Ordinance   are   necessary.  I  hope   that   the

Government will consider this matter at  an  early

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further hope that the recommendations made by

the  Land  Clearance  and  Resettlement  Committee

regarding   the  grant  of  leases  to  productive

occupants   of   Crown  land   will   be   quickly

implemented by the Government. Security of  tenure

is,  in  fact, the most pressing problem faced  by

farmers and this has to be given to them quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Address says nothing about the 30,000

locally  recruited employees of the Armed Services

in  Singapore. What step does the Government  have

in  mind to ensure that these employees will enjoy

all  the  benefits  of  local  social  and  labour

legislation  by operation of law?  It  is  clearly

inconsistent  with the dignity of  the  people  of

Singapore  that  any part of Singapore  should  be

outside   the   purview  of  social   and   labour

legislation  and possess extra-territorial  rights

in these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar, with his usual  effervescence

and  flow  of oratory, tried to make out that  the

Government   policy,   as   enunciated   in    His

Excellency's   Address  to  this   Assembly,   was

ineffective and feeble. Sir, he reminded  me  very

much of a gushing mountain torrent, supreme in its

confidence - sometimes  touching  to  the  point  of

arrogance in its confidence - that it will  be  able

to  sweep  all  obstacles in its path.  The  fact,

however, that the torrent does make a lot of noise

is incidental. Not even the impetuous force of his

mighty oratorial powers could sweep away the basic

points in His Excellency's Address that stood  out

like rocks on solid foundations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you refer to the Governor's Address, you

will  find that it is full of principles that  the

Government recognises, policy statements  outlined

by   the   Government,  and  promises   that   the

Government makes to the people of Singapore.  Take

the  first  page, for instance. You will  find  in

paragraph  2 that "the Government stands  for  the

early   attainment  of  complete  internal   self-government". That is a policy statement. There  is

no doubt about it. The word "stands" is operative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take paragraph 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Government will take every opportunity of

continuing  to  explore  trade  possibilities  and

promote sound trading relationships."



<br><br>That  is  a  promise,  and  a  promise  that   the

Government will faithfully carry out, as  much  as

is possible within its power to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will also promote the expansion

of existing industries...".



<br><br>That again is a promise by the Government. In  the

same paragraph you will find:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is recognised, however, that there is a need

to import capital...".



<br><br>That  is a recognition of principle. You will find

all  over  in  the  Address that the  three  basic

things   that   are  outstanding  are   that   the

Government   recognises  certain  principles;   it

outlines  certain policies which it  will  pursue;

and  it  makes certain promises to the  people  of

Singapore. Sir, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  in

spite  of  these  clear-cut statements,  described

them in his usual fluent oratory as "catalogues of

administrative   matters   stuck   together   with

platitudes,  fluff  and empty exhortations,  pious

protestations and platitudes". Sir, he  asked  two

questions:  Why  the Government  policy  statement

does  not say how the Government is going to carry

out  certain  things, and when the  Government  is

going  to do so. Sir, how the Government is  going

to  do  a  certain  thing  is  a  matter  for  the

Government  to decide. It is a detail which  I  am

sure  it  is  not proper to bother  this  Assembly

about.  But  if the method by which the Government

carries out its policy is repugnant or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



not  acceptable  to the Members of  the  Assembly,

then  it is up to them to criticise the method  if

and  when  the Government brings it up before  the

Assembly. The question of when the Government will

carry  out certain things depends very much  on  a

lot of factors. For instance, the availability  of

funds,  as  the Member for Telok Ayer pointed  out

very  ably.  If it is a matter of construction  of

buildings, schools, hospitals and so on, there are

physical limitations involved, such as the  labour

available,  the materials available, the  building

programme  of the P.W.D., and so on. If  it  is  a

matter  of  carrying out industrial policy,  there

are  other  and  bigger limitations involved.  For

instance,   there  is  the  matter   of   creating

confidence  which, incidentally,  no  one  in  his

right  senses can say has been created by  certain

events in the last 17 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon, the leader of the

Liberal-Socialist   Party,  yesterday   criticised

point  by  point  especially  the  industrial  and

economic section of His Excellency's Address. Most

of  his  criticisms were, of course,  unjustified.

Probably it was because he was not aware of a  lot

of things that the Government has done. But in his

usual  pedagogic way he wagged a reproving  finger

at  the  Government  Benches  and  said  that  the

Government lived on hopes. Sir, there was  nothing

new  that  he raised yesterday in his  speech.  In

fact,  most  of  the points he  raised  have  been

replied at one time or another by me in the Press,

but I will shortly make a reply to the points that

he  raised, one by one. However, before I come  to

that,  I  must  say that there are certain  things

that  a Member has got to take into consideration.

It  is  all  very well to strain at the leash  and

show an anxiety for getting things done. We on our

side  are  also  anxious to get things  done,  but

there  are certain limitations. For instance,  the

policy on industrial advancement cannot be brought

about   overnight.  The  policy  takes   time   to

formulate and after its formulation it takes  time

for it to be brought into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some disparaging remarks about the

Government not having been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



able  to  come to any good solution of the trading

relations with Indonesia and of the tariff problem

with   the  Federation  of  Malaya.  Members  must

realise  that  when  we  are  dealing  with  other

countries,  especially other sovereign States,  we

must  be careful what words we use. We do not want

to aggravate a situation which is not happy at the

moment.  Negotiations  have  got  to  take   time.

Sometimes they take a very long time. Sometimes we

may  not  succeed, but all that we can  do  is  to

negotiate; to show our goodwill; to talk  to  them

nicely. We must also realise and face the fact - and

I think we have got to face it squarely one day or

another -  what  have  we  got  to  offer  when  we

negotiate with other countries? We have  our  port

services  to  offer,  our  business  acumen,   our

banking and insurance facilities, but we must also

realise that these are days when trade is governed

by politics, when trade arrangements are made with

the  consciousness of what is politically suitable

or good. These are not days when trade matters are

considered purely from the economic angle. We  are

still  a  colony  and  we have  not  yet  got  the

political   friendship  to   offer   which   other

sovereign States have to offer to each other.  The

only  thing that we can do is to create friendship

and goodwill and it takes time for that friendship

and  goodwill  to  blossom  forth.  We  must  have

patience. If it is only a domestic matter,  I  can

understand  the impatience; I can understand  that

if  we  do not go about doing it quickly,  we  are

just  wasting  time. But when the matter  concerns

another country, it has got to take time. The pace

cannot be forced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon alleged that some

rubber contracts had been made by the traders even

before the goodwill mission and the working  party

left  for Indonesia last year. That, Sir,  may  be

true.  Contracts could be made. But  was  shipment

made? That is the point. A contract can be made on

paper. But did you get that rubber here? You  only

got  that rubber after the working party had  come

back   from   its  successful  negotiations   with

Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



It is misinformation, Sir, the way it was put. The

hon. Member went on to talk about the trouble that

our  fishermen had in Indonesian waters. Sir,  the

working  party did do something for the fishermen.

It did, in fact, come to a settlement on an agreed

list  of  items which our fishing boats  can  take

back on their return journey, which settlement had

been  pending for two or three years. We were able

to  do  that much. If we were not able to do more,

it  was not our own fault. There were able members

in  the  working party. We tried our best  and  we

managed to achieve what we could, and no more.  It

is no use grumbling about it. It is something that

did not lie in our hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Serangoon went on to say

about  the  Federation  customs  duties  having  a

detrimental effect on our trade. We are not  blind

to  that.  We  realise  that  they  are  having  a

detrimental effect. In fact, I have stated it many

times. I said that three or four days back in  the

Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association   meeting

when I spoke on the economic relations between the

territories of the Malaya/Borneo Group. Here is  a

cutting from a Hongkong paper which I will read to

you:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Addressing the Regional Conference of the

Commonwealth  Parliamentary Association,  he  (the

Minister   for   Commerce  and   Industry)   said,

`Singapore  now finds that tariffs in  Malaya  are

creating  an  obstacle to the development  of  her

industries.  We hope that though we  may  progress

separately on the political path, we will  in  the

future   merge.  We  hope  that  in  the  meantime

something can be done to eliminate this difficulty

which is facing the Singapore manufacturer.' "



<br><br>That  is a problem which we have to tackle. It  is

no use grumbling about it. It requires goodwill on

both sides. We have set up a committee to consider

the  effects  and at the moment we are  collecting

data.  We  require a lot of data  and  information

before we can put up a good case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Serangoon went on to speak

about   farmers   and  asked  what   encouragement

Government  was  giving  them.  Sir,  if  I  start

reading   out  portions  of  my  speech   at   the

Agricultural Show, I think it will take up  a  lot

of the Assembly's time. So much time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



has  already  been taken up by other  Members  who

have  no  regard for time. But I will not  do  so.

However,  if the Member is interested  in  knowing

what  we have done, I will just quote him  one  or

two  figures: the inoculation of poultry - 4 million

birds last year; 2 million so far this year. If he

is interested, I will send him a copy of my speech

at  the Agricultural Show and he can then find out

what we have done in that field.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I would rather you say it here.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The hon. Member went on to

allege that we had created a monopoly on a certain

brand  of  insecticide. That, Sir, is not correct.

The  correct position is this. Up to very recently

a  certain brand of insecticide was only available

and  that insecticide was imported by I.C.I.  This

insecticide  contained phosphorus and  because  it

was of a poisonous character it was necessary that

the  farmers  had  to  have the  approval  of  the

Ministry  of Health before they could use  it.  So

instead  of creating a monopoly, there  were  more

obstacles put in the way of selling that  product.

The  position  now has changed.  Another  type  of

insecticide has come into the market which is  not

so  poisonous,  which can be  bought  freely,  and

which does not belong to I.C.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of fisheries, the Member for

Serangoon  queried  why only three  licences  were

granted  for  joint  Japanese  operations.   Eight

applications were received. Why were they all  not

granted licences? Then we would have more training

facilities for our fishermen. The answer to  that.

Sir,  is this: before we allow unlimited operation

of  this scheme, we want to make sure what  effect

it  is  going to have on the fishing grounds  here

and  also  what effect the import of the resultant

catches  is  going  to have on our  fishermen  who

number quite a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member also said that all the

applicants  were willing to comply with Government

requirements, and yet only three were chosen,  the

implication  being. I suppose, that  there  was  a

selection. Naturally we could not help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



having  a selection when we decided to issue  only

three  licences and more than that number applied.

Sir,  I  will  quote  from the advertisement  that

appeared  in  the papers calling for  applications

for  licences.  It  shows that  the  criteria  for

selection    were   clearly   stated    in    that

advertisement. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only a limited number of licences will be

available  under  this scheme and  the  Government

reserves the right to select from the applications

received  before the closing date those which,  in

its  opinion, offer the best prospects  for  rapid

training   of   local  personnel,   the   greatest

participation of local interests, and increase  in

the supply of fish from deep-sea off-shore fishing

grounds."



<br><br>The  criteria  are these: the best  prospects  for

rapid  training of local personnel,  the  greatest

participation of local interests, and increase  in

the supply of fish from deep-sea off-shore fishing

grounds. The applications were judged according to

how they fitted in with those criteria and, as had

been  decided  by Government, three licences  were

granted.  If and when we find that this method  is

really  beneficial  to us, I  will  then  consider

recommending to Government that we should increase

the  number  of  licences under this  scheme;  but

until I am satisfied that it is going to be really

beneficial, I am not going to plunge headlong into

a scheme of which we know little at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon then asked what

Government  is  doing regarding the cheap  landing

and  selling of fish. The Clyde Terrace Market  is

away  from the beach now. The Ellenborough  Market

is  too  small. Sir, plans for a wholesale  market

have  been  under consideration at  first  by  the

Department  of Commerce and Industry and  then  by

the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, since 1951.

Sir,   six   sites  have  been   gone   over   and

difficulties  have been encountered with  many  of

these  sites. In some cases, the Army or the  Navy

wanted  to  use the land. The last  site  that  we

considered  was at the city end of Merdeka  Bridge

but  we  found that it was too costly, that piling

would cost too big an amount to be economical. Now

we have found another site towards the extreme end

of  the  old Kallang Airport runway, but  that  is

still under consideration and I cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



make any promises. However, I will say this, that,

in  my  opinion, a wholesale fish market does  not

deserve a high degree of priority and that it will

only  be  considered  in  the  order  of  priority

according  to the funds available for the  various

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we come to the interesting part, the field

of  industry, I wish to refer to the point made by

the  Member for Serangoon about the import  duties

imposed by Indonesia on our goods, ranging from 50

to  200  per  cent. Sir, Indonesia is a  sovereign

power. We cannot control her and if she raises her

import  duties  to  500 per  cent,  we  cannot  do

anything about it. So why grumble about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Negotiate.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Negotiate? That is what we

are  doing, but the Member probably does not  know

that   these   import  duties  are   not   applied

discriminately only to Singapore; they are applied

to all imports, whether they are from Singapore or

anywhere else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do something.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> If a sovereign power wants to

regulate its own economy, what cause can  we  have

to grumble about? If we do, it is possible that we

may harm our trade. We must realise that their own

needs  are  of paramount importance  to  them.  We

should not try to create more ill-feeling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one part of the Member for

Serangoon's speech which struck me as having taken

cognizance of the facts as they really exist,  and

that is that we are being used as a dumping ground

for  foreign manufacturers. That is true in a way.

The Member for Paya Lebar was more constructive in

his  suggestion. Now what is the Government  doing

about it? The Member for Paya Lebar suggested that

Government  should  think  of  introducing  tariff

protection. Sir, that is not a new proposal to me.

In   fact,  at  the  opening  of  the  Trade   and

Industries Fair at the Great World Amusement  Park

on 20th July, I did mention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



that  suggestion, and these are the words I  used, Sir:



"That  Government should give protection to  local

industries by means, of tariffs on imported goods.

This  suggestion is not a new one and, in fact.  I

have   for   some   time   been   examining    the

possibilities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we have to remember is this: that when

we  introduce tariff protection, we must look  out

for  three factors (the Member of Telok Ayer  also

mentioned this) and these are, first, that we  are

an  entrepot centre and we should not do  anything

that would harm our entrepot trade. We have to  be

very  careful about that. Then we should also  see

that,  by giving tariff protection, our industries

which   get   such  protection   do   not   become

uncompetitive because then the incentive to reduce

costs is lost. I do not think it will be so in all

cases.  In  some cases, however, by giving  tariff

protection,  we  get  more economical  production,

more  competitive  production,  because  then  the

industries  concerned can produce  to  their  full

capacity  without any waste. But in certain  cases

especially where advanced methods are not used,  a

manufacturer getting tariff protection might  say,

"I  am getting protection now, What have I got  to

worry about?" And instead of trying to better  his

quality  and to bring his costs down, he may  just

take  things easy. So we find that his goods  will

become  uncompetitive  on the  export  market,  on

which  we  have to rely to a large extent  because

our  home  market  is not big  enough.  The  third

factor that we have to take into consideration  is

that  we  should not do anything to bring  up  the

cost of living. Take the case of bee-hoon. The bee-hoon people have come to see me about half a dozen

times  in  the last three months and I know  their

case full well. I have investigated it. But if  we

impose restrictions, especially since bee-hoon  is

a  food  item,  is there not a danger  thereby  of

increasing the cost of living? There is one way of

encouraging  the  bee-hoon  people.  They  are  at

present using out-of-date methods of manufacturing

bee-hoon.  I have told them that we might  try  to

bring  their case before the Industrial  Promotion

Board  so  that they can get a loan to buy  up-to-date machinery which will help to bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



down  their cost of production, and thereby enable

them   to  compete  with  imported  bee-hoon  from

Thailand and China. We have also to bear in  mind,

when  we impose restriction, the repercussions  on

the  other territories that are affected by  those

restrictions. Sir, the Member for Serangoon -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I think this is an

appropriate time to suspend. I will take the Chair

again at 2.30 p.m.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker,Sir, before I was

interrupted this morning, I was going to touch  on

the  important subject of encouragement  of  local

industries but now I think the subject is of  such

great importance that I am going to talk on it  at

the end of my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now going to answer some of the

miscellaneous points that have been raised by  the

other Members from the Opposition side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) put

up  a  suggestion that the Fisheries School should

be  established  immediately. My answer,  Sir,  is

that  if we can train our fishermen free of charge

under this scheme of joint-Japanese venture, I  do

not  see  any  reason why Government should  spend

money  on a scheme which might not prove  of  much

help,  and  therefore I will  only  consider  this

suggestion when I see the result of the  operation

of the joint-Japanese venture scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Bukit Panjang (Mr Goh Tong

Liang) raised certain points about agriculture and

about  farmers.  He  said that  Government  should

examine   all   outstanding  grievances   and   he

suggested  that  we  should do away  with  pig-sty

licences  which cost six dollars each annually.  I

will  also not be surprised if he comes round  and

says that we should do away with the fees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



for  the  registration of businesses, in order  to

encourage business, or that we should do away with

rents for land given to farmers and with all other

similar things. Six dollars is a small sum and  it

is  necessary that we should have a record of  all

farmers who breed pigs. He also lamented the  fact

that  there was an epidemic of swine fever earlier

this  year - that  quite a lot of  pigs  died  as  a

result - and that not much help was forthcoming from

the  Veterinary Department. Sir, the  main  reason

why the pigs died was because of the reluctance on

the part of the farmers to report the outbreak  of

swine  fever. Immediately we became aware  of  the

existence  of  this disease amongst the  pigs,  we

took steps to recruit an extra team of men for the

Veterinary Department to go out and attend to this

disease  so  that  it would not  spread  to  other

areas. He has also touched upon the bad roads  and

communications and in this respect I  am  sure  he

will  notice  in  His  Excellency's  Address  that

reference has been made to bringing in services to

the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of attention has been given in certain

sections  of  the  Press  to  statements  by   the

Singapore Farmers' Association that farmers should

be  trained to inoculate their own poultry. I have

here,  Sir, a statement from an expert whose views

are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A vaccine is not a pill or a dose of medicine

which any one can take, but requires the use of  a

hypodermic    syringe   under   trained    sterile

conditions, This Ranikhet vaccine is put up  in  a

glass ampule of 1 c.c. capacity which must be  kept

on  ice  from  the  moment of manufacture  to  the

moment of vaccination."



<br><br>Now,  the  farmers do not have the  facilities  to

keep the vaccine on ice or in a refrigerator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If exposed to sunlight or heat it dies

immediately. In addition the vaccine is so  potent

that  it  requires  a dilution by  a  thousandfold

using special sterile filtrated medium which  must

also  be  used at ice cold temperature; after  the

ampule is broken open, the diluted vaccine must be

used within an hour otherwise it dies."



<br><br>The  success of this vaccination campaign has been

largely  dependent on the fact that  it  has  been

carried out by experts who know their job  and  if

it is handed over to the farmers, there is a great

chance of it being misused by quacks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



trying to make money by injecting dirty water  and

calling  it vaccine and the farmer who  gets  this

service  will  not know whether the  poultry  have

been  injected with the real vaccine or with  some

other  substitute. Also, the Federation Veterinary

Laboratory which supplies us this vaccine supplies

us  on the condition that it is used by experts of

the  Veterinary  Department. I have  studied  this

matter  before  and I cannot find  any  method  by

which  it  would  be possible to let  the  farmers

handle this vaccine; but what we are doing is that

we  are expanding our veterinary services so  that

every farmer who is in need will be able to get at

his  doorstep  this service. Of course,  it  takes

time and requires the means to have this expansion

brought about, but it is going to come surely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally it has been recognised even by the

Farmers'  Association, belatedly I must say,  that

the  Government has done something for the farmer.

The   Sin   Pao,  which  was  very   critical   of

Government's action towards farmers and  the  help

that the Government was giving, has now come round

belatedly and is now admitting that Government has

done something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendance at the Agricultural Show, which is

estimated  at  over 200,000 during the  last  five

days - out of which one and a half days were wet and

rainy - is  in  itself a compliment to  Government's

help and assistance towards the farmer and to  the

importance   that  Government  attaches   to   the

agricultural section of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also brought to light the fact

that  feeding  stuffs have gone up  and  that  the

price  of swine has gone down. We have no  control

over  the price of feeding stuffs in the countries

from which they are coming. If the prices go up in

the  country of origin, we cannot help it but  the

price  of  swine  to  the farmer  has  come  down,

especially because of the activities of middlemen.

The  middleman who buys swine from the farmers and

brings it to the consumer is making all the profit

and  the farmers are not getting a fair share  for

their portion. The remedy for this, however, is to

increase our co-operative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



effort  so  that  more and more  farmers  will  be

brought  into co-operative societies. They will  be

able to market their own produce, poultry and pigs

and   they  will  have  direct  contact  with  the

consumer  then, and be able to get the best  price

possible; eliminating the middleman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a complaint about Malay fishermen

in  the  Straits of Johore being affected  by  the

curfew.  Sir, we are well aware of this. In  fact,

we  have been giving our attention to it but  this

curfew   was  imposed  at  the  request   of   the

Federation Government because of the Emergency and

we   are   in  consultation  with  the  Federation

Government over this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) in

his  speech  gave - if I may use the  words  of  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar - a catalogue of the Labour

Front's  inefficiency. Sir, this speech should  be

taken with a pinch of salt. It was intended mainly

for  political  purposes and I  am  not  going  to

comment because all the points - in fact, he  raised

very few points - but whatever points he raised have

been covered by me in replies to other speakers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to the very important subject

of   encouragement  of  our  industries.   Various

speakers  have touched on this subject - the  Member

for  Kampong  Kapor  (Mr Seah  Peng  Chuan),  the

Member  for  Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon  Teck),  the

Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) and  our

friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan

Yew).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar cited examples

of  India  and Ceylon but there are two advantages

which  India  and Ceylon have which we  have  not.

They have cheaper labour and they have a very  big

home market which we have not. We have to rely  on

a small home market and more on exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of criticism that Government

has  been inactive over its economic policy,  that

Government   has  done  nothing  about  industrial

expansion, and that it is only talk and talk,  and

so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



on.  As recently as yesterday, Sir - I will quote  a

paragraph   from  the  Free  Press  editorial   of

yesterday which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only the Government is acutely aware of the

need  for industrial expansion on this island  but

it  is setting about in a thoroughgoing manner  to

produce a favourable climate for it."



<br><br>Sir, I am a modest man and I will not let this  go

to my head but I must say, as I said this morning,

that these matters take time to formulate and they

cannot be achieved overnight.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Eighteen months!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> More, it should take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has been said this morning about the

entrepot   trade  of  Singapore.  I   admit   that

Singapore  has  no basic economy of  its  own  and

therefore  we  have got to rely  on  our  entrepot

trade.   Then   let  us  examine  the   conditions

prevailing  at  the moment in  this  part  of  the

world.  Asia has changed greatly since before  the

last war. Many countries which were under colonial

domination did not have any nationalist  policies.

Today we find that those countries which have been

freed  have become nationally conscious  and  they

are  deliberately  pursuing a policy  of  national

economy  and  therefore it is only to be  expected

that  they  will  do what is best  for  their  own

economy. We have relied on the entrepot trade  but

these   national   economic   policies   in    the

surrounding countries are going to have an  effect

on  our  economy. There is no doubt about  it.  We

have   exploited  to  the  full  our  geographical

position  in  the  past. We have  been  a  natural

receiving  and distributing centre for the  region

of  SouthEast  Asia, but with the  advancement  of

national economic policies, we cannot expect  that

we will get any increase in the entrepot trade: if

we are lucky, we may keep to the same level in our

entrepot  trade,  In  fact, during  the  last  few

years, we have lost quite a few trade items  which

we  were  dealing  in  before.  Take  cloves,  for

instance. We were supplying Indonesia with  cloves

from  Zanzibar.  Today, we have lost  that  trade.

Dates  from  Iraq: we have lost that trade.  Dates

from Iraq used to go to Indonesia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



from  Singapore mostly, but now we have  lost  it.

Sago  flour  to India: that has been lost  because

India  is  herself producing some type of  starch.

There  are many other things. Copra: you  can  see

from  the figures for copra that it is a dwindling

trade.  And  therefore we have got to look  around

and  reconsider our position now and to  plan  for

the  future  if  we  are going to  survive - if  our

increasing  population is  to  get  employment.  I

admit  that we cannot solve the employment problem

entirely, but we can at least alleviate it and  do

something to lessen unemployment. Therefore,  Sir,

a  strong  economic policy is necessary and  there

have  been  indications in the Press in  the  past

that  I am working on it now and I only hope  that

hon.  Members  will be a little patient.  Since  I

took  office as Minister from March, I  have  been

giving  my whole attention to this matter but,  as

you  know,  I have been interrupted. I  have  been

away on the Merdeka Mission and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, encouragement of industry demands three

factors:  the  first  is the establishment  of  an

Industrial Research Institute. I lay great  stress

on  that  Institute  and, as  you  will  see,  His

Excellency the Governor in his speech also  stated

that  the  Government "is examining  the  possible

establishment    of    an   Industrial    Research

Institute".  At  the moment, the main  problem  is

that  we do not know what our industrial potential

is.  We do not know what industries could best  be

established  beneficially here. There  are  people

who  come  to me and say, "I have got so  much  of

money. Can you please tell me what type of factory

I  shall open?"; and I say, "I am sorry. I am  not

in a position yet to tell you that." If we have an

Institute  that will make a market survey  and  be

also   able   to   offer   technical   advice   to

industrialists,  we  may  then  be  in  a   better

position  to come nearer to the solution  of  this

problem of encouraging industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second requisite is a favourable political

climate. Now, Sir, a favourable climate is  not  a

thing that can be brought about overnight. It is a

thing  that  can be easily swayed  or  changed  by

certain actions, for instance, some actions  which

have taken place in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



past 17 months, and no amount of guarantees and no

amount  of affirmations that the Government  might

give about nationalising or non-nationalising,  or

repatriation of capital or profits are going to do

any  good  unless  we  can bring  about  a  really

suitable  climate, and therefore I  would  request

certain Members of the Opposition to be careful in

their  utterances, to be careful in their actions,

so  that  the intending industrialist may  not  be

frightened  away  from us. We  are  not  the  only

country   competing  for  foreign  capital.   Most

countries  in  Asia  are  competing  for  foreign'

capital at this moment. You have Ceylon, you  have

India, you have Indonesia, Thailand and many other

countries  which  are asking for foreign  capital.

Why?  It  is  because there is not enough  capital

formation locally in those countries and it is the

same  here. Without capital formation, you  cannot

have  industries. So if we have not enough capital

formation  locally, we have got to import  capital

whether  we like it or not and whether politically

we   thoroughly  dislike  it  does  not  make  any

difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> By creating a favourable

climate.  That  is  the  only  way  of  attracting

foreign capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third requisite, of course, is, as I touched

upon this morning - also mentioned by the Member for

Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) - giving some sort of

protection to our industries and that, as  I  have

already  mentioned, I am considering  now  but  we

have  got  to see that our entrepot trade  is  not

hampered  because of that, To achieve one  object,

we  should not kill the other, We should not  kill

the existing golden goose. We should also see that

those  industries  which  are  developed  will  be

healthy and competitive because our home market is

very limited. We should also see that our services

do not become expensive as a result of the rise in

the cost of living. We should be very selective in

our  policy  if  we  are  at  all  going  to  give

protection  to  our industries. We should  have  a

very selective policy, not a policy that should be

applied  like a scythe, levelling everything  that

comes under it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have satisfactorily answered all

the   points   that  have  been  raised   by   the

Opposition.  There is only one  point  I  want  to

touch  upon  now and that is that the  Member  for

Telok  Ayer  (Mr  R. Jumabhoy) raised  the  point

about  getting experts to teach handicraft to  our

rural  folks. Sir, handicrafts depend to  a  large

extent  on the waste produce that is available  in

any  country. Take, for instance, the coconut husk

or  the  stem of the coconut leaf and things  like

that.  Now,  that would mean that the  country  is

agricultural  and it has got all  these  materials

available  which are going to waste and which  can

be  utilised  in the economic life of the  country

and  of the people but, as was admitted by me,  we

have  no agricultural economy to speak of. We have

not  got  these products and therefore  I  do  not

think  that we could encourage handicraft  to  any

great  extent. We may be able to do  something  on

those  lines,  I admit, and I will certainly  look

into that question when we get our experts on  the

Industrial Research Institute and they will be the

persons  who will say what is going to  waste  and

recommend what can be beneficially utilised.  That

is all I have to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it looks to me that  some  of  the

speeches made by Opposition Members were just  for

the  sake  of saying something, as the Member  for

Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) puts it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not claim to be pundits in the art of

government  and therefore we welcome  constructive

criticisms  but  some of the points  made  by  the

previous speakers do not come under this category.

On  the  one hand. Government is accused of laying

down  a  long-term policy while being a  caretaker

Government   and,  on  the  other,  there   is   a

suggestion that the policy speech was but  a  mere

collection   of   activities   of   the    various

departments and that the Government has  not  laid

down   a  long  clear-cut  policy.  What  we  have

endeavoured to do was to map out the policy  which

we  hope to carry out while we are in office.  The

Hon. the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



Chief  Minister  has indicated  that  the  present

Government does not expect or wish to carry on for

the full term of four years and if any part of our

policy   remains  unfinished,  it   is   for   our

successors to finish them or do something better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of housing, Sir, I must say that

the   difficulties  have  been  enormous.  Housing

projects   have  been  delayed  because   of   the

difficulties of resettling squatters. If they  are

forcibly  ejected, which act we are  reluctant  to

do,  the  very people who express concern  at  the

slow  progress made will be the first to  take  up

the  cause  of  the  squatters  and  protest  that

Government   is   being   inhuman.    With    such

difficulties to contend with, the progress already

made cannot but reflect credit on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to sell 68 houses by the Singapore

Improvement   Trust  is  in  the  nature   of   an

experiment  to encourage the public to  own  their

own  houses. It was only when the houses were  put

for  sale  that  it was possible to ascertain  the

extent  of  the response by the public.  The  fact

that there were about 1,300 applicants for the  68

houses  is  sufficient evidence that  there  is  a

demand   for  low-cost  houses  and  that  certain

sections  of  the population are  keen  to  become

owners of houses. Having ascertained the wishes of

the  people, Government will hereafter concentrate

on  this  aspect of the problem but it  is  by  no

means  possible to achieve all that we want to  do

in  the shortest possible time as, expected by our

critics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that squatters are being pushed

from pillar to post as alleged by the Member  for

Paya  Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) yesterday. On  the

contrary, squatters are very  un-cooperative  and

this   lack   of  co-operation  had  been   mainly

responsible  for the difficulties  encountered  by

the  Land  Office  and  the Singapore  Improvement

Trust.   Government  is  fully  aware   of   their

difficulties.  We  know how hard  it  is  for  the

farmers  to  give up the plots of land  that  they

have   cultivated.  However,  I  can  assure  hon.

Members  that  the  question  of  resettlement  of

squatters is being dealt with consideration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



and  sympathy  and there is no question  of  their

being  bullied or pushed around. We  are  as  much

interested as the Opposition Members, if not  more

so,  in this problem and every effort will be made

to solve it to the satisfaction of all concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

seem from the comparative absence of criticism  of

the  Government's education policy that  even  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew), whose

natural  invectiveness reinforces his keen  desire

to   discredit  Government,  does,  in  fact,   in

general,  approve  of  it.  True,  he  called   it

unimaginative, feeble and what have you, but  then

the policy owes much to the All-Party Committee on

Education  of which he him-self was a member  and,

with  due respect to those who are panting  for  a

change,  I  would say that we should  think  twice

before we throw overboard a system that we know to

be  good when all around us we find our neighbours

having  second thoughts about the changes made  in

their early revolutionary ardour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Come, come.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> May I suggest that the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar's preference for Malay  rather

than  English is dictated rather by his  political

expediency than by his own good sense? I will  now

read from today's Indian Daily Mail:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Madras, September 5th.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English will continue as the compulsory subject

of  study  in  all secondary and high schools  and

will also continue to be the medium of instruction

in  the  universities for at least another fifteen

years.  This  welcome assurance was given  by  the

Education  Minister,  Mr C. Subramaniam,  on  his

return  from  the  New  Delhi  conference  of  all

education  ministers  in  India  at  which   these

decisions were taken."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Reuter message from New Delhi dated 2nd

September reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Indian Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, today

urged Indians to continue to learn English as  the

unifying  factor in the country and  in  order  to

provide  technically trained men for the country's

Five-Year Plan."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Tanjong Pagar, with his usual

flair  for debate, criticised Government  for  not

having an imaginative policy on education - intro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>

ducing  Malay as the national language - it reminds

me  of  the  time when we all sat at the All-Party

Committee  on  Education  when  the  question   of

national language was brought up. He, and I  share

the same view with him, was reluctant to bring  up

that  question. We said, "The question of national

language should not be discussed here. It  is  not

within the ambit of our terms of reference. If  we

say  that  Malay should be the national  language,

then  the  Chinese students will say that Mandarin

should  be  their national language." I think  the

Member  for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) will  bear

me out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Now, it is not so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Because the Students' Union

and  the students generally now say that they want

Malay  as the national language, it is no surprise

to me that the Member for Tanjong Pagar should toe

their line and get orders from them to say in this

Assembly, for party politics, that Malay should be

the  national  language and that the Minister  for

Education is not doing anything imaginative enough

to introduce that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also criticised or was rather worried about

the  conditions  under which  full  aid  would  be

given.  I  have already stated that the conditions

will be the same for all schools and that the  two

most  important factors will be that  the  schools

must   subscribe  to  the  Government  policy   by

providing  the  kind  of  education  designed   to

produce  loyal  and efficient Malayans,  and  that

they  must use Government funds wisely and account

for  them properly. Surely, it cannot be that  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar wishes to take  part  in

subversive  activities  or  to  misuse  Government

grants-in-aid?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an editoral in the Straits Times not

long ago which I think is well worth quoting here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> By the time you have to quote

the Free Press and the Straits Times -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The editorial of the 24th August states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refusal to accept full grants-in-aid on

Government terms or get none at all is the  result

of  stubborn misunderstanding on the part  of  the

critics.  The difference of opinion  is  not  over

grants-in-aid   to   Chinese  schools.   The   new

education policy unreservedly accords a status  to

Chinese schools fully equal to that of non-Chinese

schools in the matter of financial aid. Other than

those  who  resort to double talk as a  matter  of

principle  or  political  strategy,  no  one   has

questioned  that equality for all schools  is  the

Government   policy.  It  is  this  principle   of

equality which is now called into question by  the

critics. The Chinese schools want aid but  without

any vestige of Government control. If this control

were  sought  only in the case of Chinese  schools

there  would  be, of course, valid objections  but

the  conditions going with the aid are imposed  on

all  schools which accept assistance. The  Chinese

schools, in fact, seek not equality but privileged

treatment."



<br><br>Then it goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which government in the world would hand over

millions   of   dollars   annually   to    private

organisations  and  wash its hands  of  the  whole

matter?"



<br><br>It ends up very aptly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No government with so sinister a purpose would

be  willing to give substantial financial  aid  to

support Chinese schools."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Nanyang University, it is

clearly  to  the  best interest of Singapore  that

this should be an institution of high repute.  Its

recognition will be earned not by its, wealth  nor

by  fine  buildings  and  equipment,  but  by  the

quality  of  the  students  turned  out   by   the

University. I am sure that the students themselves

will want an education the qualities of which will

be  the guiding light in recognition. As stated in

the  Address,  the  Government  is  at  all  times

willing  to  help  the University  authorities  to

attain  standards and thus accord the  recognition

to degrees conferred by the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

touched  on  secondary education  yesterday.  Now,

Singapore's  problem  is  that  nearly  half   the

population is under fifteen. In other words, there

is   an  abnormally  large  proportion  of  school

population  and an abnormally small proportion  in

gainful  employment.  It is essential  that  there

should be no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



waste  of  the very limited educational  resources

and also that there should be the fullest possible

use  of  productive resources including  manpower.

Yet  this proportion is made still more marked  by

the  reluctance of the large numbers  of  over-age

pupils,  many of them in their twenties, to  leave

school and seek employment. No community could  so

misuse  its  resources  for  long,  least  of  all

Singapore.  It  is very largely because  so  many

school  places are thus occupied that the  younger

children  have  to  be turned away,  not,  as  the

Member  for  Serangoon suggested, at 13  but  last

year  at  l4½ and over. The Government  does  not

wish  to  deny education to anyone. It  is  taking

progressive   measures  to  ensure   that   places

available for full-time education in Government or

Government-aided schools should be occupied as far

as possible by those pupils who are of the correct

age for the classes and best fitted to profit from

the education provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Malay education, I might quote

here  certain figures. The number of  teachers  in

Malay in Singapore is 330, few of whom have had  a

full  secondary course. The number of children  in

Malay schools is 13,000 and the number of children

in  other  schools  totals to  about  230,000.  At

present,   there  are  not  nearly  enough   Malay

teachers  for Malay schools alone, let  alone  for

the  children in other schools. There are scarcely

any,  either here or in the Federation,  qualified

to  teach in secondary schools. Now, what are  the

sources of supply? We have 21 in training  at  the

Sultan  Idris Training College; 10 in training  at

the  Malay  Women  Training  College,  Malacca;  9

studying Malay at the University of Malaya of whom

7 are Chinese; 2 studying at the Teachers Training

College,  Certificate Course, 50 studying  at  the

Teachers Training College, Normal Course, and  100

teachers  studying Malay at the  secondary  level.

These are approximate figures available now.  They

may  not  be  very accurate, I hope  hon.  Members

opposite  would  not  expect  me  to  conjure   up

teachers  or  to  produce  teachers  out   of   my

imagination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi deplored the attitude

adopted  by the Federation Education Minister.  He

said, "Why should the Federation forbid their boys

from  mixing  with our school students  here?"  He

wanted  this Government to do something about  it.

Well, I suggest to him that if we want respect, we

must have self-respect and that we had better  put

our  house  in order before we expect  anybody  to

have respect for us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I thought it was because of

venereal disease.

for  Changi wishes to intervene, he can do  so  in

the  proper  way  provided that the  Minister  for

Education gives way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

clear the point just mentioned by the

Minister for Education. I said this morning that I

was  not against the notice issued by the Minister

for  Education  of the Federation  Government  for

forbidding school children from the Federation  to

visit  Chinese schools here, but I am against  the

wording which was used in the notice and which has

received  publicity in the papers. It stated  that

the  reason for stopping its school children  from

visiting Chinese schools in Singapore, including 2

girls  schools especially, was to prevent students

from contacting venereal disease. I think that  is

insulting,    Sir.   Therefore   I   think    this

misunderstanding -

given his explanation. Mr Chew

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Member for Changi may well

read   the   notice  before  he   attributes   any

accusation against the Federation Minister or  the

Federation Government or Minister said  the  words

"venereal  disease".  It  was  at  a  meeting   in

Singapore - the Chinese High School, I think it was - that  the  principal  asked a  group  of  visiting

students  from the Federation, "Have you contacted

any disease now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You might go into the lewd details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> That is all, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, amongst the many speakers from  the

opposite   Benches,  the  only  person   who   has

expressed  a feeling of depression on hearing  His

Excellency  the Governor's Address is  the  Member

for  Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim).  Perhaps

if the person who prepared his speech - being  of  a  very suspicious mind I  believe  he

did - had only explained to him the full text of His

Excellency's Address, I am confident that  he  and

members  of  his  constituency  would  not  be  so

depressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I accepted the post of Minister for Health

in April 1955, I have always welcomed constructive

criticisms,    suggestions   and    advice    but,

unfortunately, all that is fired from the guns  of

the  Opposition are, as the Member for Paya  Lebar

(Mr Lim Koon Teck) rightly suggests, nothing  but

destructive criticisms or fatuous suggestions. The

only   useful  suggestion  that  came   from   the

Opposition was that offered by the Member for Paya

Lebar   on   the  question  of  economy   in   the

construction  of  medical units,  and  this  is  a

matter which has always received the attention  of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

talks   about   wastage  of   manpower,   economy,

construction of a central specialist hospital  and

cheap district hospitals for acutely ill patients.

Does  he suggest that the patients acutely ill  in

the  district  hospitals  cannot  and  should  not

receive  specialist  treatment?  As  regards   the

building of a hospital on a grand scale, it is not

the  intention  of  Government to  build  district

hospitals as replicas of the General Hospital. The

district hospital will provide for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



acute surgical and medical cases and for maternity

work. There will be no specialist facilities other

than  for  general  acute cases  of  disease;  for

example,  ears,  nose, throat and eyes  specialist

treatment, neuro-surgery, plastic surgery, and  so

forth,   will  all  be  referred  to  the  General

Hospital.  Our plans are to make it as  economical

as  possible  and we are basing the  cost  of  our

district  hospital at $13,000  per  bed.  This  is

quite  economical in comparison with the  cost  of

others  in  other countries. A hospital  built  in

Australia cost A£l0,000 per bed -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Those are large people.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Braga: - and the cost quoted in the United

Kingdom  by  the Ministry of Health is £8,500  per

bed.  I  am glad to inform hon. Members  that  the

hospital  that is going to be built in the  Katong

district  is to provide for 500 beds out of  which

less than 50 will be paying beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (who now just walks in)

also  talks of building district hospitals on  the

lines  of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In the  same

voice,  he  complains about the man with  a  prawn

pond who was asked to remove it when he encroached

upon Government land. There is but little land  in

Singapore  for  such  an  extravagant  scheme   as

building a district hospital on the lines  of  the

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital. That hospital was a  gift

by  Mr  Tan  Tock Seng many years  ago  when  the

population of Singapore was but a quarter of  what

it is today. Surely, the Member for Serangoon must

agree  with the policy of my Ministry,  namely  to

build  multi-storeyed hospitals which would supply

more beds on less ground? To build a few hospitals

on  the lines of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital  would

be an extravagant use of land and staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of economy, it was early realised

by  the  new  Government that there was  room  for

economy in the construction of medical units,  and

the Ministry in consultation with the Ministry  of

Communications  and  Works,  gave  directions   to

exercise extreme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



economy  in  the  new  planning.  Prior  to  1955,

certain  works  were initiated and  already  under

construction at the time when I took office. These

included  the  Mistri Wing, an  operating  theatre

block  in  the  General  Hospital,  and  the   new

hospital extension at the Kandang Kerbau Maternity

Hospital. The work in these three cases  had  gone

so  far  that no alteration was possible.  In  all

these schemes, the Member for Paya Lebar was quite

right  when he said that they are most extravagant

and  expensive but that, of course, was due to the

extravagant  nature of the colonial  or,  shall  I

say,   the   Progressive   Government   and    the

governments   in  the  past.  It   was   however,

possible on other projects, for example, the Ward

Block  at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, to introduce

measures  achieving a large saving on construction

costs  without  reduction of size  or  efficiency.

Similiarly,  whereas according to the White  Paper

laid before the Legislative Assembly in 1954,  the

Nurses  Hospital  at  the  General  Hospital  cost

$1,916,000  for 250 nurses, we built an  extension

to  this Hospital for 200 nurses initiated by  the

present Government and estimated to cost $750,000,

a  saving  of  nearly  a  million  and  a  quarter

dollars.  According to the same White  Paper,  the

standard  maternity and child  health  centre  was

estimated  to cost $80,000. That was  their  basic

cost. The same standard maternity and child health

centre  of  which planning was initiated  in  1955

cost  only  $50,000 and this economy was  achieved

without  any  sacrifice of size or efficiency.  In

the  period that I have taken office, 460 hospital

beds have been added to existing institutions, and

buildings now under construction will provide  yet

another  728 beds before the end of 1956.  In  the

rural areas, two maternal and child health clinics

and three outdoor dispensaries have been added.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Hospital, because of its specialist

facilities and because of the fact that  it  is  a

teaching  school, is a most expensive hospital  to

maintain. It is obvious that beds should  be  used

to the best advantage and should not be allowed to

be blocked by long-term and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



incurable  patients.  It  is  estimated   by   the

Ministry  of  Health that at least one-quarter  of

the  1,000  beds in the General Hospital  are,  in

fact,  thus  blocked. Instructions have  now  been

given and funds have already been provided for the

construction  of  a  250-bed Chronic  Hospital - the

hospital  about  which my friend  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) made a  pun.  In

this  250-bed Chronic Hospital, incurable patients

can be adequately looked after at a far lower cost

than  is  possible at the General  Hospital.  This

project had no place in the previous Medical  Plan

and  it  is  now  expected that construction  will

commence on this hospital before the end of  1957.

This  is  an  answer to the Member for Serangoon's

complaint that a number of sick people are  turned

away from our General Hospital because of lack  of

bed space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar said that the

Minister  for Health takes things easy and  leaves

matters  in  the hands of his Permanent  Secretary

and  officials. That was the only,  shall  I  say,

criticism   he  could  make  to  launch   on   His

Excellency's  Address on the medical side  because

there   was  nothing  there  for  any  cause   for

complaint, but his statement is both incorrect and

unjust. I would invite the hon. Member to spend  a

day or two with me in my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> God forbid! I will be charged!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Braga: You might be cured!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> $300 for professional fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Braga: The Member for Tanjong Pagar also

could  not  have read the Governor's Address  very

thoroughly  when he said that only one clinic  was

referred  to,  and  that was the  Malayan  Airways

canteen.  I  refer  him to  paragraph  27  of  the

Governor's  Address  which  speaks  of  five  more

maternity and child welfare clinics and  two  more

outpatient  departments on which  work  will  soon

start. For his information, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



April  1955, three new outdoor dispensary  clinics

were  established  in  the  rural  areas  and  the

planning  for two general out-patient  clinics  in

other areas is already far advanced. This was  the

policy  initiated  by  me and  which  will  enable

residents  in  places  distant  from  the  General

Hospital to obtain outpatient facilities  near  at

hand in accordance with the Labour Front platform.

It  was obvious that the previous Medical Plan for

the expansion of medical and health services could

only   be  carried  out  if  trained  staff   were

available.  I  therefore paid first  attention  to

increasing  the  facilities for  the  training  of

medical  officers and nursing personnel. Provision

was made for increasing the number of departmental

awards.  In  1955, for example, only 17  had  been

budgeted  for;  in  1956,  30  such  awards   were

provided  and,  in 1957, budgetary  provision  has

been  made  for 66 officers to obtain  specialised

training.  In  the training of nursing  personnel,

the   increase  is  evident  from  the   following

figures:  student  intake  for  all  sections   of

nursing  training in 1954 was 243;  in  1955,  the

intake  was  stepped up to 356 and  up-to-date  in

1956,   303   students  have  been  accepted   for

training.  It was also seen from the White  Paper,

No.  27 of 1954, that the Government at that  time

intended to establish a third medical unit in  the

General  Hospital. It appeared obvious to me  that

this  project to enlarge the empire of the General

Hospital could not be justified by the expenditure

involved and could only delay the provision  of  a

new district hospital elsewhere in the island. The

expansion of the General Hospital as envisaged  in

the White Paper is therefore to be halted in order

to accelerate the planning and starting of the new

district  hospital.  The first  district  hospital

prior to 1955 was only an item in the Medical Plan

and  no  attempt had been made to  embark  on  the

project. The planning now is well under way and it

is   expected  that  construction,   as   I   said

yesterday, will start in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government since April 1955 has laid stress

on  two matters of policy calculated to reduce the

pressure on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



hospital  beds.  Both these projects  represent  a

long-term policy but nonetheless essential in  the

long-term   development  of  medical  and   health

services.  The  first is health  education.  Since

1955, the staff of the health education section of

the  Ministry  has  been increased  and  its  work

greatly  facilitated.  The  Government  has   also

provided a grant of $20,000 for a Health Education

Council to be established with the aim and  object

of  interesting all willing persons and  voluntary

agencies in a united effort to teach the people of

all  communities how to avoid disease. The  second

long-term   project  initiated  by   the   present

Government  is  in  respect of  the  provision  of

domiciliary   nursing  services  so  that   nurses

trained  in health education and also in  curative

techniques may be able to visit patients in  their

own  homes  and provide in their homes the  advice

and  minor  treatment  which  hitherto  have  been

available  only in Government and local Government

clinics.  This  is  a long-term policy.  It  takes

three years to train any one health nurse for this

purpose,   but  already  the  intake  of   student

assistant nurses at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital has

been  "stepped  up" considerably with  a  view  to

creating in due course a district nursing service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also stated that

there was not one word in His Excellency's Address

on  the  shortage  of doctors  and  that  we  were

importing  doctors  from India.  It  is  perfectly

obvious  that  he is misinformed and  that  he  is

mixing up Singapore with the Federation. There  is

no  serious  shortage of doctors  in  our  medical

services   but   we   are  definitely   short   of

specialists. The University increases  our  output

of  doctors  as steadily as it can. He also  spoke

flippantly of our efforts to step up the policy of

Malayanisation  by  exchange  of  personnel   from

Australia.  Does  he seriously  suggest  that  the

qualifications of an F.R.C.S.of Australia are  by

any  means  lower than those of any  part  of  the

Commonwealth?  It  has not yet  been  possible  to

reach final agreement with the authorities in  the

United  Kingdom.  We  have  approached  them.  The

exchange of personnel with Australia would provide

a specialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



service  needed  here with no  danger  of  denying

promotion to locally domiciled doctors who  obtain

specialist  qualifications  and  experience.   His

suggestion  that  the exchange of  personnel  with

Australia  while  our  local  doctors  are  taking

higher degrees is an attempt to Australianise this

country, is too ludicrous and unworthy of comment.

We  are  grateful to Australia and for the Colombo

Plan for all the assistance that they can give  us

on  matters like this, and for the wide-scale T.B.

research campaign which they have offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform hon. Members that any

problem of a technical or difficult nature I refer

to  my Medical Advisory Council which comprises 22

members:  2  from  the Alumni;2 from  the  British

Medical Association;3 from the Services;2 from the

Federation;  3 from the Ministry of Health;3  from

the  University;2 from the City Council;1 from the

Chemistry    Department;1    from    the    Dental

Association;1  from  S.A.T.A.;1  representing  the

nursing profession, and one pharmacist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure hon. Members that every effort

is  made  by me to see that the medical policy  is

implemented and that Singapore gets the best.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had an

eloquent plea from the Opposition for more  facts.

Unfortunately, the pleader for more facts  is  now

leaving  the  room just when he is  going  to  get

them. Never mind, they will be on the record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the Telephone Board. There was a

rather  unkind attack on the Telephone  Board  for

moving  at  a  snail's  pace  in  its  development

programme  whereas,  in  fact,  we  have   already

recently  tabled before this Assembly  the  Report

and Financial Statement for December 1955, and the

earlier  development  plan tabled  which  indicate

that  they  have laid a total of more than  20,000

circuit  miles  in the course of 18  months;  that

they  have  added  2,257  new  lines  one  way  or

another - a big net increase of services;  that,  in

fact, they have made very good progress indeed and

that if there is any delay to be complained of, it

arises,  as  is  pointed out  in  the  development

report,  from  the fact that they  could  not  get

possession of the site for the City Exchange - there

is  a lengthy reference to this. I say that it  is

rather   an  unjust  thing  to  attack  a   public

corporation, which is doing an extremely good  job

of  work  and  going ahead very much  faster  than

could have been expected,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



without  referring to its own published statements

which fully justify its rate of progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to a complaint made

that  the  mechanical working of the  Exchange  is

unsatisfactory. Of course, it is  because,  as  is

pointed out in the Report which is included in the

development plan, the Central Exchange is  working

at 98 per cent loading, whereas 90 per cent is the

efficient limit. If the Exchange is overloaded  in

the  service  of the public, well, the  answer  is

that  it  is  better  to give as  many  people  as

possible  a  telephone line even  though  it  does

sometimes get crossed with someone else's than  to

cut  down the total load and give a smaller number

a  perfect  service. As soon as they can  get  the

City  Exchange through, I think we shall find that

we  stop  getting crossed lines and that  kind  of

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)

wanted clarification about the unified bus system.

Well,  he  has been promised a White Paper.  I  am

anxious  that  there should be  clarification  and

that there should be an ample opportunity for  the

public  and  Members  of the Opposition  to  fully

study  the situation and get it thoroughly  talked

over and I hope that we shall have a good interval

between the publication of the White Paper and the

time that we take a debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass over a complaint about the widening of Yio

Chu  Kang  Road as that has already been mentioned

by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hon. Member wanted clarification about

protection from floods at Bedok. This was given in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 21 of 1955. Reference  to

page  6  will  indicate the measure of protection.

These  protective works are substantially complete

apart  from  the few points which are waiting  for

the  earth that has been lifted out of the  swampy

grounds  to  dry  out  before  the  works  can  be

completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might very briefly give an account of

the  six  major flood prevention schemes which  we

now  have  in the report form. There is  the  main

drainage  at  Bedok  and  Ketapang  catchments  at

$523,000; the main drainage at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



Geylang  River catchment at $1,872,000; Bedok  is,

as  I  said,  substantially complete  and  we  are

hoping  to  start  on  Geylang  as  soon  as  this

Assembly  has  voted the first instalment  of  the

money.  There  is  the drainage  of  the  Whampoa,

Kallang  and  Seletar catchments about  which  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  made  a  considerable

muddle.  That  is estimated at an all-in  cost  of

just under $16 million. There is the main drainage

of  the catchments at the Bukit Timah and Stamford

Canals  at  about $9½ million; the catchments  at

the  Singapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan  at  $3

million,  and the Sungei Api Api and  Tampenis  at

about $1,865,000. I should stress that these costs

are  in relation to the drainage works and do  not

take into account the cost of land acquisition  or

possible demolitions of houses which would come to

a  very  large  further sum. I am hoping  that  we

shall  table these reports fairly soon and it  may

be  helpful if we publish a White Paper as well so

that  those  who  do not want to  read  the  whole

reports can at least read the White Paper and  get

the general principles and the general problems of

flood prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress that although one has the technical

answer,  one still has to carry out the works  and

find  the money. The total for the drainage  works

alone  is somewhere about $32 million and  if  you

add to that the cost of land acquisition, it is  a

formidable sum and you are going to have to  raise

a  lot  of  money for it. The flood  programme  is

phased  into  the  general  development  programme

which  will  be tabled soon and there will  be  an

opportunity to discuss it then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint was on the lack of details

regarding  the  large economies mentioned  in  His

Excellency's Address. I might illustrate  this,  I

think,  but  it is worth while, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

before I go on to relate details of the economies,

to  set  them  in  perspective by  mentioning  the

building costs on which the economies have  to  be

made. Back in 1940, you could build for 30 cents a

cubic foot. In quoting these figures, I am quoting

for  the  type of buildings that the Public  Works

Department  does  according  to  their   type   of

construction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



You  can  always change your figures if you  leave

something  out or if you use a different  type  of

construction. In 1953, costs were 74 cents a cubic

foot,  82 cents a cubic foot in 1954. 96  cents  a

cubic foot last year, and then up to $1.06 a cubic

foot  this  year. That is in relation broadly  to

wage  rises in Singapore as a result of the upward

movement  of wages, the Labour Ordinance and  that

kind  of  thing  and  also to  rises  in  imported

materials like cement or structural steel  due  to

wage increases in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachers Training College deserves a mention

for  savings, I think. The first six items on  the

College for which contracts are already let or  in

hand  totalled  $760,000. They  are  now  down  to

$613,000;  there  is a saving of  earthworks  from

$350,000 to $107,000 by adopting a different  plan

for earth-working; by changing the road plan, from

$½ million down to $35,000 - that kind of figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For primary schools, we got a handsome saving

indeed. The previous type of school - 16 classes, 40

pupils  each - cost $14,781 per class room or  $370

per  pupil.  We  got the cost  down  for  the  new

standard  primary school - 3 stream  type - to  $9,500

per  class  room or $238 per pupil which  I  think

hon. Members will agree is a handsome economy. For

the   accommodation   for  student   nurses,   the

accommodation per nurse has come down from  $6,400

to $4,000 - another handsome economy - due, primarily,

to  better planning and, secondarily, to reduction

in  the  standards.  Broadly speaking,  over  this

year,  I think we shall show savings in cost - I  am

not  talking  of the savings which  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary refers to when he transfers  a

bill from one year to the next but actual lowering

of total costs - on final construction of about $2½

million  on  a  building programme  of  about  $30

million,  so  that that again is a  very  handsome

overall economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are anxious to get on with the taking of the

vote  on this matter. I think I will rest on these

points, Mr Speaker, Sir, as I am afraid my  other

points of interest are rather higher level matters

which cannot be dealt with except at some length.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, time is running short and I need not take  up

the  time of the Assembly unnecessarily. There are

two points which I should like to clarify, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng)

mentioned  this  morning that during  my  election

campaign,  I  promised to reduce  the  rentals  of

S.I.T. houses in Singapore. Well, Sir, this is not

so. In fact, it is a deliberate lie on the part of

the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the word "lie"? I

am not quite certain.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to withdraw the word "lie". It  is  a

mistake  on the part of the Member for Queenstown.

When  the  last Government decided to  reduce  the

rents  of  S.I.T. houses, it was the intention  of

Government to try and help those who are really in

need  of help and not for people who live in cheap

S.I.T. houses  and who can afford  huge  American

limousines.  There is going to be no subsidisation

of rentals for these types of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I was going to raise, Sir,

was  in  connection with the eviction  of  farmers

from  private  land. The Master Plan in  Singapore

has  earmarked  over 25,000 acres of  land  as  an

agricultural  zone,  and  within  this  zone,  the

farmers  will  have sufficient protection  against

landlords   who,   because  their   land   is   so

restricted, will not be able to exploit  it  other

than    for    agricultural   purposes.   However,

Government  is  well aware of the hardships  which

harry  the  farmers  and I can  say  that  careful

consideration is being given by Government to  the

criticisms    directed   against    the    present

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, in reply, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am indeed very happy to hear  from

Members  of the Opposition in response to my  call

for  a vote of confidence that the Government  has

their  support.  I  would like  to  give  them  my

assurance  that,  during  the  intervening  period

before  the reopening of the constitutional  talks

in  London,  the Government will do everything  in

its  power to bring about a state of affairs  that

will be not only conducive to success but also  in

the best interests of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday. Sir, that in the fight for

Merdeka,  let us not play party politics  and  yet

the  leader of the People's Action Party said that

his  Party  would give me their vote of confidence

if  I agreed to his three conditions. Sir, let  me

say  here and now, and in the most emphatic terms:

I  will  not  bargain nor will I buy any  vote  of

confidence.  The cause to which the Government  is

pledged,  to which all of us are pledged,  demands

of  each  and every one of us, no matter to  which

political  Party we belong, every ounce of  honest

endeavour  to  promote united  effort  and  united

action.  I  explained  with all  sincerity  in  my

speech yesterday the reasons that impel me to call

for  a  vote  of  confidence. I ask  the  People's

Action Party to examine their conscience and  vote

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now, Sir, examine the three conditions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to call for a national convention;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to plan the tactics for the next talks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to plan concerted and united All-Party

constitutional  action  if  the  next  talks

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against this, Sir, permit me to repeat what I

said yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been silent, and deliberately so, on our

plans for Merdeka because I feel a new strategy is

called  for as a result of experience gained  over

the failure of the last talks. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



time  we  must plan and plan well so that  we  can

negotiate  from  a position of strength.  In  this

planning,  there will, of course, be consultations

with  Members  of the Opposition with  a  view  to

united  effort and united action. Let us not  play

party  politics  in  this  great  task.  Let   us,

however, show that as true Malayans we are  united

in the fight for Merdeka because in unity we beget

our strength and in unity we brook no failure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any dissimilarity between the two? I can

see no dissimilarity other than the difference  in

the  choice  of  words. What  I  have  quoted  are

conditions  which  I  feel  will  beget   success.

Obviously, the P.A.P. feel the same way. Why  then

have they found it necessary to turn my conditions

for  success, which I announced in my main  speech

yesterday,  into  their conditions  which  I  must

accept  before  they can give  me  their  vote  of

confidence? Why, why, why? I am indeed puzzled.  I

assured   hon.   Members  that   there   will   be

consultations  with the Opposition in  drawing  up

plans  for  the  next talks. I have not  disclosed

what form these consultations will take but if  it

will  make  the  People's  Action  Party  any  the

happier,  let  me say that the representatives  Of

all  political  Parties in this Assembly  will  be

called  to attend a conference to draw up  a  plan

for Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leader of the People's Action Party

repeatedly said yesterday that we are a  caretaker

Government.  Let  me explain,  Sir,  our  position

clearly  so that there can be no misunderstanding.

This  Government is not a caretaker Government  in

the accepted sense of the word. This Government is

a  caretaker Government in so far as its  life  is

concerned.  We aim to reopen talks  in  London  by

April 1957. If we succeed, a new constitution will

come into being. If we fail, the purpose for which

I accepted office as Chief Minister will have come

to  an end but during the intervening period,  the

machinery of Government will be in full swing  and

whether we govern wisely or not, time will tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our efforts to raise a

Singapore Battalion and our call to the people  of

Singapore to come forward to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



serve  Singapore  have been decried  by  the  hon.

Member,  and  all these from a man who  claims  to

have  a  great love for his country. What  greater

love,  what greater loyalty, has a man  than  this

that  he  should serve his country, fight for  his

country  and,  if necessary, die for his  country?

What   better  guarantee  have  we  for   internal

security  than  that  we should  raise  our  armed

forces to augment the Police Force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Malayanisation, as is to be expected, the hon.

Member  talked  and talked just for  the  sake  of

talking,  not caring for the language he used  nor

for  the justification of his remarks. Did he  not

read  the Report of the Malayanisation Commission?

Did  he  not  know that in that Report,  abolition

terms  are  recommended? When the  Government  has

completed  detailed study of the Report  and  when

negotiations with staff associations on  terms  of

abolition have been completed, these will be  made

known  to  the Assembly and the hon.  Member  will

have  every  opportunity to speak to  his  heart's

content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as Minister for Labour and Welfare, I

will answer briefly the points which he raised  in

connection with this Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revision of the Trade Disputes Ordinance,

I do not propose any amendment for the time being.

This Government cannot ignore the fact that in the

immediate past, strikes of a political nature  had

been threatened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rights of trade unions to collect

political  funds,  I assure the hon.  Member  that

this has not been forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Labour Ordinace, I have been considering

various  amendments to this Ordinance as a  result

of  experience gained over the past  eight  months

and  I will introduce an amending Bill when I have

completed my examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance, I am

aware of the points raised by the hon. Member  and

they are at present under active consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to workers in the Armed Forces,

obviously  the  hon.  Member and  two  other  hon.

Members who spoke on the same subject are  not  in

full possession of the facts. Workers in the Armed

Forces  are  covered by the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance,  the Labour Ordinance and  the  Central

Provident Fund and will be covered under  the  two

Bills  which I introduced yesterday and will still

be   covered  under  any  legislation  which  this

Government  introduces  in  the  future.  In   any

proposed labour legislation, there surely must  be

consultations  between  employers   and   workers'

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of unemployment, Sir, the hon.

Member  spoke  about  unemployment  insurance  and

increase  in  the  rates of  unemployment  relief.

Paragraph  43, Sir, of the Governor's  Address  is

quite  clear on this. The hon. Member also  stated

that  no  strike had brought about the closing  of

any factory. May I remind the hon. Member that the

Mis-Sino   Company  Limited,  manufacturing   soft

drinks, had to close down their factory last  year

as  a  result  of strike action organised  by  the

Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that the Governor's Address

is  all blah, blah, blah. May I, Sir, respectfully

submit that during the two hours when he had  been

speaking he had been blah, blah, blahing away?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other points which have been

raised   by  other  Members  on  the  subject   of

community centres and youth clubs. I would  assure

hon.  Members  that I will look  into  the  points

raised by them.
