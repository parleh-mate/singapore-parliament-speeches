   <b>(Emplacement on salary scale for Education Officer, Group III)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education if he will consider the emplacement of those stagnated teachers, who have done ten years' continuous service in the teaching Profession, on the salary scale for Education Officer, Group III.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, teachers whose salaries stagnate at certain points on the Education Officer/Group III (EO/III) salary scale are either untrained or under-qualified. Among the teachers considered under-qualified are those trained under other schemes. For those untrained they may be considered for full emplacement on the EO/III salary scale if they obtain a Certificate-in-Education through part-time studies at the Institute of Education. For the under-qualified and the trained under other schemes teachers they may be considered for full emplacement on the EO/III salary scale if they had completed 10 years' service and found suitable through interviews. Such under-qualified and trained under other schemes teachers may also be considered for full emplacement on the EO/III salary scale if they had 10 years' service and obtained three GCE 'O' level passes, one of which must be the language of instruction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are adequate avenues for teachers stagnated at certain points on the EO/III salary scale to be fully emplaced at that salary scale, my Ministry does not consider it appropriate to emplace such teachers fully on 10 years' continuous service alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would be most grateful if the Minister could enlighten the House as to how many teachers in this category were
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> involved, how many of them got through and were emplaced on the EO/III salary scale ($1,030) by the Public Service Commission after an interview, and how many of them through self-development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were originally 1,439 teachers in this category. Of this number, 1,003 were emplaced after an interview and 203 were emplaced after they had obtained three 'O' level passes. To-date there are 1,206 such teachers who have been emplaced on the EO/III salary scale. There are now still stagnating 233 teachers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figures show that there is only about one per cent of the total teaching population who have not been emplaced in the EO/III salary scale. It is about 50%, in fact not even halt compared to those who have been promoted recently in the promotion exercise. I would suggest to the Minister that he should discuss with the Minister for Finance, and not to pass the buck, that these teachers should be seriously considered for emplacement on the EO/III salary scale, say, on the basis of 12 or even 15 years of service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My argument is this. Would the Minister agree that even if these teachers were emplaced on the EO/III salary scale, not all of them, that is, the 200-odd teachers, would reach the maximum of their salary scale when they reach the age of retirement? As we have always been talking about respecting our elders, would the Minister agree that here is an avenue where we can prove that we really appreciate our elders. This lot of teachers are among the elders in the teaching profession, and they have contributed immensely to the teaching profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister also agree that by emplacing them on the EO/III salary scale, we can save them embarrassment or even nightmare, as put by one teacher by the surname of Lim who wrote to me hoping very much that a new deal could be given to them. We could once and for all erase these 200-odd "untouchables" of the teaching
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> profession. Even the untouchables have every expectation in their next incarnation - Shudrah, Waisya, Ksatria or even Brahmin.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that the teachers are certainly not considered "untouchables." In fact, in my answer just now, I have said that there are now adequate avenues whereby these teachers can be emplaced on the EO/III salary scale. In fact, out of 1,439 such teachers, 1,206 have already been emplaced through these avenues. There is no reason why the rest of them cannot be emplaced through these avenues. I do not think the Ministry can do more than what has already been done.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the teachers, that is, more than 1,000 of them, have been emplaced through self-development, i.e. they have obtained three 'O' level passes, and not through interviews by the PSC. Secondly, these teachers are getting old. Age can sometimes catch up with a person and there is then no more vigour to learn. That is why I would like the Minister to consider, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance, whether a continuous service of 12 years or even 15 years will be given consideration in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my reply is that we would certainly like to encourage these teachers to develop themselves further. It is good for the Ministry to encourage them to self-develop, and the Ministry can recognise it by emplacing them on a higher salary scale through the present avenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister be able to say how many teachers from the English stream are in this category, as my union would be interested in helping them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not able to give details as to how many of them are from the Malay stream, English stream or the Chinese stream. If the Member for Moulmein is interested, I shall supply him with the particulars.

  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education whether he is aware that library facilities in primary and secondary schools and junior colleges are inadequate and if he will take steps to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the library facilities in schools are being developed and improved upon. This will have to be carried out in stages. For existing schools, a programme has been initiated for both the extension of physical facilities and the improvement of book collection. In January 1977, the Ministry implemented a School Library Development Project whereby library grants were made available to all existing primary schools to establish central libraries and to all secondary schools which need to expand their library facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For new schools, plans have been incorporated in their designs to set up fully-equipped central libraries. Besides the improvement in the physical facilities, the Ministry is rendering services to the schools by training the school library co-ordinators to improve their skills in the running of school libraries. With the flexibility now granted on the use of School Funds, principals may exercise their discretion to use the Funds for library development.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education whether his Ministry will review its present policy of requiring teachers seeking confirmation of service to pass Malay Standard 1, and whether equivalent qualification in Chinese, Tamil or English will also be deemed acceptable, so that a teacher, seeking confirmation, can offer in addition to his first language qualification one of the remaining three languages as the additional language requirement.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is reviewing the Education Scheme of Service and the requirement to pass Malay Standard I for confirmation is one of the matters in the Scheme which is under review.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Government officers in the Education Service are required to pass Malay Standard I for confirmation. This cannot be substituted by another official language. However, the requirement to pass Malay may be waived if the work and conduct of the teachers during their probation have been very good.

   <b>TRANSFER OF TEACHERS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education (a) how many teachers were transferred in the last three months; (b) how many of those transferred had not asked for transfer themselves and what was the basis of selection of such teachers for transfer; (c) how many of those who had asked for transfer were not transferred; and (d) how many were transferred to schools more than 10 kilometres from their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of teachers transferred in the last three months was 1,567 and out of this number 1,001 teachers were transferred owing to necessity and not because they had applied for transfer. It is not possible to consider all requests for transfer. Some teachers do not meet the requirements of the schools to which they wish to be transferred or the schools in question do not have vacancies to be filled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the factors taken into consideration when selecting teachers for transfer are -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) matching of the specific needs of receiving schools to the teachers' teaching subjects and language of instruction;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the ability of the sending schools to release the teachers - in cases where teachers are key digits, the schools are reluctant to release them; and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) proximity of teachers' homes to schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teachers who applied for transfer in the last three months but who were not transferred was 873.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teachers who were transferred to schools more than 10 km from their homes in the last three months was 267.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every effort is made to post teachers to schools as close to their homes as possible, it must be appreciated that often teachers may be posted to schools which are 6 km or more from their homes. This is because in certain areas such as Katong and Marine Parade there is an over abundance of teacher; living there in relation to the available posts while in places like Jurong and Lim Chu Kang there are far more teaching posts available than there are teachers living there. Other factors such as matching the teachers' own abilities and preferences to the schools' requirements add to this problem.

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education (a) how many clerical employees of some aided Chinese schools in the rural area have become unemployed following the closure of the schools recently; (b) why the Ministry of Education cannot employ them in some of the schools which have newly been opened; and (c) whether an assurance can be given to similar employees of schools which are still functioning that they will not suffer the same fate if their schools are closed, as they have been feeling insecure and demoralised since the retrenchments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1976, six clerks were rendered redundant. Three were given alternative postings to other Government-aided schools where vacancies existed. One refused redeployment and two had their services terminated because they could not be redeployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, although nine aided Chinese schools closed down, only two clerks were rendered redundant. The two clerks were redeployed to other Government-aided schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry helps to redeploy the clerks by posting them to other aided schools where vacancies exist. Where no such vacancies exist and the clerks meet the minimum educational qualifications for appointment to the Government General Clerical Service, their cases are referred to the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service Commission for absorption into the General Clerical Service to serve in the newly opened Government schools. In the event they cannot be absorbed into the General Clerical Service, their services have to be terminated. Every possible assistance has been and will continue to be given by my Ministry to redeploy the redundant aided school clerks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered the most important part of my question. Can the Minister give an assurance whether similar employees of schools which are still functioning will not suffer the same fate if their schools are closed down? I insist upon an assurance from the Minister because employees of Chinese-aided schools are between 45 and 50 years old and the employment market for this age-group is very thin.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, although the assurance has not been specifically spelt out, the fact that the Ministry is doing its best to redeploy some of these redundant school clerks is itself concrete evidence of what the Ministry is doing. That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is better than a specific assurance from the Ministry. What the Ministry has done for these redundant clerks, to my mind, is a better assurance than any statement by the Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister said that in 1976 two clerical employees had their services
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Ministry can only give an assurance that it will do its best to redeploy these clerks. It cannot guarantee them a job. I do not think the Ministry can guarantee that these clerks who have been found redundant will be given jobs. The Ministry can only try to do its best and has done what it could for these clerks.

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that if the Government had not taken over these aided Chinese schools, in the event of retrenchment these clerks would have been paid retrenchment benefits?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these clerks who are affected are from Government aided schools. The Government has not taken over the schools. It is still aiding these schools. In fact, the clerks are employed by the aided schools. They are not employed by the Government. So the question as to whether the Government has taken over or has not taken over the aided schools does not arise. The Member for Khe Bong should know that, as far as clerks in Government schools are concerned, they are recruited by the Public Service Commission and they must satisfy the requirements of the Government General Clerical Service. But in this case these clerks are employees of the aided schools and they are still the responsibility of the aided schools. Whether they are given retrenchment benefits or not, it is not the responsibility of the Government. It is the responsibility of the aided schools.

  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in view of the consolidation of 1973-77 National Wages Council allowances into salary scales for civil servants, if he will consider revising the existing fixed leave allowances under the 1973 Leave Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Civil Service Leave Scheme was amended in 1973 to allow civil servants to commute their vacation and medical leave into pay, the matter was discussed with unions representing the public service. Explicit agreement was reached that the rates of leave allowances would remain fixed and unchanged, notwithstanding any subsequent general salary revisions. The compensation for deducted vacation leave was at the rate of one day's pay for each day of vacation leave whilst for medical leave, the rate of one day's pay for six days medical leave. The quantum of leave allowance, using the factor of 286 work:ing days per year, worked out to percentages of salary, ranging from 6% to 10% for Division I to Division IV officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Leave Scheme was effective from January 1973. The first payment of NWC allowances was in July 1973. Hence, NWC allowances did not feature in the computation of the Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be wrong to revise the leave allowances with every revision of salaries. It would leave the matter open for all time and place an onerous liability on public funds. My Ministry is therefore not prepared to consider any revision of leave allowances under the 1973 Leave Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Senior Minister of State explained that it would be wrong to revise the leave allowances, and I think it is right. But I want to know why newly recruited clerks are getting $30 leave allowance when the old clerks are getting only $20. Can the Senior Minister of State enlighten me on this?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I am not aware that newly recruited clerks are given $30 leave allowance while old ones are given $20 leave allowance. I thought that the quantum of compensation was fixed in 1973 and new recruits are given the option to either opt for the old scheme including the leave eligibility applicable under the old scheme or the new scheme with the leave allowances fixed in 1973.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I do understand what it means. But I am talking about a situation where there could be an anomaly between the leave allowances paid to new clerks and old clerks. That is the reason why I have tabled the question on whether the Minister will consider revising the leave allowances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These discussions will include the form that the Trade Development Council should take and the financial and operational aspects of the Council. These have to be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that the Council, when formed, will begin on a proper and effective footing. A properly organised and operated Trade Development Council should be of great help in promoting exports from Singapore. In this connection, the Government believes that to ensure the success of the Council, the private sector must be closely involved both in funding as well as in the running of the Council. Indeed, one of the main reasons for setting up the Trade Development Council must be that it will receive the benefit of private enterprise and initiative.

  <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider introducing amending legislation to exempt non-working retired persons from income tax as this will enable the Government indirectly to look after their welfare during retirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, for resident pensioners, some measure of relief is already provided since half of the pension is tax exempt. However, a non-working retired person may also derive substantial investment income in the form of dividends, interest, rents and so on. If such a person were exempted from paying income tax, he would be better off than another person who has to continue working after reaching normal retirement age because of financial needs. To encourage pensioners to continue working, our tax laws provide enhanced relief for them. Thus an individual who is above 55 but below 60 years of age is entitled to an earned income relief of $2,000, while an individual who has attained the age
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of 60 will get a relief of $3,000 instead of the usual relief of $1,000. This has the effect of encouraging persons who attain normal retirement age to continue to be gainfully employed. The exemption of non-working retired persons would be contrary to the rationale behind the granting of enhanced earned income relief.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Finance what the Economic Activation Committee has contributed towards the economy of the Republic since the formation of the Committee and to what extent it has assisted industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, the Economic Activation Committee (EAC) was formed in November 1974. In the industrial sector, the EAC improved inter-Ministry coordination in matters such as planning approval, compliance with fire safety, environmental, anti-pollution and other requirements to facilitate speedy implementation of industrial investment projects in the Economic Development Board (EDB) pipeline.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EAC has also assisted industries by obtaining temporary exemption from the 10% tax on Public Utilities Board (PUB) bills for firms consuming between 100,000 to 400,000 megawatts of electricity monthly. This concession which is normally available to industries consuming more than 400,000 megawatts per month has been in effect since 1st April 1975. As at September 1977, 72 companies were enjoying this concession. In addition, more than 20 export oriented companies were granted waiver of the declared demand charge by the PUB between March 1975 to December 1976. The PUB has also adopted a scheme to spread out the payments for the maximum demand charge incurred during the first six months of operation of certain specialised energy-intensive industries such as foundries, electroplating and heat treatment plants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stimulate the construction sector, the EAC has drawn up priority lists of public
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sector projects for resettlement action in order that these projects could be speedily carried out. This has helped to maintain the momentum of public sector construction activity. To assist the private residential property sector, the Committee was instrumental in obtaining exemption from the Residential Property Act for foreigners purchasing apartments in blocks of flats of at least six storeys. This concession has also been extended to units in approved condominium developments. Furthermore, foreigners of economic benefit to Singapore are being liberally permitted to buy houses occupying up to 15,000 square feet of land for their own occupation in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To intensify Singapore's export promotion efforts, the EAC encouraged the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to open a special rediscount window for export bills. This came into operation on 1st May 1975 to provide cheaper financing for manufacturers and traders. $200 million was provided by the MAS to be rolled over every three months (or $800 million a year) at a preferential rate fixed at 7% in May 1975 and subsequently reduced in line with the falling interest rates to the present level of 3 1/2% The monthly average transactions for the last six months of 1977 was $108 million as compared to a total of $50 million in the first six months of the scheme. A further stimulus to export promotion was given with the incorporation of the Export Credit Insurance Corporation which commenced operation in August 1976 to protect Singapore exporters against a range of commercial and political risks. By December 1977, 127 policies with a total face value of $375 million had been issued. All in all, the EAC has been active.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, it is premature to refer to SIA's Concorde service as "short-lived" or "cancelled".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of traffic rights falls outside the province of my Ministry. Concorde overflight is a matter for the British and Malaysian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Airlines does not believe it has suffered any "embarrassment" or "loss of prestige" from the suspension of Concorde services. It is a victim of circumstances. It will continue to improve air services into and out of Singapore for Singaporeans and other residents of the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not prepared to answer the question on the amount of money spent by SIA on publicising its Concorde service. I hope that the hon.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State seems to have evaded the salient point in this issue in his reply and, that is, as much as it was the job of the British Government to obtain clearance of foreign air space, was it also not the responsibility of SIA to ascertain that its partner in this joint venture was in a position to deliver the goods before signing a 10-year agreement?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the answer has been very explicit. That Concorde overflight is a matter for the British and Malaysian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, when the Hon. Senior Minister of State says that the financial losses are too sensitive, to be revealed, does he mean that the losses were therefore far from minimal?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, that was never implied.

  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, the Jurong Town Corporation has informed me that when the discolouration of water was first detected, extensive tests and investigations were conducted immediately to ascertain the causes of the discolouration. It was found that discolouration was due to the high saline content of water from the Kranji-Pandan reservoirs which causes rapid erosion and deterioration of the cast-iron pipes and the water tanks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was decided to replace the cast-iron pipes with cement-lined pipes for about 118 apartment blocks affected by the discolouration. At the same time, it was decided to repaint about 330 water tanks with anti-corrosive paint. Replacement and repainting work began in October 1977 and will be completed by September 1978. It will cost altogether $1.4 million. The replacement of cast-iron pipes has already been completed in 47 apartment blocks with replacement works in another 16 blocks nearing completion. The remaining apartment blocks will be completed by June 1978. When these remedial measures are completed, discolouration of potable water supplied to Jurong residents should be eliminated.

  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is true that there were some isolated interruptions to the supply during the initial teething period of commissioning of the pumping equipment at the flats, but the Jurong Town Corporation has since rectified the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no major odour problem in the use of industrial water produced by the Ministry of the Environment. The JTC flushes and washes the effluent water tanks regularly.

  <b>Mr Lim Chee Onn</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether his Ministry has examined the cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of trade or commercial offices located overseas and/or upgrading those already in existence, in order to promote our exports; and (b) what other plans his Ministry has to assist our manufacturers in further diversifying their exports to new markets and in responding quickly to overseas demand for new products.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, the Department of Trade has so far established only three overseas trade offices. These are in New York, Bonn and Tokyo, to help Singapore manufacturers gain larger shares of the American, German and Japanese markets. As they have been set up only since 1975. it is too early to assess their precise cost-effectiveness. However, since 1976, our Commercial Secretaries at home and abroad have helped our manufacturers participate in 14 international trade fairs and 11 trade missions abroad. Initial orders received through contacts made at these fairs and during the trade missions amounted to $116 million. Encouraged by these initial successes, more and more of our manufacturers and exporters are making use of the services of our Commercial Secretaries, which can be regarded as an indication of their growing effectiveness. Singapore is becoming increasingly known as an additional and, in some cases, an alternative source of supply in the Far East for manufactured products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main limiting factor in increasing or upgrading overseas trade offices is the shortage of well qualified and experienced staff. Newly recruited Commercial Secretaries have to undergo a two-year intensive on-the-job training in the Department of Trade to enable them to understand and appreciate the strength, as well as the weakness, of the products of Singapore industries. Only such knowledge
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would enable them to effectively serve our manufacturers in finding new markets when they are posted overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Trade will, however, continue to send small recce missions abroad to investigate the potential of new markets, and only when such potential has been clearly identified, will more new trade offices be established overseas. Such trade offices cost about $150,000 each a year to run.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to part (b), this year, more trade missions will be sent to the major existing markets in the USA, the European Economic Community (EEC), Japan and West Asia, where demand exists for high quality products. Teams will also be sent to investigate market potential in Africa, the Pacific Islands and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of overseas trade offices is only one of several instruments used in promoting our exports in existing and new markets. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) offers export financing at attractive rates under the MAS Export Re-discounting Scheme, while the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of Singapore provides insurance against political and commercial risks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in my reply earlier to a Question from the Member for Jalan Kayu, discussions are now currently taking place between the Government and the Joint Standing Committee of the Chambers of Commerce and the Singapore Manufacturers' Association on the establishment of a Trade Development Council. A properly organised and operated Trade Development Council, with close involvement by the private sector, will greatly help in promoting exports.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government will continue to do its best to encourage trade expansion through exports, our efforts must be matched by the active participation of manufacturers and exporters. If the direct marketing effort is lacking, no amount of Government support can make up for it. Some of ,our local
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font>

  <br> manufacturing companies, admittedly too few, have been able to increase their exports to West Asia many fold through selling missions and sheer perseverance. Successful marketing requires an intimate knowledge of the market, which can only be acquired through direct selling by the manufacturer or exporter himself. In the final analysis, it is the tenacious manufacturer, with competitively priced high quality products, who will penetrate and hold new markets.

   <b>(Fixing of sound attenuators to amplifiers)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.
  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs to explain the recent action taken by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura in fixing sound attenuators to amplifiers used in mosques.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fixing of sound attenuators to reduce the loudness of amplification of the call to prayers or Azan from mosques is part of Government's Community Noise Abatement programme aimed at controlling community noise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound levels in modern living - from a large variety of sources - are increasing. In combination or individually loud sounds are disturbing and even harmful. Researches have shown that there is a direct relationship between growing tension and noise levels of urban living. It is, therefore, necessary for the Government to control the volume of sound amplification systems in public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government's policy on sound amplification affects not only mosques, but also Chinese wayangs, Chinese temples, Hindu temples, churches and all public gatherings where sound amplification systems are used. Amplifiers used at such places or on such occasions are to be fitted with sound attenuators by SISIR.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials from the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and my Ministry have been testing different levels of sound amplification for the Azan and decided that an acceptable sound level for the broadcasting of the Azan from mosque external loudspeakers is 60 dB measured from a distance of 10 metres from the sound sources. This sound level is neither too soft nor too loud. Tests of this sound level confirmed that the Azan can be heard clearly from a distance of 100 metres (or approximately 110 yards) from the mosque.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS officials are visiting mosques to explain to Mosque Management Committees the reasons for fixing sound attenuators to control the decibel levels of external loudspeakers of mosques. Almost all mosques have accepted the reasons and have been cooperative. To-date, 61 sound attenuators have been fixed. Sound attenuators are not required for 21 mosques which do not have loudspeakers mounted externally. The exercise has been completed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate that the fixing of sound attenuators is merely to fix the volume of sound amplification of external loudspeakers of mosques to 60 dB measured from a distance of 10 metres. Since 15th August 1977, my Ministry has arranged for the Azan to be broadcast by Radio Singapore five times a day. This has meant re-starting up the station about an hour earlier than its normal broadcasting time in order, to be on the air before the first Azan.

   <b>COMPLAINTS AGAINST CIVIL SERVANTS</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs (a) how many written complaints of discourtesy and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> unhelpfulness against civil servants were received by the Central Complaints Bureau from the general public in 1975, 1976 and 1977; (b) whether the complaints have been thoroughly investigated and what disciplinary action has been taken against the guilty ones; (c) what measures have been taken to improve the situation; and (d) how many letters complimenting civil servants were received from the public in those three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1977, the Central Complaints Bureau received 42 complaints of discourtesy and unhelpfulness against civil servants - 37 regarding discourtesy and five regarding unhelpfulness on the part of civil servants. The corresponding number of complaints in 1975 was 34 consisting of 29 on discourtesy and five on unhelpfulness and for 1976, there were 19 cases consisting of 17 on discourtesy and two on unhelpfulness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All complaints received by the Bureau are assessed and thoroughly investigated. The Bureau, while ensuring that civil servants are protected from malicious and frivolous complaints, never hesitates to take action against any civil servant who has failed to discharge his duties properly. Complaints against Police and Armed Forces personnel are referred by the Bureau to the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Armed Forces respectively which conduct their own investigations. The Bureau monitors the outcome of such investigations to ensure that appropriate action has been taken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the complaints against civil servants for discourtesy and unhelpfulness received in 1975, 1976 and 1977, disciplinary action was taken against five cases in 1975, six in 1976 and nine in 1977. One case received in 1976 resulted in the dismissal of the officer. The other cases resulted in written warnings issued to the officers involved. The Bureau is presently taking disciplinary action against four cases received in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the measures to reduce the incidence of discourtesy in the civil service, the Bureau has, since 1974, started to deploy its officers to observe various Government and statutory bodies which have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> frequent dealings with the public. It conducted 1,020 visits in 1976 and 1,048 visits in 1977. Besides observing the way officers at the counters treat members of the public, an assessment of the facilities such as directional signs, cleanliness of the waiting areas, etc, available for the public, is also made. Where applicable, reports of such visits are sent to Heads of departments for corrective action to be taken. This service rendered by the Bureau is accepted by various Heads of departments who are quite appreciative of the visits conducted by the Bureau. The Bureau received 19 letters of appreciation in 1975, 19 in 1976 and nine in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau received two letters from members of the public complimenting the work and conduct of civil servants in 1975, three in 1976 and four in 1977.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs (a) whether the rates of public assistance can be increased to meet the present escalating cost of living, as many of the recipients consider the amount granted inadequate; (b) what was the number of recipients of public assistance as at 31st December, 1977: (c) how many of them were (i) below 40 years; (ii) between 40 and 60 years; and (iii) above 60 years of age; and (d) whether regular reviews are made to determine the continued eligibility of the recipients of such assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rates of Public Assistance allowances were last revised upward by 40% in March 1976 in view of the substantial increase in the prices of essential consumer commodities since
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> January 1973 when they were previously revised. Since March 1976, there has not been much change in the consumer price index and it is felt that any proposal for a further increase of the Public Assistance allowance rates would be difficult to justify at this time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recipients of Public Assistance allowances are eligible for a number of other benefits besides the financial assistance itself. They are eligible for free medical treatment at Government hospitals and clinics and even the fares for transport when they seek such medical treatment. They are also considered for financial assistance from various trust funds, benevolent societies, voluntary organisations and community groups as well as the assistance they get from friends and relatives. During festive seasons, community centres and Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) also distribute food parcels, cash and other gifts to Public Assistance recipients who reside in the constituencies served by these community centres and the CCCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Assistance allowance is meant to provide temporary relief to those who are incapacitated and are unable to work or help themselves for one reason or other.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not pretended that the allowances provide for the total needs of recipients. Every effort is made to discourage continued dependence on welfare aid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st December 1977, there were 6,397 households in receipt of Public Assistance. The age groups into which the heads of these households fall are as follows:
  <pre>
   Head of household below 40
      years                            428
   Head of household between
      40 and 60 years                  977
   Head of household above 60
      years                          4,992

                          Total      6,397
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member for Changi that the Public Assistance Section of the Social Welfare Department does conduct regular reviews of the cases to determine their continued eligibility for assistance.

  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head H be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3090.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to seek further clarification and elucidation on the need to vote this sum of $330,120 incurred by the Attorney-General's Chambers because of the increase in the number and seriousness of accidents involving Government vehicles and because of unforeseen expenditure incurred in London in respect of extradition proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that much debate had been generated in previous Budget sessions concerning accidents involving Government vehicles. Therefore, because of the increase in the number and seriousness of accidents involving Government vehicles, a sum of $30,210 is being sought for to meet necessary payment, I would like to request the Hon. Minister concerned for details on this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) How many incidents have there been and the degree of seriousness in the current fiscal year?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What is the number of Government vehicles involved?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Which are the departments involved in these accidents?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) What is the sum required for?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) What are the comparative figures on accidents involving Government vehicles in the last three years and the extent of expenditure incurred?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Has there been a lowering in the standard of the performance on the part of the drivers in the Government departments concerned?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) whether any disciplinary action has been taken against the erring drivers?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may interest the House to know that I have had occasions to notice Government vehicles, for example, the Ministry of the Environment's garbage trucks, speeding and overtaking each other along Tampines Road without due regard to the other road users.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The Hon. Minister may reply that I am exaggerating and request me to furnish particulars, etc. But what I have said is true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures does the Hon. Minister propose to take to ensure that accidents involving Government vehicles are kept to the minimum?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the period from 1st April, 1977 to 20th February, 1978 there were altogether 1,514 accidents involving the same number of Government vehicles. Thirty-two departments were involved. A list of these departments showing the exact number of accidents and the exact number of vehicles for each department is with me and I will be pleased to hand it to the Member concerned. I do not think it is appropriate that I read it out here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $200,000 was originally voted for this item for expenditure on accidents involving Government vehicles. This sum is to meet the claims received against Government when Government vehicles are involved in accidents. The sum does not cover repairs to Government vehicles. The sum was found inadequate. Hence, the supplementary estimates for the additional sum of $30,210.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact figures of expenditure involving these vehicles for the lest three years are as follows: In 1975, there were 1,545 accidents and the amount spent was $196,339.62. In 1976 the number of accidents reduced to 1,373. But the amount spent on claims increased to $281,774.15. Last year the number of accidents increased to 1,819 and the amount spent was $293,296.59.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drivers of Government vehicles are not only liable to criminal proceedings which may be initiated if they drive negligently or recklessly but they are also subject to disciplinary proceedings which are taken by the Government departments concerned in appropriate cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lorries of the Ministry of the Environment racing together, I did not know that there were hell-drivers in my Ministry. But it is difficult for me to investigate a general complaint like this. I will be pleased to start investigations if dates, places and numbers are given to me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other sum, perhaps I can deal with it briefly. The extradition proceedings started before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in London in January 1977. There was an appeal against the Magistrate's findings to the Divisional Court and a further appeal to the House of Lords against the Divisional Court's judgment. In these proceedings we engaged a Queen's Counsel, two junior Counsel as well as a London solicitor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the request for extradition, senior officers of the Attorney-General's Chambers had consultations with a Mr Ronald Waterhouse, Q.C., as to the adequacy of the evidence, the framing of the charges and other related matters. A total sum of $335,218.90 has so far been paid out as costs in respect of this case. A further supplementary provision will be needed to meet further costs. The appeal to the House of Lords which began on 25th January, 1978 lasted for more than 3 1/2 weeks. It was an epic legal battle and has gone on longer than any other appeal in that House within living memory. The House of Lords has reserved judgment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a trial in Singapore if Mr Tarling is extradited, and should there be an appeal by Mr Tarling from Singapore to the Privy Council, further supplementary provisions will be required to meet further claims or costs to meet all these legal fees. I hope I have satisfied the Member.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Hon. Minister has not answered my last question, i.e. what measures does he propose to take to ensure that accidents involving Government vehicles are kept to the minimum. If I have got his figures correctly, in 1976 and 1977 there was an increase of more than 30% in the number of accidents as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> well as in the payments. Before I withdraw my question, I will be grateful if the Minister can answer the last question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I have dealt with that question when I said that drivers who were negligent or reckless could be charged in court and that disciplinary proceedings would be taken. I do not propose to take other measures in my Ministry. I cannot speak for the other departments concerned. The Member may be interested to know that the majority of the accidents comes from the Armed Forces and the number of Government vehicles has been increasing over the years. So has the number of accidents. It does not mean that the standard of driving has gone down or that the drivers have become more negligent. It may also be of interest to the Member to know that second on the list of the drivers involved are those from the Ministry of the Environment. I will send him a copy of the list in a few minutes' time.

  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures "$214,500", "906,600", "$210,060" and "$2,450" appearing in the second column thereof and substituting therefor the figures "$224,900", "$873,680", "$219,450" and "$17,760" respectively.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provision for the Privy Purse (Class 1) by $10,400 to meet the 1977 NWC wage supplement. However, the salaries of Personal Staff (Class II) will decrease by $32,920 because of the reduction of eight daily-rated posts due to mechanisation of maintenance work in the Istana Domain.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase of $9,390 for Expenses of the Istana Household (Class III) is required mainly to meet rising costs of stores.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $17,760 has been provided under Special Services (Class IV) mainly for the purchase of an electric jet pump for watering plants in the nursery and the normal replacement of gardening equipment and office equipment and three colour television sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Singapore's Economy in 1977</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1977 was a difficult year. World economic recovery slowed down. The Gross National Product of the seven major countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) grew by only 4%, much
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lower than the 5.6% growth achieved in 1976. World trade grew at only 6%, half the pace of 1976. Weak economic growth and the easing of commodity prices helped to stabilise consumer prices. The rate of inflation in the OECD countries stabilised at around 7.25%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy grew by 7.8%, slightly higher than the 7% in 1976, and within our growth target of 6 to 8%. At current prices, growth was 10%. Growth was achieved with relative price stability. The GDP deflator rose by 2% compared with 1.8% in 1976. Owing largely to rising food prices, the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.2% against a drop of 1.9% in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth was led primarily by commerce and transportation which accounted for 64% of the increase of GDP. Manufacturing grew at a steady pace, contributing 20% to GDP growth. Most of the 33.5 thousand new jobs were found in the commerce and manufacturing sectors which employed 11,700 and 11,500 more persons respectively in 1977. As a result, unemployment fell to 3.9%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's external trade climbed by 18% to reach $45.6 billion. As exports increased faster than imports, the trade deficit narrowed by $700 million to $5.4 billion. Manufacturing output expanded by 15% to $17.6 billion. As a result, value added by industries grew by 8% in real terms. Growth was accounted for largely by the electronics and petroleum industries. There was some recovery in the oil rig equipment industry. Shipbuilding slackened further. However, ship repairing increased by 10%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitor arrivals increased by 14% to 1.5 million, helping the tourist sector to maintain its consistently good rate of growth. International banking continued to expand in Singapore with assets of the Asian Currency Units reaching S$49 billion. Singapore's balance of payments continued to be in surplus by $717 million due mainly to sustained capital inflows and the narrowing of the trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Singapore did well again in difficult international economic conditions shows the greater resilience of our more diversified economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Prospects for 1978</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World economic recovery which began in late 1976 was shortlived, turning sluggish from the second quarter of 1977. Consumer spending was restrained. With capacity idle, new investment in plant and machinery was weak. Unless the United States, West Germany and Japan adopt expansionary policies, but without rekindling high inflation, a fine but difficult balance to achieve, the world economy is not expected to improve in 1978. World trade has been forecast to expand at an even slower rate than the 6% of 1977. If unemployment continues to rise in the developed countries, the tendency towards protectionism will increase. This would make it more difficult for us to export. Our own employment situation would be affected. We must therefore be prepared to meet the challenges of what may turn out to be a difficult year. It would be optimistic for Singapore to expect real growth at more than the 7.8% in 1977 if the OECD countries achieve a real growth of only 4% as they expect.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Problems and Outlook for the next 2 - 3 Years</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in reviewing our Economic Strategy Programme for the 1970's, I said that our strategy had laid a sound foundation for sustained growth. This remains true. The broad thrust of our strategy to diversify our economic activities, to upgrade our industries to higher skill levels and to develop all kinds of economic and professional services in Singapore is in the right direction. However, we shall have to give specific emphasis to particular elements of our strategy in the next few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of protectionist tendencies against the cheaper lower-skilled mass consumer products, upgrading of our industries will have to be accelerated. The prospect of increasing tariffs and non-tariff barriers being imposed against the influx of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such products into the industrialised countries is all too real. Already we see this happening to textiles and the cheaper electronics. If Singapore is not to be adversely affected in the future we shall have to develop our industrial sectors to those making products that are less sensitive. Such products will be those where there is an inherent advantage for production to be carried out in Singapore. Examples of such products will be those in industrial electronics and telecommunication equipment, precision engineering, aircraft components, medical instruments and fine chemicals. The EDB in the coming year will be embarking on an intensive drive to promote such industrial sectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our concerted investment promotion drive, new investments in Singapore from the major industrialised countries will perhaps be increasingly difficult to attract. President Carter's proposal to end tax deferral for US companies abroad if approved by the American Congress is likely to seriously reduce future US investments in Singapore. We feel that tax deferral - of incomes eamed abroad until they are returned as dividends to the US - should be preserved. US investments overseas help US companies to maintain their competitiveness in world markets and do not replace US investments or US jobs in the United States. The American Business Council in Singapore will no doubt through their members' parent companies press in Washington, I hope successfully, for the retention of tax deferral. If it will be helpful, the Singapore Government will continue to make representations for retaining tax deferral either in its present form, or alternatively, since this has been indicated as more acceptable to the US Administration, in the context of a bilateral treaty. With less uncertainties, Japan, which is currently the second largest investor after the United States in Singapore is likely to be a more promising source of investment in the next few years. If it becomes more difficult to attract entirely new foreign investment, we shall have to concentrate our efforts on encouraging the expansion of existing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> industries in Singapore. Industries which are already here and know us well have continued to expand. In 1977, 48% of investment commitments were accounted for by expansion of existing industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One problem which will pose a threat to our economic growth in the next few years is the tendency to re-classify us as a developed country and thereby deprive us of the assistance accorded to developing countries. This has begun with the IMF efforts to disqualify us from receiving our share of the proceeds of IMF gold sales, on the basis of our exceeding arbitrary GNP levels. We have no illusions about our status. We have not reached the status of a developed country. We are now trying to convince the IMF of this. Though it has been said often, it bears repeating that we are essentially a city state with no natural resources to speak of and with no agricultural sector, unlike most other countries, to produce our requirements for bare essential living. The markets and much of the technology and management expertise for our products are provided by multi-national companies and foreign personnel. Industrial development in Singapore is recent and still very young. Our own industrial and financial sectors are just beginning to take root. The use of arbitrary GNP levels therefore shows a lack of understanding of the narrowness and unevenness of Singapore's economic structure, making it especially vulnerable to the vagaries of climate settling the size of world harvests and determining our food prices and fluctuations in demand of the industrialised countries like Japan which uses Singapore's output as a marginal topper-up of her needs. Though the IMF has stated that its list of countries eligible for sharing of gold profits was not intended as a re-classification of developed and developing countries, other institutions and countries may well consider it a precedent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, I can fairly describe Singapore's evolution since 1960, when the U.N. team on Economic Development led by Dr Winsemius first studied us, as the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prototype of economic development promoted by international institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and GATT. We have followed policies which developed countries have urged all developing countries to pursue, that is, to start with simple manufactures (which the developed countries helped by opening markets vis GSP) and then to upgrade our economic skills and go on to more skill intensive manufacture. Eventually the hope is that we, like the industrialised countries, can go on to capital intensive, high technology industries. However, this process of development takes time. We are the first to realise the immaturity of our industrial workforce and the lack of depth of our supporting industries. We need a transitional period during which the continued assistance of developed countries is essential. Another 10-15 years is a realistic time frame for us to be able to do without it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in an intermediate stage of development and it would require at least 10-15 more years to achieve some measure of economic maturity in our skilled, technical and managerial workforce. By then the world's developed industrial nations would have gone on to higher levels of sophisticated technology. We may never catch up with the very advanced industrial societies. However, if at this crucial stage of our progress, developed countries and international institutions accord us understanding and continuing concessions as a developing country, then we can well become a demonstrable model of development for the third world, and not be strangled at birth by arbitrary yardsticks such is GNP per capita.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of trade, the prospect for increased world trade in the next few years is unpromising. There is a.great danger that the principle of free trade and international division of labour which have served the world so well and effectively will now be replaced by new short-sighted policies such as organised marketing arrangements which are no more than polite excuses to protect inefficient industries. However, if the much delayed Multilateral Trade Negotiations
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> currently going on in Geneva result in extensive reductions of tariff and non-tariff barriers, there could be hope for increased trade flows. On a regional level, we will press on with encouraging increased intra-ASEAN trade through trade liberalisation among ASEAN countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to review in more specific detail the policies which we shall be pursuing in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Industrial Development</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite difficult world conditions, the EDB's promotion efforts in 1977 have yielded satisfactory results. Investment commitments for 1977 totalled $431 million representing an increase of 18% over 1976. Whilst the US continues to be the largest source of investment commitments through expansion of existing industries, Japan for the first time became the largest source of new projects. A significant event during the year was the incorporation of Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore (Private) Limited to serve as the nucleus of the petrochemical project.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of industrial promotion in 1978 as I have said earlier, will be the promotion of industries making products less sensitive to the industrialised nations. While the large multinational companies will continue to be very welcome in Singapore, attention will be given to attracting the medium sized industries to broaden and deepen our industrial base. In this connecdon, while Singapore remains an attractive location for foreign investments in manufacturing industries, competition for such investments is becoming keener.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to improve upon our present incentives in the Economic Expansion Incentives Act by introducing an investment credit scheme. Under this scheme, a company carrying out an approved manufacturing or related technical servicing project will be allowed an investment credit in respect of its now fixed investment on plant, machinery and factory building for such approved project. The investment credit will, depending on the merits of the project,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be 10 to 50% of such capital expenditure. The credit can be set-off against the profits of the company for the year in which the now capital expenditure is incurred. These profits can be derived from the approved project or other operations of the company. If there is insufficient profit in that year to absorb the entire credit, the balance of the credit can be carried forward to be set-off against future profits of the enterprise until the credit has been fully used up. The profits which are thereby exempted from tax can be distributed to the shareholders as tax-exempt dividends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is meant to complement the existing pioneer status and export incentive schemes which are less beneficial to projects unable to generate profits in the initial years of operation. More important, we hope that this scheme will also provide the incentive for existing local and foreign industries to expand. In particular, the scheme will encourage existing profitable trading or servicing companies to diversify or further diversify their operations into manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be continuing assistance to industries by established schemes such as the Export Credit Insurance Scheme, the Ship Financing Scheme, the Small Industries Finance Scheme and the Capital Assistance Scheme. In addition, a Product Development Assistance Scheme has recently been introduced and will be further refined to help manufacturers develop new products and improve upon existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's industrial history is relatively short. We have yet to see any substantial development of local entrepreneurial ability in the manufacturing sector. In the current year, the EDB will modify its Capital Assistance Scheme to help young Singapore managers who have the necessary skills and expertise but lack the financial resources to strike out into industry. Under the scheme, the EDB will be prepared to provide loans to an amount which may even exceed the funds risked by the entrepreneur.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Trade Development</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established viable modern industries, we must ensure that both in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> traditional and new markets, our local manufacturers will be able to maintain and increase their exports. The area of emphasis in our trade development policies therefore remains in export promotion. In 1977, Singapore participated in six international trade fairs and seven trade missions overseas to explore and penetrate now markets. These efforts enabled some 80 Singapore companies to secure about $74 million worth of orders. To sharpen the marketing skill and expertise of Singapore manufacturers, 12 export promotion training courses were also conducted by the Department of Trade. In 1978, such activities will be further increased.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double tax deduction benefits currently given to participation in trade fairs and trade missions have been of assistance to our exporters. In order to encourage them to undertake direct and more intensive export promotional activities, the double tax deduction benefits will now be extended to include the operational expenses in the first two years incurred by local exporters in the setting up of permanent overseas offices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade promotion has so far been carried out as an ordinary function of the Department of Trade. There have been calls on the Government to set up a Trade Development Council for export promotion. Consultations are now being hold with the Chambers of Commerce and the Singapore Manufacturers' Association to work out proposals for a properly constituted and well managed Council with adequate financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Services Development</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our services industry has been a major growth sector, less vulnerable then other sectors to protectionistic measures. In the development of our financial services particularly, we have made considerable progress in the last %w years. During 1977, several new measures to further develop Singapore as a financial centre were implemented. These included the extension of the 10% concessionary tax on income from Asian
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Dollar loans to non-residents to cover all off-shore income other than foreign exchange profits and transactions with domestic banking units and residents. Exchange control regulations were further liberalised while brokerage rates were reduced to encourage secondary trading in government securities. The US dollar negotiable certificate of deposit was introduced to add greater depth to the Asian Dollar Market. In 1978, attention will be directed towards the improvement of the secondary market in government securities, the establishment of a gold futures exchange and improvement of the cheques clearing system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of insurance, the reduction of tax on reinsurance business from 40% to 10%, which is being implemented with effect from 1978, has encouraged the setting up of now and branch reinsurance companies and should result in a rapid growth of reinsurance business in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tourism, the industry continues to grow apace. The average hotel occupancy rate rose from 78% to 83% in 1977. Occupancy rates seem likely to remain high in the future though an additional 2,428 hotel rooms will be available by 1980, on the basis of projects approved for construction. Convention business in Singapore also increased, with the number of foreign participants in conventions and exhibitions rising by 11.6% over 1976. To meet future needs, a 4,000-seat convention hall together with exhibition facilities is being set up by the Port of Singapore Authority within its new World Trade Centre building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our intention to promote Singapore as a warehousing and servicing centre. For approved companies, I therefore propose to reduce the company tax rate from 40% to 20% for a period of five years from the date of approval. Companies eligible will be those engaged in the regional warehousing and servicing of technical products, provision of technical and consultancy services overseas, export of approved Singapore manufactured products, and offshore trading in non-traditional commodities. To qualify for this scheme, warehousing and servicing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> companies must make a now investment of $5 million in fixed assets. Consultancy services must have a minimum annual turnover of $5 million or a turnover level which would enable them to pay a concessionary tax of $50,000 a year. Companies which am engaged entirely in the export of approved Singapore manufactured products must have a minimum annual turnover of $10 million or a turnover level which enables them to pay a concessionary tax of $100,000. Companies engaging exclusively in offshore trade in products other than rubber, timber, tin, popper, petroleum products, palm oil and similar traditional commodities, must have a minimum annual turnover of $20 million or a turnover which enables them to pay a concessionary tax of$200,000 a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Development of ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging progress in ASEAN economic cooperation was achieved during the year. With the coming into force in August 1977 of the Agreement on Preferential Trading Arrangements, trade negotiations among ASEAN countries were able to begin in earnest. The first batch of 71 items under the preferential trading arrangements was implemented with effect from 1 January 1978.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences for another 506 items have been agreed for further exchange among ASEAN countries, and await the formal approval of ASEAN Economic Ministers before implementation. Negotiations for more exchanges of preferences am expected to be hold on a quarterly basis in 1978. The pace of such negotiations under the ASEAN PTA therefore augurs well for greater economic cooperation in ASEAN in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the ASEAN industrial projects, there has been some progress since Japan indicated her willingness to extend financial assistance totalling US$l billion for these projects. Action in firming up these projects may, however, be expected in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Manpower Development</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our shortages of professional and technical manpower are being met. Our manpower development must now concentrate on higher quality whether in schools, training centres or factories. In 1977, school-leavers were for the first time, provided with information on job prospects in Singapore to enable them to make informed decisions on careers which would also meet our future manpower needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be setting up another training centre with the assistance of the Japanese Government. The centre will provide specialised training in instrumentation. mould-making, electrical and electronics engineering.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Wage Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prudent wage policy providing for realistic, regular and orderly wage increases has been Singapore's formula for building up competitive manufacturing and servicing industries. The 1977 National Wages Council recommendation of full offsetting for all forms of increases in remuneration against the recommended NWC increase guidelines should help to further increase their competitive edge. The NWC has also given due recognition to the importance of productivity improvements by recommending that collective agreements should in future include provisions for productivity incentive schemes. I hope that management and union in the spirit of increasing national welfare will work out ways this year to implement this recommendation for the benefit of all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Monetary Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our monetary policy will continue to be the maintenance of a strong and stable currency, and consistent with this, an adequate supply of funds at reasonable interest rates to foster capital investments in productive activities. These policies imply the development of active and sophisticated capital, bond, foreign exchange and money markets and the competitive services of the stock exchange and its brokers, banks,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> merchant banks, discount houses, money brokers, and other financial institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, we had improved growth over the previous year although the world economy fared worse. In view of the forecasts of a further world economic slowdown in 1978, can we repeat our 1977 performance? To achieve this, we must be sufficiently flexible to take advantage of the slightest change in economic conditions in our favour such as the revival of regional oil exploration or the increased demand for oil rigs and offshore drilling equipment. We must be prepared to produce goods and services competitively and responsively to the demands of special or new markets such as those in West Asia or China. In the more protectionistic climate of developed countries, to avoid any restriction of our exports, we must be ready to acquire now knowledge, learn new skills and accelerate the conversion of our manufactures to products which will not be politically sensitive in developed countries. Working smarter as well as harder, I am confident that as in the past, with close cooperation between Government, management and labour, we shall be able in this, the Year of the Horse, to put on the extra gallop which should enable us to challenge, and even beat, our 1977 growth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The FY 78 Budget</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to the FY 78 Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major changes have been made to the presentation and format of the Budget documents. In the Expenditure Estimates, the financial and manpower requirements under each Head of Expenditure are classified according to programmes and activities which will be carried out to achieve specific objectives. Changes have also been made to the structure of the Heads of Expenditure. Statutory expenditure items, which were previously shown under a single Head, are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> now shown under the appropriate programmes. This is to reflect as accurately as is possible the total cost for each programme. Two new Heads, namely, Head X "Pensions" and Head Y "Public Debt" have also been created.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence of these changes, Ministries will have greater flexibility to reallocate expenditure within each activity to make the best possible use of the funds to achieve the objectives of the programme. Because there will be greater flexibility, there will be less delays in changing the nature and content of expenditures to meet changed conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of performance is an integral part of the new budgetary system but is being left for implementation as a second phase to this system. It is necessary to phase this out because of the nature and complexity of Government activities. Much effort will be required to devise systems of measurement and to refine performance indicators and norms as well as to lay down procedures for evaluation and assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Expenditure Proposals</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated expenditure for FY 78 is $5,756 million. As in the past few years, about half of this will be spent on development to help accelerate economic recovery. The budgeted development expenditure for FY 78 is $2,754 million. The main thrust will be on economic services and public housing. Expenditure on economic services will be $1,185 million or 43% of development expenditure. Of this, $570 million will be spent on industrial and commercial development (mainly in the form of loans to JTC and industrial and commercial enterprises) and $386 million on airport and rood development. Expenditure on public housing takes up $911 million or 33% of the development budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large expenditure on development will be made possible by holding down recurrent expenditure especially on manpower. This will enable a transfer of $666 million to be made from the Main Estimates to the Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the $666 million transfer, total recurrent expenditure under the Main Estimates will be $3,000 million. This is only 9% higher than for FY 77 and is the minimum required to maintain the present level of Government services. Of the increase, $241 million is for servicing the Public Debt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to hold down manpower cost in line with the policy requiring higher productivity, following the NWC allowances of the last few years, is reflected in a small increase of $15 million or 1.9% on Expenditure on Manpower. Staff increases have been supported selectively and only in cases where the needs have been clearly demonstrated. Such increases have, by and large, been confined to Ministries and departments with major development programmes under implementation. The not increase in the permanent establishment for FY 78 including those posts created by Establishment Warrants during FY 77 has been kept down to 1,992 posts or 3% of the FY 77 establishment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Expenditure, excluding the Armed Forces expenditure, will increase by $20.5 million or 8.4% over the FY 77 figure because of larger expenditure on preventive maintenance of Government buildings, roads and properties and the operation of more drug rehabilitation centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers, comprising largely grants for the recurrent expenditure of statutory boards and institutions of higher learning, will go up by $17 million or 5% compared to the current provision. This is largely for annual increments, the consolidation of the NWC allowances into basic salaries and the concomitant increase in CPF contributions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of funds is, however, only the first step. The more important step is to get the programme implemented. This depends on the Civil Service which must have adequate and competent personnel. Although there are shortages of officers in a number of Ministries, especially Health, Education and Home Affairs, recruitment is progressing satisfactorily and hopefully should be nearer establishment in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Revenue</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue we expect, assuming no changes in taxes, is $3,668 million for FY 78, an increase of 7.1% over the revised estimates of $3,424 million for FY 77.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Tax remains the largest source of revenue and is expected to produce $1,450 million, 10.9% over the revised revenue of $1,308 million for FY 77. This rate of increase is, as may be expected, about the rate of growth of the economy at current prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total revenue of $3,668 million at existing tax rates is sufficient to cover recurrent expenditure, enabling $666 million to be transferred to the Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this large contribution from the Consolidated Revenue Account, there will still be a deficit of $1,428 million which will have to be met by borrowings and a drawing down from the Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that new loans, both domestic and foreign, can be issued which should bring in about $1,500 million, but any shortfall from this amount can be met by an extra drawdown from the Development Fund which is in a healthy state.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>TAX CHANGES</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two decades Singapore has followed the path of financial prudence and probity. Annual budgets have been fairly predictable exercises in moderation and restraint. No radical tax changes have been enacted. The success of our policies, evident in the rapid rate of growth of the economy, with relatively low unemployment, relatively stable prices (except in 1974 when external influences have intruded) and balance in external payments, is due, in part, to our abstinence from fiscal excesses or recklessness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, financial orthodoxy must be kept relevant to a changing situation by alterations in our tax structure to encourage economic expansion and diversification, to make Singapore an attractive centre for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> investment in manufacturing and servicing industries as well as a financial haven for capital. Consonant with these objectives, we have also encouraged the growth of savings and discouraged certain forms of consumption expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These basic policies will be continued, and accelerated this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Company Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier part of my Budget Statement, I indicated a number of tax incentives which will be given this year to stimulate the corporate sector. It may be convenient if I list them here also with other tax concessions I am giving.
  <pre>
First     An investment tax credit scheme
          which permits a certain
          percentage of the fixed investment
          of approved projects to be credited
          against taxable profits.

Second    A concessional 20% tax rate for
          overseas-oriented sales and service
          companies. Approved ware-
          housing and related activities
          together with offshore trading,
          consultancy and other services
          which deal predominantly with
          offshore business in now spheres
          of activity will be granted a lower
          tax rate of 20% for a period of five
          years.

Third     Double deduction from income of
          operational expenditure for two
          years of permanent trading offices
          set up abroad.

Fourth    Accelerated depreciation
          allowances for industrial buildings.
          At present, industrial buildings
          have to be depreciated over 45
          years for tax purposes. To lessen
          the tax burden, the Income Tax
          Act will be amended to allow
          industrial buildings to be
          depreciated over 25 years. The
          initial allowance will increase from
          10% to 25%.

  <br>
  <br>
  <pre>
Fifth     Abolition of tax charge on dividend
          distributions out of offshore
          profits. At present, financial
          institutions operating Asian
          Currency Units enjoy the conces-
          sional tax rate of 10% on offshore
          profits. However, this tax rate does
          not extend to dividend distribu-
          tions made by such an institution
          out of offshore profits, so that it
          immediately incurs a further 30%
          tax charge on its dividend distribu-
          tions. To further promote the
          development of the Asian Dollar
          Market, I have decided that the
          ACU tax concession will "follow
          through" for dividends received in
          the hands of both resident and
          non-resident shareholders. This
          means that the 10% tax on ACU
          offshore profits will be the final
          tax.

Sixth     The "follow through" concession
          will similarly apply to dividends
          paid out of offshore reinsurance
          profits of insurance companies.

          All these concessions will take
          effect from Year of Assessment
          1979.
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Personal Income Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just over two decades ago, in 1957, the ceiling rate of income tax was raised from 30% to 40%. In 1959, it was pushed up to 50%, and in 1961 to 55%. For a brief spell in the mid-Sixties, it came down to 50%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those increases were made in a period of low levels of savings, capital formation and Government expenditure on the social services, as well as against a background of glaring inequalities of wealth, disparities in income, and social turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed and circumstances of incomes distribution are different. The need now is to reward effort, whether manual skills or intellectual disciplines and at all levels. We must avoid the danger of encouraging and condoning mediocre effort and results by not rewarding excellence in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> performance. In our quest for a just and equal society, we must not forget that the thrust for development and progress springs principally from the strong human urge for recognition of achievement and the rewards that go with hard work and success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some evidence that high marginal rates of income tax in the middle income levels are becoming irksome and will in time become a disincentive to effort in Singapore. Fuelling this tendency is the effect of inflation, relatively mild as it is in Singapore, which has pushed income earners, at all levels, into higher brackets of taxation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggravating the problem of equity or fairness in sharing the tax burden is the ability of many self-employed professionals to incorporate themselves into companies in order to sell their personal services, and thereby quite legally avoid paying tax at more than 40%, the company rate. Professionals and executives working for the public sector on salaries are unable to take advantage of this loophole in the law. Nor do they enjoy the perks of tax free "expenses."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided, from Year of Assessment 1978, to make income tax less inequitable by broadening the steps over which the tax rate goes up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the existing tax rates and new tax rates are shown in the Appendix (Cols. 425 - 426) which I have asked to be distributed to Members.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1978/19780227/19780227-HA-0370425.htm">Appendix - PRESENT AND REVISED INCOME TAX RATES ON INDIVIDUALS (Cols. 425 - 426)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will see that the 40% marginal tax rate is payable for a minimum chargeable income now raised from $35,001 to $ 50,001. Concessions are made all down the line to the lowest tax rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new rate of 45% is introduced for a chargeable income between $100,001 and $200,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50% marginal tax rate is for a minimum chargeable income now raised from $50,001 to $200,001.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 55% marginal tax rate is for a minimum chargeable income now raised from $100,001 to $400,001.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax reduction varies from 7.8% to 18.8%, depending on the tax bracket. The average tax cut is 14.6%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss in revenue in the first year is estimated at $53.9 million out of a total tax collected on personal income tax of $370 million,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered carefully the question of boosting tax reliefs for earned income, dependants and other purposes. But I have decided against it chiefly because we must expand the tax base, to make every member of society realise that the fruits of Government expenditure can only be paid for from the toil of income producers. Moreover, the concessions given are generous, and will leave a big gap in the Revenue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem the Inland Revenue Department has not been able to solve is how to bring into the tax net some 150,000 persons who should be paying tax on their incomes, but do not do so because they are self employed and keep no accounts. Some of their incomes are considerable. Up to now, it has not been economically and administratively practical to bring every dodger to book. As a result, some occupations like self-employed small contractors, taxi drivers, hawkers and persons in other activities which can avoid the tax because no accounts are kept and tracing is difficult have become profitable and popular. This is manifestly unfair but until we can get all economic activities recorded and checkable, we shall have to suffer these tax dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless and until we can bring all incomes within the tax net, and also place limits on perks and expense accounts which are tax free, personal income tax under Singapore's trading conditions and social circumstances is unfair because it falls most heavily on the honest and the hardworking, the salaried wage earner
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax on Repatriated Profits</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Singapore tax laws, profits and dividends remitted into Singapore and received by an individual are taxed at the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> marginal rate. In many cases, the burden of Singapore tax on such income is very substantially reduced by double taxation relief provided under tax treaties Singapore has concluded with a number of countries. However, for countries with which Singapore has no double tax treaties, the marginal tax burden on the individual can go up to 5596
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide some incentive for the repatriation of overseas income, I have decided that such income shall be subject to a maximum marginal rate of 40% with effect from Year of Assessment 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Garden Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to refer to an existing tax concession - the income tax relief for the maintenance of private gardens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the campaign to make Singapore a clean and green city, a tax incentive was given to owners and occupiers of houses to encourage them to maintain clean and attractive gardens which can be seen by passers-by. A remission of tax up to $100 incurred in the maintenance of private gardens was granted in 1970. This amount was increased to $300 in 1972. For Year of Assessment 1977, only 1,992 tax payers applied for remission. The tax remitted amounted to $161,865.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the objective of encouraging the proper maintenance of private gardens has been achieved. Many homes maintain attractive and clean gardens which make the living environment more congenial and pleasant. It is, therefore, unnecessary to continue with the tax remission for the maintenance of private gardens. I have decided with effect from the Year of Assessment 1979, to discontinue the tax remission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>TAXES ON EXPENDITURE</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the burden of income tax concessions on the Revenue, as well as to shift gradually the impact of taxation from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> incomes to consumption taxes, a number of taxes on expenditure will go up.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Additional Registration Fee on Private Motor-Cars</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immediate effect, the Additional Registration Fee rate for private motor-cars will be increased from 100% to 125% ad valorem. The Preferential Additional Registration Fee will also be correspondingly increased to 125% of its present rate for each class of vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional revenue yield is estimated at $14.4 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional tax is most necessary if we are to prevent the release of $54 million freed by the new income tax rates for the lower and middle income groups from going into private cars excessively, once again cluttering up the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Entertainments Duty</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st April 1978, the duty rate for cinemas, amusement parks, trade fairs and exhibitions will increase from 20 cents to 25 cents for every increase of 50 cents or part thereof for admission charges exceeding $1.50.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty rate for "live" entertainment such as stage plays, concerts, recitals, music performances and dances will also increase by 5 cents for tickets priced at $1.00 or more. The duty payable will be 25 cents for admissions priced at $1.00 to $1.50 and an additional 15 cents for every subsequent increase of 50 cents or part thereof.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates for establishments which pay lump sum entertainments duty and provide floor shows, music and dance facilities will increase by 20%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Games and sports, including professional boxing and wrestling, as well as roadside wayangs, will not be subject to the increase in entertainments duty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the increase will net additional revenue of $7.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Driving Licence Fees</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last revision in the driving licence fee was in 1966. With effect from lot April 1978, the fee will be increased from $10 to $20 a year. The provisional driving licence fee will also be raised from $10 to $20 for six months. That fee has not been revised since 1963.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions are expected to yield an additional $11.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Telephone Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government tax on telephone bills has not been revised since 1969. From 1st April 1978, the rate will be raised from 15% to 20%. The scope of the tax remains unchanged, that is, it will be levied on domestic telephone services and on trunk calls to West Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional yield expected is $5.7 million a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Colour TV Licence Fee</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although transmission of television programmes in colour started three years ago, the licence fee for colour television sets was left at $36 a year. Transmission of colour TV calls for heavy investment in facilities as well as in substantially increased levels of operating expenditure. With more programmes now being telecast in colour, the time is appropriate to differentiate between colour and monochrome licence fees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fee for monochrome sets will remain at $36 a year, but for colour sets will be raised to $54. The fee for radios will remain at $12 a year. A colour TV fee of $54 will cover all monochrome TV sets and radios in the same household.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hotels, the concessionary rate of $18 a year will continue to apply for monochrome sets, but the rate for colour sets will rise to $27 a year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional revenue yield is estimated at $1.5 million in the first year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Airport Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing rate of passenger service charge for flights to Malaysia and Brunei is $2 per passenger. I intend to raise the rate to $4 with effect from 1st April 1978. The extra revenue generated is expected to be $1.1 million in the first year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total yield from all these expenditure taxes is estimated at $41.8 million in the first year, and will reduce the loss to Revenue from the income tax concessions to $12.1 million a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax on PUB Bills</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concession which I propose to give to consumers is by the abolition of the 5% tax on PUB bills which is now effective for consumption levels between $35 and $50 a month. With effect from 1st April, only consumption levels of $50 and above will be subjected to tax at the same rate as before, of 10%. The revenue loss is estimated at $5 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total loss to Revenue from all the tax changes made in this Budget is approximately $17.1 million in the first year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conclusion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial policy of the Government outlined in this Budget Statement will, I hope, continue the process of adjustment we have so far been successfully making to the economic uncertainties of the Nineteen Seventies. The world economy has yet to recover from the shock of the oil crisis. The turbulence of the exchange rate of the US Dollar and the poor performance of the New York Stock Exchange are but some of the symptoms of the chronic problems of inflation and unemployment, leading to strong sentiments for trade restrictions and controls in most industrialised countries. Nevertheless, our growth rates of 7 and 7.8% over the past two years show what is still possible given prudent Government policies, efficient management and hard working and productive workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
