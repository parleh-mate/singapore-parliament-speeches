<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MOBILE PHONE USERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Mobile phone portability for)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Information,  Communications and the  Arts  if  the  Infocomm

Development   Authority   will  allow   full   mobile   phone

portability  for mobile phone users so that they  can  retain

their  existing telephone numbers when they switch  from  one

service provider to another.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, mobile number

portability  refers  to the ability of  mobile  customers  to

retain  their telephone number when they switch  between  the

different  mobile  operators.   IDA  mandated  mobile  number

portability  since  the start of mobile  competition  on  1st

April 1997, when M1 entered the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several technical solutions can be used to achieve

mobile  number portability.  In line with IDA's principle  of

technology  neutrality,  IDA did  not  mandate  which  method

operators  should  use.  Up until now, the implementation  of

mobile number portability has been industry-driven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA recognises that the current mobile number

portability  solution adopted by the mobile operators  has  a

number  of limitations.  Specifically, SMS messages  are  not

portable.  This means that a user cannot receive SMS messages

sent  to  his original number once he switches to a different

mobile  operator.  Given the high usage of SMS in  Singapore,

and  the projected proliferation of mobile data services, the

lack of SMS portability could become a significant barrier to

migration between mobile operators.  This would then  inhibit

mobile competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation on SMS portability can be overcome.

However,  this requires additional investments by the  mobile

operators, and the end users could end up bearing the  higher

cost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the potential impact on both the mobile

operators  and  customers, IDA has decided to re-convene  the

Mobile  Number Portability (MNP) Working Group  so  that  the

mobile  operators  could engage in a discussion  of  all  the

implications   of  a  migration  to  a  full  mobile   number

portability solution.  This would allow IDA to weigh the pros

and  cons,  including the likely impact on consumers,  before

deciding  whether or not it is timely to mandate full  number

portability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister's

reply  was  actually  referring to call  forwarding  and  SMS

portability,  but  I am actually talking about  retention  of

telephone  numbers for mobile phone users.  So I  believe  he

has not answered the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, call forwarding is a way to achieve

number   portability.   In  other  words,  if  one   switches

operators, yes, he will get a new telephone number.   But  if

someone calls his old telephone number, he will still receive

the  call.  So, in that sense, his number has not changed  to

the people who are calling him, and that makes it portable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, we pay for the call forwarding,

and  that  is the point I am trying to make.  Is the Minister

aware that in other countries, where MNP has been introduced,

it has resulted in greater convenience for consumers?  It has

also resulted in cheaper telephone rates, and it has also not

affected the profitability of telephone companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Yes, I am aware that a number of

countries  implement  a  full  network-based  mobile   number

portability  system.  But this is a much  involved  technical

solution.  It does require setting up a database of  numbers,

as  we are told, and it does require additional investment by

the  mobile  operators.  This will increase the cost  to  the

mobile operators, and this cost must work, in some way,  into

the  system of charging users.  But, of course, the potential

advantage  of  this  is that it would make  competition  more

viable in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>



the  mobile  telephony industry, and therefore  this  is  the

reason why we are taking another look at the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no free lunch, so to speak.

At  the  end of the day, if we want the convenience  of  this

service,  if  we  want the convenience  of  keeping  our  own

telephone number, there is a solution to it.  But this is the

solution that is not costless, and therefore we will have  to

weigh  carefully the pros and cons of whether or  not  it  is

advantageous  to introduce this.  Right now, those  who  want

number portability pay for the service, and they pay a charge

of  several  dollars  a month, and they get  the  benefit  of

number  portability.   But  if we  implement  a  network-wide

solution,  then  all users will have to pay  for  the  higher

cost,  whether or not they change the telephone numbers.   So

there are pros and cons, and this is what we will weigh out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, am I right in saying that in

implementing  a full MNP system in Singapore, it  would  cost

about $100 million which, in the larger context of things, is

really  not  very expensive?  On the point of paying  charges

for  full MNP, is the Minister aware that, in Hong Kong,  the

introduction  of MNP resulted in a 60% drop  in  tariffs,  as

operators  braced themselves for the change and  they  became

more  competitive?   Actually,  in  the  end,  the  consumers

benefited.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, tariffs will change in response to

competition  in the marketplace.  I am not sure  exactly,  in

the case of Hong Kong, whether it changed only because of MNP

implementation.  But, certainly, to the extent that you  have

got  competition in the marketplace, competition  will  drive

rates  to competitive levels.  And this is what we intend  to

do  in  the  Singapore marketplace, which is to  ensure  that

there  is  competition in the marketplace, and we  have  that

today.  This is why, as I said yesterday in this House,  that

we   have   a  very  high  level  of  mobile  usage,   mobile

penetration.   That  shows that the existing  model  has  not

hindered the growth of the marketplace.  Nonetheless, we will

look  at the matter.  I do not know exactly how much it would

cost at this point in time, because technology is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>



changing  all  the time and there could be advancements  that

could  bring the cost down.  If so, then that would  make  it

even  more  viable  for  the industry to  come  together  and

implement a network-wide mobile number portability system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, before I take Members

through  some of the initiatives that the Ministry is putting

in  place  to  help  Singaporean  families  with  care-giving

responsibilities,  let me answer some specific  questions  on

the family that were raised yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked if MCDS has a "family policy". We have

widely-known  principles  that  undergird  all   our   social

policies.   May I take this opportunity to remind  Dr  Maliki

that these are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, family is the building block of society. Family

ties  are the key factors in rooting Singaporeans.  They  are

the ties that bind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, family is the first line of care and support. This

principle is applied even in the implementation of our social

safety  net.  So, whenever an applicant comes in through  the

CDC,  we will check his family background to ensure the level

of  support  that he has.  So, family, as the first  line  of

support, is a very important consideration in everything that

we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, strong and stable families are critical for the

well-being  of individuals, and for our nation.  If  families

are weak, they will undermine the first two principles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family, as a building block of our society, is an

important  principle for us in Singapore.  But we  know  that

family  is a personal domain, and we respect that.   But  the

health of society rests on the health of the family.  This is

something that we should not forget.  Thus, the role  of  the

Government is to provide the support, the infrastructure,  to

enable  the family to fulfill its roles and responsibilities.

I suppose we should support this, and not supplant it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the role of fathers and

husbands  - a very interesting topic.  There is the emotional

tug-of-war  between a father who feels he is doing everything

and  earning an income, and a homemaker, or a working mother,

who  is  exhausted and frustrated, because she is not getting

the support and involvement from her spouse.  Couples need to

examine not only how much time each parent spends with  their

children,  but  also  the type of activities  that  they  are

engaged in.  While it is much easier for mothers, because  of

the way a mother's role has been socially conditioned, it  is

unfortunately  less straightforward for fathers.   But  I  am

pleased to note that, increasingly, fathers too want to enjoy

the  joys of parenthood or fatherhood.  Judging from the good

response the Centre for Fathering has been receiving, fathers

want a role to play in the family too.  More recently, I have

been  told  by  some mothers that the way to  encourage  good

fathering  is  for  mothers to withdraw from  some  areas  of

activities, in order to provide some opportunity for  fathers

to be good fathers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate my parliamentary

colleague,  Dr  Maliki, for having taken the first  steps  to

start  Forum  Adam last year, a seminar aimed  at  empowering

Malay  men  to embrace a fair-share of parenting.  The  event

attracted  the highest number of 300 Malay men attending  any

Family  Life  Education Conference.  Today,  the  publication

Visi  Adam  serves  to empower many Malay  fathers  on  their

fathering skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having fathers who are equally involved as mothers in

the parenting partnership is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>



a fundamental tenet on what it means to be a family.  Sir, my

Ministry  promotes this underlying principle in  the  various

education programmes conducted by our community partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng asked whether the civil service would extend

the  5-day  unrecorded paid leave for looking  after  a  sick

child  to  fathers as well.  MCDS will work with  the  Public

Service Division to review this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mdm Halimah asked about the implementation of

family  care  leave.   Again,  MCDS  cannot  implement   this

unilaterally.   We  will have to consult the  Public  Service

Division for the civil service, and the Working Committee  on

Work-Life, comprising officials from MCDS, NTUC, MOM and SNEF

and,  of  course,  Mdm  Halimah  who  is  a  member  of  this

committee.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discussed, so far, some of the programmes

that  we  have  embarked  and  will  be  embarking  upon   to

strengthen  the  family.  Let me now turn  to  the  range  of

services and care options that my Ministry will implement  in

order  to help Singapore families stay strong.  We know  that

with the trend towards nuclear families, smaller families and

dual-income   households,   families   will   require    more

assistance,  especially in the area  of  childcare.   I  will

describe  what are the things that my Ministry  is  doing  to

increase  some  of the care options and improved  access  for

childcare for families in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are committed to increasing the range of the

childcare options to help parents to fulfill their role.  For

a  start, we have launched the Baby Bonus Scheme as a way  to

help  parents to meet the financial needs of their  children,

especially when they are young.  But parents do require  more

options in terms of childcare so that they will help them  to

balance   their   work   and  their  life.    Flexible   work

arrangements and part-time work for parents are becoming more

prevalent  these days, and this is because of  the  increased

awareness among both families and businesses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>



about family-work practices.  More couples, especially women,

are  also  working part-time during the early years of  their

children's development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this, on top of the current subsidies

for  full-day and half-day childcare programmes which we have

given  to  families, my Ministry will now grant  a  pro-rated

childcare subsidy to both working and non-working mothers for

flexible  childcare programmes in licensed childcare centres.

Under  this  flexible  childcare  scheme,  parents  will   be

eligible  for a pro-rated childcare subsidy when  they  place

their  children in a childcare centre that offers  programmes

for  a minimum of two half-days every week.  This scheme will

be  implemented in January next year, and my Ministry has set

aside $5 million for this financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Lily Neo have asked for more

help  for  parents  with young infants, especially  below  18

months.  As Members will know, childcare operators can  offer

infant care services for children as young as two months old,

provided  of  course  they comply with certain  requirements,

both  physical  and staffing, because these  are  very  young

children.   Therefore, we need a certain type of skills  set.

Such  requirements, as we know, are critical because  of  the

safety  and  well-being  of our young  children.   Currently,

there  are eight centres providing infant care services  but,

at the end of the day, we will have to allow market forces to

dictate the supply and demand for infant care services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked whether higher subsidies could be

provided  for infant care.  Besides the childcare subsidy  of

$150   and   $75   for   working  and   non-working   parents

respectively, there are two other subsidy schemes that can be

used for fees at infant care services.  First, of course,  is

the  Baby Bonus Scheme, which provides cash payment  for  six

years  -  $500 per year for the second child, and $1,000  per

year  for  the third child.  The Government also matches  the

parents'  contribution, so it is a co-payment scheme,  dollar

for  dollar, up to a maximum of $1,000 for the second  child,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>



$2,000 for the third child.  This works out to be about  $125

and   $250   per  month  for  the  second  and  third   child

respectively, and these can be used to pay fees at the infant

care   centres.   The  second  scheme  is  what  I  mentioned

yesterday.  The Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme  for

Childcare   (CFAC)  is  available  for  low-income  families.

Together, these subsidies can help families cope with  infant

care fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while affordability is an issue, it is equally

important  that  parents are provided with childcare  options

other  than centre-based options.  As Ms Irene Ng has pointed

out, studies have shown that home care, especially by one  or

two  of  the  parents, by a mother or father, or a consistent

caregiver, is far superior to a centre-based option.  Infants

are  better  cared  in a family setting  where  they  receive

individualised  care.  I am, therefore, pleased  to  announce

that my Ministry is piloting the Family Day Care Service as a

care  option, especially for infants and toddlers who require

greater  individual care and attention.  The Family Day  Care

Scheme  provides  home-based care  for  children  by  trained

caregivers, who are mainly housewives and retirees.  It  will

provide  a flexible care arrangement that will allow  parents

to work and to work out mutually acceptable arrangements with

the caregiver.  So it is an arrangement whereby they can work

together with the caregiver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this scheme, which we are piloting now with both

the  Southeast and Southwest CDCs, the councils will help  us

to recruit and maintain a list of caregivers who can care for

children in their homes.  The councils will also support them

with  information  and  training.  After  the  training,  the

service  refers and matches the caregivers with  the  parents

who  have  no  full-time  care for their  children.   We  are

putting  aside  $150,000 this year for this  initiative.   So

far,  from  what we have heard from the two CDCs,  they  have

received  many  enquiries about this scheme, and  the  actual

matching and referrals are expected to pick up soon.  The two

CDCs  will  also maintain a list of short-term  or  temporary

caregivers to provide parents with occasional care  services.

Some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>



parents may not need such a service on a frequent basis,  but

they may need such service because they have to go out and do

something else and, therefore, they can rely upon this list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong and Dr Lily Neo also asked for

more  childcare  centres.   At  the  moment,  there  are  608

childcare  centres  operating  in  Singapore  offering  about

50,400  places, and the take-up rate is only about  76%.   So

there  is  still  extra capacity.  Since  the  delegation  of

childcare  development  to  CDCs,  the  CDCs  have  played  a

significant  role in identifying sites for childcare  centres

that  are  both convenient to parents and, at the same  time,

meeting  the  local  needs.  This year, we  plan  to  develop

another  60  childcare centres, which will give an additional

3,700 places for children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked for better training for

childcare  teachers.   I am pleased to  inform  Members  that

since 1985, MCDS has had a training system to ensure a steady

supply of trained childcare personnel.  The quality and level

of their training have a direct impact on the quality of care

provided   by   our  centres.   We  stipulate  the   training

requirements currently, and all centre supervisors  have  the

required    Certificate   in   Pre-School   Management    and

Administration.   In addition, 65% of all childcare  teachers

possess  the Certificate in Pre-School Training.  Last  year,

we   took  the  process  one  step  further.   MCDS  and  MOE

established  a  joint training framework for  all  pre-school

personnel, and a joint pre-school qualification accreditation

committee was formed to set training guidelines and  accredit

pre-school teacher training courses.  To further enhance  the

professionalism  and the quality of childcare  in  Singapore,

MCDS   announced  in  1999  new  training  requirements   for

childcare centre personnel.  All centre supervisors,  and  at

least one teacher per centre, must possess a Diploma in  Pre-School Education by the end of 2004, and all teachers must be

trained  at  the Certificate in Pre-School Teaching  by  this

date.  Based on the projected number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>



training  places provided by 15 training agencies that  offer

accredited  training  courses, there are sufficient  training

places to meet this current demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides providing more childcare options, my Ministry is

also  committed  to improving the quality of  childcare.   My

Ministry,  with the help of partners, such as the Association

of Early Childhood Educators (Singapore) (AECES) will also be

implementing training programmes for informal caregivers  for

children, such as maids or relatives.  Short courses will  be

offered   in  different  languages  which  will   equip   the

caregivers  with  basic  skills  of  caring  for  our   young

children.   They  will  impart knowledge  on  physical  care,

hygiene,  first-aid and, of course, child  development.   The

course will be launched by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides helping families in childcare, sometimes

families  have other concerns requiring temporary assistance.

Mdm  Cynthia  Phua  has  raised some  concerns  about  making

accessibility  better for families.  She has  also  suggested

the  setting  up of one-stop support centres to provide  such

frontline   service  for  the  families.    Currently,   this

frontline  function is undertaken by Family  Service  Centres

(FSCs).   Members  of the public who need  advice  on  family

matters and they are not sure whom to contact, they can  call

the  FSC helpline at the toll-free number 1800-8380100.  This

is  a  first-stop telephone hotline for families.  Once  they

make  the  call, it will be directed to the FSC  serving  the

area where the resident is living in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FSCs, as we know, are the first-stop neighbourhood-based

focal  point providing social services to families  and  they

manage  four  core  programmes -  casework  and  counselling,

information  and  referral, family education,  and  outreach.

For  example,  if  a family approaches an FSC  for  financial

assistance,  they  will  be  counselled  and,  if  necessary,

referred  to  the nearest CDC which administers  the  various

schemes.   FSCs  also have the expertise to  deal  with  most

family  problems, but if specialised expertise or  assistance

is needed, they will work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>



closely  with CDCs and other organisations.  So, coordination

and   networking  among  the  social  service  providers  are

important  steps to ensure that families get  the  help  that

they need, timely and effectively.  At the moment, there  are

about  35 FSCs operating in Singapore.  One more FSC will  be

established next year in Chua Chu Kang, and each FSC serves a

population  of  between  80,000 and 160,000  residents.   And

based  upon what we have seen, this is adequate to  meet  the

needs of our family and our community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these initiatives and programmes relating to

the  family  that  I  have mentioned, must  only  be  matched

rightly by a change in mindset about care-giving roles within

the  family.  We cannot but stress the impact of the couples'

marital  health  on family well-being.  In the  first  place,

full  and  equal  partnership in a marriage  can  help  share

stress and offer mutual support and this, of course, in  turn

contributes to work-life balance.  Furthermore, children  are

affected  by  their  parents'  relationship  to  each  other.

Loving,  cooperative 2-parent families are clearly  the  best

environment for today's children to be raised.  Both sets  of

parents,  therefore,  need  to share  the  care-giving  role.

Father care is as important as mother care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now turn to the subject on the elderly, I would

like  to  thank  all the MPs who have spoken  on  the  issues

pertaining to our seniors.  Mr Charles Chong, Chairman of the

GPC for Community Development and Sports, has asked about the

progress  of  the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  on

the  Aging Population.  I am pleased to inform the House that

the  work  of the Committee is bearing fruit.  To date,  over

80% of the recommendations have been or being implemented.  I

think  we  are  quite familiar with some of them.   The  more

recent  developments include, of course, the  Lift  Upgrading

Programme,  the  Five-year Eldercare Master  Plan  which  was

launched  last  year, the Severe Disability Insurance  Scheme

and, of course, the provision for barrier-free access in  all

our MRT and LRT stations.  The infrastructure is being put in

place to prepare for an aging population.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are a few outstanding recommendations that are

still  being studied, and these pertain primarily to  changes

to  the  Central Provident Fund and the implementation  of  a

portable medical benefits system.  All these recommendations,

as   Members  will  agree,  have  a  tremendous   impact   on

Singaporeans.   Therefore, we should take a prudent  approach

in  implementing  some of these recommendations.   Hence,  we

should study them thoroughly before coming to a decision.  Mr

Charles  Chong is probably aware that the CPF issues and  the

question  of  portable medical benefits are  currently  being

studied by the Economic Review Committee (ERC).  And  as  the

Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, Mr Mah Bow  Tan,

will be releasing a more detailed progress report on the work

of the IMC soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can turn to the issue of social integration,

Ms  Irene  Ng spoke passionately yesterday about making  sure

that  there is a place for the elderly, and not for us to  be

overly  focusing  on the young.  I think we need  a  balance.

Social integration and active aging are the corner-stones  of

our national effort to achieve successful aging in Singapore.

We want to achieve this with three strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, promoting positive mindsets and

attitudes  towards aging and older people.  Second,  creating

opportunities  to  stretch the productive  potential  of  our

seniors  and tap their wealth of experience, particularly  in

ways  in which we can promote inter-generational contact  and

bonding.   Finally, as Mr Charles Chong has  rightly  pointed

out,  strengthening our community-based services  to  support

families  in caring for their frail elderly members in  their

own homes.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on these three strategies. One key

success factor, of course, is society's mindset, and Dr  Lily

Neo has rightly raised that as a challenge for us to discuss.

We  have already taken a systematic approach to have a public

education programme year round, in order to promote  positive

attitudes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>



towards  aging  and  older people.  Our  target  audience  is

across all sectors, including the elderly.  We have and  will

continue  to  collaborate with various  Government  and  non-Governmental   organisations  to  promote   positive   public

attitudes  through  public  and professional  forums,  talks,

media campaigns and production of resource materials on aging

issues.   We also have the annual Senior Citizens'  Week  and

Grandparents'  Day  as  forums to promote  active  aging  and

respect  for  our  seniors.   But  Members  will  agree  that

changing  mindsets will take time, and it  will  require  the

collective  effort of everyone in our society, including  the

elderly.  To this end, I am glad to learn that many community

organisations  are taking the lead to promote positive  aging

and  senior volunteerism.  For example, in last year's Senior

Citizens'  Week,  more  than  40  community  clubs  organised

programmes and activities for the elderly and their families.

The  Central  Singapore CDC, which I was  closely  associated

with, has launched a programme to rope in elderly volunteers,

who  then  read  to  primary school children  every  week,  a

programme  called  Read  and Reach  Programme.   The  Retired

Seniors  Volunteer  Programme  (RSVP)  conducts  a  mentoring

programme  for  school  children.  Last  year,  the  People's

Association Senior Citizens' Network launched the SPICES  for

Life Programme.  This programme is designed to motivate older

people  to learn to pick up new skills, such as IT.   I  hope

that we could see more of such community organisations coming

forward to help us spread the message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that in the life cycle, at different

times,  at different points in our lives, our needs  will  be

different  and  therefore,  we  need  to  prepare  for  them.

Therefore, my Ministry will intensify all our efforts to work

together  with  other agencies to promote  what  we  call,  a

culture of planning for the various transitions in our  life,

including aging or the so called "third age".  The key, as Mr

Maidin has rightly pointed out, is to start early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second thrust, both Mr Maidin and Mr Zainul

have spoken about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>



giving  our seniors productive and meaningful roles to  play.

Over the next 4-5 years, MCDS will place greater emphasis  on

programmes to develop the potential of our seniors.  We  have

launched  the Active Seniors Programme. We have set aside  $5

million for this programme over the next four years to  pilot

innovative  projects  designed to tap  the  talents  and  the

experience  of  older Singaporeans for  the  benefit  of  our

community.  I am pleased to inform the House that  the  first

six projects are currently being implemented.  We welcome any

other  proposals from anyone or any community  organisations.

These projects will involve over 2,000 senior volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has asked specifically if senior volunteers

can  be reimbursed for incidental expenses, such as transport

and  what  have  you.  Some of the VWOs, for  example,  RSVP,

Singapore   Action   Group  of  Elders   (SAGE)   and   Lions

Befrienders, are already doing so and we will promote this as

a best practice for others to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul and Ms Irene Ng also raised issues about

grandparenting   and  the  need  to  foster  greater   inter-generational interaction.  Besides community involvement, our

elderly  can continue to play a valuable role in the  family,

by promoting family value and transmitting positive values to

their grandchildren. The role of grandparents will evolve  in

tandem  with  our more educated elderly population.   Towards

this  end, MCDS supports public education programmes  related

to grandparenting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng will also be happy to learn that we are also

developing more facilities that will bring the young and  old

together.   The  Neighbourhood Link  is  one  such  facility,

located  in studio apartments and HDB void decks.   The  Link

mobilises  volunteers  of  all  age  groups  to  help   needy

residents in the community.  I visited one in Toa Payoh, well-located, not too far from the town centre, and they have lots

of  activities  for the senior citizens to engage  themselves

in. With the help of the VWOs, we can continue to engage them

in other types of activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-location or close location of services for

different  age  groups also promotes social  integration,  as

does joint programming.  The Tampines 3 in 1 Family Centre is

an  example of co-location of services for the young and  the

old  under  one  roof.  Children from the  student  care  and

childcare  centres are brought to the eldercare centre  daily

for  them to mingle with the seniors.  Another example is our

Singapore  Boys' Home located in Jurong, next  to  the  Saint

Joseph's  Home.  This proximity allows our boys to  help  out

regularly  at  the  home and befriend the  elderly  residents

there.   The  experience has been a mutually beneficial  one.

The   elderly  are  able  to  share  with  the  young   their

experiences, the history of Singapore and, in some instances,

we found that they act as mentors to the boys.  And the boys,

in turn, bring companionship to the old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also asked whether we have studied the

experiences  of  other  countries  with  regard   to   inter-generational  programming.  Sir,  we  have  visited   several

countries, including Japan and Hong Kong, which face  similar

ageing  challenges  as we do.  We will be visiting  Australia

and  the  United  Kingdom  to learn  not  just  about  inter-generational  issues,  but also about aged  care  and  policy

measures.   Where  feasible, we  will  adopt  some  of  these

learning  points. We have to adapt them to the local  context

and perhaps also expand on our range of programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now onto care for the aged. Mr Charles Chong also

highlighted  the impact the ageing society will have  on  the

care-giving   role.    Currently,  our  range  of   eldercare

programmes,  services and facilities are run by close  to  70

voluntary  welfare organisations.  Over the next four  years,

we  will step up these services to better support families in

the  care  for  the  elderly at home.  The initiatives  being

planned for include 400 additional day care places, more home

help  services,  gerontological counselling, case  management

and a wide range of respite care services.  In planning these

services,  my Ministry will work closely with the  respective

CDCs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet the rising demand, not only for a wider

range, but for a higher quality of services, I think we  need

to  bring  new  players  into the  field  of  community-based

services.   This will, of course, inject fresh ideas  on  how

services can better meet changing demands, and be more  cost-effective in meeting these demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting this July, my Ministry will introduce a new

incentive framework to encourage more cooperatives to provide

eldercare  programmes for seniors in the community, beginning

with   day  care  and  home  help  services.   The  incentive

framework will have two elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the extension of Government subsidy to

cooperatives   that  run  these  services.   Second,   making

subsidised premises available to cooperatives to set  up  and

run the services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 2-3 years, MCDS will also implement

further measures to encourage private operators to enter  the

eldercare field.  One key initiative is a user-subsidy system

in  which  an  elderly Singaporean, who meets the eligibility

criteria, will receive a subsidy, regardless of which service

provider  he  goes  to.   So there is  portability.   Another

initiative  is  to set aside 10-20% of the premises  reserved

for  eldercare services for commercial operators to bid  over

the next five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also constantly reviewing our subsidy

policy   to   ensure  that  services  remain  affordable   to

Singaporeans.  Last year, we introduced differential  subsidy

rates  for  elderly  services such that  lower  income  users

receive a higher level of subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has recently reviewed the eligibility criteria and

I  am  pleased to announce that we will be raising the income

ceiling for the 50% subsidy from $500 to $700.  This revision

will  potentially  benefit our seniors who  are  in  the  per

capita  family income  range of $500-$700 and  who  need  day

care services or sheltered accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will address the specific suggestion of Mr

Ang Mong Seng to set up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>



community  senior  citizens' institute.   I  agree  that  our

community facilities should also cater to the needs of  older

Singaporeans.   Currently, there is already an infrastructure

in place to organise various activities for our seniors.  For

example,  as  Members know, they can sign up for  courses  in

community   clubs,   participate  in   sports,   social   and

recreational  activities organised by  our  Senior  Citizens'

Clubs.  Today, there are 112 Senior Citizens' Clubs or groups

in  the  Southwest CDC alone.  Among them,  73  have  set  up

mutual  care  and  support groups among their  members.   For

those who need a job, they can approach the CDC concerned for

assistance.  I am happy to inform Mr Ang that my Ministry  is

now  working  with Southwest CDC to set up two  Neighbourhood

Links at Jurong East and Chua Chu Kang respectively.  Instead

of  building a new facility, we would like to suggest that Mr

Ang  may  want to work with the CDC first to see how best  we

can  leverage  on the existing infrastructure and  facilities

and  the  two neighbourhood links that we are proposing  with

Southwest   CDC,  so  that  we  can  better  coordinate   the

programmes and services to meet the needs of our elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the concerns

raised yesterday.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, can I make a point of

clarification?  The FSC has the undertone of  the  VWOs.  For

example,  the  rich  Family Service Centre  in  Bishan  is  a

Christian  organisation.  I know that some  families  do  not

want to go there.  That is the reason why I asked for the CDC

to  be  the front-line office for such family service support

centres  and,  at  the same time, they can  also  handle  the

financial assistance cases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I do not necessarily

disagree  with the Member that the CDC can play  that  value-added  role.  In terms of FSCs where there are such barriers,

it  is  better  for us to work with the FSCs to  lower  those

barriers  so  that  people of different faiths  or  different

races will feel comfortable.  In fact, our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>



experiences have shown that in some other FSCs, such  as  the

Marine Parade FSC, the number of Malay clients there has been

increasing in the last few years. There are ways in which  we

can  lower the barriers to make FSCs more effective, in terms

of  reaching out to a wider clientele. Certainly, if the CDCs

are  prepared  to  take that role, I am sure  we  could  work

together with the CDCs, so that they could play the role of a

front-line  office.  I think this is best left to the  Mayors

to consider.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, the Prime

Minister,  in  January this year, announced that Inter-Racial

Confidence  Circles (IRCCs) will be formed to  foster  inter-racial   and  inter-religious  rapport  among  the  different

communities through regular interactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descriptions and objectives of the IRCCs resemble

that  of goodwill communities that were formed shortly  after

the  racial  riots  in   Singapore during  the  1960s.  These

communities  were eventually replaced by the CCCs  and  other

grassroots organisations.  IRCCs are now being formed  as  an

extension of the CCCs.  Have we come a full circle?   In  the

1960s,  there  were  numerous  kampongs  and  villages   were

informal but acknowledged leadership, in the form of  village

headmen or penghulus, had evolved over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, times have changed. Our housing and

resettlement policies, although assuring better  ethnic  mix,

have  broken  up the informal but influential  leadership  as

penghulus   and   their   flocks   were   dispersed   through

resettlement   throughout  the  island  and  these   kampongs

vanished.  It is now harder to find acknowledged penghulus or

village  headmen in our new HDB estates, but we should  still

try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs are likely to see greater success in fostering

inter-religious rapport as religious leadership  in  mosques,

temples  and churches are still quite clearly defined.  Could

the Minister give us an update on the formation of the IRCCs,

and  how successful have IRCCs been in inducting acknowledged

community leaders who are not already serving in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>



grassroots organisations?  Are IRCCs, that have already  been

formed, clear on their composition, objectives and methods on

how they should go about achieving the desired outcomes?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Chairman, it

has been more than 40 years that the People's Association has

been involved in the development of community work.  However,

the  involvement of Malay activists in the PA  activities  is

unsatisfactory.  This does not mean that the  involvement  of

Malays  in  community activities in general is reducing.   It

can be said very accurately that many Malays are involved  in

community  activities  but only with organisations  that  are

related to the mosques and Malay/Muslim bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community does enjoy social interaction and is

concerned  with  the  problems of  others.   I  believe  that

increasing   the  involvement  of  the  Malay  community   in

grassroots activities, such as the RCs, CCCs, is one way  for

us   to   strengthen   inter-community   relations   at   the

constituency level. The Malay community's involvement in  the

activities of the People's Association is important and  must

be encouraged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the question is: why is the involvement of

the Malays in the People's Association activities so lacking?

What  measures  can  be taken to enhance  their  involvement?

Maybe  the  People's Association needs to use  more  suitable

strategies  and  approach  and it should  take  into  account

efforts to attract more Malay activists.  One group we should

be  concerned about in our efforts to enhance the involvement

of  the  Malays in the People's Association's activities,  is

the young or the youths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, not long ago, the People's Association had

carried out a study to identify the interest and needs of the

Malay community in terms of community activities.  Could  the

Minister for Community Development and Sports give an  update

or  information on the results of the study? Secondly,  based

on the study, what measures have been taken to enhance the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>



involvement   of   the  Malay  community  in   the   People's

Association's activities?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Prime Minister's Goh

initiative of forming the IRCCs has sparked off a  number  of

cultural  and  bonding programmes, aimed  at  bringing  about

cultural and religious appreciation and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether enough

measures have been taken to prepare our community leaders and

community  to cope with the events of a terrorist  attack  or

riot  in Singapore.  I am well aware that our security forces

and  civil defence force are fully prepared to deal with such

exigencies.  Nonetheless, are our ordinary folks prepared  to

deal  with such an occurrence - God forbid - or a terror were

to  transpire?  Could we have a regular television and  radio

programme to educate our ordinary folks, especially  the  old

and  the young, on what they ought to do, and how they  ought

to  react,  if  such  a situation were to  take  place?   For

example,  would  the  Minister  consider  putting  out   some

programmes  on  how the community leaders and  community  can

manage their emotions in a very tense-filled atmosphere  that

is normally an aftermath after such an event?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main point that I would like to raise here is

that our community leaders and community need to be aware of,

and knowledgeable about, how to respond during any emergency.

They  cannot completely depend upon the efforts of our  civil

defence  officers to tell them what to do during such  times.

In  this  connection, what types of programmes are in  place,

and are there sufficient funds earmarked for these programmes

to  raise  the awareness level of our community  leaders  and

community  so  that  they will know how to  respond?   In  my

opinion, some crisis management education programme  must  be

in place so that our community leaders and the community will

know  how  to react to these crises.  Such crisis  management

programmes are also required in schools and at the workplace.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore's rate of

volunteerism,  when  compared  to  the  developed  countries,

appears to be rather dismal.  The National Volunteers  Centre

was  formed in July 1999, as a joint initiative of  MCDS  and

the people sector.  Its mission is to promote volunteerism as

a  way  of life across all sectors and all levels of society.

In  so  doing, the Centre hopes to root Singaporeans,  bridge

social  stratification, and increase interaction,  to  foster

deeper community bonding, thereby strengthening the heartware

of the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives sound very similar to that of CDCs when

they  were  formed  just  two years  earlier,  in  1997.   In

adopting the "many helping hands" approach, MCDS should  also

be  careful  to  avoid wasteful duplication of  services  and

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us what additional measures have

been taken to increase the rate of volunteerism in Singapore?

And VWOs also need to upgrade their services and professional

standards to meet the new challenges of an ageing population,

growing social problems, and higher levels of stress  in  the

family.  Given the tough economic climate, more assistance to

the voluntary sector is necessary.  I was therefore delighted

to  hear  the  Minister  announced yesterday  the  additional

assistance  that will be extended to VWOs.  I am  also  quite

amazed  that he was able to predict exactly what I was  going

to ask for in my speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the future challenge

facing  Singapore  is  not  just  building  more  and  better

hardware,  but  rather to get Singaporeans in tune  with  the

software that seeks to develop strong community ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This challenge to build strong community ties is, to my

mind, greater than building the infrastructure.  For many  of

the grassroots organisations, the question is how do they get

more and better people motivated to volunteer their time  and

services within the community.  This is an essential part  of

getting  people  to take greater ownership of  the  community

that they live in.  As my colleague before me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>



has  said earlier, our participation rate in volunteerism  is

dismal.   If  I  may just give the figures, in Singapore  our

volunteerism rate stands at 9.3% compared to 25%  for  Japan,

and 55% for the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of volunteers, typically, in Singapore, the

volunteers  comprise the young and retired Singaporeans.   It

is  difficult  to  get  those in  the  middle  age  group  to

participate.  Sir, you will agree with me that  at  9.3%,  we

are  a  far  cry away from the benchmark set by the developed

countries elsewhere.  I believe that if we want to build  our

software  by increasing community bonding within our society,

we  must  work  towards increasing the rate of  participation

amongst  Singaporeans.  We know, and we heard  earlier,  that

the  National  Volunteer Centre was set up for this  purpose,

and  that purpose being to promote volunteerism in Singapore.

In  this  regard,  I  would like to ask  the  Minister  three

questions.  First, whether the National Volunteer Centre  has

made  much  progress  since its formation,  in  getting  more

volunteers to come forward to give off their time and  energy

to  serving  the community, and to give us an update  of  its

progress.   Second, whether or not we can  inculcate  in  our

young a greater spirit of volunteerism that goes beyond  just

the perfunctory community service programmes organised by the

schools  just  to  fulfil its curricula  requirements.   And,

lastly, whether we can bring volunteerism down, even further,

to  the grassroots organisations by organising smaller groups

within  each block to encourage residents there in  community

living.   Presently,  the  RCs  typically  look  after  11-12

blocks.  It is not possible for them to pay attention to  all

the residents, in all the blocks, and to be aware of all that

is happening within the community.  By having a smaller group

in  each  block, it would help the volunteers better able  to

create  a  sense  of community and a sense of belonging,  and

thus  strengthen community bonding.  I hope the Minister  can

respond to the comments.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, I agree with

many of the points raised by my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>



colleagues  earlier.   In fact, as a young  multi-racial  and

multi-religious country, I believe we will continue  to  face

challenges that can either unite or divide our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I believe that Singaporeans from all

ethnic  and religious groups, share a similar desire  to  see

that  we  will  continue to live harmoniously, hopefully,  no

tensions, no riots, no bloodshed.  We have not had  any  ugly

incident for more than three decades.  But the problem is  we

cannot guarantee that this will forever be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, there were several times when

the  temperature rose, and it became somewhat  tense.   Often

times,  it  started  not  as a local  problem.   Instead  the

situation  was  actually imported from  real  tensions  which

happened elsewhere.  However, due to the active work  of  our

security  officers, we managed to avoid things  from  getting

worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in maintaining racial and religious harmony, I

do  not believe it is a good idea for us to rely entirely  on

our  security  apparatus to do the job.  Instead,  I  believe

that  all of us, the people of Singapore, from all races  and

religions,  should take it as part of our national  duty,  to

build  and  improve  upon  inter-racial  and  inter-religious

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we need to be able to see each other as part of

the big Singapore family.  And as a family we need to reach a

higher  level of comfort in the way we deal with one another.

We  need  to take care of each other and willingly  help  one

another.   And  we  should not let anyone  to  be  sidelined,

alienated, discriminated, or marginalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no responsible citizen should leave things to

chance  when  it  comes to inter-racial  and  inter-religious

harmony.  I believe we should all play a part.  And  we  need

to  enhance our social and community bonding in times when we

are  living in peace and harmony.  I think it is too late  to

want to do something when things have already turned ugly. It

is  like our young men in National Service.  They need to  do

their in-camp and reservist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>



duties,  and  they are kept prepared to deal  with  difficult

situations  whenever it arises.  And we all  hope  that  they

could measure up to it when the time comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, we should all do our best to establish

trust  among our people, such that we would be able  to  keep

calm and not easily be aroused and fall prey to calls of riot

and bloodshed.  The real danger in difficult and tense times,

as   we  can  learn  from  past  incidents,  and  the  recent

happenings  in  Gujarat, is the spread of rumours  and  lies,

designed to infuriate different groups against one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are most vulnerable if we lack trust and a sense

of  one  people,  one nation.  But if we  are  successful  in

building bonds between the races, we can be resilient  enough

to  face such trying times and remain a stable and harmonious

country.   I sincerely hope that more Singaporeans  from  all

races  and all walks of life will come forward to spend  time

to  keep  Singapore a safe place, not only for ourselves  but

also  for our children and the future generation.  There  are

many  ways  for  us to do so, through various  organisations,

through  volunteerism, through the  IRCC.   And  I  hope  the

Minister, in this case, could share with us his assessment of

progress  in  community  bonding,  inter-racial  and   inter-religious   harmony  in  Singapore,  and   what   else   need

Singaporeans do or do not do in order to maintain and improve

the situation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, much has

been  talked  about on the need to maintain social  cohesion.

It  is  even  more critical for a multi-racial  society  like

Singapore.   Sir,  the  CDCs were formed  in  1997  with  the

primary task of maintaining and enhancing the level of social

cohesion  in  our society.  Since 1997, the CDCs  have  taken

different  shapes  and sizes, and today  we  have  five  CDCs

managed by full-time Mayors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the CDCs, the People's Association, with

its fleet of grassroots organisations, has also been actively

involved in implementing programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>



that  aim to enhance social cohesion.  To this end,  I  would

like to ask the Minister the following questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much has been spent by each CDC in programmes that

aim  to  promote social cohesion?  How do these CDCs  measure

social  cohesion?   What are the outcome indicators  used  by

CDCs  in  ascertaining the effectiveness of their programmes?

How much have been achieved thus far, and how much more do we

need  to  do?   Has there been any systematic  evaluation  of

these  programmes?  If there are, what are the findings?   If

not, are there plans to evaluate these programmes?  With  the

expanded size of the CDCs, how do they ensure social cohesion

in their respective geographical areas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the programmes developed by the CDCs and other

grassroots organisations oftentimes set the stage and provide

opportunities for Singaporeans to interact.  However, we have

often heard the common lament that it is the same people  who

are  participating in these activities.  If this is so,  what

is  the profile of Singaporeans who are not actively involved

in   social   programmes  organised   by   these   grassroots

organisations?  How do MCDS and the CDCs plan to engage  this

group of Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the responsibility of ensuring that social cohesion

is  enhanced  should not be limited to the  community  sector

alone.   We  need  to  ensure that  the  other  sectors,  the

employment,  the schools, etc, also consciously work  towards

enhancing  social  cohesion.  To this  end,  may  I  ask  the

Minister  the  extent to which MCDS works  with  the  private

sector  in enhancing social cohesion in the workplace?   What

programmes have been in place to facilitate this process?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we discussed the issue of social cohesion, we

must  also go beyond inter-ethnic relation.  Sir, our society

is  as hierarchical as any other modern society.  We do  have

different  levels  of social classes.  Social  cohesion  must

also address the relationship between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>



different  social classes.  In this regard,  may  I  ask  the

Minister  what is the level of participation of residents  in

private estates in the programmes that aim to promote  social

cohesion  organised  by  CDCs and  grassroots  organisations?

Sir, as we attempt to narrow the economic divide between  the

different  social  classes,  we  should  also  work   towards

narrowing  the  social  divide.   The  state  of  our  social

cohesion  is  indeed the responsibility of every Singaporean.

We must ensure that Singaporeans understand the circumstances

that Singapore is facing, and take ownership of the issue and

the  need  to  improve  our  level  of  social  cohesion.   I

understand  the  Ministry, and its related agencies,  can  do

that much in providing opportunities for Singaporeans, but if

Singaporeans  do  not respond, these efforts  would  only  be

futile.  Of course, the Ministry should continue its best  to

attract  and  assist  Singaporeans to identify  and  own  the

issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, when we talk

about   community  bonding,  normally  we  turn   to   social

programmes.  But the CDCs' experience in the last six months,

particularly when we embarked on "jobs, jobs, jobs",  it  has

given another dimension to this idea of community bonding and

social  bonding, and I would like to call that the  "economic

glue"  to social cohesion.  I would like to urge the MCDS  to

exploit the current economic downturn to better forge bonding

and  social cohesion among our people.  I would like  to  see

the   MCDS,   for  example,  to  encourage  the  better-offs,

particularly those who have benefited from the IT  boom,  and

those  who  are knowledgeable in IT knowledge, to impart  and

work  with the other groups, especially those in need of help

to  promote,  not only better dissemination of knowledge  but

also  better  bonding.   I  would be  most  grateful  if  the

Minister  could share with us MCDS' programmes that put  into

practice this idea of economic glue to social bonding.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I note with pleasure the

budgetary provision for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>



double  tax  deductions to individuals and  corporations  who

contribute monies to Institutions of Public Character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, philanthropy extends beyond giving money to

the  needy.  Philanthropy also means giving of our  time  and

energy to cater to the needs of the needy in our society.  If

a  society  is  to forge those bonds that make  for  national

cohesion,  then one of our unsung heroes or heroines  is  one

who  makes  the time and the effort to volunteer his  or  her

service at these institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers carry a range of out-of-pocket expenses

associated  with their work.  The contributions of  time  and

money  made  by volunteers in an emergency situation  can  be

considered  as  endowments bestowed on the community.   These

endowments are funded by both volunteers and their employers.

For  those  volunteers who are self-employed, their endowment

contributions could be substantial.  This situation contrasts

with  the  treatment  of  reservists and  the  Armed  Forces,

volunteers of another kind.  Where both the participants  and

their employers get many statutory-based tax concessions  and

other benefits, these are funded by the community through the

tax  system  to  encourage  their  commitment  and  continued

participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteerism and community service are a strong and

important  tradition for our nation to cultivate.   Expanding

opportunities for senior service befits an ageing  population

like  Singapore's.  The population of older adults is growing

rapidly,  and  it  is expected that the ageing  of  the  baby

boomers  will  accelerate  this growth.   Seniors  today  are

living longer than ever before and can often anticipate up to

30  years  of  productive post-retirement years.   Retirement

should be a time of economic security and physical well-being

and  should also provide seniors more opportunities to  serve

their communities.  Singapore should consider the setting  up

of  a  national vehicle for senior volunteerism.  This senior

voluntary  programme  can  work  with  non-profit  self-based

groups,  schools  and  other civic organisations  to  provide

opportunities for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans of all ages to serve their communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior volunteer group can use the talents, skills

and experiences of older Singaporeans to help solve problems.

Members can help meet a wide range of community needs,  serve

one-to-one  with  young people with special needs,  and  help

other seniors live independently in their homes.  This senior

group  can organise themselves into various categories,  like

the  Retired  and  Senior  Volunteer  Programme,  the  Foster

Grandparent Programme and the Senior Companion Programme.  Of

course,  you may argue that the best volunteers will  be  the

ones  who do the job quietly and efficiently, taking the lead

without taking public recognition, knowing full well that the

hard work and dedication will be recognised in due time, but,

until  then,  happy  with  the  knowledge  that  a  task  was

completed  and  perhaps a life enriched, taking  satisfaction

from  the  wisdom found.  In the first Analect of  Confucius,

"To  remain  unoffended, and to feel  no  discomposure,  even

one's  ability  and  accomplishments remain  unrecognised  by

others."   Is  that not, after all, expected of a  person  of

complete virtue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Government and the community must

recognise   that  it  costs  to  be  a  volunteer.    Without

appropriate official recognition and support, many volunteers

have  begun  to question whether their commitment and  effort

are  appreciated.  Politicians, judges and the community  may

applaud the unselfishness of volunteerism, but the values  of

a fair go and equity are also key elements of our Singaporean

ethos and need to be shown to volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing volunteer participation to ensure the long-term

sustainability of volunteerism, for example, in the emergency

services, will become a significant focus for Singapore after

September 11.  Many of the agencies in which volunteers serve

have vigorous volunteer recruitment, motivation and retention

programmes,  which  include suitable  forms  of  rewards  and

recognition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how many individuals, who offer

their  services in the form of time and effort on a voluntary

basis to Institutions of Public Character, are recognised for

their voluntary spirit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the seniors, would the Minister look into

granting  some  seed  funding to support a  senior  voluntary

group  which could be the source supplier for volunteer work?

This will help to sustain volunteerism in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, Singapore

is  fast becoming a globalised state.  This is inevitable  if

we  were  to plug into the world economy.  But as  we  become

globalised,  more  and more of our young generation  will  be

working  abroad.  At the same time, an increasing  number  of

our  children  are  also going overseas for their  education.

This  in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  However,  as

more  and more Singaporeans are going overseas, the issue  of

national identity and rootedness becomes more acute.  We need

to  address  this issue urgently or we will risk  losing  our

younger  generation.  Home ownership, Sir, is  no  longer  an

effective  means  to hold them back.  We need  a  new  raison

d'etre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what programmes

his  Ministry  has to address this issue.   Perhaps  I  could

suggest a two-pronged approach to reach out to the hearts  of

Singaporeans.  These are: passion and participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion: passion for Singapore, passion for the

community, passion for the family and passion for friendship.

Family  and  community  bonding is an  important  element  in

fostering   rootedness.   I  have  spoken  to  a  number   of

Singaporeans  who are contemplating migration.   One  of  the

major  reasons that is holding them back is the  relationship

they have with their family members here and their friends in

Singapore.   Sir, I would like to urge the Minister  to  look

into  programmes  and  initiatives that would  encourage  our

people  and help them build closer relationships and stronger

bonds with their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>



family  members  and their friends.  This is particularly  so

for  the younger generation.  This way, their roots here will

be  strengthened.  For this purpose, perhaps we can designate

part of the Marina Esplanade as a Youth Corner, to allow  our

younger  generation  to hang out and to  make  friends.   The

place must, firstly, be youth-friendly.  We can also organise

wholesome and exciting activities, not boring ones, that will

engage the young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation: active citizenship and participation in

nation  building.  One of the factors that are  pushing  some

Singaporeans  away is the sense that they have  no  place  in

Singapore.   They  have  to choose between  being  nobody  in

Singapore  or  being somebody in a less competitive  country.

We  cannot reduce the competitive spirit, but I would like to

appeal to the Ministry to create more space for Singaporeans,

and give them greater opportunity to participate in important

matters  such as nation building.  This will make  them  know

and  feel  that they have an important role to  play  in  the

making  of  Singapore, that they have a say in shaping  their

collective   future.   This  way,  we  can   promote   active

citizenship and strengthen the sense of belonging.   We  must

take  the feedback from the people seriously.  Change, if  we

agree  to  the feedback, and explain if we do not agree  with

them.   Otherwise, we may end like what some of the residents

say about feedback - feed, but nothing comes back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, national identity and rootedness cannot be

developed  overnight.  We have come quite a long  way,  given

the  short history that we have.  However, more needs  to  be

done  and  can  be done.  I believe passion and participation

are  the  keys  to  building a strong national  identity  and

active citizenship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, yesterday I spoke about

growing  old.   It  is always a pleasure to  talk  about  the

youth, for after all they are our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports

has  identified one of its objectives as being rooting  youth

with our shared values.  I think that is a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>



important  area, and I am glad that the Ministry  has  chosen

that  as one of its key objectives.  But I would like to just

raise  a few questions in the context of shared values "in  a

different  world" which, I think, the Deputy  Prime  Minister

spoke about when he tabled the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed facing a very different world. More and

more  of  our  youths are travelling, studying overseas,  and

they  will  imbibe  the kind of values  which  may  be  quite

different  from ours.  Looking at those kinds of  challenges,

what  are  the programmes in place to make us root our  youth

better  to  the kind of changing world and, more importantly,

the  changing Singapore?  There are very serious  issues  the

community  faces, especially post-911, which,  I  think,  the

youth  must  understand  fully, eg, what  multi-racialism  is

about, what are the challenges facing a young society,  which

is very keen on nation building, especially in the context of

our multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to share with us,

again, the thinking and the programmes which the Ministry has

in  terms  of  what it means by rooting our  youth  with  our

shared values.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, it is heartening

to  note  that  the standard of corporate governance  in  our

public  companies in Singapore has improved in recent  years.

This  follows  a  gradual  implementation  of  the  Code   of

Corporate  Governance practices recommended by the  Corporate

Governance  Committee some 1 1/2 years ago.  There  has  also

been  some adoption of better governance practices among  the

larger    private   companies,   including   having   greater

transparency and more independent audit committees and  board

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the area of non-profit charitable

organisations, there are currently no such practice codes  to

guide  and strengthen the management of large sums of  public

monies.   For  example,  from time to time,  there  has  been

public  disquiet or criticism over the use of funds by  large

charitable organisations,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>



like  NKF,  Community Chest, and so on.   I  believe  greater

oversight   of   charitable   organisations,   through    the

formalisation of a proper governance code similar  to  public

companies,  may  help  strengthen  and  further  enhance  the

confidence of Singaporeans who contribute to charities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formulation of a Code of Good Governance

Practices  for  charitable organisations  is  indeed  timely.

Why?   Because  in  the  recent Budget debate,  DPM  Lee  has

proposed  that  double tax relief be given for  donations  to

Institutions of Public Character (IPC).  IPC status  is  also

made more readily available for qualifying charitable private

foundations.  Sir, I see this as part of the national  effort

to encourage more Singaporeans to donate to charities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the promulgation of such a code rests with

the  Commissioner of Charities under the Ministry of Finance,

and  MCDS'  role  is  just  to help promote  more  charitable

giving.   Nevertheless, I would like to ask the  Minister  if

his  Ministry  is  working closely with MOF and  the  various

agencies under his charge to develop and implement a Code  of

Practice  for fund-raising, in line with the national  effort

to  promote transparency and ensure greater accountability in

the  use of public monies, which include charities.  I  would

like  to  recommend that this be looked into so  that  public

accountability can be strengthened and that kind and generous

Singaporeans  can  be assured that their money  is  going  to

where their hearts want it to go.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, let's all be charitable

but, I am sure, not with time, I am sure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set ourselves the laudable task and mission

of  becoming a gracious society.  But we all know that we are

still  far  from  that  target, the Small  Kindness  Movement

notwithstanding.    The  call  for  TUP  (Toilets   Upgrading

Programme) and kiasuism are some of the examples to show that

we  still  have  some way to progress.  But I am  very  happy

indeed  to  see the Deputy Prime Minister and the  Government

promoting philanthropy.  Yes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>



let us focus on upgrading ourselves, become more competitive,

but  we  should not inadvertently become less public spirited

and  more  self-absorbed individuals.  I agree that  we  must

continue   to   show   our  care  and  concern   for   fellow

Singaporeans, and to contribute as members of our society  to

worthy projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to add that while the Government

in  being  generous in the new areas which they are  offering

tax  rebates, I would like to also propose that  perhaps  for

those  organisations without IPC status, the Government could

also  consider on a project-to-project basis, worthy projects

and  good programmes, which I think deserve community support

and philanthropy.  Perhaps, the Government could also look at

them on a case-by-case basis.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I like to thank

Members for all their charitable remarks for MCDS.  First,  I

like  to thank Mr Charles Chong and other Members for raising

their  concerns  about social cohesion.  We all  are  equally

concerned that this is an important area.  But let me try and

address  this in a larger context before I take some specific

issues.   As I see it, there are two very important concerns:

first, the communal divide, and, second, the material divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first describe what I see as the fundamental

principles  of managing communal relations for  the  last  40

years.   Basically,  there are three  principles.   First,  a

secular  government  that "holds the  ring"  and  takes  firm

action against disruptive elements.  Second, equal access  to

all  communities  to  basic  services,  that  is,  education,

housing,  medical care, and so on. In this way, no one  group

will  feel denied or marginalised.  And, third, the principle

of meritocracy, where everyone advances by his own merit, not

because he belongs to a certain group, race or religion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this model for maintaining communal harmony has

served us well for more than four decades of nation building.

A  Survey on Social Attitudes commissioned by my Ministry and

conducted in the first half of 2001, found that 9 out  of  10

Singaporeans were generally satisfied with race relations  in

Singapore, with the Malays being slightly more likely  to  be

satisfied than the Chinese and the Indians.  The Survey  also

found  that  a  vast  majority of  Singaporeans,  about  97%,

thought it was good to have people of different races  living

in  the  same  neighbourhood.  And  not  only  that,  98%  of

Singaporeans were comfortable with the idea of allowing their

children to play with children of other races.  There were no

significant differences between the different races  in  this

regard.  So across-the-board, everyone feels comfortable  for

their  son to play with the son of a neighbour who  may  come

from a different group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 9 in 10, or 89%, of Singaporeans found their

neighbours  helpful and friendly, and with Malay Singaporeans

being  slightly  more  upbeat than their  Chinese  or  Indian

counterparts.   82% of Singaporeans thought that  they  could

turn to their neighbours for help in times of need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in general, based upon the survey that we had done

on  attitudes, communal relations look to be  good.   But  of

course,  you must remember this survey was conducted  in  the

first  half  of  2001.   And foremost in  the  minds  of  us,

undoubtedly, in Mr Zainul Abidin's mind, events of  September

11 and, of course, December 2001 have placed some stresses on

our  communal  relations.   My Ministry  will  be  conducting

another  survey to see whether or not the views have changed.

So  the  first  set of surveys will help us to establish  the

baseline  for  us to manage or to understand  where  communal

relations are going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even before the event of September 11, the Survey

on  Social  Attitudes  found  that,  whilst  Singaporeans  in

general  are  satisfied  with communal  relations,  there  is

actually  one very striking difference - younger Singaporeans

were significantly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>



less  satisfied with race and religious relations than  older

Singaporeans above 30 years of age.  So we need to understand

better  the  reasons for this generational  difference  which

could   be   rooted  in  the  life  experiences  of   younger

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share what Mdm Ho and Mr Maidin have raised that

our  people  are  our  core aspect of defence.   How  we,  as

citizens,  respond to the events of late 2001, or  indeed  to

any crisis, such as terrorist attack on our country, would be

critical  to  the  test of our cohesion  and  maturity  as  a

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the HDB housing policies and efforts by the

People's Association and MOE in the community and schools, we

have  tried  to  maintain  an  integrated  environment  where

different  races  can mingle.  The survey findings,  I  cited

earlier, show how our inter-racial ties are good, but I think

we need to build more upon this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the promotion of harmonious communal relations

is an on-going journey that all communities in Singapore have

to take and we will have to adapt as we go along.  The coming

of  age of a younger generation of Singaporeans means that we

need   to   re-energise   our   efforts   at   inter-communal

communication,  to  re-discover  each  other  if   need   be,

especially in relation to what has happened in the  last  few

months.   Each  community in every generation will  have  new

views,  new  mindsets, new influences and,  maybe,  even  new

blind  spots.  So we cannot assume that the foundations  that

underlay  the comfort level among older Singaporeans  can  be

understood,  appreciated,  or even replicated,  by  different

generations.   Indeed, a new generation  will  have  to  work

together  to  create  their  own comfort  zones  and  comfort

levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communal harmony does not mean that each community

insisting  on  having its way.  Indeed, all communities  must

learn  to  give  and to take, and no community should  labour

under  the  false  impression that they are always  the  ones

having to make concessions.  What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>



is  needed  is an understanding and readiness to  accommodate

one another in the interest of the greater national good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is where I believe the various grassroots

organisations,  community-based  organisations,  schools  and

Inter-Racial  Confidence Circles (IRCCs) can  play  a  useful

role.   In  response to our Prime Minister's call, there  are

now about 38 IRCCs created and they are made up of leaders of

different  ethnic groups and organisations in the  community.

They  organise programmes to help residents better appreciate

one  another's culture and religion.  By July this  year,  we

hope  to form IRCCs in all constituencies.  Mr Charles  Chong

has asked us about the composition and how successful we have

been.   From  the  best  of my knowledge,  in  terms  of  the

composition,  we have been able to attract the non-grassroots

organisation type into the IRCCs.  But having said  that,  we

are leaving it to the various IRCCs.  So you may form an IRCC

of  10  members.   It  does not mean you should  stop  at  10

members.  You can continue to expand and bring in new leaders

that  you  think will be helpful in your IRCC.   These  IRCCs

will  play  an  important role, should  there  be  a  crisis,

because  they will help to maintain calm and manage relations

in the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also embarking on many activities to promote

racial  harmony.  I believe such cross-cultural  appreciation

and  interaction  from young will help to pave  the  way  for

bonds and friendships to be cemented across the races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effort to get to know one another must take

place  from the ground up and from the young.  And the effort

must  also  be sustained.  The learning must start with  what

each  community is all about - the identities,  the  beliefs,

the  values  and  the  practices.  The  learning  must  cover

uniqueness,  but  more  importantly,  it  must  also  address

commonalities - what are the values and objectives  that  all

communities  share that bind us together,  in  spite  of  our

differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share with you an example. I am sure

other Members can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>



relate  to  the same example.  Just recently, the Kolam  Ayer

IRCC organised a group of grassroots leaders and residents to

visit  the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Taoist Man  Sun  Fook

Tuck Chee Temple, both in Jalan Besar GRC.  Participants from

different  religions found that they all pray  for  the  same

thing - harmony, peace, prosperity and happiness.  So when we

recognise  the things that we share in common and hold  dear,

stronger bonds can be developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the second potential area that

could  affect social cohesion, and that is a growing material

divide.   As  mentioned by some Members in the House,  income

disparity  is  inevitable in a globalised economy  that  pays

knowledge  workers a premium but where the pay  of  unskilled

workers  is  constantly being beaten down by  cheaper  labour

elsewhere.  Disparity itself is not a bad thing, but a  sense

of  divide can be dangerous.  So we need to build bridges and

bonds  across  all levels of society as well  as  all  social

classes.   We  need a culture where the more  successful  are

motivated  to "give back to society" and help those  who  are

less successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address some of the concerns raised by

Members - Mr Charles Chong, Mr Maidin, Mdm Ho and Mr Sin Boon

Ann.  They have all called for more Singaporeans to be active

citizens  and to volunteer their time to help those  who  are

less fortunate.  First, Mr Charles Chong and Mr Sin Boon  Ann

have  pointed out that our volunteerism rate, which is  9.3%,

lags  behind  some other developed countries.  Although  this

figure looks small, I believe there is a growing interest  in

voluntary   service,  and  there  is  a   lot   of   informal

volunteering   by   Singaporeans,  such   as   helping   your

neighbours,  keeping an eye on the house  of  your  neighbour

when they are away on holiday, feeding the cat, and the like.

These  are  all not captured in the statistics.  So  I  think

this  is  an  under-reporting.  More than anything  else,  we

should  not  be complacent, we should work towards increasing

that rate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the people sector is made up of ordinary

people  who are moved to do something, big or small, for  the

wider community.  I could cite many heartwarming examples but

let me just mention one:  Rachel Ong, a very successful young

professional,  who helped to start a programme called  Thumbs

Up  to help teenagers build their self-esteem and reach their

potential.  She also roped in her friends, many of  whom  are

busy  young  professionals, to volunteer with the  programme.

The  programme achieved overwhelming response from over 6,000

students  in less than a year.  I see people like Rachel  and

her friends as part of a bridge across the material divide in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have raised the point on how we should

appreciate the efforts of volunteers.  Mdm Ho touched  a  bit

on  some  of  the  incentives which  are  given  to  National

Servicemen.  I am not sure whether she is suggesting that  we

should  give  tax  rebates  to volunteers.   But  I  am  sure

financial  incentives  are not the  only  reason  why  people

volunteer their time and resources.  How do we actually value

and  quantify volunteers' time and contributions  across  the

different  activities?   It is a very difficult  question  to

answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are important factors that help volunteers to come

forward,   such  as  the  supportive  family  and  supportive

employers,   the  desire  to  contribute,  and  a  fulfilling

volunteering experience.  Obviously, they must feel fulfilled

when  they  go down to the schools, or to the home,  or  even

helping out in the neighbourhood.  People just do not want to

feel  that they are wasting their time.  Today, more educated

volunteers  seek meaningful volunteering opportunities  which

capitalise on their skills and they have to fit in with their

own work-life commitments because there are other demands  on

their time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many volunteers may also find it increasingly difficult,

given  their time constraints, to commit themselves  for  too

long to any one particular cause or programme.  They may have

an hour a week, or two days a month, that they can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>



contribute.   How  do you slot that into  the  needs  of  the

voluntary  organisation is a challenge for  all  of  us.   So

volunteer  host organisations will have to respond creatively

to these trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, other than attracting more volunteers, a

critical  challenge that we face is to help the organisations

strengthen  their  capabilities  to  manage  volunteers  more

effectively,  and thereby nurture a culture that  appreciates

and recognises volunteers.  Previously, volunteering means we

are spending time on a particular project organised by a VWO.

We  came forward and gave our time without really knowing the

details of the project.  Now, we need to better manage  those

expectations because some of them may not have the luxury  of

time as some others may have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Volunteer Centre (NVC) works closely

with  the volunteer host organisations to put in place a good

volunteer   management   practice,   for   example,   through

consultancy and training.  There are various awards  also  to

recognise volunteers' contributions.  At the highest  levels,

these  include the President's Social Service Awards and,  of

course, the National Day Awards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NVC will not replace the CDC, but they will

play  a  complementary role in fostering  community  bonding.

The  NVC  is  actively partnering CDCs to support  volunteer-driven  programmes  at the community level.   As  a  national

body,  what the NVC will do is to set standards in  volunteer

management  practices  and  administer  national  awards  for

volunteer coordinators and volunteer host organisations.   So

the  NVC  will  therefore augment, or value  add,  the  CDC's

efforts  by  providing consultancy and  advice  on  volunteer

management practices and training.  Promoting volunteering is

just  one of the ways in which CDCs encourage their residents

to have a strong sense of ownership in the local community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the matter of philanthropy.

Before  that,  Mdm Ho has made two specific suggestions,  ie,

funding  for a senior citizens' volunteer group.  I mentioned

earlier, in my speech,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>



that  we have launched a $5 million fund for an active senior

citizens  programme.   Six projects have  been  approved  and

these  projects  are  meant  to promote  specifically  inter-generational  bonding and to engage our senior citizens.   So

any  group  is welcome to submit proposals to this particular

project so that they tap the money for the purpose which  Mdm

Ho has suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address another point. Mdm Ho may know that

there  are already existing senior citizens organisations  at

the national level, such as RSVP and SAGE. So these are again

organisations  that could easily tap on the funds  which  are

made  available, through the Ministry, to run programmes,  to

draw  upon  the  volunteers and make sure  that  they  remain

active and engaged within the community.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann has also asked what else can be

done and what sort of impact have we made after the formation

of the NVC.  We did a volunteer benchmark survey in 2000.   I

do  not have the results of the survey here.  But we will  do

another  survey this year to assess the progress.  There  are

other  signs of progress that NVC has made an impact.   There

is greater awareness, and the media has helped us in terms of

promoting  some  of  the good examples.  Last  year  was  the

International  Year of Volunteers 2001, so  we  had  a  whole

range  of programmes.  One particularly interesting programme

is  "Volunteer as a Family" that was promoted by the NVC.  So

there  are  many efforts in place.  I hope Members  can  wait

until  the second survey, when we can do an analysis  of  the

progress of our efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Sin also suggested that in order to promote

the  sense of volunteerism, we should try and work  with  the

grassroots  organisations to build smaller units  instead  of

the  RCs.   I  am  sure Members have heard  about  the  Block

Representatives.  I understand some constituencies  have  it,

some  do  not.  But these are schemes, that I agree  with  Mr

Sin, that we could work towards, forming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>



smaller  units,  because some of the estates may  have  grown

and,  therefore,  we need small and nimble units.   There  is

nothing  to prevent that from happening.  I am sure we  could

work with PA on how we can further push this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a strong and close-knit society, the more

successful  must see it as their responsibility to  help  the

less   successful.    We   have  many   examples   of   early

philanthropists,  such as Dato Lee Kong Chian,  Dr  Lim  Boon

Keng,  the various Arab families, such as the Aljunieds,  the

Alkaffs  and  the Alsagoffs, Mr Mohammed Eunos  Abdullah,  Mr

Govindasamy  Pillai, and many others who have contributed  to

the building of modern Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture a supportive environment and charitable

giving, my Ministry will work with our partners, such as  the

National  Council of Social Service and the  Commissioner  of

Charities  under IRAS, to promote the value of  philanthropy,

to    support   informed-giving   and   to   strengthen   the

accountability  of  charities.   The  public  will  be   more

confident    about   supporting   charities,   if   charities

demonstrate  that  they are responsible in fund-raising,  and

wise and prudent in using the donated funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to set the pace, the Community Chest will increase

its  efforts  to reach out to the donor community.   ComChest

will  keep  donors  regularly updated on  its  work  and  the

results  of their donations.  It will continue to  give  full

and  transparent  accounts of its stewardship  of  the  funds

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mr Chew Heng Ching that we must

ensure that charities remain accountable and responsible.  My

Ministry  is  working  closely with the National  Council  of

Social  Service  (NCSS) to draw up a code of good  governance

for  voluntary welfare organisations this year.  NCSS is also

developing codes and guidelines for VWOs, covering areas such

as  programme development, financial accountability and fund-raising practices.  NCSS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>



also organises workshops for VWOs on these topics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS is also studying the feasibility of requiring its

members  to comply with a code on fund-raising practices,  in

order for the donors to continue to enjoy tax exemption.  The

code will address many issues including, for example, how  to

deal with fund-raising appeals that are being made after  the

target  has  been  achieved.  Another issue  is  fund-raising

ethics,  eg,  the  use  of  children  and  how  children  are

approached to raise funds for charities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also working on requiring Institutions

of  Public  Character  (IPCs) and charities  to  place  their

essential  profile and financial information on the Internet.

This  will give donors and members of the public easy  access

to  information on how donations are disbursed and the  types

of  activities which are being funded and undertaken  by  the

IPCs  and  the charities.  MOF has sought feedback  from  the

public  and  they are supportive.  So my Ministry is  working

with  NCSS  and MOF to provide more information online  about

such  best  practices so that donors can make  more  informed

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that NCSS is helping the

Government  to  set up an online donation portal  on  the  e-Citizen  website  by the end of this year.  The  portal  will

make  it easy for people to donate to Institutions of  Public

Character  of  their choice.  It will also  have  information

about  the  participating IPCs to help promote more  informed

giving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen community bonding among Singaporeans,

we   need   a   good  infrastructure  and  strong   voluntary

organisations  to serve as effective platforms for  community

participation.  However, most importantly, it is people  like

you  and  me,  who  are  at the heart of  it  all,  community

leaders, volunteers and citizens, stepping forward as  active

citizens to make a difference to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can now address some of the specific concerns

raised by Members.  Both Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Zainul



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>



Abidin  have raised pertinent questions on the rootedness  of

our  youths and how to keep them engaged and young.   Mr  Gan

has  made  an interesting suggestion of a programme based  on

passion  and participation.  Somehow, it did not  escape  me,

but  the acronym is PAP!  We share the Member's concern, Sir.

Indeed, with increased globalisation and ease of connectivity

with the rest of the world, our youths will increasingly  see

themselves  as global citizens.  This is not a bad  thing  in

itself.   It becomes a challenge, however, if their sense  of

global citizenship replaces or outstrips their attachment and

commitment to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainul that our young is our future, and

we recognise that for our youths to become effectively rooted

to  Singapore, they must be informed and engaged in  national

issues.   They must also feel that they have a stake  in  our

society through active involvement in various programmes.  We

have, for example, the National Education programme which  is

conducted  by  MOE, and the various Government  agencies  are

part of the Government's effort to educate, expose and engage

our  young  Singaporeans.  The National Youth  Council  (NYC)

organises and supports programmes, such as the National Youth

Seminar,  Prime Minister's dialogue with young  Singaporeans,

the   Polytechnic   Forum  and  ITE  Seminar,   where   young

Singaporeans can express their views on national  issues  and

play a part in policy making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was involved in some of these seminars, and I

have   found  our  youths,  far  from  being  detached  about

Singapore,  are  passionate  about  some  of  the  issues  in

Singapore, and they are prepared to raise their ideas without

any  inhibitions.   The  Youth Expedition  Project  organised

jointly by the NYC and the Singapore International Foundation

brings  youths to another country to experience, reflect  and

discuss  issues concerning the country they visit and  relate

these lessons to Singapore.  Such experiences will strengthen

their  conviction  about their roles and obligations  towards

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CDCs have also created many platforms for the

active involvement of our youths in the community.  The "Dare

to  Dream  Fund" administered by the Northeast  CDC  and  the

"Young  Leaders Community Project" by the Northwest CDC  and,

if  I  may  add,  the  "High-5 Youth Award"  by  the  Central

Singapore  CDC are some good examples of ways to attract  the

young into community involvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Volunteer Centre has also been working with

the   schools   to  interest  their  students  in   community

involvement and volunteer projects.  I am glad to report that

in  a  recent National Volunteer Centre survey, it was  found

that almost one-third of those between 15 and 24 years of age

have  done some form of voluntary work.  My Ministry believes

that  by engaging our youths in discussions and allowing them

to  turn  their  ideas  into  deeds  through  youth-initiated

community projects, we build in them a sense of ownership and

belonging.  The issue of rooting our young is, of  course,  a

multi-faceted one.  Yet, I think it boils down to  one  thing

which  Mr  Gan has pointed out - creating ties that bind,  to

friends and families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can provide social anchors for our youths, be it

through  strengthening family ties, education,  opportunities

for community participation, or simply involving them in more

of our discussions, we will be sending a strong signal to our

youths  that we value them and that they belong to Singapore.

I  assure Members of the House that my Ministry will continue

to work with other agencies to create and sustain these ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the queries. I have

mentioned  about  IRCCs.   At an appropriate  time,  we  will

report on the progress of the various efforts of the IRCCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has raised some concerns about whether or not

we are going beyond the usual people that we are engaging in.

I  would  like  to assure Members that we are also  concerned

about  that.  Obviously, in order to attract more people,  we

have to bring in new faces, but this is where volunteer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>



management becomes a very important aspect of how we are able

to draw some of these people, not only in terms of programmes

but to be able to contribute their time and resources to some

of the programmes that we conduct.  I do agree with him, as I

mentioned earlier, that we have to bridge the social classes,

and  this is where our appeal to the more successful to  come

forward is indeed something that we will continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul has mentioned specifically about how we root

our  young in relation to what has happened, ie, 911.   Later

on,  I  will  touch on what MUIS is trying to do  beyond  the

confines of just the Malay-Muslim community, to reach out  to

a  cross-section of the non-Muslim community,  including  the

young.  I hope the hon. Member can bear with me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with respect to the suggestion by Mr Gan Kim

Yong  that  perhaps a place in Marina Esplanade be set  aside

for  youths, we do have a place in Orchard Road,  called  the

Youth  Park,  which  is  meant for  our  young.   Other  than

physical  spaces,  I  would  like  to  assure  Members   that

opportunities  for our young to contribute  their  ideas  are

available  and continue to increase, eg, the efforts  by  the

Remaking Singapore Committee.   The Committee is reaching out

to a whole cross-section of people, including our young.  The

same thing was done during the Singapore 21 exercise in which

I  was  involved.  We will reach out to the school  students,

the polytechnics, the JCs and the universities, to create not

only physical spaces but also virtual spaces for them to come

forward  to  contribute ideas and suggestions.  I know  there

are  programmes being undertaken by the CDCs with some  youth

groups  to carry out programmes to further entrench  some  of

these youths who have come forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the queries raised

by Members.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has not

answered my questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>



I would appreciate it if he could answer my questions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like to thank

Mdm Halimah for reminding me.  Mdm Halimah has asked in Malay

about   the   People's  Association's  survey  on  grassroots

participation  and efforts in strengthening  racial  harmony.

Dr  Maliki has also raised about the efforts of the CDCs  and

the People's Association in enhancing social cohesion and how

this can be measured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to add that I chaired a committee in

PA to look into how we can strengthen participation among the

various communities in Singapore.  We have launched a  couple

of  programmes through the various groups that we have in the

CCs.  But, if I could seek Mdm Halimah's indulgence, Minister

of  State,  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen, will address  some  of  them,

together with the other issues that both Mdm Halimah  and  Dr

Maliki have raised in their cuts on PA and CDCs, and we  will

give a more complete reply to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in September 2000, the Committee

on  Sporting Singapore (CoSS) was set up to review  and  make

strategic  recommendations on how sports  should  be  further

developed   in  Singapore.   The  main  Steering   Committee,

comprising three Ministers and a Minister of State, had  four

equally  high-powered sub-committees.  These  committees  met

between September 2000 and May 2001, and involved almost  the

entire  sporting fraternity in Singapore.  The objective,  in

the  words  of the former Minister for Community  Development

and Sports, ie, yourself, Sir, was "To question fundamentals,

discuss possibilities, re-examine priorities and explore  our

dreams  for  sports in Singapore."  The Committee  eventually

submitted  its report with 40 recommendations that would  set

the  directions  for  sports development  in  Singapore.   To

implement  these  recommendations, the  Government,  together

with  Singapore Pools, has committed $500 million  over  five

years  to  sports.   Could the Minister give  us  a  progress

report on the implementation of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>



40  recommendations?  How successful have we been  in  moving

towards  our  "Sports For Everyone" objective of achieving  a

sports participation rate of one in every two Singaporeans by

the  year  2005?  In "Sports Excellence", what measures  have

been  taken to ensure that we stand a good chance of emerging

one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by 2010?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our efforts to promote "Sports Excellence" and

"Sports For Everyone", I would also like to urge the Minister

not to overlook the sporting needs for the disabled.  Perhaps

more  grants  could  be  provided for  the  Singapore  Sports

Council  for  the  disabled.   Our  disabled  sportsmen   and

sportswomen  appear  to  be  bringing  home  more  medals  in

international  meets  compared to our  able-bodied  athletes.

Perhaps,  more  of our sports facilities should  be  disable-friendly, and the future sports school should admit promising

disabled athletes in order that they, too, can realise  their

full sporting potential.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,

Sir,  MCDS has set two very challenging objectives:  (1)   By

2010, Singapore will be one of the top 10 sporting nations in

Asia;  (2)   50%  of Singapore citizens could  take  part  in

sports activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can formulate some strategies to fulfil these

objectives, I think we can achieve the objective of  becoming

one  of  the  10 sporting nations in Asia or the  third  best

sporting  nation in Southeast Asia. There are many  countries

in  Asia,  such  as  China, India, Japan,  Korea,  Australia,

Taiwan  and  Hong Kong which are very strong in  sports,  and

certainly stronger than Singapore in this aspect.   Thailand,

Vietnam  and  Malaysia  are the strong  sporting  nations  in

Southeast  Asian countries.  In order for us to  achieve  the

objective of becoming one of the 10 sporting nations in Asia,

we  have  to  be  in the top 3 positions in  Southeast  Asian

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I attended a SEA Game in Malaysia. I found

that the standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>



sports   in  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  has   improved

significantly. I am sure we are all familiar with  the  story

of  the  tortoise  and  the hare. If  the  tortoise  is  well

prepared  and perseveres all the way, he will beat  the  lazy

hare  who  relaxes  in  mid-stream. Therefore,  in  order  to

achieve the objective laid down by the MCDS to become one  of

the top 10 in Asia, I have two suggestions to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore Sports Council should meet up with

all the National Sports Associations to find out what are the

reasons for their inability to excel.  Athletes and sportsmen

should discuss ways to improve their skills and techniques to

bring  out  their best performance.  Second, we should  award

scholarships to our sportsmen and sportswomen, sportsboys and

sportsgirls  to  go  overseas for  further  studies,  and  to

receive  professional  training  there,  in  order  to   have

breakthroughs in their respective sports. Then, we may have a

good  chance of fulfilling our objective of becoming  one  of

the top 10 sporting nations in Asia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in the budget for MCDS, there is

an  allocation  of  $21.8 million for the  sports  and  youth

programme. According to the budget, this money is mainly  for

the  implementation  of the Committee on  Sporting  Singapore

Programme.  I would like the Minister to enlighten the  House

as to the details of the sports and youth programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the recommendations of the CoSS, the

Government agreed to give a grant of $500 million to  promote

sports  to  be  spread over five years.   I  would  like  the

Minister  to  inform the House how much of this  money  comes

from   Singapore  Pools,  and  how  much  is  actually   from

Government funds.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, one of the pillars for the

vision  of  a  sporting Singapore is "Sports  for  Everyone".

Statistics  have shown that adults who take up  sports  start

when  they are young. To achieve this vision, we must put  in

resources to get our children active when they are in school.

Presently, there is this stark



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>



missing  link.  We are not reaching out to the young  in  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the setting up of an Inter-Ministry Committee for sports for everyone and excellence for

our  school children by the Education Ministry and the  MCDS.

There is a nice fit.  MCDS has the vision, the expertise  and

the  funding,  especially the facilities,  but  MOE  has  the

students,  that  is MCDS' target customers.  Without  working

closely  with the caregivers of the students, the  principals

and  the  teachers,  MCDS would not  be  able  to  reach  the

students to encourage an active sports lifestyle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lack of sporting facilities in schools.

Schools  have limited spaces so they would only pick the  few

sports  which  they have the facilities.   In  my  daughter's

school  I  observe they play soft tennis in the school  hall,

about  30-40  students  at one time, congested  with  a  long

waiting  queue  to just hit the ball.  Within one  hour,  the

poor  kid  is  only able to hit about three rounds  of  three

balls each.  They cannot even enjoy the game, the sun and the

feeling  of  perspiration.   So  how  do  we  achieve  sports

excellence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should tap on the community facilities among the

schools.  For  example, the CCs could bring in  the  regional

sports and fitness facilities nearer to the community so that

students   could   tap   on  these   facilities   with   less

transportation   problems.   We  could  also   identify   the

community facilities and have a central booking system  where

the   regional  sports  office  could  manage  so  that   all

organisations in the community could fully maximise  the  use

of these facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a lack of sports facilitators and

coordinators.   The teachers are doubling up these  roles  in

schools.   Some  do  not  even  know  the  sports  they   are

coordinating.  Let me quote my personal experience.  In  view

of   the   shortage  of  teacher  coordinators,   a   teacher

coordinator asked a Primary 3 student to learn from a page of

30-40  questions and then take a 10-question  test  paper  in

order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>



be  eligible to become a student scout.  The answers given by

the  student  must  be perfect, with the capital  letters  in

place.   MCDS  could  support these  schools  with  trainers,

coaches or sports volunteers who know the games.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should expand the concept of volunteers into the

sports  arena.   MCDS has done a great job for volunteers  in

social  and community work itself.  We should extend this  to

the  sports arena.  I thereby urge the adoption of an  Inter-Ministry  approach to provide for an integrated  approach  to

sports  for everyone and excellence, especially to the school

children and to lay the foundation for excellence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in our effort to promote sports

for everyone and to achieve our objective of one in every two

Singaporeans  being involved in sports, we must  ensure  that

sports complexes are available as basic infrastructure in all

our  HDB  housing estates where the majority of  Singaporeans

live.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sporting complexes should have, as a basic

requirement, facilities for track and field, an indoor sports

hall and a swimming pool. Facilities that can be utilised  by

as  many  residents  as possible, such as  a  swimming  pool,

should take priority over facilities that only a few can  use

at any one time, such as a tennis court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister consider ensuring that all our HDB

housing estates, including Pasir Ris New Town, have a  sports

complex with at least the basic facilities mentioned earlier?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, to be a

sporting  nation,  we  need to have  the  appropriate  sports

infrastructure in Singapore.  Many existing sports  complexes

and  facilities were built in the 1970s and 1980s.   Some  of

the  designs or facilities are obsolete while others  require

immediate  upgrading.   We need to develop  a  Masterplan  to

upgrade and rebuild our sports complexes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore should aim to host more world sports

events. This will not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>



boost  our  sports industry, but also place  Singapore  in  a

global  sports  arena.  To-date, we do not  have  world-class

sports  facilities  with capacity to host  large  world-class

sports competitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the Masterplan for upgrading and building

sports complexes in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do we have any plans to build a world-class sports

complex?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, for many years, Singaporeans

have identified with the National Stadium and its vicinity as

a venue for various sporting activities.  They range from the

former Malaysia Cup to even the recent Singapore Rugby 7.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang area indeed contains some of the symbols of

the Singapore heartbeat that we are striving to build so that

Singaporeans can identify with.  In the Budget debate in  the

House  here  last year, in your capacity as the Minister  for

Community  Development and Sports then, you  told  the  House

that the Government intends to redevelop the National Stadium

into an integrated sports hub which will provide Singaporeans

with  a world-class venue to watch top level sports, as  well

as provide excellent facilities for sports participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Kallang area has historical heritage value for

Singapore  and  is  used  for  a  wide  variety  of  sporting

activities for the participation of both the young  and  old.

It  is an area where Singaporeans could use and develop their

sports  talents and yet be a good venue for healthy lifestyle

pursuits and family recreation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that commercially, land use in

the  Kallang  area, as calculated by MOF and  URA,  may  have

better yield from other uses besides sports, especially  with

the  proposed location of the new MRT line there.  I  believe

we could still achieve this by blending on the development of

the sports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>



hub  with appropriate commercial activities and yet meet  the

needs of MOF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister if he is

still  proceeding with the development of the sports  hub  at

the  Kallang Theatre, in view of the concern of MOF and  URA,

and,  if  so,  to  give the House an update on  the  proposed

redevelopment of the National Stadium and the sports  hub  in

that area.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, each year, we have between 30 and

100 drowning cases in Singapore.  Over the last 10 years, 514

lives were lost through drowning.  Drowning can be attributed

to  a number of reasons, such as the design of waterways  and

pools, management of water facilities, and the knowledge  and

skills  of  users.  But drowning can be prevented  if  proper

training and measures were undertaken by the authorities, the

water  facility  operators and the people.  Experiences  from

other  countries have proven that drowning prevention efforts

have  been  successful in saving lives.  One key strategy  in

drowning prevention is to promote the understanding of  water

safety among our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, water thrills, but it can kill if you do not

understand   water   and  its  dangers.   Sadly,   not   many

Singaporeans understand water and water safety. That  is  why

we  often  read  about drowning cases in the  papers.   These

drownings  can be prevented. For example, if a  child  cannot

swim, he should not be allowed to be in a wave pool or should

at  least  wear  a life jacket, in addition to  a  buoy  when

playing  in  a wave pool. Wave pools are designed for  strong

swimmers to have fun, and they are dangerous to weak or  non-swimmers.  The simple lack of such knowledge will  cause  the

loss of lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help reduce drowning in Singapore, I would

like to urge the Minister to take the lead in spearheading  a

water  safety  or drowning prevention campaign in  Singapore.

This   programme  should  reach  out  to  all   Singaporeans,

including  domestic maids.  Sir, I wish to ask  the  Minister

the following questions:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the Ministry's plan to increase water

safety knowledge and skills among Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can the Ministry form a committee to review the

water safety measures in our pools and beaches?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the plans to prevent further drowning in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, just to alert Dr Teo,

he  asked what the Minister is going to do to take the  lead.

I just want to inform him that the Minister cannot swim, so I

am not sure whether I can take the lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong has asked about the progress in

implementing  our sporting plan.  Mr Ang Mong Seng  has  also

asked about our plans to achieve our sports excellence target

which  is for Singapore to be among the top sporting  nations

in  Asia  by  the year 2010.  Allow me to give the  House  an

update.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government committed an additional $500

million  over five years to our Sporting Singapore Plan,  and

this  was allocated to three broad areas:  Sports Excellence;

Sports for All; and the sports industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim in Sports Excellence is that Singaporean

athletes should be able to compete against the very  best  in

Asia  by  2010.   We  have a number of initiatives  from  the

Sporting Plan to achieve this, but let me just address  three

of these key areas which have made some progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, as Members would have rightly noted, is the

setting up of the Sports School which will be operational  in

2004.   This  is  one  of  the major recommendations  in  the

Sporting  Singapore blueprint.  The Singapore  Sports  School

will  have a high standard of sports training.  At  the  same

time  it  will  have a very flexible academic  curriculum  to

cater to the training and the competition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>



schedules of the students.  This will ensure that the student

athletes  will have access to quality education,  even  while

they  train.   The  Sports  School  will  also  be  admitting

talented, disabled student athletes, who can integrate in the

mainstream  school system.  Graduates from  the  school  will

form  a  significant part of the base of the future  sporting

talent  that  will  help us to achieve our Sports  Excellence

target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative, which was also touched by Mr Ang

Mong  Seng, is that the Singapore Sports Council is currently

carrying  out  a comprehensive review of the National  Sports

Associations   (NSAs).   This  review  will  help   establish

strategic directions, targets, as well as key programmes  for

the NSAs.  Increased support in funding and manpower will  be

given  to  deserving NSAs so that they will  be  much  better

equipped, to not only promote their sport to the masses,  but

also to select and develop elite athletes in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key measure is a comprehensive support package

for  the  training  of  all national athletes.   Elite  level

sporting  performance  requires  dedication,  commitment   of

athletes  for  a  very  long period of  time.   SSC  has  put

together the Athlete Career and Training Scheme (ACT),  which

is  a customised and enhanced support package to enable elite

athletes to commit to full-time training, either locally,  or

overseas,  for a period of 2-4 years.  Some of  our  swimmers

are now overseas under this programme.  This package includes

living  allowance,  training grants, study  grants,  coaching

fees, and training and competition expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the three key measures, my Ministry and the

SSC  are  also reviewing what we call the "Sports  Excellence

Delivery  System".   This  will  cover  issues  like   talent

identification, youth development, sports science and  sports

medicine, career counselling and planning, and the developing

of   expertise   of   coaches  and   officials.    With   the

implementation of the current, and possibly new  initiatives,

we  are confident that we will be able to compete against the

best in Asia by 2010.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second area of Sports for All, I am pleased to

report  that the sports participation rate has improved  from

24% in 1992 to 38% in 2002.  I would just highlight two areas

that  we  are  focusing  on to help  us  improve  the  sports

participation rate.  The first, of course, relates to  sports

complexes  managed  by  the SSC.  Mr Charles  Chong  and  Mdm

Cynthia  Phua, both asked whether sports complexes  could  be

provided  at  more locations.  Dr Teo Ho Pin has  also  asked

about  our  plans to upgrade and rebuild some of  our  sports

complexes in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the SSC's masterplan for Sports Facilities,

Singapore is divided into 13 sports zones.  Each sports  zone

has  a population size of about 200,000, and should enjoy  at

least  an  outdoor running track, a football field, a  sports

hall, a swimming complex and a tennis and squash centre.  For

instance, Sir, in the Pasir Ris New Town, which is within the

Changi-Pasir  Ris  Tampines sports zone, it  has  a  swimming

complex  and  a sports hall at Tampines Avenue 5,  about  two

kilometres  from Pasir Ris New Town.  But, Sir,  the  SSC  is

considering building another sports hall and a tennis  centre

at Pasir Ris New Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting out these guidelines, the SSC has to take

into  account the cost effectiveness of operating the  sports

complexes.  The SSC is currently reviewing the masterplan for

facilities  up  to  the year 2010.  Among other  things,  the

review  will look into the adequacy of our sports facilities,

types of facilities to be provided, as well as the upgrading,

rebuilding, or phasing out of older facilities.  This  review

will  therefore look at how sports facilities can  be  better

patronised   by   integrating  them  with   other   community

facilities,  and  how the cost of operations  of  the  sports

complexes  can  be  minimised.  SSC will  endeavour  to  seek

feedback   from  various  sources,  such  as  the  users   of

facilities,  grassroots organisations, as they undertake  the

review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mdm Cynthia Phua that the shared use

of  the  facilities is the way forward and  we  have  started

working in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>



this  direction.   For instance, to address the  shortage  of

playing  fields,  the SSC and the Ministry of  Education  are

embarking on a pilot scheme to share school fields within the

community.  Under the pilot scheme, seven school fields would

be  opened up for community use outside curriculum time.  The

SSC  will  maintain these fields, and manage the use  of  the

playing fields, after schooling hours.  Concurrently, we  are

also  opening  up temporary vacant lots of land  for  use  as

interim  sports  fields.   Two  of  such  sites  will  become

available  shortly,  one at Ubi Avenue 1  and  the  other  at

Marina  South.  With these new initiatives we hope to  create

more opportunities for Singaporeans to enjoy the benefits  of

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area that we are focusing to promote Sports

For  All  is to expand, and strengthen our network of  sports

partners.   The  idea  is  to multiply  our  efforts  through

encouraging  more  sports partners  to  support  and  deliver

sports  programmes.  Mdm Cynthia Phua has suggested  a  joint

committee between MCDS and MOE so that we can promote  sports

among the students.  I would like to inform her that we  have

started a programme with the schools to encourage the schools

to  hire  trainers,  to help those who  are  not  the  school

athletes to participate in sporting activities.  Well over 30

schools are now involved.  With a bit of funding from the SSC

they are now able to open up sporting opportunities for those

who  otherwise would not be involved in sports.  And this  is

best  left to the schools to decide.  Some of them have  even

engaged  the  parents of the students as  trainers.   In  one

particular  school I visited, the mothers were very  actively

involved  in some of the sporting events together with  their

children  and  the  trainers, to  ensure  that  the  children

continue to participate in some of these sporting events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial support, as I mentioned, Sir, where

applicable, will be provided to these partners.   With  their

new  role as facilitator and catalyst, the SSC also hopes  to

have  a  more coordinated approach to the planning of  sports

programmes and competition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also asked about the support for

the  disabled sports.  I want to assure him that  the  sports

agencies, representing the disabled sports in Singapore, will

also be part of the network which I have just mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third pillar is sports industry. The Singapore

Sporting  Plan also called for the development  of  a  sports

industry.   I  wish to report that we have been working  very

closely  with the Singapore Tourism Board, as sports  tourism

is  one  of  the key pillars of the sports industry.   In  FY

2001,  we  organised a number of prestigious sporting  events

which  proved  to  be  popular  with  both  Singaporeans  and

tourists.   Dr  Teo must have known this. We  had  Singapore-Manchester United and Singapore-Liverpool matches, as well as

the  Singapore  Rugby  7, which was  just  recently  held  in

Singapore.   Sir, our aim is to have a range  of  prestigious

sports  events that are commercially viable and are  able  to

help establish Singapore as a regional hub for sports events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has also formed a sports marketing team to build up

its  sports industry capabilities.  In time, Sir, we hope  to

be able to nurture sports related enterprises as the industry

grows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has drawn our attention to the

budget on youth and sports.  The $21.8 million is part of the

$500  million  Singapore Sporting Fund.  We are  tapping  the

Singapore  Sporting Fund to help schools in  terms  of  youth

development  for  sports.  In fact, in our arrangements  with

the  NSAs, one of the key items in the NSAs is that  we  want

them to have a youth development programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, Mr Tan has also asked how much of the

$500  million comes from Singapore Pools.  I wish  to  inform

the  House that $375 million, or 75% of the money, is donated

by Singapore Pools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Chew Heng Ching both asked

about the redevelopment plans of the National Stadium.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>



Government has agreed, in principle, to replace the  National

Stadium  with  a multi-purpose sports hub, which  is  also  a

major  recommendation  of the Sporting  Singapore  blueprint.

The  present National Stadium at Kallang, which was built  in

1973,  is  now  inadequate for our objective of developing  a

sports  industry.  The sports stadia of today are  no  longer

built  just  for sports alone.  They are designed for  multi-purpose   use,  with  facilities  such  as  retail   outlets,

restaurants, hotels, to attract customers to the stadium,  on

a daily basis.  It is therefore important that we upgrade the

National  Stadium  as  it is a vital  infrastructure  to  the

development of our sports industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a new sports hub will give Singapore

the edge to compete with the world's best in attracting major

sporting  events.   Besides being  a  world-class  venue  for

sports  and  entertainment event, it will also  be  a  unique

lifestyle centre with sports as a major theme, and an icon in

the  landscape of Singapore.  As Mr Chew has rightly  pointed

out, there is a new MRT station running nearby, that could be

integrated in the plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has engaged a team of consultants to conduct

a  feasibility  study of this project.  The study  will  look

into  issues such as the possible location of the sports hub.

We  still  have to find out what is the best type  of  sports

facilities  to include, possible events we could  stage,  and

the  business  models which we use to ensure its  operational

viability.  Sir, we aim to submit our recommendations to  the

Government by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of water safety, Dr Teo has asked what

are the water safety measures for the prevention of drowning.

I  remarked  earlier  that  I do not  swim,  but  I  am  also

concerned  about drowning because my two young  children  are

also  learning  how  to swim.  The Singapore  Sports  Council

operates  28  public  swimming complexes  in  Singapore,  and

employs qualified lifeguards to ensure water safety for these

pools.  The SSC also trains lifeguards, conducts water safety

related  courses, and run "Learn to Swim" programmes for  the

general public.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>



total  expenditure on all water safety related activities  is

approximately $6.1 million per annum.  SSC has  introduced  a

number  of water safety measures including a "Learn to  Swim"

scheme  to  teach non-swimmers to swim.  As of 31st  December

2001,  more  than  222,000 people have participated  in  this

programme.   The  SSC  also  started  the  National  Survival

Swimming  Awards  (NASSA) scheme in 1979,  to  promote  water

safety knowledge and survival swimming skills.  To date, Sir,

the  scheme  has produced more than 250,000 people  who  have

undergone  proficiency tests.  The NASSA scheme is  currently

promoted through 55 test centres, with more than 400  testers

and  swimming instructors supporting the scheme.   The  NASSA

syllabus was reviewed and revised last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, SSC collaborated with the Ministry of

Education   who   launched  the  NASSA   Excellence   Schools

Performance Award (ESPA) and Water Safety Enrichment modules.

This  is  to enable secondary school students to learn  about

water  safety  knowledge and survival swimming skills  within

the  school curriculum hours.  Dr Teo, as the Chairman of the

NASSA  Advisory  Committee, has said recently  in  the  press

conference  that  there  were  plans  to  extend  the   NASSA

Excellence  Schools  Performance Award  to  primary  schools.

Sir, we are supportive of this and glad that he is helping to

raise  the  awareness of water survival  skills  amongst  our

students.  The SSC is also working closely with the Singapore

Life  Saving Society (SLSS), to promote water safety  through

the  NASSA  scheme by producing publicity materials  such  as

posters and brochures to educate members of the public.  Sir,

the  SSC  will continue to train and educate members  of  the

public  on  water  safety to prevent  drowning  incidents  in

Singapore.  My Ministry will look into Dr Teo's suggestion of

forming  a  committee to review the water safety measures  in

our pools and beaches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the queries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, since MUIS

was  formed  in  1968,  it has played a  meaningful  role  in

meeting the aspirations of our Muslims.  Now, the Muslims are

entering  an era with greater challenges.  So, MUIS needs  to

make  some refinements for the good of the community and  the

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Internet age, there are groups that desire to

extend  their  influence around the globe.  Muslims  here  in

Singapore are not exempted.  But, what worries me are  groups

that  try  to  abuse  the religion for  political  and  other

purposes.   They  desire to spread extremism  and  militancy.

This can be troublesome to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want external elements to influence local

Muslims  by  breeding extreme attitudes and stand that  could

tarnish  the good name of our Muslims and affect  the  inter-racial  and inter-religious harmony here.  The arrest of  the

Jemaah  Islamiyah members was a clear example.   We  need  to

take  a  firm  stand  so  that such occurrence  will  not  be

repeated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe MUIS should take appropriate steps to help the

Muslims  in  this  country to maintain  the  correct  Islamic

attitude  and  behaviour, which is  to  be  moderate  in  all

things.  Extremism has no place in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>



Islam,  worse still, any activity  involving  terrorism.   In

fact,  I  believe that Muslims should be in the forefront  in

the fight against extremist activities, especially those that

involve terrorism.  The Muslim community should instead be  a

pillar in promoting all good values and in developing healthy

relations among people, regardless of race or religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that local Muslims are very concerned because

there  are some external groups which are damaging  the  good

name  of  Islam by using religion as a tool in their campaign

of  terror and militancy. They claim to be Muslims, yet their

actions are all contrary to Islamic values and teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if all Muslims in this country could

strengthen  their belief that Islam is all about  moderation,

and it teaches its followers moderation, it would not be easy

for  any outside group to sway them to the wrong path. As  we

equip  ourselves based on the do's and don'ts of Islam,  even

if  there are attempts by external elements, we would be able

to reject extremism and deviations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested to know how MUIS can help our Muslims to

stay  on  course  with  the correct  Islamic  teachings  that

promote  peace and harmony.  Can MUIS do more to ensure  that

wrong and deviationist teachings will not take root here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under AMLA, it is known that there are provisions

to appoint a Mufti in Singapore and also the establishment of

a   Fatwa   Committee.   This  is  because   of   the   heavy

responsibility of the Mufti and the Fatwa Committee to stress

the stand on issues regarding Islamic regulations and laws in

Singapore  to be used as a guideline for Muslims here.   This

is  a  highly respected institution in the Muslim  community.

The  views or decisions taken by the Mufti or Fatwa Committee

are  used in guiding the Muslim community.  This has  been  a

long  tradition,  maybe  hundreds of  years,  in  the  Muslim

community,  and  I  see this system has  proceeded  smoothly.

However, with this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>



system, it does not mean that people who have differing views

cannot  give their opinions. It has been a tradition  in  the

Muslim  community  whereby those  who  are  learned  and  are

scholars in the religious field should feel that it is  their

responsibility to give their views  to the Mufti or the Fatwa

Committee,  if there are certain aspects that they  find  not

very  accurate  and  sufficient attention  is  not  given  to

certain matters by the Fatwa Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, could you wind up your speech,

please?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay): This should be done in writing to the Mufti

and  not  to  the  press  that could lead  to  confusion  and

misunderstanding.  This is especially so  if  there  are  too

many  groups giving their views on certain issues and I would

like to ask the Minister if there are still opportunities for

the religious scholars and teachers to give their views.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I wish there were more

Members  in  the  House because halal cuts  can  be  just  as

sumptuous!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut on MUIS, Sir. Why cut now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS or the Islamic Religious Council's role in

secular  Singapore is unique.  Singapore may be  secular  but

even  that  brand  of  secularism  is  unique.   I  call  it:

secularism  with  a soul.  The tudung issue  notwithstanding,

Singapore is not anti-religion.  In fact, religion is allowed

to play its role in forging a harmonious and cohesive society

in  our  Singapore.   After all, MUIS is a  statutory  board,

appearing under the MCDS' care and budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the cut, yes, the budget cut, I was surprised to

see a 4% dip in Government grants to MUIS.  I do realise that

MUIS  has  for  some time now been receiving a larger  income

from its own zakat collection (tithes), but even that tap  is

facing a decrease, because of the economic downturn.  I  also

realise that there are quarters, though a minority, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>



feel  that  MUIS  should  not bother  about  funds  from  the

Government, for fear of being controlled, but I think that is

being   myopic  and  to  the  detriment  of  the  community's

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS, identified by the PM as one of the key pillars for

the  Muslim  community  and which Minister  Yaacob  has  also

highlighted as a critical player to achieve his vision of the

Community of Excellence, deserves all the help it can muster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially true, post September 11. The tasks

ahead  for  MUIS are even more formidable, both in forging  a

clear  world view for the Malay/Muslim community and to  help

it  uplift,  in the light of the new and changing world,  and

also   in   promoting   better   understanding   with   other

Singaporeans.   MUIS  needs new tools  and  added  resources.

MUIS needs to groom scholars who studied not just in Al Azhar

(in  Cairo) and Makkah/Medina (in Saudi Arabia) but also from

new centres of Islamic learning in other more plural and open

societies like Jordan, Morocco, or even in the US and Europe.

Studies  in  Islamic tenets and jurisprudence are basic,  but

equally   important  are  studies  of  contemporary   Islamic

societies  and issues, including how they meet the challenges

of  social  change, modernisation and living in  this  plural

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS needs all the resources to tackle these

challenges.  It should also engage scholars and intellectuals

from other parts of the Muslim world to work with our leaders

to  face  these tasks.  MUIS must also work closely with  the

community  and  religious  leaders on  issues  affecting  the

community.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not the time for the community to be passive and

self-defeating.   Neither  should the  community  be  finger-pointing   all  the  time.   The  community  does  itself   a

disservice by being insular.  It is time to look out  and  be

bold  about the fresh changes that are taking place  in  this

new and different world.  The community must feel and act  as

an  integrated  part of society in Singapore and  the  bigger

world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>



Being  a  Muslim  does  not make me less  a  Singaporean,  as

anybody  else in this House.  The community has to  stand  up

and  stand tall in being counted as moderates who believe  in

tolerance,  working  together as a  team,  whether  to  fight

terrorism  or  to build a better future for our children  and

grandchildren.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the arrests of 13 operatives of Jemaah Islamiyah is a

serious wake-up call to most Singaporeans.  Not only did  the

news  make  Singaporeans  realise  how  real  the  threat  of

terrorism  is,  it  also  highlighted  the  reality  of   how

vulnerable we can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the leader of the 13 arrested is a self-proclaimed religious leader sets a new dimension and presents

a    critical   challenge   to   Singapore.    Religion   has

traditionally  been  a  close and personal  matter  to  every

individual.   However,  events in the  world  have  suggested

strongly  that  it  is  no  longer a  personal  matter.   The

situation  is  critical  for a multi-religious  society  like

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every religion often presents its followers with a

set  of  values and beliefs that they should embrace.   These

are then translated into behaviours.  To some, religion is an

abstract   phenomenon  that  is  difficult   to   understand.

Followers  look  up to religious teachers  for  guidance  and

direction,  especially  when they are  faced  with  difficult

decisions to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like teachers in academic schools, religious

teachers  also  have the moral and ethical responsibility  to

provide  sound  teachings.  What  is  more  critical,  in  my

opinion,  is  that  religious teachers  must  understand  the

context  in which its followers are practising the  religion.

In  Singapore,  for  example, I think it  is  the  moral  and

ethical  responsibility of every religious  teacher  to  help

their  respective  followers understand  and  practise  their

religions  within  the context of a multi-religious  society.

This  implies the need to place higher value to  the  greater

good  of society than the interest of the individual.   I  am

sure that every religion aspires to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>



achieve  greater  good  for society that  its  followers  are

living in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sufficient evidence around the world that show

the charisma of religious leaders can influence the behaviour

of  his or her followers.  To this end, I would like to raise

the  issue of the qualification and registration of religious

teachers  in Singapore.  We must set a mechanism in place  to

ensure  that  religious  teachers  who  conduct  classes   in

Singapore are qualified and have the necessary qualification.

The recent incident of the JI operatives is an example of how

the  situation  may  be detrimental to the  security  of  the

country and how it can threaten social cohesion and religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the group is a self-professed religious

teacher  whose  qualification and credentials have  not  been

established.   We are fortunate that the group  was  arrested

before  any  mishaps could happen.  We cannot take  any  more

chances.   In this case, may I ask the Minister-in-charge  of

Muslim  Affairs  if MUIS has any plans to register  religious

teachers  who  conduct classes for Muslims in  Singapore.   I

understand that it will be an arduous task to do as there are

many classes that are taking place in residential homes.  The

value,  however,  is  that the register  will  enable  Muslim

Singaporeans  to  be  certain that they  are  indeed  getting

religious guidance from qualified teachers.  I feel  that  it

is  better  if  the public is informed on what measures  that

could  be  taken  should they suspect a particular  religious

teacher of improper teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier the critical point that religious

teachers  should teach their respective religion  within  the

context of our multi-racial and multi-religious society.   In

the  case  of the Muslim community, for example, we generally

find  that  many  of our religious teachers  are  trained  in

universities in countries where the Muslim community are  the

majority.    Oftentimes,  they  learn  the   experience   and

practices of these communities.  As the Muslim community here

is a minority, situations and practices for the Muslims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>



may be different here compared to countries where the Muslims

are   a   majority.   Indeed,  there  are  minority   Islamic

communities  of excellence in other parts of the  world.   In

our  effort  at  attaining  the  vision  of  a  community  of

excellence,  may  I  suggest  that  MUIS  provide  attachment

programmes  for  these  religious teachers  to  go  to  these

countries and understand how Islam is practised by a minority

community  par  excellence.  They can  then  bring  home  the

wealth   of   experience  and  teach   the   community   more

effectively.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): One of MUIS'

major successes has been in the implementation of the mosques

building  programme.  With the community's  contribution  and

the  collection  machinery  of  the  CPF  Board,  the  mosque

building  programme  has  been  our  meaningful  achievement.

Since  the  first generation Muhajirin mosque was  built,  we

have   witnessed  increasing  improvements  in  quality   and

architecture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems that many of these new mosques had to

expand  the space for prayers by fixing awnings or by  adding

several floors to cater to various needs.  This requires more

funds.   The  result  is  that  many  of  these  mosques  are

continuously  finding ways to raise funds.   In  fact,  there

have  been  occasions when several mosques compete  to  raise

funds at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many older mosques which are usually

in  a  state of disrepair also need attention.  Over the past

years,  several older mosques had been rebuilt or were  given

extensive  upgrading.   Each  project  requires  millions  of

dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are some mosques that continue to

organise  fund  raising projects even though their  upgrading

work  had been completed. They felt a need to raise funds  to

sustain  other activities. I wish to know if the building  of

new  mosques  will be an on-going programme  or  will  it  be

completed  within  a  certain  timeframe.   Can  the   Mosque

Building Fund afford to build one new mosque within a year or

18 months?  If not, will MUIS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>



encourage those who can afford it, to increase their  monthly

contributions?  As many Muslim workers have lost  their  jobs

in  this  difficult  time, it will  have  an  impact  on  the

collection of this fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the building of new mosques can be completed within a

certain  timeframe, is there a possibility  that  the  Mosque

Building Fund that is collected through the Central Provident

Fund  Board  be allocated for the upgrading or rebuilding  of

the  old  mosques?  Aside from these, I understand that  many

mosques in fact have large surpluses or savings.  Can we  set

aside, for instance, 10% of these funds, for the building  of

new mosques and the repair of the old ones?  As our resources

are  limited,  I think we need to explore new  and  effective

means  to  meet the needs of both our new and old mosques.  I

hope the Minister could clarify.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, compulsory

education  will  take  effect in  the  year  2003.   The  Act

recognises  the  importance of education  and  ensuring  that

every  Singaporean  child  is given  ample  opportunities  to

education  in  our national schools.  Sir, we also  recognise

that  education  is  indeed  the  social  leveller  and   for

Singaporeans to be able to survive in the knowledge  economy,

they  must possess a minimum level of education and a set  of

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students of full-time Islamic religious schools, or

madrasahs,  have  been given an exception on  condition  that

they  also sit for the PSLE examination and obtain a  minimum

grade.   I  believe that madrasah students and their  parents

are  aware of the need for them to also be prepared  for  the

new  economy.   Whether they graduate and seek employment  in

the  religious  sector or other sectors,  the  knowledge  and

skills-set  obtained will enhance their relevance and  indeed

employability in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, running a school is no easy matter. It requires

resources  and  expertise.  The focus of madrasahs  has  been

religious  education.  The inclusion of Mathematics,  English

and  Science  in  their  curriculum  will  indeed  create   a

challenge for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>



madrasahs.  In this regard, I would like to ask the  Minister

in charge of Muslim Affairs the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the level of PSLE result that the madrasah

students  must  attain when compulsory education  comes  into

effect?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How are the madrasahs gearing up in meeting up this

new  expectation?  Do the madrasahs have the needed resources

and   expertise  to  prepare  their  children  for  the  PSLE

examination?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the role of MUIS in ensuring that the

madrasahs stay focused on providing religious education  and,

at the same time, meeting the standards set?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What is the role of MUIS in curriculum development

in the madrasahs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Are there plans for the madrasahs to collaborate

with  the  national schools in terms of sharing of resources,

eg, use of science laboratories, etc?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs'

vision of a community of excellence, the madrasahs should aim

to  be an institution of excellence in the country and in the

region.   The  madrasahs will continue to serve an  important

function  for  the  Muslim  community.   They  will   produce

generations  of  religious  teachers  and  scholars  for  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also recognised, however, that not all madrasah

graduates will become religious scholars and teachers.   Some

may  be bankers, teachers, administrators, and so on.  I have

seen  graduates  of madrasahs succeed in our  local  tertiary

institutions.  They are indeed role models for the others who

have  set  their eyes on tertiary education.  The  Compulsory

Education  Act is a boost to these students as  they  acquire

the  requisite set of knowledge and skills.  It sets a  stage

for  madrasahs  to  succeed in attaining  the  vision  of  an

institution of excellence.  I would like to encourage MUIS to

continue  to  play  an active role in helping  the  madrasahs

excel  in  its  work.   As  the religious  authority  of  the

country, MUIS should set the directions for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>



madrasahs and assist the madrasahs secure the resources  that

they need to achieve their mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in taking the lead role on the development of the

Muslim   scholars  in  Singapore,  MUIS  should  also   guide

madrasahs  and its students on training opportunities  abroad

in  universities in countries where the Islamic community  is

the  minority community. This will provide greater  relevance

to  the application of acquired knowledge when they return to

Singapore  as religious teachers and scholars.   I  encourage

MUIS  to  take a more proactive role in guiding the madrasahs

and their students in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is undergoing major changes in its

economic  and  social landscape, so do the other  social  and

religious institutions. The Muslim community should  continue

to  see these changes as key to our efforts at attaining  the

vision of a community of excellence.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, many voluntary welfare

organisations (VWOs) are doing a good job in providing social

and  community services.  However, I often wonder if our VWOs

are  getting  adequate  support from  the  Government.   Many

organisations  seem to be in constant need  to  raise  funds.

Should  these organisations be required to raise funds  while

they  are  also  expected to provide  a  good  service?   And

Singaporeans  are  constantly demanding even  higher  quality

service, even though they are in a group who needs help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry ensure that our VWOs need not spend too

much  time  worrying about fund raising so  that  they  could

accord  more time and energy to excel further in the services

they  provide?  Can MCDS and the National Council  of  Social

Service assist our VWOs in this respect?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also raise some of the issues of catering to

the  needs  of people who do not speak good English.   It  is

well known that some people can communicate best in their own

language, be it Chinese,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>



Malay or Tamil.  Many of them speak broken English and  I  do

not  think  we  should expect them to explain  clearly  their

problems in English, especially to welfare workers.   Neither

should  we  expect them to understand clearly all the  advice

and counselling if they are given only in English.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I know if MCDS is working to cater to the needs

of  these  people?   One  example is  those  who  are  Malay-speaking.  I have seen some of them who come to my  MPS,  and

when  I  referred them to other agencies, they told  me  they

have tried and it is very difficult to communicate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that, in Singapore, many Malay families and youths

are  also  facing social problems.  Yet, I am  not  convinced

that  there are enough provisions made by social agencies  to

cater to them.  I hope the Minister can enlighten me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I understand that the National

Council   of   Social  Service  has  developed  a   programme

evaluation  system  to  assess  VWOs'  programme  output  and

outcome.   This,  I  also understand, has  resulted  in  some

programmes  of VWOs not being funded.  I would like  to  know

the  objective  of  implementing such a system  and  how  the

system  works.   I  would also like  to  know  what  are  the

criteria  of  the  evaluations,  and  under  what  evaluation

results would a particular programme not be funded.  How many

programmes   have  been  disqualified  so   far   after   the

evaluations and why are they disqualified?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that such a system measures

quantitative output of the service provided rather  than  the

qualitative service.  So I would like to request the Minister

to clarify this.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like to thank

all  the Members who have raised issues relating to MUIS  and

the  Malay-Muslim  community.  Let me take those  cuts  first

together, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first respond to Mr Maidin's question on how

MUIS,  a very important institution, can help our Muslims  to

stay on course with the right Islamic values and beliefs  and

guard  against deviant teachings.  Sir, MUIS is committed  to

building an exemplary Muslim community as an integral part of

the   multi-racial  and  multi-religious  Singapore  society.

There  are  a few important principles which MUIS  subscribes

to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Singapore Muslim community's experience has

shown  that  Islam is consistent with progress.  Muslims  can

progress  in  tandem  with other communities  without  losing

their religious identity.  Secondly, one can be a good Muslim

and  a  good  citizen,  and  these  are  not  opposing  aims.

Thirdly, Muslims must reach out to other communities to build

mutual  understanding and trust, and vice versa.  MUIS  plays

an  important  role  in  helping to strengthen  bonds  across

communities  and  presenting  the  religion  in   the   right

perspective to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and  MUIS  leads

the  Muslim community in evolving the practice of  the  faith

which is true to Islam and, more importantly, appropriate for

multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS reaches out to Muslims in a number of ways. For

example,  through the weekly Friday sermons in  the  mosques,

Muslims  are guided on the right religious values  and  their

responsibilities to forge a better future for themselves, the

community  and the nation.  In another instance, as mentioned

by  Mr  Maidin,  fatwas  or rulings which  serve  to  clarify

Islamic jurisprudence are important in guiding Muslims on the

sound practice of the Islamic faith.  Through fatwas, Muslims

are  guided in the practical application of Islam in response

to  emerging issues and developments in society.   The  Fatwa

Committee  is a very high-level committee which is  in  MUIS,

and  it  is  chaired, rightly so, by the Mufti and  comprises

Islamic  scholars with sound judgement and who have extensive

experience  in  Islamic jurisprudence.  Fatwas are  religious

rulings and they are binding on the Muslim community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Maidin has asked whether there are opportunities for

groups  to express their opinions on the Fatwa Committee.   I

would  like  to  inform  the  Member  that  the  channels  of

communication  are  constantly open.   Groups  who  may  have

opinions  on certain matters that they would like to  express

are more than welcome to write to the office of the Mufti, or

to express them through letters and use the MUIS website.  So

there  are  many opportunities which are open to  the  Muslim

community  who may want to express some of their  views,  and

this  is something which we welcome.  In fact, MUIS,  on  its

own  part, has set out to meet the various stakeholders, both

within   the  Muslim  and  the  non-Muslim  communities,   to

understand  further  some of their concerns,  and  these  are

inputs  which will be fed back to the Fatwa Committee as  and

when  an  issue  which is important to the  Muslim  community

needs  to be deliberated.  I would like to assure the  Member

that  the Fatwa Committee will not turn away any feedback  or

any information that may be useful for their deliberations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of religious teachers, we know that

many  Muslims  receive teaching and guidance  from  religious

teachers.   MUIS  ensures that religious  teachers  are  well

qualified  and  able  to guide Muslims appropriately  in  the

context   of  multi-racial  Singapore.   MUIS,  for  example,

conducts  training  and  orientation programmes  to  mosques,

imams  or  religious leaders on the positive roles that  they

can  play in guiding the Muslim community towards growth  and

development.   For  example, the "Nadwah,  Imam  and  Khatib"

(NIK)   programme  is  a  platform  for  imams   to   discuss

contemporary  issues  and their implications  to  the  Muslim

community.   So there is a process of engaging  between  MUIS

and  the  various religious leaders within the  community  to

ensure  that  they receive timely information and  understand

some of the important concerns at the national level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Mohamad Maliki has raised the issue of

registering  religious teachers.  MUIS maintains  a  list  of

qualified religious teachers.  The list is being updated  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>



information  will be made available on the  MUIS  website  in

July this year.  This will enable the public to make informed

decisions when engaging religious teachers.  For parents  who

are  keen  to  engage  private religious teachers  for  their

children,  my advice, Sir, is to engage teachers who  are  on

the  MUIS  list.   MUIS ensures that all our  mosques  engage

qualified  religious teachers on its list.  Other  providers,

such  as  Malay/Muslim  organisations and  private  education

centres,  also  provide religious classes to  complement  the

efforts  of  the  mosques.  MUIS will look into  the  private

service  providers  market to ensure that the  standards  are

also maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS' public education effort this year will

promote  greater understanding about Islam among non-Muslims,

as  well  as  educating Muslims of the need for  balance  and

moderation  in practising their religious beliefs  in  multi-religious  Singapore.  MUIS and the mosques are  engaging  in

goodwill  visits,  talks,  joint activities  with  grassroots

organisations,  and organisations such as NTUC,  schools  and

Chinese clan associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, together with the partners, MUIS will continue to

undertake its full slate of religious development and  social

programmes.  I would like to assure Mr Zainul Abidin  Rasheed

that  there is no cause for concern that good programmes will

be  curtailed  for lack of resources.  Funding for  the  MUIS

administration has increased steadily from 1998 to 2001.   In

2002, because of the preceding year, where there was negative

growth, the funding will be slightly adjusted downwards.  But

I do not think there is cause for concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the grant to cover MUIS administration,

the  Government has also, since 1999, provided MUIS  with  an

annual matching grant of up to $1.3 million for programmes to

strengthen  Malay-Muslim families.  MUIS  has  also  seen  an

increase in zakat collections from $6 million in 1995 to  $14

million  in  2001, due to greater awareness among Muslims  of

their religious obligations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for full-time education conducted by madrasahs, I

would  like  to  assure  both Mdm Halimah,  who  raised  this

question  earlier, and Dr Maliki, that MUIS and the madrasahs

are working closely on preparations for compulsory education.

They  are  working  hard to ensure that  the  first  madrasah

cohort to sit the PSLE in 2008 are adequately prepared and to

reach  the benchmark of 175 at the PSLE level.  The  madrasah

curriculum  is  being  reviewed to improve  the  teaching  of

Islamic   subjects  as  well  as  the  teaching  of  English,

Mathematics, Science and the mother tongue.  Curriculum  time

for  English,  Mathematics  and  Science  subjects  will   be

increased   without  diluting  the  teaching   of   religious

subjects.   The  madrasahs  have also  hired  more  qualified

English, Mathematics and Science teachers, and provided their

teachers  with  training  to  improve  their  skills.    MUIS

provides financial assistance through the Madrasah Fund.  The

madrasahs  can  then  use these funds to  top  the  teachers'

salaries or go for teachers' training.  MUIS coordinates with

MOE to ensure that the children who are unable to get a place

in  the madrasahs when CE takes place, can still register for

the  national  schools.  MUIS and the madrasahs are  actively

looking  at  programmes to enable their students to  interact

with  students  of  other races and appreciate  the  national

perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on some specific suggestions by Mr Zainul Abidin

about  how  we  should  continually engage  new  scholars  or

scholars  from  different parts of  the  world  in  order  to

develop  a  greater  understanding of  how  Islam  should  be

contextualised in the context of a multi-racial Singapore,  I

would  like to assure the Member that we are constantly doing

that.   There  may not be a formal programme, but  there  are

efforts to reach out to various scholars who are out there in

the Muslim world who have a better understanding of how Islam

should  develop in a multi-racial setting.  Last  year,  MUIS

led  a  delegation to the US to meet some of the scholars  in

America  as  there is some similarity between the context  of

the  Muslim  minority  there  and  the  Muslim  minority   in

Singapore.  I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>



assure the Member that we will constantly be on the look-out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, at the same time, I believe that the Member will

agree with me that we should be finding ways to develop  some

indigenous capability within Singapore - scholars of our  own

who  are able to guide the Muslim community in a context that

is ever-changing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also suggested some very good ideas about

attachment  programmes for our uztaz.  I would certainly  ask

MUIS  to study that.  Personally, I think such exposure  will

help   them   in   terms  of  understanding  how   Islam   is

contextualised in those areas which are similar to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also asked what steps can Muslims take if

they  detect  that there are teachers who are teaching  Islam

not  in  the  correct manner.  I would urge  any  Muslims  in

Singapore,  if  they  come across such incidents,  the  first

thing  they should do is to refer to the office of the  Mufti

or  the  MUIS  website  and  we  will  follow  up  with  some

investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Mosque Building Fund, Mr Maidin

has raised some very interesting suggestions.  First, let  me

give  an  update  on the mosque building programme  before  I

answer  specifically  some  of the  questions  raised  by  Mr

Maidin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nineteen mosques have been built under the Mosque

Building  Fund  programme  since its  launch  in  1975.   The

building  programme  for  mosques is  dovetailed  with  HDB's

building   programme.   Two  mosques  are   currently   under

construction  - in Bukit Panjang and Sembawang  respectively.

Construction of a mosque in Bishan is expected  to  start  in

2003.   I  am also pleased to announce that a mosque will  be

built in Sengkang new town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time to come, with the need for new mosques having

been  largely met through the mosque building programme, MUIS

will  focus  more  on working with mosques to  upgrade  their

facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mosque Building Fund is currently required to fund

the building of new mosques.  The current collection is about

$3.5 million per year.  But the cost of a new mosque is about

$10  million  and, therefore, it takes about three  years  of

collection  to  build  a new mosque.  Mr Maidin's  suggestion

that  the Mosque Building Fund be used for mosque maintenance

and upgrading work can be considered when the mosque building

programme  is  completed, which it must one day.   The  older

mosques  can  be  considered for upgrading first.   MUIS  can

study  this and work with the mosques on the phasing  of  the

upgrading programmes for the various mosques.  MUIS will also

look  into Mr Maidin's suggestion for mosque surpluses to  be

used to help fund building and upgrading of mosques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of the role of MUIS with madrasah, a

point raised by Dr Maliki, I would like to assure him that we

are in constant contact with madrasah operators in Singapore.

There  is  a  committee that is looking into  the  curriculum

development  of  the  madrasah and, through  this  curriculum

development,  we hope to address the concerns  raised  by  Mr

Maidin that, in the teaching of Islam, we have to ensure that

the  teachings are contextualised to the context in which our

students  will  grow up as Singaporeans.  The development  of

the  curriculum will take that line.  We have commissioned  a

consultant to look into this.  It will take a number of years

to  roll  out but I am sure, with time, we will  be  able  to

develop  a  curriculum which is suited  to  our  needs  as  a

minority here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the issue raised by Mr Maidin on

VWOs.   Mr  Maidin  has  expressed  concern  about  Voluntary

Welfare  Organisations (VWOs) having to  spend  time  raising

funds.   I  agree  with  him that this is  a  valid  concern,

especially  for  smaller VWOs.  That is why  we  set  up  the

Community Chest.  It is there, set up to relieve VWOs of fund-raising  and to allow them to focus on the running  of  their

services.   VWOs  that  are  running  programmes  which   are

relevant  to  the  community can apply for funding  from  the

Community Chest.  However, there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>



VWOs  which choose to raise funds on their own.  I  encourage

them to partner one another and to share their resources.  To

minimise  the  fund-raising burden and avoid  donor  fatigue,

VWOs  should  set  reasonable fund-raising targets  based  on

their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Government support to VWOs, I have earlier

highlighted a $7 million increase in annual recurrent funding

to  VWOs and, of course, the setting up of the VWO Capability

Development  Fund  of  $30  million  over  five  years.   The

Government  has  also introduced double  tax  deductions  for

approved  donations.  So, I would like to assure  the  Member

that  my  Ministry places the highest importance on  ensuring

that  our services are able to cater to Singaporeans who need

them regardless of language, race or religion.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, our social service agencies are

resourceful  and  able  to  cater to  clients  with  specific

language  requirements.  I cited the example earlier  of  the

Marine  Parade  FSC where well over 30% of  the  clients  are

Malays and Malay-speaking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instances where the agency staff are not able to

speak  the client's language, the agency taps on the  network

of  volunteers or partners, such as self-help groups, to help

in  the  translation and working with the clients.  The  VWOs

also send their staff for training which help them understand

the specific needs of the different communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above these social services that cater to all

races,  we  recognise  that  there  are  specific  needs   of

different  ethnic communities that require special attention.

Hence,  Government matching grants are given to the self-help

groups  to  look into programmes to help under-achievers  and

other  niche  areas.   However, as  the  Prime  Minister  had

indicated  recently,  self-help groups should  not  duplicate

services   provided  by  other  organisations,  but   instead

collaborate with or tap on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>



services  of other providers. The partnership approach  would

prevent  us  from  swinging  unwittingly  to  an  undesirable

scenario,  where more and more social services and programmes

are organised along ethnic lines.  At the end of the day, our

approach  is for the social service agencies to work together

with  partners who can provide the expertise.  I am heartened

by the experience of the various FSCs that I have visited and

they  are able to be resourceful and reach out to either  the

CDCs  or  the  self-help groups to try and meet some  of  the

demands which are unique to the different communities here in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the questions. I will now

ask my MOS, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to reply to Mr Low.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked

about the programme evaluation system applied to the VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme evaluation system is like management by

objective  as  in  staff evaluation.  In the  case  of  staff

evaluation,  the boss and the subordinate sit down  together,

agree  on  certain performance indicators, and then based  on

these  performance  indicators, the  staff's  performance  is

evaluated.   With this, there is a good understanding  as  to

what is supposed to be achieved, to what extent all these are

being achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme evaluation system is the same thing. The

NCSS works together with the voluntary organisation concerned

and  they  agree  on  a  certain set of programme  evaluation

criteria. At the end of a certain number of months, or at the

end  of  each  year,  they will sit down  and  evaluate.  The

programme evaluation system is not directly linked to funding

in  the sense that it will not be as obvious as saying  that,

"Look, you only achieve 75% of your indicators and therefore,

I  only  give you 75% of the funding".  It is not like  that.

Performance   indicators  provide  a   common   currency   to

facilitate  communication between the NCSS  as  well  as  the

voluntary organisation being evaluated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know of any programme that was dropped because

of   the  programme  evaluation  system  as  yet.   Programme

evaluation  is  still  very  new.   I  can  understand   some

voluntary  organisations  may  initially  feel  uncomfortable

about  the  programme evaluation system, just  like  me  when

management  by objective was first introduced  in  the  civil

service.   I  was  a civil servant then.  I  also  felt  very

uncomfortable.  But as the years go by, I find  that  I  have

better  communication with my boss on what I am  supposed  to

do.  At  the  end of it, I feel better; he feels  better  and

misunderstanding  is  minimised.  I  am  confident  programme

evaluation will likewise be well accepted.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> May I seek a clarification

from  the  Minister?   In  his  reply  about  a  register  of

religious  teachers, I just wonder whether registration  also

involves  accreditation.  In other words, I wish to know  how

do  we ensure that we have a means of checking that they  are

actually qualified to teach and can teach the right  kind  of

materials in Islam.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I do not have the

details  of  how  the system works.  But I would  assure  the

Member  that  if  we  have  a list  of  registered  qualified

teachers,  there  must be a system for us to ascertain  their

qualification.  If need be, I will find the details and  pass

it  to  the Member. I would like to assure the House that  at

the  end  of  the day, we want to maintain the  standards  to

ensure  that  people  using that  list  will  feel  safe  and

satisfied that their children will not be misled through  the

teaching of religion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to seek a

clarification  from  the MOS.  He said  that  the  evaluation

programme  system  is  not linked  to  the  funding.   But  I

understand that the funding method to VWOs has been  changed,

from  one which is from organisation to programme.  So  there

is  no link even with the evaluation system.  Then how do you

decide which programme to fund or not to fund?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> What I am saying is that the objective

of the evaluation is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>



meant to decide, say, given this project which we are willing

to  fund, how do we measure its achievement at the end of the

year.   In fact, I would say it is very good for the VWOs  to

have  a list of performance indicators when it comes to fund-raising.    If  increasingly,  we  look  to  corporates   for

sponsorship, the corporates would want to know that when they

donate  a  certain amount of money, what would their donation

add  to the achievement of the voluntary organisation.  Also,

what  are  the indicators that we can give them so that  they

can  satisfy their shareholders that by donating that  amount

of  money, they have got all those social services delivered.

And  have  the  performance indicators actually provided  the

voluntary  organisations with a good currency to  communicate

with  the potential donors, to win over their confidence and,

therefore, win over their funding.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the People's Association was

formed  in  1960  under the Prime Minister's  Office.   Since

then,  it  has been placed under various Ministries and  then

back to the Prime Minister's Office between 1980-1984.  Since

1985,  the Association has been placed under the Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports. As provided under  the  PA

Act, the Prime Minister is traditionally the Chairman of  the

organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the PA's Chairman is indeed the Prime

Minister  and  the Deputy Chairman is the Minister  for  Home

Affairs.  At present, PA's Chief Executive Director  is  also

the  Prime  Minister's Press Secretary.   With  due  respect,

could the Minister for Community Development and Sports  tell

us  how much responsibility and jurisdiction does he or  MCDS

have over PA policies and the administration?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may find it difficult to imagine the Minister for

Community  Development and Sports directing  and  determining

policies of an organisation headed by the Prime Minister  and

administered by his Press Secretary.  Would the Minister  not

agree   that   the  People's  Association   would   be   more

appropriately placed under the Prime Minister's Office rather

than MCDS?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I would like to touch on

the question of digital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>



divide  which is highlighted under PA.  I notice that PA  has

been  alloted  a  budget to tackle this  problem  on  digital

divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to become a truly e-inclusive society, it

is imperative that people who at present cannot use IT tools,

such  as  Internets effectively, need to be  facilitated  and

encouraged  to adopt IT. For this to happen, focus  needs  to

shift  from just providing easy and cheap access to  Internet

to  promoting relevant IT competencies and effective  use  of

ICT  among  these  digital have-nots,  eg,  senior  citizens,

disabled folks and people in the low-income group.  These are

people quite close to the ground where PA has direct access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, relevant content and information knowledge need to

be made available, and these skills will make our people more

employable  and  encourage  an independent  way  of  life  or

lifestyle.   To  bridge the digital divide in Singapore,  the

following initiatives could go a long way:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Specific needs and problems of the digital have-nots in using ICT should be researched. Here, agencies like

IDA can help PA in playing a key role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Customise IT training tailored to the specific

needs of these digital have-nots need to be made available at

very  low  cost.  Here, GROs and CDCs and organisations  like

the  People Developer can take the lead.  A focused  campaign

by  PA on sensitising ICT player and how they can bridge  the

digital divide needs to be launched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Web contents should also be made disabled and

elderly-friendly.  Here, SPRING can help PA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in today's knowledge-driven economy milieu,

such  steps  will  yield significant  digital  dividends.   A

digital-lead   empowered  e-inclusive  society   will   enjoy

escalated  value  creation in the economy by  increasing  the

productivity of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>



human  capital.   This  ensures a  better  quality  of  life,

something close to PA's heart.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

the  People's Association is a statutory board, a public body

funded by the people through the State.  As Mr Charles  Chong

has  said,  it  has been passed between the Prime  Minister's

Office  to the MCDS and now back and forth.  Officially,  its

objective  is to promote racial harmony, social cohesion  and

community  bonding through its many CCs, CCCs and  RCs.   The

People's  Association  is a public  body  and  it  should  be

politically neutral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, ever since its establishment in the mid-60s, the PA

has  played  a  very  important role in  rallying  grassroots

support  for  the  PAP.  This is not  right,  Sir.   Can  the

Minister clarify if this is not an abuse of State funds?   If

the real objective of PA is to serve the people, then why did

the  PAP  Government deny legally elected  MPs  from  serving

their  wards  by appointing PAP candidates who  lost  in  the

elections as grassroots advisors?  It is so strange that  all

the grassroots advisors are all Members of Parliament, except

in Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies.  Can the Minister

justify  why  the PA is not appointing Mr Chiam,  Member  for

Potong  Pasir and Mr Low, Member for Hougang, as the official

grassroots  advisor respectively?  Can the  Minister  explain

why  he  allowed the PA to appoint the losers in the  general

election as grassroots advisors instead?

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the CDCs have been doing a

tremendous job in very many diverse activities and programmes

since their formation in 1997.  With all CDCs now having full-time  Mayors, these organisations are well-placed to do  even

more for the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than five years since their inception, it may

be  timely to do an evaluation on the progress that has  been

made by CDCs so far.  The Prime Minister, in his National Day

Rally  speech  on  17th August 1996 said  that  CDCs  are  to

rekindle the old community spirit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>



mutual  help  where the more able and successful should  help

the  less able and less well-off as they used to do and  were

respected for doing.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community, especially those who receive help would

naturally respect the successful who have looked after  them,

instead of resenting their success.  Now more than five years

later,  on 5th January 2002, the Prime Minister, in a  speech

at  the Mayor's swearing-in ceremony, reiterated the message.

He  said the CDCs should not be mistaken as welfare agencies.

Elaborating,  the Prime Minister said that in order  to  bond

the   community,  CDCs  would  have  to  mobilise  the   more

successful  Singaporeans to look after  those  stuck  at  the

lower  rungs of the ladder.  Could the Minister tell  us  how

successful  have  CDCs  been getting more  able  Singaporeans

involved  in  helping the less able?  Have we  been  able  to

establish appropriate performance indicators for our CDCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget for CDCs has also been increased from

$19  million in 1997 to $153 million in 2001, and  will  rise

further  as they take on more programmes, like looking  after

the  elderly  and setting up branch offices.  With  more  and

more  public funds being allocated to CDCs, would it  not  be

timely  then for CDCs to be regulated by its own  Act  rather

than remain under the umbrella of the PA Act?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each CDC should also be required to furnish an annual

report  of their income, expenditure, and their achievements,

similar to that currently being done by the Town Councils.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I declare my interest as

Mayor of North East CDC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Radio 93.8 started a series of programmes where

they interviewed Mayors and staff of the CDCs, to explain and

to  talk  about the CDCs.  To my surprise, most of those  who

were  interviewed by Radio 93.8 claimed that  they  were  not

aware  of what CDC was all about, and that they did not  even

know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>



who  their Mayors were, despite the fact that we have carried

out  quite a number of activities.  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon said

on  the programme that South West CDC had 500 activities, and

I  am sure a lot other CDCs have equally impressive number of

programmes to talk about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the PA and the Minister-in-charge would

explain  the  thinking  behind the CDC.   I  know  the  Prime

Minister  himself  has been a champion of CDC  and  has  made

quite  a number of speeches explaining CDC's role.  But,  CDC

is  an evolving entity.  In fact, a number of the Mayors were

doing  part-time  before, and only  last  term  we  have  MPs

serving  as  full-time  Mayors.   So  in  the  nature  of  it

evolving,  from  a  role  which I think  the  Prime  Minister

explained  as  "to  play  a bonding role  to  provide  social

cohesion",  it has over the last six months spent  a  lot  of

time  and  energy on "jobs, jobs, jobs".  So I think  in  the

light of this evolving profile and nature of CDC, I hope  the

PA  and  the Minister-in-charge will explain the profile  and

the thinking behind the role of CDC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, Mr Charles Chong asked why PA

should not be under the Prime Minister's Office, and he  also

mentioned that there were instances in the past when  the  PA

was  under  other Ministries.  In fact, this was  so.   Since

1960  till  1979, the People's Association was put under  the

charge of four different Ministries - from Ministry of Labour

to  Ministry of Social Affairs, to Ministry of Culture,  then

Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Interior and  Defence

and  back  to  Ministry  of Culture.  It  depended  on  which

Minister  the  Prime Minister appointed as  Deputy  Chairman.

That  is  why  in 1995, in order to avoid this  switching  of

Ministries,  PA  was  put under the Prime Minister's  Office.

But,  then  when  the  role of the then  Ministry  of  Social

Affairs  was  reviewed, and Ministry of Community Development

(MCD)  was  formed,  the decision was that  PA  actually  had

synergy with the roles of the new MCD because MCD and PA were

both promoting social cohesion, racial harmony, communication

between  the Government and the community.  Hence PA was  put

under the new MCD.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one way of looking at Mr Charles Chong's question is

it  really  does  not  matter.  Through all  these  years  of

moving,  the  People's Association continues to perform.   It

continues  to  come out with new programmes, it continues  to

move  ahead,  it  continues to serve the  community.   Today,

under  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development  and  Sports

(MCDS),  PA and MCDS continue to benefit from their  synergy.

I feel MCDS is a good place to place PA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked how much jurisdiction the

Minister had over People's Association.  PA has actually been

quite autonomous in their work, as long as they stick to  the

charge  given  to  them by the PA Act.   This  fact  is  more

important  than how much jurisdiction the Minister  has  over

the   People's   Association.   The  People's   Association's

Chairman  remains the Prime Minister.  He usually appoints  a

Minister  to  be the Deputy Chairman, and at this  particular

point  of time, my Minister and I are on the PA Board.   But,

based  on history, even if we are not on the Board,  PA  will

continue  to perform what it is supposed to perform.   So  it

actually does not matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the digital divide which Mr Zainul Abidin

asked, I would say that that particular budget item under the

People's  Association  is  to  highlight  PA's  role  in  the

National  IT  Literacy  Programme.  I think  the  House  will

probably  know  that  the Ministry of Manpower  and  Infocomm

Development  Authority  of  Singapore  (IDA)  introduced  the

National  IT  Literacy  Programme.   The  objective  of   the

programme  is  to train 350,000 Singaporeans in computer  and

Internet basics, by April 2004.  The People's Association has

been  given the role of training 90,000 people, out of  these

350,000.   So,  we  have been conducting IT courses  in  four

official  languages,  targeting senior citizens,  homemakers,

grassroots  leaders, those who have not been  trained  in  IT

before.   We  have about 20,000 residents who have  undergone

training  at about 40 community centres as well as  community

clubs.  We jointly organise these training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>



courses with commercial training agencies, as well as various

IT training centres.  In addition, we also have two roving IT

vans to bring IT classrooms to the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On working with IDA and other agencies, I want to assure

Mr  Zainul that we work very closely with IDA and many  other

agencies.  In fact, we also work with voluntary organisations

such  as  Retired  Seniors Volunteer  Programme  (RSVP),  the

mosques, the Singapore Association for the Deaf, as  well  as

the  various  self-help  groups  in  realising  what  we  are

supposed to do in this IT masterplan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked a question on PA that any Opposition

Member  would ask.  He asked probably on behalf of  Mr  Chiam

and  Mr Low, but I think both have asked this question  many,

many  times,  and the answer is still the same.   He  got  it

right.   The  People's Association is a Government  statutory

board.  It is not part of the PAP.  The PAP MPs draw a  very,

very clear line between our PA activities, as well as our PAP

branch  activities.  We do not hold our branch activities  in

the  community centres.  I can assure him of  that.   We  are

very  professional about it.  And since it  is  a  Government

statutory board, members of the public can come and  use  the

facilities  and  take part in the programmes,  regardless  of

political  affiliation.  But, when it comes  to  picking  the

people  in  charge,  the Government, like picking  people  in

charge  of other Government agencies, will have to  look  for

people who have the same vision, share the same objective, in

order  to  do  this  job  of leading the  various  grassroots

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we put the Opposition Members as the Advisors of the

grassroots  organisations, we can be sure that the grassroots

organisations will be politicised.  There will be no  end  of

quarrels between the People's Association, who is supposed to

be  a  Government  body,  and the  ward  which  is  with  the

Opposition.   This will not serve the objective of  achieving

social  cohesion.  We owe it to the residents to ensure  that

politics stays out of our community centres.  That is why PAP

stays out of the community centres and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>



appoint people in charge to make sure that politics stays out

of the community centres and the grassroots organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Sir, I think Mdm Halimah also asked about the

issue of involving Malays, especially younger Malays, in  the

community centre activities.  We have to acknowledge that  we

would like to have more participation by the Malays, as  well

as  Indian Singaporeans, in our community centres.  After all

the objectives of our community centres are to achieve social

cohesion,  racial  harmony, as well as better  communication.

We  admit that we have quite a lot of work to do still.  But,

we  are trying.  We have a few schemes to deliberately try to

encourage more Malay residents to join us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association has adopted a policy to co-locate some of the community centres with voluntary

organisations  some  of  which  are  from  the   Malay/Muslim

community.   This is for greater synergy, and to encourage  a

wider network of Singaporeans to visit the community centres.

For    example,   Telok   Ayer-Hong   Lim   Green   Community

Centre/Pondok Glam - that is one of the co-locations; Kampong

Ubi Community Club/Singapore Diki Barat Federation - that  is

another co-location; Singapore Hadra and Kampong Association,

that  is  also  in  Kampong Ubi; Toa Payoh Central  Community

Building  has got Majlis Pusat, and Pasir Ris East  Community

Building  and  the  Association of Muslim Professionals.   We

hope   that   such  co-locations  will  improve  inter-ethnic

interaction and cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah may also be pleased to note that amongst the

youth  movement, we have what we call Project Prompt.   Under

Project Prompt, if the youth programme can involve more  than

25%  non-Chinese, PA will give them a small additional grant.

So  far,  there  are, I understand, more than 100  programmes

being given such grants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the IRCCs, as my Minister has

explained in much details earlier, we believe that there will

be  even  more opportunities for inter-ethnic interaction  in

our community centres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go over to the Community Development

Councils.  I think both Mr Zainul as well as Mr Charles Chong

asked   about  the  progress  of  the  Community  Development

Councils.   First of all, in the speech given  by  the  Prime

Minister  in 1996, as well as in 2002, that Mr Charles  Chong

quoted,  he  sketched out the long-term vision of Singapore's

community.   There  should be very good social  cohesion,  of

kampong  spirit, of the more successful willing to  help  the

less  successful, and as a result achieve a good  feeling  of

rootedness.   It is a very, very long-term vision,  which  we

will  all  be striving for.  CDCs were only established  five

years  ago in 1997.  So, of course, we still have a long  way

to go.  However, I have to say that the Community Development

Councils  have  made very good progress.  It  is  becoming  a

local  administration which is relevant to the lives  of  the

residents.  Since they were initiated in 1997, the CDCs  have

been  building up their role as mobilisers of public, private

and  community resources, to bring about a more cohesive  and

harmonious society.  They reach out to the more successful to

help   the  less  able,  for  example,  through  their   many

volunteers' programmes as well as joint programmes  with  the

voluntary  organisations.  The CDCs  also  deliver  community

development  programmes, ranging from  arts  appreciation  to

life-long  learning to healthy lifestyle, to  Racial  Harmony

Day, as well as Grandparents Day.  So, they have a very, very

wide  range  of  social programmes as well as social  service

programmes.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs have also tried to achieve a good balance of

grassroots leaders, professionals as well as other talents in

their ranks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, which I believe is a very, very important year

for  the CDCs, the CDCs successfully took on a wide range  of

community  and  public  services from the  Ministries.   This

includes  social assistance and social service  schemes  from

the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS) since

1st April 2001, as well as the Primary Care and Partnership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>



Scheme  (PCPS)  from  the Ministry  of  Health.   If  Members

recall, PCPS is actually a scheme where senior citizens  from

the  lower income group, with a certain card, can go and  see

the  participating GPs who are in private practice,  so  that

they do not have to always go to the polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs, together with grassroots organisations, help

Singaporeans,  who  missed out on the CPF Top-up  Scheme  and

senior  citizens  who did not participate in  the  MediShield

Scheme for the elderly, to sign up for the schemes.  The CDCs

also  work with the CPF Board and the Ministry of Finance  to

administer CPF top-ups as well as the New Singapore Shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that CDCs have benefited from synergy on the

ground,  as  well  as  with the Ministries,  because  of  the

participation of the CDCs.  Because CDCs have been doing very

well,  in  November 2001, we decided that it should aim  even

higher. That is why full-time Mayors were appointed, and  the

CDCs were consolidated from nine to become five, each with  a

population of roughly half a million or so.  We believe  that

this is probably an optimal size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being closer to the people, the CDCs have been able to

offer  a  more  convenient and personalised  service  to  the

residents.  I must say that even for those services that  are

delegated from the Ministries to the CDCs, the CDCs have been

doing  very  well.   The processing time,  for  example,  for

public assistance cases has improved, partly because CDCs are

closer to the ground, so they know the residents better.  And

partly  also because they are closer to the ground, they  are

subject  to more pressure to settle cases early, so the  CDCs

work  harder.   All  these  are  to  the  advantage  of   the

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current economic recession, like what Mr

Zainul  said, the CDCs have been very, very active in helping

the  retrenched  workers,  by augmenting  interim  short-term

financial  help  with  career counselling,  job-matching  and

skills upgrading, retraining opportunities,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>



and so on.  In fact, I would say that all the Mayors come  up

with  excellent  ideas and they are all different.   Maybe  I

will just list a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mayor Othman Haron Eusofe of South East CDC

piloted  a  training and employment programme for child  care

and domestic help to increase the employment opportunities of

its  residents in the informal service sector.  I think  that

is very innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Teo Ho Pin has been actively introducing jobs from

various companies, like Sembawang Shipyard and TIBS,  to  the

residents  of  North West CDC, and, therefore,  bringing  the

employers and the potential employees closer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has launched the South West CDC

community portal and e-job messaging system where job seekers

are  informed through SMS and/or e-mail of their  success  in

job-matching facilitated by the CDC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to just looking for jobs, I think the CDCs

have   also   supported  the  CCCs  in  forming  Inter-racial

Confidence Circles as well as working with other bodies  such

as  schools, companies and voluntary welfare organisations to

form Harmony Circles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Zainul Abidin Rasheed of North East CDC introduced

the  home-stay  programme aimed at promoting  greater  inter-racial  understanding.  And Mayor Othman  initiated  a  South

East  CDC racial harmony youth ambassadors programme.   Mayor

Heng  Chee How - I have not forgotten him - Central Singapore

CDC,  has  harmony circles working with self-help groups  and

other  community  organisations, like  the  Hindu  Endowments

Board  and  Singapore Khalsa Association, to promote  greater

inter-racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the CDCs have done quite a bit. Of course,

some of the residents still say that, "Look, I actually still

do  not  know about the CDC."  And I think Mayor  Zainul  has

expressed  a certain amount of disappointment there.   But  I

would say, keep trying.  After all, we are only five years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>



down  a very, very long journey, and we have already done  so

much.   In  fact,  through the various  programmes,  we  have

already touched the life of many, many Singaporeans.   If  we

can touch the lives of even more Singaporeans, everybody will

recognise  the  CDC.   So,  I  would  say,  do  not  be   too

disappointed.   It is still early days yet.  Looking  at  the

progress  that we have achieved so far, I think we have  done

quite  well.  Give us a little bit more time.  I  think  life

should be kind to the CDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have three

clarifications  for the Minister of State.  What  vision  and

what  objective are the Minister referring to?  Has he  tried

any  of  the Opposition MPs to realise that their vision  and

objective are quite close to the PA?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second clarification. Just because it is an Opposition

MP,  the  grassroots  organisations become  politicised.   It

would  not  be  politicised  when  the  PAP  candidates   are

appointed as grassroots advisers.  Is that the case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification. If the Minister wants politics to

stay out, should not the elected MP stay in as the grassroots

adviser instead?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, that is why the PAP MPs are the

grassroots   advisers,  not  the  head  of   the   grassroots

organisation.  We are only there to advise.   So  he  got  it

right there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The MOS, in his answer, says the

PA's  objective is social and community bonding.  CCCs,  RCs,

the  community centres are non-political.  And he  said,  "We

draw  a very clear line."  I want to know from him how  clear

the line is, and how sure he is about what he says.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I think I have not answered Mr

Steve  Chia's  questions completely.  So I shall  answer  his

questions first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not say that the Opposition Members do not share

the objective of, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>



example,  social cohesion.  I am just saying that  Opposition

MPs,  by  their  nature, would have to  oppose  some  of  the

Government  policies,  and that would include  some  of  PA's

programmes and the methods of implementation, and so on.   In

doing  so,  bearing in mind the kind of passion that  I  hear

when  this subject was discussed in the Committee of  Supply,

we  risk getting the grassroots organisations from opposition

ward  into political conflicts with the People's Association,

rather  than  concentrating on helping the residents  improve

their lot.  That basically is my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the PAP, are very clear about this point.

Therefore,  we draw a clear line.  All Government  programmes

can  be  political to the extent that if we do a good job  in

any  Government  programme,  for example,  in  education,  or

transport,  we will get greater support in the  next  General

Election.   So  if we do a very, very good job  in  achieving

social  cohesion,  racial  harmony,  and  we  achieve  better

support in the next General Election, I would say that  there

is nothing wrong, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State seems to be

confused with social cohesion, community cohesion and support

for  the nation to one that is ensuring bonding with the PAP.

Would he clarify that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Since when did I say "bonding with the

PAP"?   I  said anybody, regardless of political affiliation,

could come and take part in PA's activities because PA  is  a

statutory board and the community centres are public  places.

But  when  it  comes  to  appointing  people  to  lead  these

organisations,  like all Government agencies, all  Government

statutory  boards, Government will be responsible  for  those

appointments,  and  Government has got the responsibility  to

ensure  that the people appointed would have the  ability  to

carry out the task that the agency is supposed to carry out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if I may clarify with the

Minister.   Are  not  elected  MPs  part  of  the  Government

service, as the elected MPs are elected by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>



people? We are here [Interruptions] not as Government, but as

part  of  the body where we actually do this service  to  the

people.  Specifically, the Minister said that Opposition  MPs

are always opposing.  Can the Minister give specific examples

of  what  the  Opposition MPs are opposing for  the  sake  of

opposing?   Is it not the case that the PAP MPs nowadays  are

actually even more opposing than the Opposition MPs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> So you are saying the Opposition MPs

are now irrelevant?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong, could you withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and the

Minister of State for the responses and beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Association recently amended the rules

and regulations of the CCC and CCMC.  Among other things, the

amendment  introduces  a compulsory retirement  age  for  key

grassroots  leaders in the CCC and CCMC.  The key posts  that

are  now  subject  to an age limit of 65  years  include  the

Chairman,  Secretary and the Treasurer.  This rule  does  not

take into consideration the number of years in office or  the

ability  of  potential  office-holders and  indicates  ageism

which  stems from a negative view of ageing and old age.   It

also  fails to realise that there are many people  who  after

retirement from a full and rewarding career, at the age of 62

years  or  older,  now  have more  time  to  be  involved  in

community service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>



armed with a life-time of experience and knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcing a prohibition based solely on the arbitrary

age  of  65  years, in favour of nurturing  new  and  younger

leaders  to  keep  up  with  the  changing  expectations  and

aspirations  of  the  residents  they  serve,  reflects   the

preoccupation  that  we  are still a  youth-oriented  society

when,  in reality, we are among the fastest ageing population

in  the  world.   Although  the new  rules  appear  to  allow

exceptions,  provided specific approval has been obtained  by

the  People's  Association, it does not indicate  under  what

circumstances would approval be granted.  Could the  Minister

indicate  what percentage of grassroots leaders in these  key

positions are aged 65 years and above, and tell us  why  this

rule  is even necessary, when it is well within the authority

of the advisers of the grassroots organisations to appoint or

replace non-performing or unsuitable grassroots leaders?



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, to look at this particular issue,

we  have to see things in context.  We are only talking about

the Chairman, the Secretary and Treasurer of the CCCs and the

CCMCs.   About  17% of the current incumbents  of  these  key

posts  are  above  65 years old.  This policy  of  compulsory

withdrawal was for leadership renewal.  It is not because  of

ageism.   We recognise that there are many grassroots leaders

who  are  still able to contribute, even though they  are  65

years  old.   But the key leadership positions  of  Chairman,

Secretary   and  Treasurer  required  more  attention,   more

commitment of energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassroots leaders have been asking why should we not

have an upper limit on the number of terms that incumbents in

key  leadership  positions should  serve.   In  many  of  the

associations, the Chairman cannot serve more than two  terms,

because  they consider that it is important to have a dynamic

leadership.    PA  had  been  considering  the  matter   very

carefully  for  quite some time before coming  out  with  the

decision  of retirement age at 65 years old for the Chairman,

the Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>



and the Treasurer.  If we do not do that, some of the younger

grassroots  leaders would find that they have no chance,  and

would not want to come forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are Chairmen, Secretaries and

Treasurers who are still very vibrant and still very alert at

65  years.  And there may be certain grassroots organisations

where, if the Chairman steps down right now, there may be  no

one  to  take over.  Under such circumstances, if the advisor

puts  up an appeal, the People's Association will look at  it

and  will  usually agree.  But, of course,  we  will  do  the

necessary  to  remind the advisors that,  "Well,  you  should

consider  succession  after this term."   Even  our  national

leadership talks about succession all the time.  So  why  not

grassroots  organisations?  If there is no succession,  there

is  no new life, and the grassroots organisations will not be

dynamic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when these key grassroots leaders retire, there are

still plenty of opportunities for them.  There are many other

grassroots organisation postings for them, if they still want

to  serve.  And for the deserving ones, they can be appointed

either  as  Patron,  Honorary  Chairman  or  Immediate   Past

Chairman.   All these options are there because the  People's

Association values long serving grassroots leaders.  We  want

to  recognise them, we want them to continue to be associated

with  the grassroots movement, and we want them to come  back

to  attend  our functions with certain official  position  of

importance,  and  they can still give  advice  to  the  newer

grassroots leaders who may have taken over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to summarise by saying again this is

not  ageism.   It  is for leadership renewal  which  is  very

important  for  any organisation.  It will be  good  for  our

grassroots movement and we implement it with flexibility.  If

the  advisors have good reasons to want to have specific  old

grassroots  leader  to  serve one  more  term,  there  is  no

problem.  We will look at it and we will probably agree.  And

also,   very   importantly,  we  make  sure  that   deserving

grassroots leaders retire with dignity as well as with a good

title that they deserve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to seek

clarification  from the Minister of State.  The  Minister  of

State,  on  two  occasions, stated that the 65-year  old  age

limit  is  for leadership renewal.  But is he aware that  the

regulation  prohibits  not only the  re-appointment  but  the

appointment  itself.   This means  that  even  before  he  is

appointed, if he is 65 years old, he cannot be appointed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, as I said, if there are specific

good  grassroots leaders that any of the advisors here  would

want  to  appoint for good reasons, please let me  know.   We

will  look  at it.  We are ultimately pragmatic people.   The

rules  are to serve us.  The rules are here to give  us  good

grassroots movement.  If an advisor can convince us  that  by

appointing an individual as Chairman, it will be good for his

grassroots movement, we will listen to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister of State's response

is  not  satisfactory.  Anyway, I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3). May I remind Members

that  we have less than 10 minutes before "guillotine"  time.

Dr Warren Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IC

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the move by the Finance Minister to

encourage  philanthropy among Singaporeans.  In  the  present

economic  climate, there will be increasing  demands  on  our

VWOs for help.  There will also be increasing competition for

the  charity dollar.  The National Council of Social Service,

through the Community Chest, raises approximately $42 million

a  year to serve 314,000 clients through 130 programmes.   By

contrast,  according  to  its website,  the  National  Kidney

Foundation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>



raises  $59 million a year to provide for the 1,900  patients

dialysing under the NKF programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both are fine organisations doing excellent work, but

Members  may agree with me that it appears that the  ComChest

seems  to  have less presence and less reach in the minds  of

the average Singaporean.  This will have an inevitable effect

on its ability to raise funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to consider helping to level

the  playing field for the Community Chest and its stable  of

funded  agencies by assisting NCSS to revamp  and  strengthen

its  publicity  and  fund  raising capability  to  match  the

juggernaut of the NKF.  This is not to mention the  needs  of

many  other non-funded VWOs, who do not come under  the  NCSS

funding  umbrella but who have to raise their own funds.   At

the  very least, I would like ComChest to be able to  compete

on  an  equal  footing  with the NKF in  persuading  schools,

community  organisations,  Government  agencies  and  private

sector  organisations  that there are many  other  worthwhile

charities  in  Singapore, and that they too  deserve  funding

attention.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, very briefly, I am glad to report

that  the  Chairman of ComChest, Ms Jennie  Chua,  recognises

this  problem.  She told me one of the areas of weakness  was

that  they  did  not  have  sufficient  presence  in  Chinese

community organisations, like the seventh moon groups and  so

on.   The  problem has been identified and she will  come  to

work  with  us to see how to improve the funding of ComChest.

There is always room for improvement when it comes to raising

funds for charity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code ID 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be very brief. I am concerned about the

important  role that systems in the environment  of  juvenile

offenders  play  in their rehabilitation.   There  are  three

questions  I  would like to ask.  One, is  the  role  of  the

family.  The Children and Young Persons Act was amended  last

year to allow the courts to mandate parents to be involved in

the  rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.  I would  like  to

ask the Minister, to-date, what is the extent of the parental

involvement   in   the  rehabilitation  of   these   juvenile

offenders,    especially   in   relation   to    professional

intervention,  rather  than just merely celebrating  Mother's

Day  and  Father's Day together.  Second, is on the  role  of

schools.   Oftentimes,  I  have heard  pleas  by  residential

institutions  that  have  difficulty placing  these  juvenile

offenders  back  to school.  May I know what is  the  current

situation   right   now?   Are  the   children   facing   any

difficulties  getting  back  to  school?   And,   third,   is

community  involvement.   What  is  the  level  of  community

involvement   in  the  rehabilitation  of  these   offenders,

especially   in   relation  to  the  role   that   grassroots

organisations  can  play in helping these juvenile  offenders

rehabilitate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, time is running out. I will give

Dr  Maliki  a more detailed explanation later.  But  I  would

say,  very  briefly,  that it was only  last  year  that  the

Children  and  Young Persons Act was amended to  mandate,  in

certain cases, parents' involvement in the rehabilitation  of

children  and young persons.  So far, 20 parents of  juvenile

offenders  in  the Homes and 50 parents of probationers  have

been  given such orders, and they have done their job.  As  I

said,  this is still early days.  The Act was passed  at  the

end  of  last year and it is hardly six months away.  But  we

have  already  seen very good promises.  Given  a  period  of

time,  few  years  perhaps, we will be able  to  report  good

results.   Involvement of the schools, self-help  groups  and

the  community  is  something  that  MCDS  always  tries   to

facilitate, and we will continue to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly abuse makes up 2.9% of all cases of family

violence.  The problem of elderly abuse has not received  the

attention it deserves.  Elderly abuse is seldom reported, and

this  is even more so in our Asian society where filial piety

and  respect  for  the  elderly  is  traditional  and  highly

regarded.   Sir,  it is to be noted that abused  elderly  are

unlikely  to  report  on  their  own  families  for  fear  of

embarrassment  and fear of losing whatever care  and  support

they  may  have.  The lack of awareness and support  services

here is a contributory factor to this situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey which was conducted from May 1994 to December

1997 on those who were 65 years or older who presented to the

Emergency  Department for non-accidental trauma or complaints

of  other acts of cruelty showed that in 58.8% of cases,  the

assailants  were the daughters-in-law or sons.   The  average

age  of the elderly was 74.6 years old and a majority of them

were ambulatory but had chronic medical illnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection from persons causing hurt, continual

harassment, threat, wrongful confinement is spelt out in Part

VII  of  the Women's Charter (Chapter 353 of the 1997 Revised

Edition).   Under this Chapter, the victim can  apply  for  a

Protection  Order.  Elderly abuse is not a  problem  seen  in

isolation.  It is an integral part of family



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>



violence.  Successful intervention may indirectly help  other

victims caught in the same cycle of violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly abuse can be classified into four types: (1)

infliction  of  pain  and  injury;  (2)  debilitating  mental

anguish;  (3)  unreasonable  confinement;  and  (4),  willful

deprivation  by caretaker of services necessary  to  maintain

mental  and  physical health.  I believe that  abuse  of  the

elderly  will  increase  in  tandem  with  our  fast   ageing

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge MCDS to campaign for better

awareness, targeting especially the relatives and friends  of

the  victims  to let them know that help can  and  should  be

sought for victims.  There is an urgent need also for  us  to

provide better support services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, we agree with everything that Dr

Lily Neo says, except I would like to say the figures show  a

consistent downward trend.  The number of cases reported:  in

1997,  it  was 163; in 2001, it was only 92.  Perhaps  it  is

because  we  have been doing all that Dr Lily  Neo  has  been

telling  us  to  do  and, if we continue to  do  so,  we  are

confident that the figures will continue to decline.

<div align="center"><b>SPORTS DEVELOPMENT IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br>4.54 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the important

recommendations  of the Report of the Committee  on  Sporting

Singapore  (CoSS) was that we should aim for high-performance

sporting  achievements.  The successful pursuit of excellence

in   sports   manifested   by  victories   in   international

competitions   enhances   our   national   pride   and    our

international standing.  This represented a marked shift from

just providing for sports for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, success in sports has that magic effect of

strengthening community bonds.  I remember in the  1970s  and

1980s,  when  we  played in the Malaysia Cup,  regardless  of

race,   language   or  religion,  everyone   cheered   as   a

Singaporean.   Chinese, Malays and Indians  sat  and  cheered

together, rain or shine, each time the national team  played.

And I remember well the Kallang Roar, which was heard loudest

way  up  in Shah Alam, when we last won the Cup in 1994.   We

did not need any Inter-Racial Confidence Circle then to bring

us  together.  I remember that when someone shouted  "referee

kayu"  or "kelong", all of us knew what it meant and  we  all

shouted  in  unison.  Such was the nationalistic fervour  and

the  powerful  bind  that pulled us together  every  time  we

tasted success and glory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given its support to the

recommendations of the Committee, 40 in all, with a  generous

grant  of $500 million under the Athletes Career and Training

(ACT)  scheme, which will go some way in helping  to  make  a

quantum leap in sports development.  The CoSS' target  is  to

make Singapore one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia  by

the  year 2010.  The question I wish to pose now is:  can  we

get  there?   Can  we produce champions who  can  become  our

sports  heroes and icons, people who can instill  a  national

pride in us and enhance our international prestige?  In other

words, can we win?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our recent record of achievements has not been

encouraging.  Our best



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>



performance in the Southeast Asian Games was way back in 1983

when  we  won  50  gold medals when the Games  were  held  in

Singapore, finishing fourth out of nine countries,  and  even

edging  out Malaysia.  In the last SEA Games, we won only  22

gold  medals, finishing sixth out of 10 countries, ahead only

of  lightweights  like  Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia  and  Brunei.

Compare  this  with  Malaysia's 111  golds,  Thailand's  103,

Indonesia's  72, Vietnam's 33 and the Philippines'  30.   And

that is only the Southeast Asian Games.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take football as another example. In 1998, Singapore

was  ranked  94th in the world and 12th in Asia.   Today,  we

have  slipped to 115th in the world and 22nd in  Asia.   Goal

2010,  getting into the finals of the World Cup, is, at best,

a dream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not had much to boast of lately. In the 1950s,

we  had household names like Wong Peng Soon in badminton.  In

1960, Tan Howe Liang became our only Olympic hero when he won

a  silver  medal for weightlifting.  Over the years,  we  had

other  notables like Junie Sng, Ang Peng Siong  and  Joscelin

Yeo.   We  were not exactly deprived, but sports heroes  have

been few and far in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oft-heard excuse for not producing champions is that

we  are a small nation and, as our population is small, we do

not  have  the large base from which to tap sporting  talent.

This  cannot  be  further  from the  truth.   India,  with  a

population  of one billion people, is not exactly  known  for

sporting  achievements,  except  maybe  for  cricket.    And,

indeed,  Ireland, a country with a population  comparable  to

that  of Singapore, can produce a team for this year's  World

Cup.  So, too, Denmark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we produce champions? I do not want to repeat

what  is stated in the Report of the CoSS, but I wish to make

a  few  points.   First of all, we need to develop  a  sports

culture  in Singapore.  This is a point which was highlighted

in the report.  It seems to be the starting point.  Australia

is  a  sports power because, amongst many other factors,  its

people are just crazy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>



about  sports.   We,  therefore, need to raise  the  people's

interest  and awareness in sports.  In turn, sports  needs  a

high  profile in the country.  We need participants,  but  we

also  need spectators who talk sports, watch sports and cheer

for sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to identify talent early. Tiger Woods

became  the  champion he is today because he started  hitting

around  with  a golf club at the age of three.  South  Korean

woman golfer, Park Se Ri, also started playing the game  when

she  was  at a tender age, at around five or six.  I  am  not

suggesting that we start arming our little toddlers with golf

clubs  or  badminton  rackets, but  an  early  identification

programme  of  sporting talent, beginning  with  our  primary

schools, can be a starting point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can import foreign talent as a short cut. People

like Jing Jun Hong and Li Jia Wei and, now new citizens, like

Li  Li  and Jiang Yan Mei, have done a lot for us.  And  they

serve  as good role models for others.  But they cannot evoke

the same kind of passion as home-grown talents like Wong Peng

Soon,  Tan  Howe Liang or Ang Peng Siong.  We need  to  start

them young, real young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard that some schools have even dropped

games  like  soccer and hockey from their CCA.   Even  Siglap

Secondary  School,  I read recently, is a  school  known  for

producing  top  athletes in the past, most  noticeably,  Chee

Swee Lee who won our last athletic gold in the Asian Games in

Tehran  in  1974.  The school had decided to drop its  annual

sports  day, citing practical constraints for this  decision.

This  school, which was once a track and field power base  in

the  1960s  and 1970s, will now no longer be able to  produce

national champions.  Contrast this with what is happening  in

Malaysia. There, the Ministry of Education has embarked on  a

programme  to  produce world-class sports  stars  by  getting

primary  school  students to be active  in  sports.   It  has

realised  that  at the secondary level, it  is  too  late  to

develop  true sports potential.  It has to start  in  primary

school  to ensure that a continuous stream of talent  can  be

produced and nurtured.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>



The  overall aim, in its own words, is for the country to  be

able to produce its own David Beckham and Tiger Woods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know we have a sports talent identification

programme,  but  we must ensure that talent is  spotted  very

early  and  not  too late.  The establishment of  the  sports

school  in  2004 to provide for students with the ability  to

pursue  excellence  in sports and academic  studies  is  very

encouraging.   It  will be headed by a person  who  is  well-regarded.   But I heard from the grape vine that one  of  the

first  things  this gentleman will be doing when  the  school

opens  is  to  retire,  as by then,  he  would  have  reached

retirement age.  I am a bit worried about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this early identification of talent must be a

competitive  spirit.   Sports is all about  competition.   It

means  not  being afraid to beat the other guy  in  order  to

excel and win.  It is heartening for me to read that the  old

boys of Raffles Institution are not happy that they have lost

the  school's rugby championship title to ACS for many years.

They  have gotten together to raise $1 million to help  their

Alma  Mater  regain the title.  This is the kind of  fighting

spirit I like to see, people rallying behind to support their

favourite team, and the team fighting all the way to win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was a student, my school, Anglo-Chinese School and a few others like RI and Chinese High,

were always fighting it out annually to be the top school  in

athletics.   ACS  was,  of  course, the  undisputed  swimming

champion  for many years. Dr Tan Cheng Bock told me  recently

that  ACS always beat RI in swimming was because the  RI  had

swimmers  like Mr Goh Chok Tong!  Sir, I would  like  to  add

that  the reason ACS was strong in swimming was because  they

had  swimmers  like  Mr  Chiam See Tong.   Luckily,  this  is

probably the only thing that Mr Chiam can ever beat  the  PAP

in.   But  such was the spirit of competition in those  days,

both with competitors and the spectators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get to the top, we need money, which is what this

speech  is all about.  The Government has been very  generous

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>



its $500 million grant, but it might not be enough to produce

sports  stars.   As we have heard earlier from the  Minister,

the  $500  million  is  spread  over  three  things:   sports

excellence, sports for all and sports industry.   So,  sports

excellence is not going to be getting very much.   Even  some

of the National Sports Associations have told me that they do

not  feel the effects of the $500 million trickling  down  to

them.   The  operating expenditure of the Sports Council  has

also  been  reduced:  $45 million in 2001, $39  million  this

year.   Even this year's reduction represents a re-allocation

of funds to the sports and youth programme under CoSS.  It is

still transferring from one pocket to another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in another perspective for Members. David

Beckham, we all know who he is. He is paid $1 million a month

and  there  are  22  others like him in the  team.  They  are

probably  paid less, but they are just one such team  out  of

many  other teams in the football league in England. The  ACT

grant  can help push towards sports excellence.  But I  think

we  need  more to make a quantum leap and sustain it  over  a

long  period.  It takes more than five years if  we  want  to

have  a  constant stream of stars.  The report of CoSS states

that  it takes 8-12 years to have an athlete of international

standard.  Sports excellence must therefore be assured  of  a

constant stream of funds.  But where do we get the money?   I

hope  the  Minister  for Finance does  not  see  this  as  an

opportunity to further increase GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a suggestion, ie, it is time for us

to  revisit  Singapore Pools.  Singapore  Pools,  if  Members

recall, was formed in 1968 to legalise forms of gambling.  It

ran the first Toto and later on, the Singapore Big Sweep,  4D

and  now sports betting.  It was clearly stated then that its

net  proceeds  would go towards the building of  the  Kallang

Sports Complex, which would include the National Stadium  and

other sports facilities.  If we further recall, the Big Sweep

tickets even carried a picture of the National Stadium for  a

long  time.  To cut a long story short, we built our National

Stadium  with funds from Singapore Pools by early  1973.   In

1980, Singapore Pools was no longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>



a  company  owned by the Ministry of Finance.   It  became  a

subsidiary of Temasek Holdings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pools' earnings are huge. Last year, it made $114

million  before  tax. Singapore Pools is one  of  the  finest

corporate  citizens  in Singapore.  It  gives  generously  to

sports,  charities,  the  arts, even  funding  the  Esplanade

Theatres on the Bay.  I applaud its generous contributions to

many worthy causes.  I know that Singapore Pools has provided

the large part of the $500 million ACT grant.  But like many,

I believe that Pools can do more.  Perhaps it is time now for

the  Government to reconsider Pools' original  mission  of  a

direct link between its earnings and the promotion of sports,

if  we  are to find the large funds to help us achieve sports

excellence.  With its large earning capacity, Singapore Pools

can  be  the long-term provider of large funds to  sports  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, Sir, to do this, if we want more money from

Pools,   I   am   sure  Singapore  Pools   will   want   more

accountability.  As a benefactor, it would want to  know  how

well  the  money is spent and what results are  produced.  We

need to have a kind of accountability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we need to build sports heroes.

There was a time when the name of Fandi Ahmad was on the lips

of  everyone  in Singapore, young and old. Everyone  probably

knew  him better than they knew who their MP was.  I  am  not

particularly  worried about this. Fandi was not  world-class,

but  he  was our best of that time.  He was a rallying  point

for  the  people, an icon and a role model.  I hope that  one

day  we  will be able to produce another Fandi who can  evoke

the  same passion and nationalistic pride in us, but one with

the class of Beckham or Ronaldo.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  thank Mr Tan Soo Khoon for his kind words regarding

sports  development in Singapore.  Personally, I do not  have

anything  to  disagree with him on the  points  that  he  has

raised.  With regard to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



how  Pools should change, I suppose that is a matter that  is

best  left  to the Ministry of Finance and Temasek  Holdings,

and  not for the Ministry of Community Development and Sports

to decide.  Let me clarify two things first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, he mentioned twice that the $500 million

is  for  the ACT scheme.  The $500 million is the budget  for

the  Committee of Sporting Singapore (CoSS).  ACT is just one

part  of  the  programme under CoSS.  Secondly, he  mentioned

that  the principal of the Singapore Sports School,  Mr  Moo,

will be retiring soon. From what I have been told, he is less

than  55  years of age.  So he is definitely not retiring  as

yet.  That  is  why  we recruited him for the  sports  school

because  we  know  that he will be able to  lead  the  school

towards what we want to achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly do not disagree with everything that Mr

Tan  has mentioned -  we need to build sports heroes, we need

to spend a bit more. The $500 million that has been allocated

by  the  Government and Singapore Pools is  actually  towards

that  end.   The  three  pillars that I mentioned  earlier  - sports  excellence, sports for all, sports  industry  -  will

ultimately build towards the kind of excellence that we want.

I think we have to take the approach of building up the base,

as  he  has  rightly mentioned, and that we need to  build  a

sports   culture.  We  are  trying  to  increase  the  sports

participation rate towards 50% by 2005.  We will try as  much

as  possible to encourage as many people as possible to  take

up  sports.  We certainly do not disagree with Mr Tan's point

about  getting the schools involved.  I am not quite familiar

with  some  of  the schools' programmes, but I do  know,  for

example, schools, like Saint Andrew's Junior School,  have  a

very  intense programme in rugby where some of the  kids  who

graduate,  can  go on to Saint Andrew's Secondary  School  so

that they can continue with their passion in rugby.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports School will therefore feed off some

of  the  primary schools which are involved in  some  of  the

sports programmes that they have undertaken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>



We  hope  to  be  able to attract swimmers  from  the  feeder

schools that have gone to ACS.  They might consider going  to

the  sports  school where intense training will be undertaken

for  their passion for swimming and for other sports that  we

have  identified  as  important  in  order  to  build  sports

excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in terms of building up sports excellence, we

are  revamping the National Sports Associations  (NSAs).   Mr

Tan's  feedback that some NSAs have told him that  they  have

not seen the effect of the $500 million is because we have to

be  very  careful on how we spend this money.  As Mr Tan  has

mentioned,  accountability is very important.  What  we  have

done is to make sure that we have a system in place.  We have

recently  launched a system to evaluate the NSAs and classify

the  sports according to core, merits and others.  This would

allow  them to receive different funding levels.  The  system

is  transparent.  It will allow them to evaluate  where  they

are  in  terms of the ranking system, and what more  do  they

need  to  do  in order to improve.  In all of our discussions

with the NSAs, we make it clear that governance is important,

and  how they must manage the sporting fraternity.  Secondly,

we  also  talk about developmental programmes - what are  the

things  that they should do in order to develop the  athletes

under their charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier in the CoS debate about programmes

for  youth  development,  which  the  NSAs  are  supposed  to

undertake.  In this regard, I would like to add that NSAs are

also  working with some of our CDCs to ensure that  we  start

young.  When I was the Mayor of Central Singapore, we started

a  football league for young kids.  We worked through the FAS

to  get  support  from Home United, which is  located  within

Central  Singapore.   The programme is  well-received  by  my

residents  at  that time and we have, since then,  started  a

second  centre  in Bishan Stadium. The first  centre  was  at

Beatty Secondary School. There are efforts along the way,  be

it  directly through the schools or in collaboration with the

schools, with the CDCs and the NSAs to encourage more  people

to take up sports of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



interest.   I  understand that Southeast CDC  has  also  been

working   with  Geylang  United  to  bring  sports   to   the

heartlands,  especially soccer because  there  is  a  lot  of

interest, and to start young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third pillar is the sports industry. I agree with

Mr  Tan that we need the base, and people who are prepared to

pay  to  watch and then to support.  Like Mr Tan, I  grew  up

with the Kallang Stadium.  I was part of the Kallang roar.  I

remember those matches.  I think it is very good for us to be

able to achieve that sort of support.  Earlier this year,  we

had  the Singapore Rugby 7. Mr Speaker himself was the  Guest

of Honour. I was there in my capacity as Sports Minister. The

atmosphere was fantastic.  There was a lot of support.  There

were  a lot of expatriate community members because they have

a  passion for rugby.  I suspect beer supplies went  up  over

that  weekend, because there was a lot of involvement by  the

community for that particular event.  The sporting spirit was

indeed  very remarkable because, at the end of the day,  even

though  they  may  be English or other supporters,  but  when

there  was  a  game  between  Fiji  and  Samoa,  they  always

supported the underdog, and cheered the underdog on. That was

the  kind of spirit that I saw, and I think most of us in the

sporting  fraternity will agree that we want to achieve  that

kind of level of participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have anything else to add other than the fact

that I agree with him on the kind of fighting spirit that  we

see  now  of the old Rafflesians in order to lead the revival

of  the rugby team in Raffles.  My brother was a rugby player

from RI.  He is also very disappointed.  I am sure Mr Zainul,

who  was  his  contemporary  in  RI,  is  also  disappointed.

Something  needs to be done. We applaud such  spirit.   Where

possible, SSC will come in and help the schools, as  we  have

done.   As  I  mentioned earlier in my reply, we are  working

with schools in order for schools to encourage those who  are

normally not keen in taking up sporting activities to engage.

These  are  not  competitive sports, but it  allows  them  to

participate  in  a sport of their interest.  Developing  that

base  is  very important.  It is a pyramid.  We  develop  the

base and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



industry,  so  that we can get people to participate.   As  I

have mentioned earlier, we are looking into redeveloping  the

Kallang  Stadium, to revamp it into something which  is  new,

not  like  the  old  stadium, something that  can  promote  a

lifestyle and attract people there throughout the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in terms of the pyramid at the top, we

have, as he has mentioned, the athlete programme, the ACT, to

help  some of our top athletes.  We give them support.   Some

of  them  have been sent overseas.  I know the recent winner,

Sports  Girl  of  the Year, is now in California,  undergoing

intensive  swimming  programme while  pursuing  her  studies.

These are efforts that we have put in place.  Whether we will

need  more money or not the $500 million is there.   We  have

only  spent about $35 million.  We have just started,  so  we

have  to be very careful.  At the end of five years, we  have

to go back to Government if we need more, I suppose.  But the

$500 million does not include the money that we will need  in

order  to  redevelop  the Kallang Sports  Stadium.   For  the

moment,   our  assessment  is  that  $500  million  will   be

sufficient  for  the next five years for us to  lay  some  of

these  foundations.  Beyond that, we will  probably  have  to

review, and go back to Government for the funds.

<div align="center"><b>CONCLUSION OF DEBATE IN COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, we are now at the end of the

Budget debate.  It is the custom for the Speaker to say a few

words after every session of the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several theories to explain why this is so.

One  of  which  is to compensate the Speaker  for  having  to

listen to Members' speeches for several days on end.   But  I

relish the opportunity, really, to address the House, because

it  gives me the opportunity to thank hon. Members for  their

contributions in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



the  debate, especially those Members who have given me their

cooperation and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those Members, whom I have had the occasion to cut

their speeches unceremoniously, I offer my deepest apologies.

If I seem unduly harsh in my interventions, it was because of

the demands of my role as Speaker of the House, not due to my

nature,  as I am known to be humble, soft-spoken, gentle  and

caring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I started this Debate with a mental list of MPs

known  for their long speeches.  Alas, and to my dismay,  not

only  does this list remain, I also have had to add new names

to the number that I have.  Henceforth, one of my missions in

life now is to shorten this list as this session progresses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I have actually enjoyed the debate, despite my

demeanour  and  my  body language.  I am impressed  with  the

depth,  breadth  and  texture of the  speeches,  and  by  the

variety  of  views expressed.  I would like  to  particularly

congratulate the new Members of this House for their sterling

performance  in this debate.  All these augur  well  for  the

future of this Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>, we have had a long and very gruelling

session.  It leaves me now to end this debate.  But before  I

do, I would like, and on behalf of my Deputy Speakers, and my

staff on this side of the Chamber, to thank hon. Members once

again  for  their contributions, their cooperation and  their

forbearance.  My thanks also to the Leader of the House,  and

his  Deputy  and  to  the Whip and his  Deputies,  for  their

assistance.  Thank you.  [Applause.]

<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament do now adjourn."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty minutes</div>
