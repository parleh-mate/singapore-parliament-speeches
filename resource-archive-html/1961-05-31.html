<div align="center"><b>BUKIT HO SWEE FIRE</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation to  proceed

with the motion* standing in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its profound sympathy for the victims of

the fire at Bukit Ho Swee and calls upon the people to donate generously

to the Bukit Ho Swee Fire Relief Fund;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to prevent a recurrence of such disastrous fires the site of the fire be

acquired by the Government for the Housing and Development Board for rebuilding,

and to this end that no one be allowed to rebuild on this site structures of a

temporary or permanent nature;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That compensation to private owners for the land to be acquired should be at

the value of the land in its encumbered state just before the fire, and that legislation

to this end be passed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Housing and Development Board regulations relating to the prohibition

of sub-letting or sharing of accomodation be relaxed in the case of these fire

victims in order that rapid re-housing will be possible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House thanks the fire fighting services, the Police and Military Forces

for their work in combating the fire and maintaining order on that occasion and thanks

the workers in the Government Social Services and the Voluntary organisations who have

helped in the relief of the fire victims.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Ho Swee fire took place on the afternoon

of  the  25th  May, 1961. It was without  doubt  the

worst that Singapore has ever experienced since  the

war.  It  devastated an area of some 100  acres  and

rendered homeless, according to the latest count,  a

total  of  2,833  families - comprising  some  15,694

persons,  most  of whom lost practically  all  their

possessions. Hon. Members of the House have read  in

the  Press of the immediate measures which have been

taken  by  the Government to provide interim  relief

for the fire victims. They are now housed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



temporarily in five school buildings in the Kim Seng

Road  area,  where voluntary workers, the Government

Social  Welfare  Service,  the  Army  and  the  Work

Brigade  have  done  all they  can  to  relieve  the

sufferings  of  the victims and have  provided  them

with food, clothing and blankets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also set up the Bukit Ho Swee

Fire Relief Committee under the chairmanship of  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law. Representatives  from

political   parties,  the  Trades  Union   Congress,

student bodies of Universities, the Polytechnic, the

Chambers   of  Commerce,  the  Council   of   Social

Services, rural and other organisations are  serving

in this Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lessons must be learned from the cause of

this  fire, and this lesson should strike home  with

full  impact.  For  the third time  since  the  war,

Singapore  has bitterly experienced disaster  caused

by  fire. In 1958 the Kampong Koo Chye fire rendered

379  families with 2,050 persons homeless;  in  1959

there  was the Tiong Bahru fire which affected 1,016

families, comprising 5,200 people; and now the  most

tragic  of  them all, the Bukit Ho Swee  fire  which

destroyed  the  homes  of 2,833 families,  involving

nearly 15,694 people. The common feature about these

fires  is  that  they  occur in already  packed  and

unauthorised  structures  of  wood  and  attap.  The

occupants  in  all these cases had,  in  fact,  been

living  in  veritable fire traps. If only one  house

catches  fire, then within minutes a blazing inferno

would  engulf  a  whole community  before  the  fire

fighters could arrive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unstinted devotion to duty during the disaster

of  the  fire fighting services, the Police and  the

Military   was  something  to  be  proud   of,   but

unfortunately  They  were to a  considerable  extent

hindered by curious crowds who arrived on the  scene

while  the fire was raging and almost choked up  the

roads,  thus  delaying  the  arrival  of  the   fire

engines. It is hoped that our citizens would be more

civic-minded in future and make an effort to  subdue

their  curiosity  and stay away from  calamities  of

this  nature  which  are not really  spectacles  for

enjoyment.  I  am happy to say that,  on  the  other

hand,  the  fire victims themselves  behaved  in  an

exemplary  manner  and showed no panic.  Though  the

fire took four lives, it would surely have been more

disastrous   if   the  crowds  of   sightseers   and

spectators  had gone out of control  and  panic  had

resulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not ignore the lessons of this catastrophe.

The  reasons for the existence of building  by-laws,

the  need to enforce minimum building standards, and

the basic requirements of proper planning should now

be  painfully  clear. We must not be blind  to  such

lessons.  We  should now understand  why  the  Chief

Building   Surveyor's  Department  of  my   Ministry

conducts    its    campaign   against   unauthorised

structures,  which  are  built  in  exactly  similar

conditions to the houses that went up so quickly  in

flames  at Bukit Ho Swee on 25th May. Most of  these

unauthorised  structures are put up by  unscrupulous

racketeers who live off the miseries of the poor. It

is  appreciated that the poor people are  forced  by

circumstances to live in these huts because  of  the

acute  shortage of cheap housing in  the  State  and

that  it  will  be  some time  before  the  building

programmes of the Housing and Development Board  can

catch  up with this shortage. But I should  like  to

appeal to these people not to fall into the clutches

of  the racketeers who put up unauthorised buildings

for  rent or sale. They should never buy or rent any

of  these  structures. They may not only be cheated,

but may also become victims of fire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any building to be put up should be duly

authorised  by  the Building Surveyor's  Department.

The procedure for the grant of permits for temporary

buildings has now been streamlined, and applications

should   now   be  dealt  with  more  expeditiously.

Government  is  firmly resolved  to  discourage  the

erection  of wooden buildings with attap roofs,  and

in   the   congested  city  area  to   prohibit   it

altogether. Firm orders have been given to the Chief

Building  Surveyor  to  pull down  any  unauthorised

structures as soon as they are spotted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not be discharging its

responsibilities to the people if it did  not  clamp

down on unauthorised buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was indeed fortunate that the Bukit Ho

Swee  fire  was brought under control  and  did  not

spread  further. If circumstances had  been  adverse

the  fire could easily have gone out of control with

much  more  disastrous consequences. A conflagration

of  this magnitude can easily engulf not only  attap

buildings, but also brick and concrete structures as

well.  Many  brick and concrete buildings  were,  in

fact, destroyed on 25th May, along Havelock Road. If

attap and wooden structures were allowed to multiply

in  the city areas, the next fire might well destroy

a   considerable   section   of   the   city,   with

considerable loss of lives. I appeal to  members  of

the  public  to  report  immediately  to  the  Chief

Building Surveyor's Department should they  see  any

unauthorised attap and wooden structures  being  put

up.  At  the  moment, there is  a  large  number  of

outstanding  mandatory orders  against  unauthorised

buildings.  Many of these orders require alterations

to  the  unauthorised structures before they can  be

regularised. Most of the houses, however, cannot  be

regularised,  because  they  are  likely  to  become

dangerous fire traps. There has been a great deal of

misunderstanding  about the  work  of  the  Building

Surveyor's  Department, particularly when  it  takes

action to demolish unauthorised buildings. But may I

repeat  that  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  this

unpleasant action is to save people from the dangers

of fire traps, like those of Bukit Ho Swee?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government will take firm measures to prevent

the  site  of  the  Bukit Ho Swee  fire  from  being

reoccupied by unauthorised structures. The  site  is

to be acquired for re-development by the Housing and

Development  Board.  No  doubt,  hon.  Members  will

support this proposal as well as the Bill that  will

be  introduced to acquire the land. The  project  is

one  designed  for the public good and  the  private

owners  concerned  can be expected  not  to  make  a

profit out of this disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relief, re-housing and rehabilitation of

the  fire victims cannot be an easy matter  when  so

many  persons are involved. There are not sufficient

numbers  of  vacant  Housing and  Development  Board

flats   immediately  available  to  re-house   every

family.  Though  the public and various  Governments

have  been  most  generous  with  their  gifts   and

donations in cash and kind, whatever relief that the

fire victims can receive will only provide temporary

rehabilitation until they can definitely find  their

own feet again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that all available

housing  units of the Housing Board should  be  made

available  for rehousing the fire victims.  In  this

connection, I should like to appeal to those members

of  the public who have been on the waiting list for

Housing Board accommodation to make a certain amount

of  sacrifice.  There are some 13,000 applicants  on

the  housing  register and many of  them  have  been

waiting  for  three, four, or even five years.  Just

when  their chances of being allocated accommodation

have improved with the completion of more than 1,000

houses,  they  have to be told again that  the  fire

victims will be given priority. The Government hopes

that  these  applicants will  not  grudge  the  fire

victims  the  special priority given to them.  These

applicants  at least have some form of accommodation

at  present, while the fire victims have  lost  both

homes and most of their possessions. The Housing and

Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



Board will be building more units soon, and the turn

of  the  applicants who will be given  accommodation

will not be far off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the following housing units that are

immediately available will be set aside for the

re-housing of the fire victims:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600 flats at Queenstown



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 flats at Clarence Lane, Alexandra



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300 flats at Tiong Bahru Fire Site



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 flats at Kallang Estate.



<br><br>In  a  few days time the Housing Board will  have  a

further 450 units available at the Tiong Bahru  Fire

Site,  and  these  too  will  be  allotted  to  fire

victims. Within the next three months, 904 units  of

one-room $20 flats will be ready at the Tiong  Bahru

Cemetery Site, and 804 units of two-room flats  will

be  completed at MacPherson Estate, while a  further

1,448  units  of two-and three-room  flats  will  be

ready in Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flats will be offered to the fire victims at

the rents normally charged to members of the public.

It  is  not the intention to upset the very  complex

rent  structure of the Housing and Development Board

by  introducing  rent-free  periods  or  by  waiving

rents. The Government, while doing all that is right

and proper for the fire victims, must not lose sight

of  the  necessity to account to the people for  the

expenditure of public funds entrusted to its charge.

It  is  considered,  therefore,  that  fire  victims

should  pay  the  normal  rentals  charged  for  the

accommodation  offered.  To  assist   fire   victims

further,  it  is  proposed that  the  Housing  Board

regulations prohibiting the sub-letting of rooms  in

flats  or  the  sharing of flats by  more  than  one

family be relaxed. The Housing and Development Board

does not normally permit its tenants to sub-let  any

part of their flats, but in order that re-housing of

fire victims can be accomplished expeditiously,  the

Board  will be asked to permit fire victims to share

accommodation  with their friends or  relatives  now

residing  in any of the Board's estates.  The  Board

will also accept two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



small  families of fire victims joining together  to

apply  for a flat. The Government intends  that  the

relief  to  fire  victims should take  the  form  of

equitable distributions in cash and kind so that the

amounts  of  relief to be distributed  to  the  fire

victims   will  be  entirely  dependent   upon   the

generosity of the people of Singapore and elsewhere.

The  distribution will be on a per  capita  and  per

family basis and it is felt that this method will be

the most equitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fire victim families will receive (a) a rent

assistance grant of $7 per person up to a maximum of

$35 per family. This sum will, in effect, operate as

a  rent  subsidy, and will be paid for a  period  of

three  months;  (b) a lump sum rehabilitation  grant

will  be paid to these families; the sum to be  paid

will  be  dependent on the monies available  in  the

relief fund after meeting other commitments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All families will receive these two grants, whether

they  accept  Housing  Board accommodation  or  not;

those not requiring Housing Board accommodation  may

use  their  rent assistance grant for finding  their

own accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like now to thank the

public of Singapore, especially those from all walks

of  life  who have donated in cash and kind  to  the

fire  victims. The Government respects  and  admires

the  concern they have shown for their fellowmen  in

their hour of need. I should like also to take  this

opportunity to say how grateful we are to the  Prime

Minister  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  for   the

personal visit he made to the scene of the fire  and

for   the   promise  of  financial  aid   from   his

Government.  I also wish to express the Government's

appreciation  of  the prompt and  generous  donation

from  the U.K. and U.S. Governments. The relief fund

which  the  Government has set up with  the  initial

contribution of $250,000 will, I expect, continue to

grow with more and more donations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me convey to the State and Army

Fire  fighting services, the Police Force, the Army,

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



untiring  workers  in  both  the  Government  social

services   and   the  voluntary  organisations   the

heartfelt  gratitude  of the  Government  for  their

devotion  to  the service of those affected  by  the

disaster  and  for their selfless efforts  in  their

respective   spheres-in  combating  the   fire,   in

maintaining order and in giving much assistance  and

much appreciated relief to the fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I propose the Question, the

Prime  Minister  has tabled copies of  the  Bill  he

proposes to introduce under item 2, and I think hon.

Members should have copies of the Bill with them  as

soon  as  possible. I therefore propose  that  these

copies be distributed immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have had an opportunity of glancing

rapidly  through the Bill, and it seems to  me  that

the  subject matter covered by the Bill is the  same

as  the subject matter of paragraph 3 of the motion.

Perhaps  the  Prime Minister would like  to  confirm

that before I proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, that

is so. In fact, it spells out the intention which is

contained in paragraph 3 of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps it would be convenient for

hon.  Members if the motion should be posed  to  the

House without paragraph 3, so that there will not be

a  repetition of the debate on the subject matter of

paragraph  3.  The debate could take place  when  we

come  to  the  Bill. If that is convenient  to  hon.

Members,  I suggest that that would be a better  way

of doing things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you propose, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will propose the Question without

paragraph 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House expresses its profound sympathy

for  the  victims of the fire at Bukit Ho  Swee  and

calls  upon the people to donate generously  to  the

Bukit Ho Swee Fire Relief Fund;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to prevent a recurrence of such disastrous

fires  the  site  of  the fire be  acquired  by  the

Government for the Housing and Development Board for

rebuilding, and to this end that no one  be  allowed

to rebuild on this site structures of a temporary or

permanent nature;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Housing and Development Board regulations

relating  to  the  prohibition  of  sub-letting   or

sharing  of accommodation be relaxed in the case  of

these  fire  victims in order that rapid  re-housing

will be possible;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House thanks the fire fighting services,

the  Police  and Military Forces for their  work  in

combating  the  fire and maintaining order  on  that

occasion  and  thanks the workers in the  Government

Social Services and the voluntary organisations  who

have helped in the relief of the fire victims."



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all

of us are in sympathy with and express our grief for

the  16,000  people who have been affected  by  this

great  fire. From what we know, this is the greatest

fire  in  the  history of Singapore. It has  brought

much  misery  and  ruin  in its  wake.  Sir,  on  an

occasion  like  this, all of us in this  House  will

forget  and sink all political differences which  we

may have so that everyone may contribute his best to

work  out a solution for the rehabilitation  of  our

unfortunate brothers and sisters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must compliment the Government

on  all  the  efforts they have put in  on  such  an

occasion. This has been a disaster of magnitude  and

the  Government has, in my opinion, done  its  best.

Tribute  must also be paid to all the organisations,

both Government and private, which have come to  the

forefront to rescue and give assistance to the  fire

victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since we have such a motion, I wish to

bring  forward  a  few points to  the  attention  of

Government.  Sir,  these  should  not  be  taken  as

criticisms  but rather as suggestions for Government

to  consider. From what I gather, most of  the  fire

victims  have one big common problem, that is,  when

are  they going to settle down and start life again?

For  this, they have to depend so much on Government

as well as on other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



persons  who  have  come  forward  courageously  and

generously  to  the assistance of the fire  victims.

The  main problem they are worried about is housing.

We  are  happy  to  learn from  the  speech  of  the

Minister  for National Development that all  efforts

will  be made to re-house the fire victims.  But  it

has  been  said that it is not possible to  re-house

all  the  fire victims at one time. It is  fortunate

that  there  are so many vacant flats to re-house  a

big  portion  of  the  fire  victims.  But  I  think

Government  should  consider  ways  and   means   of

resettling the other victims, either by the erection

of temporary structures controlled by Government, or

by  the use of vacant Government bungalows, of which

I think there are still quite a few left, or by the

deployment of other vacant buildings in the  island.

Unless  the  fire victims are resettled, Sir,  those

who  are  employed may not be able to  go  to  work,

because  they have to look after their  children  in

the  fire relief centres. It is what we say a double

loss.  If  they  are  able to be resettled  earlier,

those  who  have employment could go back  to  their

work as soon as possible to earn a few extra dollars

to help their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for National Development has

mentioned the question of rent and the question of a

free  rental  period. Sir, the second problem  which

the  fire  victims are worried about is the question

whether they can afford the rentals and whether  the

flats allocated to them could be near their place of

work.  It is not possible to allocate flats to  them

near  their  place of work, because there  are  not

many  flats being constructed or being completed  at

the  moment near the fire site. I think  this  is  a

problem no government can solve. But on the question

of rentals, Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I know, most

of  the  houses  at  present  completed,  or  almost

completed,  were built at the time when construction

costs  were the lowest in the last five to 10 years.

If  we  go according to the normal practice  of  the

Housing  and Development Board, the rentals  charged

on  these flats should be lower than usual. They are

flats which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



were  built during the time of the Korean War,  when

the  cost of construction was much more, and persons

who  are now staying in those houses are bearing the

full   heavy  construction  costs  because  of   the

increase  in  prices  due to  the  war.  If  such  a

practice  is accepted, Mr Speaker, Sir, then  these

houses  should be rented out at what they  cost  the

Housing and Development Board to build, and not on a

so-called rational basis where everything  is  being

brought into the pool and distribution of rental  is

being accepted as a basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for

National  Development  has  also  touched   on   the

question  of  three  months'  free  rental  and  has

suggested an alternative of a rent subsidy allowance

of $7 per person, up to a maximum of $35 per family.

I  think,  Sir, this is quite a good scheme  because

normally,  during a fire disaster,  there  are  some

persons   who   go   back   and   who   get   S.I.T.

accommodation,  and  there are  others  who  receive

private  accommodation, and it will not be  fair  to

those  receiving private accommodation if Government

offers  a three-month free rental to those  who  are

obtaining  S.I.T. accommodation.  However,  in   my

opinion,  the rent subsidy proposed by the  Minister

just  now  is  below what was offered  to  the  fire

victims of the Upper Chin Chew Street fire, or  even

much  lower compared to that offered in the case  of

the  Lorong 3 fire, where each fire victim was given

three  months'  free rental, water and  electricity,

plus   facilities  to  pay  their  deposits  on   an

instalment  basis if the need arose. I propose  that

the  Government should find out whether there  is  a

way  out to increase the rent subsidies proposed  to

the  fire  victims, to raise it to a standard  which

was accepted in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another problem which the fire

victims  are  worried about is their jobs.  Many  of

them  have  lost  their jobs due to  the  fire - those

persons  who have been working on the fire  site  or

those  persons whose factories, shops  or  means  of

livelihood  by  hawking  and  labouring  have   been

destroyed  by the fire. I think the Government  must

give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



consideration  to these persons who  are  unemployed

due  to  the fire, because they have not  only  lost

their belongings and properties, but they also  have

lost  their  means of livelihood. A few  shops  were

also  affected by the fire, Sir, and it is suggested

that,  when the Housing Board build new shops around

the area, priority be given to those shopkeepers who

had  shops on the old fire site and preferably these

shops  should  be rented out at lower  rentals  than

usual.  Usually the shops are rented out on a tender

basis, and the person who bids the highest gets  the

shop. It has also been suggested. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  some of these shops could perhaps be  sold  to

the shopkeepers on an instalment basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention perhaps should also be brought to the

Government  on  the organisation at present  in  the

relief centres. First of all, it must be pointed out

that  none  of the Government departments  has  been

prepared or could ever have foreseen a task of  such

magnitude.  But  perhaps members of  the  Government

staff  will  pay attention to some of the complaints

or  little irritations which may be very trivial  to

us but which are causing quite a problem to the fire

victims. Food is one of the main problems which they

are  complaining of, Mr Speaker, Sir, It  has  been

pointed out that it now takes about one or two hours

to  queue up for food, often under the hot sun,  and

sometimes the persons at the end of the queue do not

get vegetables when the supply is finished, and some

do not even get rice. This is perhaps because of the

bad  system  of  distribution and  not  because  not

enough  food is being cooked. It has been  suggested

that  if  Government would distribute food cards  to

heads of families instead of every person having to

queue  up  for his food, then it might mean  shorter

queues  and it would mean also a better distribution

of  food for the fire victims. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

one  centre, where I think there are nealy 2,000  to

3,000 inmates, there was only one queue and some  of

them  took about three hours to get their  food.  In

such centres perhaps we could establish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



three or four queues. Perhaps the Government has a

problem in trying to get the utensils and the

necessary equipment, but I think it will not cost

very much to buy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint has been about the cooking of

food.  It has been said that the rice and vegetables

are  not  properly washed. Yesterday, in one  relief

centre -  I  do not know how far this is  true - a  few

persons  told  us that they found  a  snake  in  the

vegetables!  The rice is of poor quality  and  quite

smelly - perhaps due to lack of washing. I  think  the

question of food can be looked into and improvements

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is also felt that there is a

shortage  of doctors and that they are visiting  the

fire relief centres at periods and not all the time.

There   have  also  been  complaints  of  no  proper

diagnosis  of  the  patients and that  many  of  the

patients,  especially children, do  not  get  proper

treatment.  We  know  this  is  a  drain-   on   the

Government  resources  of  medical  staff   in   the

hospitals, but I am putting up this proposal to  see

whether  the Government can try to get supplementary

staff  either  from the Government or  from  private

sources during the next few days to help the victims

in the relief centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the fire victims at night have to sleep

with  their  blankets  on  in  the  playing  fields,

because there is no accommodation in the schools. In

the  last two days, when there was rain, they  found

it  a  problem  to get even a place  to  squat  down

during  the night. Perhaps if a few more  tents  are

erected,  the problem can be partially  solved.  The

Government has been doing wonderful work in the past

few  days  erecting more tents, but those have  been

found  to be not sufficient. I wonder whether  there

are ways and means of getting more tents or marquees

for sleeping purposes for the fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been proposed that the

Ministry of Home Affairs send a special unit to  the

fire  victim  centres to help the fire  victims  get

extracts of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



lost birth certificates and citizenship certificates

and  other  types of certificates. Perhaps  on  this

occasion  fees can either be reduced or  waived.  If

much of the red-tape can be cut for the fire victims

particularly   in   applying   for    these    birth

certificates and citizenship certificates,  I  think

they  would be very grateful to the Government.  The

Government  has  already set  up  an  identity  card

centre in the fire relief centre, and this is a most

welcome act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is whether Government can send

vans to tour the residential areas, particularly the

more  well-to-do residential areas, during  evenings

or   week-ends   to   collect  blankets,   clothing,

furniture  and  cooking utensils  which  the  people

might  like to donate generously since they have  no

means  of  delivering their gifts in kind.  Most  of

these donations in kind and even in cash should,  in

my  opinion,  be  distributed to  the  fire  victims

immediately. It should not take a week or two  weeks

before  they are distributed, because it is at  this

time  that those gifts are most needed, particularly

cash   or   clothing.   Some   clothing   has   been

distributed, but it is found insufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to repeat that the

Government  has done whatever it can to relieve  the

fire victims, arid its work deserves the compliments

of all Members of this House.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker.   Sir,   as  a  representative   of   Delta

constituency  which suffered from the fire,  I  must

fully  support the Government's motion in regard  to

the fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bukit Ho Swee fire disaster, the

Government has immediately launched effective relief

measures  and after-care welfare so that the  10,000

fire  victims  could be resettled and looked  after.

Another  relief measure of Government is to let  the

fire  victims  rebuild their  homes  so  that  those

people   who  have  long  suffered  in   the   past,

particularly  the  Bukit Ho Swee fire  victims,  can

live under better and more favourable conditions  in

future. This clearly shows that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



the  Government which comes from the people is doing

its  best  for  the  people - to  improve  the  living

conditions of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the fire broke out, the Prime Minister,

Ministers and all Assemblymen and Assemblywomen have

been working very hard. When the fire broke out, the

Prime  Minister  and many Ministers and  Assemblymen

rushed to the scene to help the people salvage their

belongings and to assist the firemen to evacuate the

old  and  young from the site. They have  also  been

consoling the victims day and night and seeing  that

all  helpers  and workers do their work properly  in

accommodating the victims in the various centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this disaster is the most serious one in the

history  of Singapore, the fire relief work must  be

fully  supported by all the people of Singapore  and

support  for Government's measures must be given  to

enable  the Government to achieve better results  in

rebuilding the homes of the victims in a short space

of   time.   At  this  crucial  time,  everyone   is

expressing  his  good  intentions.  The  people   of

Singapore have responded to Government's appeal and,

have donated generously. This has helped to make the

relief measures a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who have lost their jobs as a result of

the   fire,  we  have  appealed  to  all  shops  and

merchants   throughout   Singapore   to   contribute

generously  to  the relief of the unemployed  people

who  have  suffered from the fire. I hope they  will

come forward to give employment to these victims  so

that  they could rebuild their homes and live a good

life again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the few points raised by the Member for

Hong Lim, I wish to answer them now. The Member said

that  there  were  too  many people  housed  in  the

centres,   so  that  they  were  faced   with   many

difficulties, such as sleeping accommodation and  so

on.  I  was  at the relief centre day and night  and

looked after all their problems. We have built  many

camps  to  relieve  the congestion  in  the  crowded

centres. In these camps there are beds for  the  use

of the fire victims. The reason for the congestion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



at  the  Seng Poh School Centre is that about  1,000

victims were first accommodated there as a temporary

measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the complaint of shortage of food, I think

there  is  no  justification.  After  the  fire  the

Government prepared a large amount of food  to  feed

the  hungry  victims.  There  was  enough  food  for

distribution, but because of the great rush for  it,

the work of distribution was hampered. However, this

has been rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion for more police to patrol the

site  and  to assist the fire victims, I  would  say

that Government has already adopted this measure  in

the  past  few days. The fire victims who could  not

manage to save their belongings during the fire were

allowed to go back to the devastated site after  the

fire to salvage their belongings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures that the Government has

taken after the disaster.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first of all, might I say how deeply moved we on the

Opposition side are by the recent fire and  all  the

calamity  and disaster that it has brought to  these

15,000  odd  people?  In this matter,  Sir,  we  are

entirely  at  one  with  the  Government  and  other

Members in this House who have just spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will not think this

is a matter which is out of keeping with the debate.

I  sympathise with the Member for Delta - I understand

it  is  her particular constituency which  has  been

affected - that at a moment like this, when she should

be  rejoicing,  having secured her  lifelong  dream,

this disaster should have befallen her. However, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, none of us can arrange our  happiness

in the order in which it occurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get back to the motion before the House. Sir,

on  occasions  like this, it is the  duty  of  every

citizen not only to go to the aid of Government, but

also  to  go to the aid of the victims. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this is a national calamity. Nothing like this

has  occurred  in  the  history  of  Singapore.   We

sincerely hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



nothing  approaching  it will ever  occur  again  in

Singapore. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, while sympathising

with  the  victims  and doing our  best  to  prevent

occurrences like this in future, I think  one  would

not  be doing one's duty if one did not look closely

into  the  circumstances which led to the fire,  and

also   inquire  into  the  situation  whether   this

disaster of the magnitude to which it has now  risen

could  have been minimised or prevented to  a  large

extent.  The question that first occurs to my  mind,

Mr  Speaker,  is this. When the fire occurred,  the

first  persons  and possibly the  only  persons  who

could  have  helped in putting it out was  the  Fire

Brigade. The Fire Brigade cannot function unless  it

has an adequate source of water supply. The question

whether  there was adequate pressure in the hydrants

to  which the Fire Brigade went for their supply was

cursorily  mentioned in our leading national  paper,

the  Straits  Times - or  so it calls  itself - and  the

matter  has  been left to lie there.  I  would  have

thought,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the  fire  could

have  been  prevented  by an adequate  water  supply

being available in that area, then that is a matter

which this national newspaper of ours might usefully

have taken up. But since it did not, I propose to do

so because I feel it my duty to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did I learn this from the Straits Times,

Mr Speaker, Sir, but I have heard it said commonly,

and  the people are talking about this in Singapore,

and  therefore,  I  think it  is  the  duty  of  the

Government to reassure the people that what  is  now

being  commonly  bandied about in Singapore  is  not

correct. It is being said, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if

the  Fire  Brigade had been able to go to  the  fire

hydrants and get into their hoses a stream of  water

at  the right pressure, a lot of this disaster might

have   been   prevented.  The   question   naturally

arises - why  was the pressure in these fire  hydrants

allowed  to run down, particularly in the  Bukit  Ho

Swee area where such a fire is likely to occur? Some

of us know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



this area. We know that the houses are literally one

on  top  of the other, Mr Speaker, and it  is  very

difficult to pass from one house to the other unless

you  squeeze your way through. That is the condition

of  the estate where this fire occurred. I have also

heard  it said that it is not possible for the  Fire

Brigade  to  approach proper spots from  which  they

could use their hoses effectively. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  ask the Government to tell the House what was the

condition  of  the pressure of the water  supply  in

that area on that disastrous afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also read in the Press that constant

appeals  were put out for the firemen to come  back.

One  rather  gets the impression that  possibly  the

Fire  Brigade  was not at adequate strength  on  the

afternoon  of  the disaster. If that  impression  is

correct, Mr Speaker, Sir, then I think it  is  very

regrettable, and the Government must take full blame

for  it. If that is not so, then the Government must

assure  this House that, so far as the Fire  Brigade

was  concerned, it was adequately manned to meet the

situation caused by the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have on a number of occasions raised the

question of our water supply in this House.  I  have

indicated to the Government that the water supply in

Singapore is in a precarious state. I have suggested

to  them that they should very quickly increase  not

only  the  sources  of  water supply  but  also  the

quantum  of water supply either from our  island  or

from Johore or from both. To all these queries,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have had no adequate answer. Whether

the  Government now have plans to increase the water

supply  or not, this House is not aware of.  All  we

know  is that plans are afoot. But one does not know

exactly  what  is the position of the water  supply.

But  one  could  see for oneself if one  went  round

Singapore looking at the reservoirs. They are pretty

dry  and low. They are dangerously low. Now  if  all

this  is  correct, then I think the Government  must

bear a great deal of the blame for that most unhappy

occurrence on that afternoon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point which I wish to

touch  upon  is  this. I was not at the  scene,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  but  I understand  from  responsible

people who happened to be there that the handling of

the  situation  that  afternoon was  near  pathetic,

because nobody knew what was happening. Nobody  knew

what  to  do  about the whole position. People  were

running  about  from here to there  like  frightened

chickens  without really being able  to  render  any

effective  assistance, although everybody wanted  to

help. There was no doubt about that. They all wanted

to   help.  But  the  point  is  this.  If  you  put

inexperienced people on the fire site, they are more

a  hindrance  than  a help. On an occasion  such  as

this, we do not want sympathy, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to

bring  the fire effectively under control.  We  want

people on the site who know the job; who know how to

bring  the  fire under control, or put it  out.  The

Government  had one such arm which they  might  have

used on this occasion had they not thought it fit to

disband it. I refer, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the  Civil

Defence  Corps. Whatever we may say about the  Civil

Defence  Corps,  we cannot deny that their  training

was  intended  for occasions such as this.  If  that

Corps  and  not the Work Brigade had been  there,  I

think the story might well have been different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not criticising the Work

Brigade, and the help they thought they were giving.

But  they  were  people  inexperienced  in  such   a

situation.  They could dig drains effectively.  They

could  do  rough work. But were they trained  to  do

work  of this nature? Putting 1,700 members  of  the

Work  Brigade  on  the site, I  would  submit,  with

respect to the Government, was more a hindrance than

a  help  in  such a situation. Fifty  Civil  Defence

Corps  members would have rendered greater and  more

effective help in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that this fire which started in Kampong Tiong Bahru jumped one road, that is to

say,  it  jumped Tiong Bahru Road and having  jumped

Tiong  Bahru Road, it jumped Havelock Road  and  did

damage  on the other side of Havelock Road. So  this

fire had all the time in the world to jump these two

roads and, it seems, nothing could be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



done.  I  therefore ask the Government to tell  this

House  whether it was not possible for the Singapore

Fire  Brigade  to  have  taken effective  preventive

measures at least to see that it did not jump on the

second  occasion. One might say that they  were  not

prepared  for the first jump. What excuse was  there

in  not  taking  effective  preventive  measures  to

prevent  the fire from jumping a second time  on  to

Havelock  Road  and  doing  damage  there?  Did  the

Government not have sufficient fire-engines at their

disposal?   Or  did  they  not  have  enough   water

throughout that area? What was the reason? If  there

was  enough  water, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  if  there

were  enough  fire-engines, then I am suggesting  to

the  Government that there was absolute  mishandling

of  the  situation in allowing the fire to jump  the

second time when it had already jumped on the  first

occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the matters, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  have  crossed my mind. I mention  this  in  no

spirit of vindictiveness. But I do think that it  is

important   for   all  of  us - the  Government,   the

Opposition  and the public - to address our  minds  to

fire  hazards which are present all over  Singapore.

Bukit  Ho  Swee is not the only one. There  are  yet

others  in Singapore. And in those areas,  the  same

disaster  might occur. If by this great  catastrophe

we  have  learnt  our lesson, and  if  we  can  take

effective measures so that the future does  not  see

an  occasion such as this, then at least we can  say

we  have learnt our lesson. Mr Speaker, in  my  own

personal  view,  I  feel that the  situation  is  so

important that the Government might consider whether

they  should not appoint a Commission of Inquiry  to

go  into the causes of this fire and find out how it

spread,  why it spread, and what effective  measures

the Government should take in future on such matters

as this in order that such disasters might not occur

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, might I say this?

I  am not denying the good service and the good work

that  the firefighting services did, that the Police

did  and  that the Military forces did. We  are  all

thankful  to  these three services for  having  done

their best. Sometimes, Sir, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



is  unfortunate that the best is not good enough. It

is  not  the  best that is good enough.  It  is  the

correct  things  that should have been  done.  I  am

wondering, Sir, whether the correct things were done

there on that disastrous afternoon.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on this occasion there  was  a  fire

disaster  at  Bukit Ho Swee. This fire disaster  was

unprecedented  in  the  history  of  Singapore.  The

losses  of the victims can be said to be very great.

When  the  fire first occurred, everybody  was  very

busy.  Everybody ran away very quickly.  Many  could

not  even  have the time to fetch their own clothes,

and  they ran out naked. At that time, many  mothers

were  looking  for their children,  and  the

grand-parents   were   looking  for  their  parents.   The

belongings  could not be brought out.  It  could  be

said  that the property of the whole family was lost

in the fire. The losses of those in Tiong Bahru were

not  so  great as the losses of those  at  Bukit  Ho

Swee. But on behalf of the Tiong Bahru fire victims,

I  wish  to  say that the Government and the  people

must  help the fire victims to enable them  to  have

some  capital in order that they might  be  able  to

continue their normal life again, as they have  done

in  the past. This is my greatest hope. Just now the

Minister for National Development has said that  the

Government is going to let the victims stay  on  the

Development  Board's houses without rent  for  three

months. On behalf of the Tiong Bahru fire victims, I

express  my  view that Government should  also  help

those  unemployed  to the best  of  its  ability  to

regain their employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Farrer Park said that the

Government, in respect of fire relief, had not  done

well.  Perhaps the hon. Member for Farrer  Park  did

not  go  there. That is why he was not aware of  the

actual  situation  there,  because  when  the   fire

occurred,   the  wind  was  blowing  very  strongly.

Although the fire at first started in Kampong  Tiong

Bahru, it immediately went across the main road  and

over to Bukit Ho Swee. Because the wind was terribly

strong and because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



the hon. Member for Farrer Park did not go there  to

see  for  himself, that is why he  is  just  blindly

making accusations that the Government had not  done

well   in  controlling  the  fire.  When  the   fire

occurred, our Fire Brigade and the Police were  very

busy carrying out their work and everybody concerned

was doing his best to help put out the fire.



<br><br>3.48 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

people of Singapore have always responded generously

whenever  a  disaster  of this  kind  affects  their

fellow-citizens,  and  we  too  here   support   the

Government  in  all the measures taken  to  relieve,

rehabilitate  and rehouse the victims  of  Bukit  Ho

Swee  fire.  However, as the Minister  for  National

Development  has  said,  we  should  also  take   to

ourselves some of the lessons that we can learn from

this disaster. Some of the members of the public are

asking questions like these. Must we wait for a fire

to  raze  an  attap-house area before  we  think  of

rehousing these unfortunate people? Can we not  plan

a  scheme so that all the potential areas which  are

likely to be affected by future fires could be dealt

with systematically one at a time, and so that those

citizens who are housed in attap-house areas can  be

properly   rehoused  before  any  calamity   arises?

Otherwise, they say, Sir, it looks as if once in two

years a fire breaks out and then when thousands  are

badly affected, we think of rehousing them. If there

are  10  such  fire-trap areas, will the  Government

think of a comprehensive scheme, in addition to  the

regular  scheme they have, to prevent  these  almost

annual   disasters?   Sir,  it   may   mean   bigger

expenditure,  but  I think the  people  feel  it  is

better  to prevent a calamity than to wait until  it

occurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question they ask is this. If these

attap-house  people  want to  improve  their  living

conditions and make their houses less susceptible to

fire, would the Government raise the assessment  the

moment   their  houses  appear  to  be  much  better

constructed? I think the Government will agree  that

they want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



do everything they can to help the people to improve

themselves  without discouraging them, and  when  an

assurance  could  be given that  there  will  be  no

increase of assessment if they improve themselves by

replacing  atap  roofs with zinc  roofs,  and  plank

walls with brick walls, then that might help more of

the people to improve themselves and their lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question which they ask is this.

Although  the  deterrent factor in  private  housing

development   has  been  somewhat   removed,   still

developers  are  hesitant about  developing  housing

estates  because the deposit required  of  them,  in

their  eyes, is still considerable and they have  to

pass  on  their  deposit to the  purchasers  of  the

houses.  If the Government could revert to  the  old

system,  they say that would make things easier  for

these  private developers. In view of the  increased

load which the Housing Board will have to bear if it

tackles  the problem of rehousing people  in

attap-house areas which are faced with fire risk, we  need

to  encourage these private developers in every  way

to  provide  housing for those who can  economically

buy their own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are a few suggestions which we pass on

to  the  Government  arising  from  questions  which

members of the public have passed on to us.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

all  of  us  today  are  very sad  at  our  national

calamity. What should first strike our minds is  how

to  rehouse  and  rehabilitate and start  all  these

people  again afresh on their own feet. But  instead

of  trying to give good suggestions to Government as

to  how  we can help these poor people, as was  very

kindly  done  by the Member for Hong  Lim,  we  have

instead, from the S.P.A. benches, people who  wanted

to  make  political capital out of  the  misfortunes

that at the present moment face a big lot of people.

Everyone  of us knows that the Government  has  done

its level best. Yet we have one arm-chair critic who

if I were to translate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



meaning  of this expression into English, would  run

like  this: A robber taking opportunity of the  fire

to  rob.  He  is trying to make capital out  of  the

misfortunes  of  others.  Whilst  everyone  of   our

Ministers went down to the fire site to try to  help

(and  they stayed there until a very late hour)  the

Member  for Farrer Park never knew what it  was  all

about because, he has himself admitted, he was never

there.  He  said he had to depend on the newspapers.

Admittedly  the fire could not be contained  by  the

water.  But  did he know that it was  because  of  a

strong wind that had helped the fire to spread  from

one  place  to another? In spite of all the  firemen

who were available to go to the site to help, and in

spite  of sending all the fire-engines there,  still

with that strong breeze we could not and really  did

not  contain the fire. The fire-engines  had  to  go

from Tiong Bahru Road back into Havelock Road - a  big

detour.  And  now our Assemblyman from  Farrer  Park

complains that all this was because of the water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which he raised, and which was not

factual,  was  that the Work Brigade went  along  to

help.  The Work Brigade unfortunately did not go  to

help  in the beginning; it only went later.  So  the

Member for Farrer Park had all his facts wrong  when

he  said  that  members from the Work  Brigade  went

along to help. If you had more people from the Civil

Defence  Corps, that would have made  no  difference

whatsoever  to the fire on that particular  day.  We

hope  suggestions  from  the  Opposition  could   be

constructive instead.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel all the Members of this

House  have shown their sympathy and sorrow  in  the

catastrophe which occurred at Bukit Ho Swee. In  our

feelings  of  sorrow  there  are  people  who   have

exploited   the   opportunity   to   criticize   the

Government  and  offer suggestions with  a  view  to

ensuring that a fire like this will not occur again.

We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



emphasised  time and again that the  Government  has

done  everything  in its power to surmount  all  the

difficulties. However, in this Bukit Ho  Swee  fire,

which  is  the  worst in the history  of  Singapore,

there  is  no doubt that the difficulties confronted

were innumerable. We believe that the Government, if

it has in its possession an Aladdin Lamp, can use it

right now. But, Mr Speaker, in the words of a Malay

adage,  the Government bears the responsibility  and

is feeling the burden. But Members of the Opposition

are   taking  this  opportunity  to  castigate   the

Government  by suggesting that bungalows  should  be

taken over and used to accommodate the fire victims.

Mr   Speaker,   I  personally  have   visited   and

interviewed  the  fire  victims,  but   their   main

complaint  is  not that they require  the  bungalows

situated in Changi but that they hope to be able  to

get accommodation near the fire site. This cannot be

denied. Let us forget about the bungalows which they

cannot occupy because of the distance involved.  But

what  the  fire victims really need is accommodation

in the neighbourhood of the fire-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in addition

to  the  flats  which have been  set  aside  by  the

Housing and Development Board, there is the question

of  food. The Work Brigade did the cooking with  the

help of the fire victims themselves, and also washed

the   rice   and   vegetables.  It  is   impossible,

therefore,  that the vegetables and  rice  were  not

washed properly. However, we should not forget  that

on  the day the Bukit Ho Swee fire occurred, it  was

Hari  Raya, the day when Government workers were  on

holiday.  But  they responded magnificently  to  the

urgent call and fulfilled their duties. Mr Speaker,

we should be proud of this. It is a sacrifice on the

part of those concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Tanglin mentioned plans to prevent a fire. He suggested getting rid of

those  attap huts which are considered fire hazards.

Mr Speaker, doing away with attap huts in Singapore

is  not  an  easy matter because they have  been  in

existence  for  tens of years. We  should  not  also

forget  the  low standard of living of those  people

who  live in attap huts. If the plan is carried out,

i.e. to do away with the attap huts and immediately

force  the attap dwellers to live in the city  area,

then it would create a very difficult problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the houses built by the Housing and

Development  Board in the Princess Elizabeth  Estate

and  at Jalan Teck Whye. At certain times there were

no  applications for flats in these areas. This  is

because-



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed:</b> No, Sir. (In Malay): This is because

the  attap  dwellers could live in attap huts  at  a

maximum  rental of $15. For this reason, and because

of their low standard of living, they do not wish to

leave  their huts and stay in flats for  which  they

have  to  pay a minimum rental of $20.  And  it  was

during  those  times  that some  house-owners  built

attap  huts for those people with a low standard  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in any case, as I have said earlier, the Government is constantly paying attention to

these problems. If the Government were in possession

of  an  Aladdin  Lamp, it would use it  to  surmount

these difficulties.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

has  been  said  by the Opposition Members  that  we

share with the Government in showing our sympathy to

the victims of the Bukit Ho Swee fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Sir, that the speech of the

Member for Farrer Park has been misunderstood by the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs.  What the Member for Farrer Park  said  was

just to draw to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



the  attention  of  Government whether  or  not  the

matters that have been mentioned as facts are  true.

If  they  are  not true, then it is  good  that  the

Government  should  take this  opportunity  to  deny

them.  The Member for Farrer Park did not  make  any

attempt  to  make  political  capital  out  of   the

miseries of the victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary criticised the Member for Farrer Park for not being at the scene of the

fire.  I  was not at the scene of the fire  when  it

took  place.  Of course, hon. Members will  remember

that  during the previous Government there were  two

fires.  Immediately those fires started,  there  was

the  P.A.P. with  banners, the Workers  Party  with

banners, distributing free ice-water and free bread.

All  those things obstructed the relief measures  of

the  then Government. We thought that it should  not

be  so.  Therefore  we did not do anything  to  make

political capital out of the Bukit Ho Swee  fire  to

show to the public and to the fire victims that  our

hearts  went  out to them. It was not necessary.  We

said that it was the responsibility and the duty  of

the Government to do what it could to provide relief

for  the victims. The Prime Minister, in a statement

only a day or two after the fire, was very wise when

he  said  that  that  was  a  matter  on  which  all

organisations or political parties must be united to

provide relief. He quite rightly took the line  that

this  was  a  matter  of  national  importance   and

everyone  must  come  forward  to  do  his  part  to

ameliorate  the sufferings of the victims.  I  would

like  to say. Sir, that the Government has done  all

that  it  possibly  can to provide  relief.  But  it

cannot be gainsaid that improvements could have been

made.  And if improvements were suggested by Members

of  the  Opposition, it should not be taken to  mean

that the Opposition is making political capital  out

of this fire disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one point which I would like to

bring  out  and  which  the  Minister  for  National

Development in his speech has not touched upon. That

is  the  question of allowing the residents, or  the

fire victims, to go back to live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



in  the  same area when new houses are built by  the

Housing and Development Board on the land that is to

be acquired by Government for this building project.

These  people should be given an opportunity  to  go

back  and  live  in the area where  they  have  been

residents  for  many many years,  or  where  a  good

number of them have been born there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have suggested that that paragraph of the

motion  relating  to  the  Bill  which  is   to   be

introduced by the Prime Minister should be left out,

and  I  will  therefore not touch on that particular

angle.  But I would like to end by saying  again - let

us  all work together in this national calamity. Let

us also see to it that such future calamities do not

take place.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I rise to add to what  has  been

said  by  my  colleague, the Minister  for  National

Development, and to express my profound sympathy for

the victims of the disastrous fire at Bukit Ho Swee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was at the scene in Beo Lane and Havelock

Road  minutes after the fire was reported.  Together

with  the  civic-minded public and  the  police,  we

managed to persuade the victims to evacuate from the

area.  It  was  indeed a sorry sight to  see

panic-stricken  victims making strenuous efforts  to  save

whatever properties they could, but all to no avail.

The victims just managed to escape with their lives,

empty-handed. The Government, therefore,  will  take

and  are  taking  steps  to  render  every  possible

assistance  to  rehouse  and rehabilitate  the  fire

victims as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This disastrous fire, which is the biggest in the

history  of Singapore since the war, started  at  an

attap-hut in Tiong Bahru near the King's Cinema.  It

spread with such rapidity over such a wide area  and

was  of  such  a  magnitude that it needed  all  the

available resources of the police, the Fire  Brigade

and   the   Military  to  fight  and   contain   the

conflagration. At the height of the fire, there were

16 fire-engines from the Singapore Fire Brigade, one

fire-engine from the Royal Air Force,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



four  fire-engines from the Army Fire  Service,  one

fire-engine  from the Singapore Harbour  Board  Fire

Service,  and  two lorries from the  Auxiliary  Fire

Service.  All  these were manned by 20 officers  and

181 N.C.O.s and men from the Singapore Fire Brigade,

four  officers  and  113 men  from  the  other  fire

services, and four officers and 34 N.C.O.s from  the

Auxiliary   Fire  Service.  These  were  placed   at

strategic  positions  in the fire-affected  area  to

fight  and contain the fire. The fire-fighting  unit

did  not  spare themselves. They made  a  tremendous

effort  to  contain  the fire and  prevent  it  from

spreading.  It was unfortunate, however, that  their

effort at the time was handicapped by a strong  wind

which   caused  the  fire  to  increase  and  spread

rapidly. They were also hampered in their operations

by  the presence of large crowds trying to help them

in   fighting   the  fire.  While   these   people's

intentions  were  well  meant and  their  enthusiasm

appreciated,  nevertheless, the work  of  the

fire-fighting  unit  was,  in  the circumstances,  rather

impeded and retarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the low water pressure has been

raised  just  now. Information from the  Chief  Fire

Officer  was that at the beginning of the  fire,  it

was  reported that the water pressure  was  low.  At 3.30  p.m., however,

contact was made with the Water

Engineer,  and as a result of closing all the  mains

in  other  areas, the water pressure was  increased.

However, as several hydrants were connected  to  the

same  main,  this  factor was also  responsible  for

lowering the water pressure. The Chief Fire  Officer

also  stated  that the main problem of fighting  the

fire  in the Bukit Ho Swee area was not so much  the

low  water pressure as the fact that there  were  no

actual access roads to the houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the fire-fighting units

were  carrying on with their great task, the police,

who  were also on the scene a few minutes after  the

fire  broke  out,  began  to  throw  more  and  more

reinforcements  into the area as the  fire  grew  in

intensity  and  size, in order to control  the  huge

crowds  who were converging into the area, to assist

in controlling the traffic which had swelled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



to  huge  proportions, to evacuate the fire victims,

and  to  prevent looting from taking  place  in  the

area.  By  about 6.00 p.m., the police, assisted  by

Army units, had already succeeded in controlling the

crowds   and  laying  down  road  blocks,  diverting

traffic and throwing a cordon round the entire  fire

area. This cordon, which was completed by about 8.00

p.m. on  the  night  of the fire,  is  still  being

maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the fire, 141 officers and 1,205 men

were  on  duty  in the fire area. All available  men

from  the  C.I.D. were also sent to  the  scene  to

facilitate  interpretation  work,  assist  in  crowd

control,  and  check on looting.  Additional  police

were  sent  to  the Kim Seng Road School  and  other

relief  centres to aid the reception teams. A mobile

police station has been set up at the Kim Seng  Road

School  centre  since  26th May,  1961,  to  receive

reports  of loss of identity cards, etc.  From  26th

May   onwards  police  search  parties   have   been

organised  to  assist fire victims to salvage  their

valuables  from the fire site. Since 27th  May,  the

number of police personnel engaged on the fire  site

has  been  gradually  reduced,  and  the  number  of

officers and men still deployed in the area is about

400.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the police has been greatly assisted

by  the Singapore Military Forces who were first out

in  the  area on the night of the fire, and who  are

there  until today. They have helped the  police  to

establish  a  cordon  round  the  devastated   area,

assisting   and   maintaining   road   blocks,   and

preventing  looting in the area. The  whole  of  the

First  Battalion of the Singapore Infantry  Regiment

and  the  majority of the regular  soldiers  of  the

other  units of the S.M.F. have taken part  in  this

day-and-night task under their Commanding Officer. A

total  of 35 officers and 600 other ranks have  been

on  duty  on the site up to now. 25 S.M.F. military

vehicles were used in this operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual cause of the fire is not yet known. But

the  police  are  strenously continuing  with  their

efforts  to  ascertain the cause.  The  question  of

arson  cannot be ruled out, and the police are  also

investigating that line.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of

expressing   my   heartfelt   thanks   and   sincere

appreciation   to  the  fire-fighting   units,   the

Singapore  Police  Force,  the  Singapore   Military

Forces, the Army units and all volunteer workers for

the great part they have played and the devotion  to

duty they have shown in this disaster. Without their

great  efforts, this disaster would have been  worse

and the tragedy could have been greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

police  have set up a mobile station to  record  the

loss  of  identity cards and other matters.  If  the

fire  had  not  coincided with the  removal  of  the

Registry of Births and Deaths to a new block in  the

Ministry  building,  and the re-arrangement  of  the

Citizenship  Registry with the  expanded  space  now

available, a mobile registration team from these two

Registries  would have been sent  to  the  Kim  Seng

School  by now. Nevertheless, steps have been  taken

and  it is expected that within the next day or  two

there  will  be a team from these two Registries  at

the  relief  centres to record loss  of  citizenship

certificates and birth and death certificates.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in full support of

the  motion  under  the name of  my  colleague,  the

Minister for National Development, in his expression

of  deepest sympathy for the 16,000 victims  of  the

catastrophic fire at Bukit Ho Swee which occurred  a

week ago. This is another instance of the sad legacy

of  the  past which we have painfully to  bear  and,

therefore,  it is vitally necessary for  us  as  the

Government  to ensure that the massive programme  of

low-cost  housing  under our  Four-Year  Development

Plan  must  come to early fruition so that congested

attap  houses  will gradually become things  of  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to be associated with the motion in

which the House is asked to express its gratitude to

all  those  who  have  helped to  combat  the  fire,

maintain  order and give succour to the  victims  in

one way or another. In this respect, I wish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



particularly   to   place  on  record   my   deepest

appreciation  of  and gratitude to all  my  Ministry

officials,   Inspectorate,   principals,   teachers,

messengers,  school  servants,  watchmen,   tuckshop

vendors  and  students of the following ten  schools

for  their  public-spiritedness in giving  help  and

assistance as and when the need arose, and  for  the

many  hours of toil without rest until late at night

in  order to help and lighten the sufferings of  our

people.  Unfortunately the Kai  Kok  School  in  Beo

Lane,  off Havelock Road, a Government-aided Chinese

primary   school,   was  burnt   down   during   the

conflagration. Four Government primary schools  were

used  as  relief centres for one night only, namely,

Delta   East,  Havelock,  Tiong  Bahru-all   English

primary schools - and Seng Poh Chinese Primary School.

Another five Government schools-four primary and one

secondary - are  still being used as centres  for  the

fire  victims, namely, Kim Seng East English School,

Kim    Seng    West,   which   is   an    integrated

Chinese/English   Primary   School,   River   Valley

(Chinese),  River Valley (English),  and  the  River

Valley Secondary School (Chinese).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the evacuation of the refugees from the

above five schools, it has been necessary to suspend

the schooling of more than 7,000 pupils for the time

being  - 5,800  primary  pupils,  including  the  800

pupils of Kai Kok School, and 1,200 secondary school

pupils. Ministry officials, together with principals

and  teachers  of  the  affected  schools,  are  now

actively studying the problem of how best to restart

classes  urgently for 2,000 pupils who are attending

Primary  VI, Secondary IV, Senior Middle II and  III

who  have to take either the Primary School  Leaving

Examination or the Secondary IV or the Senior Middle

III  Examinations  at the end of this  year.  It  is

hoped  to make an early announcement to this  effect

as  soon  as  practical measures  can  be  put  into

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to ameliorate the hardship of the fire

victims,  my  Ministry has decided that  all  school

pupils  whose homes have been affected by the  Bukit

Ho   Swee  fire  will  have  all  their  school  and

miscellaneous fees remitted for seven months, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



effect from 1st June to 31st December this year.  In

addition,  they  will  be given  a  free  supply  of

exercise books until the end of this year and a free

loan  of all textbooks, so that their education will

not  be  affected  by  the unfortunate  catastrophic

fire. Principals of all schools are being instructed

to  make the necessary investigations and to proceed

with the above relief measures.

this  is a national matter, as has been stressed  by

Singapore,   although  we  are  not  a   very   rich

organisation, we have nevertheless given a  donation

of  $1,000,  and  one  of  our  members  is  in  the

organisation which has been set up to attend to  the

relief  of  the victims of the fire. As a Member  of

this Assembly, I do not rely solely on what has been

said  in  the  Straits Times, because  the  question

before the House is a national one. We too share the

feelings  of the Government. With the implementation

of  all  the  plans  before us,  we  hope  that  the

sufferings  of  the  victims of the  fire  could  be

ameliorated.  I  too appeal to the  public  to  give

generously   to   this   cause,   which   is    very

praiseworthy.

Mr  Speaker, I rise to support the motion moved  by

my colleague, the Minister for National Development,

and  also to record my deepest sympathy to  all  the

fire victims in the Bukit Ho Swee fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on the work of my Ministry which has been raised by the Member for

Hong  Lim  in the course of his speech just  now.  I

would  like to give a complete picture of  the  work

done  by  the  officials of my Ministry  as  far  as

possible  to keep control, from the health point  of

view.  The  protection  of  public  health  and  the

provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



essential health and medical care facilities to  the

fire  victims  are  basic  essentials  in  such   an

emergency.  Officials of the Ministry  were  at  the

fire site early, and after receiving a report of the

number  of persons involved, the following  measures

were taken and instituted immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Hospital Emergency Casualty Service and

Hospital  Ambulance operated on the  fire  site  and

rendered  attention  to  all victims.  An  emergency

Casualty  Section  and  an Outpatients  Clinic  were

established  at  Kim  Seng Road School  within  four

hours, and by the time the fire victims arrived they

were  ready to deal with them. Over 350 persons were

seen to during the first night. Over 2,500 have been

seen  to at this clinic and at the second clinic  in

River Valley School. Both these clinics provide

a 24-hour  medical cover for all the victims. A milk room

for infants and children was established at the same

time, and a 24-hour milk supply with sterile feeding

bottles  and  other essential infant  and  maternity

requisites  are now in operation on a 24-hour  basis

at  two  places - Kim  Seng School  and  River  Valley

School.  The  Maternity  and Child  Welfare  Service

provided a home visiting, baby bathing and maternity

and  child  health service to all the  children  and

mothers.  Urgent additional sanitary  accommodation,

bathing  facilities  and standpipes  were  arranged.

Proper facilities for refuse removal and for cooking

were  ensured.  Daily cleaning and sweeping  of  the

grounds  have been laid on. Special health measures,

such  as  spraying of disinfectant and  insecticide,

syringe  fogging and other mosquito and fly  control

measures, have been put in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim also raised the question of

the  very  limited  number of medical  officers  and

staff available at the refugee camp in Kim Seng Road

as  well  as  River Valley School. I would  like  to

mention  here, Mr Speaker, that medical and  health

officers,   public   health   inspectors,    nursing

personnel, midwives, medical auxiliaries,  including

St. John's, the Red Cross and the Hospital Reserves,

health  labourers and other health staff  have  been

fully engaged in this work. Over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



120 persons are engaged in the provision of services

at the centres. At the fire site itself, the work of

carrying carcases, clearing obstructions and  taking

steps  to prevent health nuisances by spreading  and

cleansing   operations   have   been   carried   out

vigorously. Teams of health workers are  engaged  in

the work here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I am informed that the

health  conditions are firmly under control  because

of  the  effective measures taken. I have also  been

advised, however, that the situation there  is  such

that  in  schools  intended for 3,000  pupils,  over

8,000 persons are living in what may be described as

standing  room.  The  danger from  such  overcrowing

resulting  in an outbreak of epidemics,  of

gastro-intestinal or respiratory disease is very  real.  My

officials  are doing their very best to contain  the

situation,  but feel that unless the  population  is

reduced  and  the overcrowding lessened,  a  serious

health  danger will exist, very definitely  after  a

lapse  of not more than 12 days. This is the  advice

given  to me, Mr Speaker, from the expert point  of

view.  However,  I  have had a  discussion  with  my

colleague, the Minister for National Development. He

has already mentioned earlier in his speech that  he

is trying his best to rehouse these fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to thank the officials

of  the  Health Ministry who have taken part in  the

recent fire at Bukit Ho Swee and their prompt action

about half an hour after the fire broke out at  that

particular place.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the

motion  which  was introduced in this  House  by  my

friend  and  colleague,  the Minister  for  National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately on receipt of the news of the

Bukit  Ho Swee fire, the Director of Social  Welfare

contacted  key  members of his staff and  instructed

them to proceed to the scene of the fire.

The Delta-Ganges Community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



Centre  was opened as a temporary relief centre  for

the  reception of the fire victims. In the meantime,

more  members of the Social Welfare Department  were

contacted.  They  arrived later at  the  scene.  The

staff  of the People's Association was mobilised  at

the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 4 p.m., five schools and a school theatre

in the Kim Seng Road and River Valley Road area were

requisitioned for use as an emergency relief  centre

in view of the size of the fire. At about 4.30 p.m.,

the  Kim Seng Road and the River Valley Road Schools

emergency relief centre was established, and  manned

by  officers of the Department of Social Welfare and

members  of the People's Association. While  at  the

same  time, the Army was contacted to supply lorries

to  transport the fire victims from the Delta-Ganges

Community Centre and other reception points  in  the

Havelock   Road  and  Delta-Ganges  area   to   this

emergency relief centre. In the meantime,  Sir,  the

Department  of Social Welfare and Prisons Department

jointly  had food and drinks prepared for  the  fire

victims. The health services, the British Red  Cross

and  St.  John  Ambulance moved into this  emergency

relief  centre at about 6 p.m. the same evening.  At

the  request of the Director of Social Welfare,  the

Army  supplied  on  loan  to this  emergency  relief

centre  8,000  blankets  and 6,000  mattresses.  Two

temporary  relief centres were opened for the  night

at  the  Seng Poh Road School and Tiong Bahru School

for the accommodation of fire victims from the Tiong

Bahru   area.   About   1,000  fire   victims   were

accommodated in these two temporary centres  on  the

night  of the 25th of May. In the Kim Seng Road  and

River  Valley Road Schools emergency relief  centre,

about  2,300 victims were accommodated on  the  same

night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morning, the fire victims from the Seng Poh

Road  and Tiong Bahru Schools were moved to the  Kim

Seng  and  River  Valley  Schools  emergency  relief

centre.  A  steady flow of fire victims  moved  into

this  emergency relief centre from Friday, the  26th

of May. By Monday, the 29th of May, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



ascertained  that  there  were  8,200   persons   in

residence  at  this emergency relief centre.  As  at

midday today, I am informed, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

that number has increased to 8,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delta-Ganges Community Centre in Havelock Road

was  kept  open for the registration and  relief  of

fire victims who chose to live out with friends  and

relatives. The Work Brigade, Sir, was brought in  to

help  on  Friday,  the 26th of  May.  I  was  rather

surprised  that the Member for Farrer Park mentioned

that  the  Work Brigade was brought in to fight  the

fire.  That is not part of their duties at all,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Army supplied food on the first day, as the

Social Welfare Department had not by then been  able

to  establish a central kitchen for the  feeding  of

all  the  fire  victims  at  this  emergency  relief

centre.  Arrangements were also  completed  for  the

Singapore Harbour Board to establish a supplementary

food  service  for  the central kitchen.  The  Board

kindly  undertook to supply cooked rice as and  when

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, the 26th of May, the Gas Department

undertook  the installation of gas burners  for  the

central    kitchen.   Mobile   latrines,   temporary

bathrooms  and  standpipes  to  increase  the  water

supply  were laid down the same day. A milk  feeding

unit was set up as from the evening of Thursday, the

26th  of  May, and it has provided an efficient  and

reliable  infant  welfare service at  the  emergency

relief centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the cramp conditions in the three

Kim   Seng  Road  schools,  fire  victims  who  were

accommodated in the corridors of these  schools,  or

in  covered ways linking these schools, for lack  of

suitable accommodation elsewhere in these buildings,

were  moved to 20 military tents which were  put  up

opposite these buildings on Monday, the 29th of May.

These  tents  have  been provided  with  double-tier

wooden  bunks  from the Work Brigade. And  in  these

tents  some  600  fire victims  are  now  living  to

relieve the congestion in the Kim Seng Road schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Brigade and the Blue Cross Society took

over  the  servicing and operation  of  the  central

kitchen as from Monday, the 29th of May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim earlier

on  drew  the  attention of the House to  complaints

which   he  had  received  from  the  fire  victims,

alleging that there were inadequacies with regard to

the  feeding  arrangements and the accommodation  in

the  relief  centre. He said that his attention  had

been  drawn  to the fact that the food  distribution

points  were inadequate and that there were  central

points  serving  as many as 3,000 persons.  He  also

mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it took one to two

hours for the fire victims to queue up for food. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the fire victims are accommodated  in

six  buildings in the Kim Seng Road and River Valley

Road  areas.  As  I have mentioned earlier  on,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  8,500  fire  victims  in

residence in these six buildings. That works out  to

1,500  for  each  of the schools and  an  additional

1,000  for  the  theatre  which  serves  these  five

schools. So that, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are  today

six distribution points serving these six buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim also

said  that the fire victims have to queue up for  as

much  as  one to two hours for their food, and  that

they  do not get vegetables and rice at the  end  of

the  queue.  Mr Speaker, Sir, there are three  meal

periods  for  all those who are now accommodated  in

this relief centre. The first meal period is in  the

mornings,  when  coffee,  bread  and  biscuits   are

supplied;  and  those  in  this  relief  centre  are

allowed to take as much coffee and biscuits as  they

want.  In fact, yesterday when I visited the  relief

centre,  I was told by the superintendent in  charge

that  that morning 1,000 gallons of coffee had  been

supplied to the residents of the relief centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second meal period is

between  12 noon and 2 p.m. It is true, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that the inmates of this relief centre were not

very satisfied with the mutton that was supplied  by

the  Military on the first day. But since then,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  ample supplies of rice  cooked  with

chicken, duck and pork have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



been  supplied to the inmates of this relief centre.

The  mid-day meal hours are between 12  noon  and  2

p.m., and the evening meal is supplied between  5.00

and 7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim also

said  that the rice and vegetables were not properly

cooked.  It  was  complained that a snake  had  been

found  in  the vegetables and that the rice  was  of

poor  quality and generally unsuitable. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  cooks  employed to  cook  the  meals  are

qualified  cooks  from the Blue Cross  Society,  and

they  are  used to mass cooking. There is plenty  of

water  and  plenty of manpower to  clean  the  rice,

vegetables  and  the  meat  which  are  served.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  some of the rice cooked  is  donated

rice.  We  cannot refuse this rice, because  of  its

quality, without causing considerable offence.  Much

of  the rice is also cooked by the Singapore Harbour

Board from its own kitchens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is for the Muslims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, not only for the Muslims but also

for  the  rest of the inmates of the relief  centre.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim also said

that  as accommodation was short, we should increase

the  number  of  tents  and marquees.  It  has  been

decided  that  Government should  take  very  prompt

measures  to ensure that the residents of this  camp

are  moved out as soon as possible, and there  would

be  no  point. Mr Speaker, Sir, for us to  increase

the number of tents and marquees now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim also suggested that it

would  be  useful for Government to  look  into  the

question  of setting up teams to tour the  town  and

residential  areas to collect furniture and  cooking

utensils  for the victims of this fire. Mr Speaker.

Sir,  that  is a responsibility which the Government

cannot accept. However, I shall pass this on to  the

voluntary  bodies to see if they are  interested  in

this sort of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the St. John's Ambulance, the

Red Cross and the Government nursing service are now

functioning under the control of medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



officers  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.   All   the

buildings  in  this  emergency  relief  centre  were

fumigated  yesterday.  The  health  authorities  are

anxious, because of the cramped conditions  and  the

large  number  of fire victims in residence  at  the

centre,  that  arrangements should be made  for  the

early removal of an appreciable number of those  now

in  residence  to the new Housing Board  estates  to

relieve  the congestion and to minimise the risk  of

an outbreak of an epidemic amongst the inmates. With

the  assistance  of the Military, transport  can  be

laid on at a moment's notice to remove large numbers

of  the  residents and their families to new housing

estates  as  soon  as  they  have  decided  on   the

localities to which they wish to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration of the fire victims at the emergency

relief centre commenced on Friday, the 26th of  May.

Registration  of  all  fire  victims  both  in   the

emergency relief centre and the Delta-Ganges  Centre

was  completed on Tuesday, the 30th of May. A  total

of  2,833 families consisting of 15,694 persons have

been registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to describe the relief which

has  been  planned  for  these  fire  victims.  Rent

subsidies  will  be  paid  to  all  registered  fire

victims  who  are  accommodated  in  Housing   Board

estates  on  the basis of $7 per person  per  month,

subject to a maximum of $35 per family of up to five

persons per month for a period of three months. If a

family exceeds five persons, no subsidy will be paid

for any person in excess of that number. But where a

family consists of less than five persons, the  rent

subsidy will be paid at the maximum rate of $35  per

month.  Where the rental of the Housing Board  flats

to which the family moves exceeds $35 per month, the

excess rent will not be subsidised and will have  to

be  borne by the tenant. This rent subsidy has  been

worked out on the basis of the lowest rental payable

for  present Housing Board accommodation,  that  is,

$35  per flat per month divided by a family unit  of

five  persons. The registration for relief disclosed

that a total number of 15,694 people registered  for

relief. There were 2,833 families and this was  held

roughly to be a family unit of five persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered, Sir, that the rent subsidy worked

out  on this basis will be of great help in enabling

a  family to get on its feet again if the subsidy is

paid  for a period of three months. Those registered

fire  victims  who are not accommodated  in  Housing

Board  estates will receive cash grants in  lieu  of

rent  subsidies on the same basis of $35  per  month

per family, irrespective of the number of persons in

the family, and for the same period of three months.

To  ease  the  lot  of  fire  victims  who  find  it

difficult  to  pay  a rental of more  than  $35  per

month,  they  will be allowed to share accommodation

with  other  registered  fire  victims  in  the  new

accommodation  offered by the Board, or  with  their

friends  and relatives in the Board's older estates.

By  relaxing  the  prohibition against  sharing  the

Board's  accommodation,  the  pool  of  the  Board's

available   accommodation   will   be   considerably

increased, and this will assist the fire victims  to

get the accommodation they require sooner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of these subsidies, Sir, a sum of

$100,000 a month will be required, and for a  period

of  three months the estimated subsidy required will

be in the region of $300,000. Besides rent subsidies

and  cash  grants  in  lieu of rent  subsidies,  the

registered   fire  victims  will   also   be   given

rehabilitation grants to assist them  to  buy  food,

clothing  and  furniture for their new homes.  Every

registered  fire victim has already been  paid  $10,

and this has involved an expenditure of $156,940. In

the  next  few days it is proposed to  pay  all  the

registered fire victims another instalment of $20 to

each adult and young person over the age of 16,  and

$10 to each child under the age of 16 years. Out of

a  total  number of 15,694 registered fire  victims,

7,816  are adults or young persons over the  age  of

16,  and 7,878 are children under the age of 16. The

payments  of  this  second  instalment  by  way   of

rehabilitation   grants   will   involve   a   total

expenditure of $235,100. The rent subsidy, amounting

to  a total of $105 per family, and a cash grant, in

lieu of rent subsidy, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



estimated to cost $300,000. The first instalment  of

rehabilitation grant at the rate of $10 per  person,

which  has  already  been  paid,  has  amounted   to

$156,940.  The  second instalment of  rehabilitation

grant  will  cost  $235,100,  as  I  have  mentioned

before.  The  total  of the rent  subsidy  and  cash

payments  in lieu of rent subsidy and the first  two

instalments of rehabilitation grant is estimated  to

involve an expenditure of $692,040.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the initiative of the Government, the

Bukit  Ho  Swee Fire National Relief Fund  Committee

was  set up last Saturday and the Bukit Ho Swee Fire

National  Relief  Fund  was  established.  Its  main

object  is  to  raise  funds  for  the  relief   and

rehabilitation  of the fire victims  on  a  national

basis.  In  view  of the size of the  fire  and  the

number  of victims involved, this work could not  be

left to the Council of Social Services, which is the

organisation in which all voluntary bodies concerned

with social and welfare work are represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the House to have a clear appreciation

of  the damage caused by this fire and the amount of

funds  which will be required for the rehabilitation

of  the  Bukit  Ho Swee Fire victims,  I  shall  now

proceed  to  give a few details of two  fires  which

took  place  in  Singapore in recent years  and  the

amount   of  Government,  City  Council  and  public

donations  which were received in respect  of  those

two fires. These figures do not include the value of

contributions in kind that were received in  respect

of each of these fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Kampong Koo Chye fire which broke out in

Lorong  3 on 5th April, 1958. The number of  persons

who  were rendered homeless In that fire were 2,050,

and   the  number  of  families  who  were  rendered

homeless  were 379. The City Council gave a donation

of  $100,000.  The Government gave a donation  which

included a rent subsidy of $114,137.50, and a sum of

$356,000 was obtained by public donations. The total

sum  received  from all sources  in  that  fire  was

approximately $570,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire which broke

out  on  13th February, 1959. The number of persons

rendered homeless in that fire was 5,220. The number

of  families  rendered homeless  in  that  fire  was

1,016. The City Council gave a donation of $100,000.

There  were  public donations received of  $756,200,

and  the  total contributions from all  sources  for

that  fire  approximated $856,200.  In  this  second

fire, Sir, Government gave an interest-free loan  of

$4,800,000 to the S.I.T. for the building of  a  new

housing estate on the fire site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the details that I have just given of the two

previous  fires, Members of the House will certainly

see that the number of persons and families rendered

homeless  in  the Bukit Ho Swee fire is three  times

more  than the number of those rendered homeless  in

the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire in 1959, and as much as

seven time more than those rendered homeless by  the

Kampong  Koo  Chye  fire in 1958. This  information,

Sir,  will  serve  to show that, by comparison,  the

Bukit  Ho  Swee  fire is the biggest fire  that  has

occurred  in recent years, and that the  relief  and

rehabilitation of the victims of this fire will call

for  an  effort  in the raising of funds  by  public

contribution which will surpass anything  which  has

been  undertaken  before. This will  also  call  for

energetic  action on the part of the Bukit  Ho  Swee

Fire National Relief Committee to raise a large  sum

of money for this very worthy cause, and also for  a

generous response from the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government announced on Saturday, the 27th of May,

that  it  has  voted  a  sum of  $250,000  from  the

Contingencies Fund for the relief and rehabilitation

of the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims. Up to the time  I

am  speaking this afternoon, a total of $520,000 has

been   received  by  way  of  donations   from   the

Government and from foreign governments, as well  as

by  way of contributions from the public. The amount

and  scale of relief, Sir, which we will be able  to

afford  to pay to the victims of the Bukit  Ho  Swee

fire  will  there  fore have to depend  to  a  large

extent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



on the amount of contributions which the Relief Fund

Committee  will receive from the general  public.  I

take this opportunity now of appealing again to  the

public  to  contribute generously to this  Fund.  In

addition  to  the  cash donations, which  have  been

received,  contributions in kind in  a  steady  flow

have  been  received at the emergency relief  centre

from  the  public. The clothing has been removed  to

the  People's Association Headquarters where  it  is

being   made   up   into   bundles   for   equitable

distribution to registered fire victims. The  canned

food received will also be distributed equitably  to

the registered fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the fire victims who have lost

their  occupations because of the fire,  they  will,

after  receiving assistance which I  have  mentioned

before, be put on public assistance until such  time

as they are able to get other employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Fire Insurance Association of Malaya

has  been  approached for an estimate of the  number

and value of policies and the amount of claims which

fire insurance companies will be required to meet as

a   result  of  the  fire.  This  will  give  us  an

indication of the extent to which the losses of  the

fire  victims  have been mitigated by  monies  which

they will receive from the fire insurance policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, to conclude what I have said

by  thanking  all  the individuals  and  members  of

charitable bodies and welfare organisations who have

given  their  services unstintingly to mitigate  the

hardships  experienced by the victims  of  the  fire

ever since the evening of 25th May.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the

first  national disaster on such a scale for many  a

long year. On behalf of the Government, I would like

to  say  how gratified we were at the response  from

all  the people - response in sympathy, material help,

and  personal  service. I hope it will be  sustained

long  enough for material and substantial  donations

to be made to the Bukit Ho Swee Fire National Relief

Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



But I would like, in particular, to mention that  in

future  the public can help by curbing their natural

instincts of curiosity. I do not think the thousands

who  flocked to the area to see the fire, whilst  it

was  in progress, understood that by blocking up all

the  roads leading to the area they were,  in  fact,

doing  a disservice to the people who were about  to

he  victims of the fire. It meant slower movement of

the  fire brigades and slower movement of the police

to  help in crowd control. It might well be that had

there  not  been  the same traffic congestion,  some

parts  of  the  damage  might have  been  prevented.

However,  the general consensus of opinion was  that

the  wind was so strong on that day that, given  the

best of goodwill, the best of fire services, and the

strongest of water pressure, the damage to the

attap-huts was inevitable. But I would make this appeal to

the   people  of  Singapore - that  in  another   such

catastrophe,  if ever we are unfortunate  enough  to

have  another one, it is the duty of the  people  to

help, if by nothing else, by keeping out of the  way

of those whose business it is to fight fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to add a word of admonition

against  those  who, out of zealousness,  wanted  to

help  in  directing the fire hoses. We  welcome  the

great  spirit of mutual help and co-operation  in  a

common  disaster. People voluntarily helped to  move

fire hoses and helped the firemen. But I think it is

important that the people should understand that the

person who knows where best to put the water is  the

fireman,  because he has been trained for that  job.

And   to  help  the  firemen  to  direct  the  water

somewhere  other  than where the firemen  wanted  to

direct  it is, in fact, very dangerous business  and

may  well  do a disservice to the people  whom  they

wanted to help. However, this is a matter which I am

told  has  happened again and again in the past.  We

hope  that  with  more and constant  explanation  we

might  get  not only zealous help but also effective

help.  By all means, help the firemen move the hose,

but  let  us leave them to decide where to  put  it.

However, everything said and done. I think we can be

proud of the magnificent way in which all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



people  responded,  both during  the  emergency  and

immediately after that in the relief area to  assist

fellow   citizens  who  had  unexpectedly   suffered

grievous loss.



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tan Kia Gan, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, it is indeed most gratifying

to  hear  the  Opposition Benches complimenting  the

Government on their assistance and all that it could

do during the last few days to help the fire victims

of  Bukit  Ho Swee. However, there were  "buts"  and

"suggestions".    Some   of   these    "buts"    and

"suggestions" have been answered by my colleagues. I

would  now  like to take some of the  time  of  this

House   to   point  out  where  these   "buts"   and

"suggestions" are wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to touch on what the

Member  for Hong Lim has mentioned in regard to

re-housing,  whether the victims can afford the  rents,

and  other matters that were brought up by  him.  He

has  suggested  that  we  should  put  up  temporary

structures or allow vacant Government quarters to be

occupied by the victims. I believe that was intended

for  some  purpose, and I would like  to  tell  this

House that the Government has already done all  that

it  can  to  rehouse the victims. We have  mentioned

that  all  the  vacant  flats which  have  not  been

allotted  to  the Housing Board applicants  will  be

made  available  for  the fire victims.  Regulations

controlling  the  sharing of  these  flats,  or  the

sharing  of  flats which are occupied by tenants  in

the present housing estates, will be relaxed so that

as  many  as possible of these fire victims will  be

rehoused and resettled, and other assistance will be

given  to them to put them on their feet again.  But

the  Member  for Hong Lim has suggested  that  other

measures  should  be  done.  Other  Members  of  the

Opposition   have   already   mentioned   that   the

Government is doing all it can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of no free rental period, the

Member  for Hong Lim has doubts in his mind  whether

these victims could afford these rents. I would like

to  mention the rental policy of the Housing  Board.

It all derives from the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



in the past the S.I.T. had no policy of fixing rents

for  these estates. As a result of that, in  respect

of  more  than  22,000 units in  the  Housing  Board

estates under the previous management of the S.I.T.,

they  had altogether about 100 categories of  rents,

ranging  from $9.65 to $105 per unit. You  can  find

that  in  some estates the same type of flats  carry

different rents. For instance, in Queenstown,

three-room  units were rented, some at $42 per unit,  some

at  $55, and others at $89. It St. Michael's Estate,

the  same  thing  happened; and in the  Tiong  Bahru

Estate  the rents were still more varied. Three-room

flats  were  rented out at $38.50;  $40.70;  $48.80;

$57.20;  $60.70; $66.00; $69.30; $75.00; $79.20  and

$89.10.  Looking at these rents, Sir, it  is  really

difficult to determine how the rates were fixed. The

Housing  and Development Board, however, has decided

that rents should reflect the size of the units, the

amenities   provided,  as  well  as  the   cost   of

construction,  maintenance  and  management.   Rents

which  include  all these elements  are  defined  as

economic  rents. I would like to mention here,  Sir,

that  the  Housing  Board  is  not  a  profit-making

organisation.  Its job is to build  houses  of  good

material  and good construction at the  lowest  cost

possible. It is the intention of the Board to  build

one-room  units to be let out at $20 a  month;

two-room  units to be let out at $40 a month; and

three-room  units to be let out at $60 a month. But I must

point  out  here,  Sir, that  the  units  which  are

available for the fire victims today are units which

were  planned  and  partially built  by  the  former

S.I.T.,  and  completed in the time of  the  Housing

Board. Obviously the rents of these houses will  not

be in the category that I have mentioned, that is, a

one-room unit for $20; a two-room unit for $40,  and

a three-room unit for $60.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim asked whether units were

available for the fire victims the rentals of  which

would  be  within  their reach.  He  mentioned  that

construction costs were low. I must point out,  Sir,

that the construction costs of these units which are

available  now have not been low. So the rents  will

not be low. But the Government has already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



taken  into  consideration  what  subsidy  could  be

worked out to relieve these fire victims. As I  have

mentioned  before, a subsidy in the form of  $7  per

person  up to a maximum of $35 per family  would  be

given  to  families who want Board accommodation  or

who  prefer accommodation of their own. In this way,

Sir,  we have worked out how these victims could  be

relieved as far as rental is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has also mentioned that

the rent subsidy proposed is below that given to the

previous fire victims. Sir, I have already said, and

I  repeat, that the Government will see to  it  that

the  fire victims are given all necessary assistance

in the matter of rehousing. The Government, however,

considers that, in fairness to the taxpayers who are

actually  footing the bill, it could not go  to  the

extent  of  giving rent-free accommodation,  as  was

done  by  the  previous  Government;  nor  does  the

Government consider that it will be right to let out

public  housing units to the fire victims  at

long-term  highly subsidised rentals. Both these measures

will  no  doubt  appeal  considerably  to  the  fire

victims  as  very  generous  concessions,  but   the

Government  does not feel that it ought to  buy  the

favour  of  a  certain section of the population  by

expending   public  funds  in  this   ill-considered

manner.  There is, furthermore, a further  objection

to  such  measures in that they lead to  an  unequal

treatment  of  the  fire victims  themselves.  Those

victims  who  declined the offer of  public  housing

units    and    preferred   to   find   their    own

accommodation-and there are many victims of both the

Kampong Koo Chye and Tiong Bahru fires who belong to

this  category-found  to their  disappointment  that

they got much less in the way of benefits than those

who accepted accommodation in public housing units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's plan to rehabilitate the

fire  victims is based on principles of  equity  and

good  public finance. Those victims who wish  to  be

rehoused in the Board's flats will be given  special

priority  over the normal applicants on the  Board's

register.  But  they  will be required  to  pay  the

normal   rentals   charged  for  the   accommodation

offered. To help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



them,  I  have already mentioned the rental  subsidy

for a period of three months. The decision to charge

normal  rentals cannot be said to be  unfair,  since

victims of small fires in other minor calamities who

were  given  accommodation in public  housing  units

were  charged  these rentals. The  circumstances  in

these casual cases of disaster are exactly the  same

and, therefore, the same treatment should be  applied

all round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one very strange thing has cropped up from

the strange mind of the Member for Hong Lim. We have

heard  time and again that he is concerned with  the

welfare  of the poor people - and all fire victims  in

Bukit Ho Swee are poor people. But among these  poor

people there is a group of people who own shops. The

Member  for  Hong Lim has specially brought  up  the

point  that the Government should consider  building

shops  and  rent  them out at low rentals  to  these

people.  We  know  that  shopkeepers  are  not  poor

people.  But  the Member for Hong  Lim  has  made  a

special  appeal for them. I would like  to  make  it

known  to this House that the Government will  treat

all   fire  victims  as  fire  victims.  No  special

consideration will be given to the shopkeepers,  but

shops  will  be  built in this area and  shopkeepers

from this area who are fire victims will be given  a

priority on such shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park mentioned the Work

Brigade  and also the Civil Defence Corps.  I  would

like to point out to the Member that it is known  to

all  people  that the crowds who went to watch  this

fire had hampered the work of the Fire Brigade,  the

police and the Army. Obviously, this Government does

not  intend to send any corps of men there to hamper

the progress of the work of the Fire Brigade and the

people who were controlling the crowds in this area.

For the information of this Member, I would like  to

mention  that the Work Brigade was not sent  to  the

fire site during the fire. It was sent to this place

only  after  the fire had died down, to  do  all  it

could  to  assist the fire victims  in  cooking  and

distributing food. At a later stage, a camp for  the

Work Brigade members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



will  be  set up. In fact, this evening some members

of the Work Brigade will be stationed on the site to

help  clear  this area so that work on  building  to

rehouse  the  fire  victims in  this  area  will  be

expeditiously carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill mentioned that I had

overlooked   the  fact  that  when  rebuilding   was

completed, fire victims should be allowed to go back

to  this area. As early as on the night of the fire,

the  Housing Board Chairman and I moved in to survey

the  place. On the next day we planned how this area

could  be  rebuilt mainly to rehouse the victims  as

quickly  as  possible. Plans to build  about  10,000

units  in  this  area  have  already  been  put  up.

Following  this  motion, there will  be  a  Bill  to

acquire  this  piece of land. In fact,  the  Housing

Board  has  already mapped out the plans to  rebuild

this  area where people could live without  fear  of

fire, with all the other facilities provided in  the

form  of schools, community centres, markets,  shops

and other amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleagues the other Ministers have

already  mentioned how much they have done  for  the

fire  victims  and how they propose to  relieve  the

hardships of the fire victims in the months to come.

There  is  no necessity for me to repeat  what  they

have  said. But this I would like to say,  and  that

is,  the  P.A.P. Government has always  believed  in

taking  a  realistic view of things. We acknowledge,

as any responsible government must acknowledge, that

the  fire  victims who have been overtaken  by  this

dire  calamity  must be given every  assistance.  We

have done all we can, and we will do our best in the

months to come for these fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its profound sympathy

for  the  victims of the fire at Bukit Ho  Swee  and

calls  upon the people to donate generously  to  the

Bukit Ho Swee Fire Relief Fund;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to prevent a recurrence of such disastrous

fires  the  site  of  the fire be  acquired  by  the

Government for the Housing and Development Board for

rebuilding, and to this end that no one  be  allowed

to rebuild on this site structures of a temporary or

permanent nature;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Housing and Development Board regulations

relating  to  the  prohibition  of  sub-letting   or

sharing  of accommodation be relaxed in the case  of

these  fire  victims in order that rapid  re-housing

will be possible;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House thanks the fire fighting services,

the  Police  and Military Forces for their  work  in

combating  the  fire and maintaining order  on  that

occasion  and  thanks the workers in the  Government

Social Services and the voluntary organisations  who

have helped in the relief of the fire victims.

<br><br>5.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

the  Land Acquisition Ordinance (Chapter 248 of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I lay upon the Table, Mr

Speaker, Sir, a Certificate of Urgency signed by the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in  respect  of  the  Land

Acquisition (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order, and hon.

Members  have received copies of the Bill. Is  there

any hon. Member who wishes to have an extra copy? If

not,  I  call  upon the Prime Minister to  move  the

Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members

will  have  noticed  from the  motion  moved  by  my

colleague, the Minister for National Development, it

is  the  intention  of the Government  to  seek  the

consent of the House to acquire the fire site and to

acquire  it under conditions which will not  give  a

windfall to the landowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present law, if we acquire that

land today, we will have to pay the market value  of

the land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



as  at  the  date  of  publication  of  the  Gazette

Notification, which means the land which is  vacant,

without tenants and squatters. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

is  an unfortunate fact that land with squatters and

tenants  on it is worth considerably less than  land

without  tenants and squatters. I have been  advised

by the Government Valuer that in areas such as this,

encumbered land with tenants and squatters is  worth

approximately  one-third the value of  land  without

tenants  and squatters. I think Members  will  agree

that  it  is  heinous in the extreme  to  allow  any

profit to be made out of this fire. In fact, if  any

profit  is allowed to be made, then it will only  be

an  inducement, a temptation to arson by  those  who

possess land with squatters on it. Most of the  land

to  be  acquired, or nearly all of the  land  to  be

acquired,  belongs  to private owners - 53  owners  in

all;  a  few  large ones going up to  12  acres  per

single  owner; but mostly small ones varying between

half  an  acre  and two acres. Fortunately  for  us,

there  is  clear evidence that this particular  site

was encumbered by squatters and tenants. In fact, in

1954  both the City Valuer and the Government Valuer

had  made  a survey and valuation of the  land.  The

City Assessor had put it at 43 cents per square foot

with the tenants and squatters then present; and the

Government Valuer had put it at 41 cents per  square

foot.  I am further advised by the valuers that  the

price of land between 1954 and now has not varied to

any  extent,  but  that it is most likely  that  the

number  of  squatters and tenants has increased.  If

there  is any tendency on the valuers' part to alter

this  valuation, it would be towards diminishing  it

in   view  of  the  larger  number  of  tenants  and

squatters  who would have been present on the  night

of the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank the

officers  responsible, both in the  State

Advocate-General's  Chambers  and in  the  Land  Office,  for

putting  up  this  Bill  at short  notice.  I  would

hesitate  to say that if they were given more  time,

they could not find more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



rough  edges to polish. But, nevertheless, it  is  a

workmanlike   piece   of   draftmanship    in    the

circumstances.  I  can assure  the  House  that  the

expectation  is that this will be the only  instance

we anticipate using this proviso. The reason is that

a  completely  new  Land Acquisition  Bill  will  be

introduced in the next Session, in which a provision

similar to this, but with such other refinements  as

this  operation would indicate necessary,  would  be

put in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I briefly then explain the way in which this

clause  is to work? Under section 26 there are  five

factors which determine the value of compensation to

he  awarded. For the convenience of Members, I  have

appended  a  copy of section 26. Factor (a)  is  the

market value of the land at the time of acquisition;

and  factor  (e),  the  fifth  factor,  is  that  of

expenses  incurred by having to change residence  or

place  of business. Sir, the fire has already  taken

place;  residence  has  already  been  changed;  the

squatters and tenants have already been removed; and

it falls upon the Government and the public at large

to  expend a considerable amount of money and effort

to  rehouse  and  rehabilitate the fire  victims.  I

think  the least this House can expect of landowners

is  that they should not benefit from this fire.  We

are  not  asking them to incur a loss.  We  are  not

expropriating  the  land. But we say  quite  clearly

that it would be unconscionable to allow any private

landowner  to  benefit  as a result  of  this  fire.

Therefore, the clause in this Bill to be moved  will

remove  the  necessity to consider factors  (a)  and

(e).  Instead of factor (a), the market  value  will

not  be  the market value at the date of acquisition

where there are no tenants and squatters, but at the

date  just before the devastation, that means,  with

the  tenants and squatters. That was the real  value

if  the  Government had acquired it and had  to  pay

compensation  to  every single  squatter  and  every

tenant who moved out of the land. Factor (e),  as  I

have  said, does not apply, because in any case  the

squatters and tenants have been moved out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must admit to one difficulty to which the

land  officers, particularly the Collector  of  Land

Revenue, will face. Everybody knows roughly how many

squatters there were. In fact, on registration  with

the  Social  Welfare Department of the  Ministry  of

Labour  and Law, we know that they are somewhere  in

the region of 3,000 families. The difficulty will be

between the claims of competing owners. We know that

with 3,000 families on that plot of land, it can  be

proved by expert evidence that the value of the land

will be one-third its unencumbered land. But it will

be  difficult  for us to prove or  disprove  that  a

particular  squatter was on a red  acre  or  a  blue

acre,  because  the  house is  already  burned,  the

receipts  have gone, the tenants and squatters  have

moved out, and probably cannot again be found to  go

back  and  give evidence. I am not saying  that  any

landowner will do it, but I think it might  well  be

possible for a landowner, who is enterprising enough

to make sure that he expresses further sympathy with

the fire victim, to ask him to disappear forever  so

that he will never give evidence to say that he  was

a  squatter  there.  It is quite possible  that  the

owner  of a red acre can say, "I never had squatters

on my land. All the squatters were on my neighbour's

land - a blue acre." And so interminable arguments can

go on. We are not saying that there are, in fact, no

plots of land without squatters. There may well  be,

but  we  are  putting the onus upon the  owner.  The

burden of proof is on the owner. If he proves  that,

in  fact, his plot was an oil mill and there were no

squatters and no tenants, that he was the only  chap

there,  he  owns  the land and he  can  give  vacant

possession if he wanted to sell the land,  then  the

Minister has the power when he has satisfied himself

and  the  Collector  of Land Revenue  has  satisfied

himself,  to  up the one-third limit. The  one-third

limit  is  the overall value of the land  with  that

number of squatters on it. If any owner of any piece

of  land  can prove - not we prove that  he  had  the

squatters  but he proves that he did  not  have  the

squatters - to  the satisfaction of the  Collector  of

Land  Revenue  and his investigators,  then  we  are

quite  prepared to exceed and remove the limitations

of one-third.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally I would like to say that the other

three factors, (b), (c) and (d) which the Court  has

to  take into consideration in making an award  will

remain - injurious  affection of land  by  separation;

increase  in value of the other land of  the  person

interested  likely to accrue from the use  to  which

the  land acquired will be put; and damage sustained

by  the person at the time of the Collector's taking

possession  of  the  land by reason  of  acquisition

injuriously  affecting his other  property,  whether

movable  or  immovable. These are the  factors  that

will  still, apply, but the two factors that do  not

apply  are (a) and (e). And for the reasons  that  I

have  stated, I hope the House will give  this  Bill

swift passage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Prime

Minister  has made my task very much easier  than  I

thought  it  would  be, because he  said  that  this

amendment is only of a temporary nature and intended

only  to  affect  the present ad hoc situation,  and

that  the Government has in mind a complete overhaul

of  the  Land Acquisition Bill, in which, of course,

this  amendment will come into play. Therefore, when

I do suggest to the Prime Minister that the terms of

the  Bill  have exceeded the avowed purpose  of  the

Bill  set out in the Explanatory Statement,  perhaps

these  are  matters  which the Prime  Minister  will

consider  when  the  whole  of  this  Ordinance   is

reconsidered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the first point I wish to make

on  a  matter of principle is this. The impetus  for

the  amendment  is  not  to allow  the  landlord  to

benefit from the fortuitous dispersal of his tenants

and  squatters  by  an Act of God,  with  which,  of

course, we completely agree; more so when such  land

is subject to the control of the Rent Ordinance. But

where  I  find  the  Bill has gone beyond  affecting

landlords  who  have benefited by the  fire,  so  to

speak, is this clause, Mr Speaker, which says - if  I

may read that clause (clause 2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that in the case of an acquisition for a

public  purpose of any land devastated  or  affected

directly or indirectly by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



fire,  explosion,  thunderbolt,  earthquake,  storm,

tempest, flood or any Act of God,".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till now it is perfectly all right, Mr Speaker,

Sir. This, I think, is the objectionable portion  of

the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` "., or of any land immediately adjoining such

devastated or affected land as shall be required for

such public purpose,".'



<br><br>Now,  as  I  understand the Bill, an area  has  been

devastated. This particular area is subject to  rent

control.  As  a  result  of  the  devastation,   the

landlord is put in a better position. Therefore,  it

is  only right and proper that he should not benefit

by  this  devastation.  Therefore,  the  restraining

proviso  of this amendment is completely  in  accord

with the Government's intention, and we support  it.

But  what I do not understand, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is

this.  There is a piece of land adjoining this which

is a vacant piece of land not affected by squatters;

but  because the Government feels that  it  will  be

better  and  more  economic from the  town  planning

point of view to develop the whole area rather these

two  acres of devastated land, why must the landlord

of  the other six acres, shall I say, be put in  the

same  position as the landlord whose sites have been

devastated   by   fire?  I  find   that   completely

inequitable.  But  I appreciate and  understand  the

equity  and  the justness of the first case.  But  I

certainly do not appreciate the justness of bringing

in  adjoining landowners who are free of  squatters.

You  are putting them in the same category and  only

allowing them one-third of the land value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. The

last proviso to the Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And provided further that the market value of such

land shall not exceed one third of the value of such

land had it been vacant land not subject to any such

encumbrances, tenancies or occupation  by  squatters

unless  the  Minister  shall in  his  discretion  by

notification in the Gazette specify otherwise.'



<br><br>I  would  have  felt much happier if  the  Bill  had

confined itself to saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that he shall be paid the market value of such

land on the encumbered site.'



<br><br>So  that it would not be an arbitrary way of  fixing

the  value.  The  Hon. the Prime Minister  has  said

that, by an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



arithmetical process arrived at between him and  the

Commissioner of Lands, he has come to the conclusion

that that is one-third. Perhaps that is correct, Mr

Speaker, Sir. But that is based on the fact that the

valuation  of the Commissioner of Lands is  accepted

as  the  gospel  truth. There  are  many  people  in

Singapore   who  are  not  willing  to  accept   the

valuation of the Commissioner of Lands as the gospel

truth  on  such  matters. That is the second  point.

They would have felt happier if that matter had been

left  to the Court, if the landlord were so desirous

of going to Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the other matter which I am going to bring to

the  notice of the Prime Minister is this. This Bill

has  been given life by this national calamity which

has  occurred  at this site. Thousands  of  families

have  been deprived of housing. But the Bill as  set

out here, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided that in the case of an acquisition for a

public purpose of any land devastated..'.



<br><br>"any  land devastated" might be just half  an  acre.

Now  the  public  conscience is so stirred  on  this

occasion that this Bill becomes necessary. But there

are  several fires in Singapore which go  unnoticed,

to  which  the  attention of  the  Assembly  is  not

brought to bear, and no special sittings are  called

simply because they are not of a national character.

They just become particular local calamities and not

national  calamities. The scope of this  Bill  takes

the  acquisitive powers of the Government beyond the

national calamity into a situation which is merely a

private  calamity. So that the Government can  enter

into this acquisition business on a private calamity

and  apply the provisions. I am not saying they  are

going to do it, Mr Speaker, Sir. But the provisions

of  the Bill are such that they could do it if  they

want to do it. I do not think the Government want to

do  it,  and  I hope they will also look  into  this

matter   when   the  whole  of  the   Ordinance   is

reconsidered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too am glad

that  the  Prime  Minister  is  going  to  introduce

another  Bill because, in my case, I feel that  this

Bill,   since  it  applies  only  to  land   already

devastated  by fire, etc., means that  those  people

who  stay in densely-packed attap-house areas  which

are continually subject to grave fire risks will not

be  able to benefit by any protection the Government

can  give today. It means that over their heads will

always hang the sword of Damocles, that at any  time

they  too  will  be  subjected to  this  sort  of  a

calamity.   They  will  lose  their   homes,   their

property, and some of them will lose their lives.  I

would  suggest, Sir, that the Government take  steps

so   that   these  people  may  be  prevented   from

undergoing  such a calamity, because the public  are

anxious that annually-



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how those

remarks are relevant to the Bill. We are now dealing

with  an amendment to the Land Acquisition Ordinance

which provides for acquisition with a special method

of  compensation.  I  do not  know  how  methods  of

preventing calamities have anything to do with  this

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

relevant  in  the sense that if the  Prime  Minister

wants to amend clause 2, Sir, it can be done. It  is

left  to the Government side. If the Government side

does  not  want  to amend it here, I  suggest  these

provisions be included in a future Bill. If it is so

amended  that it applies not only to land devastated

at  this  time,  but  also  to  land  likely  to  be

devastated,  then  that can be provided  for  in  an

amending clause 2. [Pause.]



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please continue until

I rule him out of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> So long as I have made the

point,  Sir,  I  leave it to the Prime  Minister  to

consider that for his next Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Made what point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In view of the fact that the

Prime  Minister has not understood, Sir,  I  repeat.

The  point  is  this. The public are  asking,  "Must

people  wait for another fire before the  Government

takes just remedial action? That is-



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to ask the Member

for  Tanglin whether that has anything  to  do  with

land  acquisition.  We  are dealing  with  the  Land

Acquisition  (Amendment) Bill. Has that anything  to

do with land acquisition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

sorry  if I have not made it clear enough.  But  the

danger   of   another  fire  can  be  prevented   if

Government has further powers to acquire areas where

these  attap houses are built together in such close

proximity  that  if any spark catches  one  roof  it

means  the beginning of another conflagration.  That

is for the Government to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Sir, is this. I have been charged

with   suggesting   that  I  am   recommending   the

resettling  of attap-house area people  affected  by

fire  and so on, on to houses with higher rents.  We

all  can see that if the Government is going to  pay

one-third  of,  we might say, the regular  value  of

land,  then it is in a position to subsidise  people

who  are  staying in such houses, and therefore  the

rents  must be lower than usual. That is the purpose

of  acquiring  the  land at a lower  rate  than  the

market value. I made no such suggestion, and I  take

this  opportunity to explain that I never  made  the

suggestion  that  there should be higher  rents  for

these  fire victims. Instead I suggested  that  they

should be given lower rents.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must be forgiven for

not  being able to follow the Member for Tanglin the

first  time.  But  when he was speaking  the  second

time, it dawned upon me that perhaps what the Member

meant was, let us change the Bill in such a way that

if  any  fire takes place, we expropriate the  whole

land.  So all landlords will be so worried about  it

that they will install fire-fighting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



apparatus in every squatter's hut in case  he  loses

his land by fire. Perhaps I will ask my officers  to

give consideration to that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Before the fire.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I dispose of the points

made  by  the  Member for Farrer  Park?  First,  the

question  of the adjoining land. That is  absolutely

important,  both  for  the reasons  the  Member  has

stated. For a comprehensive scheme you will have  to

include little bits of land either with buildings or

without buildings which may adjoin a fire site. Also

because we want to avoid any difficulty which  would

arise if any tenant or any landlord disputes whether

or not his house or his site is involved in the fire

site.  But the case has already arisen in the  Bukit

Ho  Swee fire. A block of shophouses was burnt.  All

the  tenants  fled for safety on the advice  of  the

police  and  the Fire Brigade. The fire was  checked

right  up  to the end house. The end house was  only

partially  burnt, or perhaps a spark just  burned  a

speck  on  the  window. Does this clause  come  into

operation? Was this house devastated either directly

or   indirectly   by  a  fire,   an   explosion,   a

thunderbolt, or an earthquake? Is it suggested  that

we  acquire nine houses under this and the tenth one

is  left out because it is arguable whether it  was,

in  fact, devastated by the fire or whether  it  was

partially burnt out and so on? Therefore, the clause

is  not only necessary from the Town Planner's point

of  view, but it is also necessary from the point of

view of the land acquisition officer. He has to have

power  which cannot be challenged. When he exercises

his  power clearly on the facts and says,  "This  is

part of the fire site, or adjoining it", then it  is

up  to  the Court to decide whether or not the  land

which  was  not  directly affected by  the  fire  is

immediately   so  adjoining  as  to  be   indirectly

affected.  Therefore,  it  makes  the  question   of

interpretation and quibbling less likely to arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question of the market value of

the land being fixed at one-third, I think I had  in

my opening



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



explained  the reasons for this exercise.  Everybody

knows - not  just the Land Office Valuer or  the  City

Assessor - you can bring any number of auctioneers and

licensed  valuers to give evidence to show  that  if

you  want  to get rid of squatters, or if  you  sell

land  which has squatters and tenants on it,  it  is

worth  about  one-third the market  value.  But  the

difficulty will arise when, after the fire has taken

place,  you  are to apportion between the  competing

interests. Were all seven tenants on Lot A and there

were  no  tenants  on  Lot B? Or  were  there  three

tenants on Lot A and four tenants on Lot B? We could

spend  years of litigation on this. Everybody  knows

that   there  were  3,000  families  living   there.

Therefore,  from  the point of view  of  expeditious

land  acquiring  in a fair manner, we  have  adopted

this  omnibus  clause of putting the limit  at

one-third.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, I have given an understanding on

my  moving the Second Reading just now that if a man

can prove to the Collector of Land Revenue that,  in

fact,  he had no tenants and no squatters,  that  he

was  in actual physical possession himself, that  he

ran  a little factory, then the Land Collector  will

obviously  advise  the  Minister  that  his  is   an

appropriate  case  in which action  could  be  taken

under  the last proviso where the Minister  can,  in

his  discretion, by notification  in  the  Gazette,

specify otherwise. It is as simple as that. In other

words, what it means is this. If any client turns up

to  see any lawyer, the lawyer will tell him, "Look,

it is not worth your while buying off your squatters

and  telling them to disappear, because the onus  is

on  you  to prove it." But he can prove and convince

his  lawyer. He says, "Obviously I was in occupation

there with all members of my family. I was running a

bicycle shop there or a sauce factory. I  own a piece

of  land,  and if I had wanted to sell it,  I  would

have  moved out." Obviously, the lawyer would advise

him  that it is worth while paying a modest  fee  to

seek  the clemency of the Collector of Land  Revenue

in  order to get the Minister to gazette. But, as  I

have said, this is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



matter of practical tactics. Do we involve ourselves

in  endless  inquiries as to which squatter  was  on

which land?

Or  do  we  try to spread equitably the  load  over

everyone? Which, in fact, is probably the  real  and

true  position, that there was no plot of land there

which  was  not encumbered by tenants or  squatters,

and  leave it to the odd individual who happened  to

be  in actual physical possession of his own land to

seek discretion under the proviso?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other remarks on the comprehensiveness

of the provision, when the final Bill is drafted,  I

think we will have the experience of the workings of

this  particular proviso. Perhaps on that  occasion,

we  can  speak  with more expert knowledge  of  what

landowners do, and what squatters do after  a  fire,

and  what evidence is left. But I think one definite

effect  this Bill will have is that it will give  no

inducement  whatsoever to any  landlord  to  attempt

arson. It is not worth the candle. As I have said, I

will  take the advice of the Member for Tanglin  and

ask my officers to consider whether or not we should

go  one  step further and just say, in view  of  the

general  necessity to prevent fires and  so  on,  we

will  acquire  the land for nothing, so  that  every

landlord  will install a spirit-pump, foam  and  all

the  fire-fighting apparatus right there on the spot

to  see  that his squatters are safe and sound  from

fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business having concluded, Mr Speaker

adjourned   the  House  without  Question   put,

pursuant to the Standing Order.
