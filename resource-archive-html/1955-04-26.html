<div align="center"><b>QUEEN'S MESSAGE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

privilege  today to move the motion which stands  in

my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House conveys its humble duty and thanks

to  Her Majesty the Queen for Her Majesty's gracious message.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with pleasure, I am sure, that hon. Members of

this   House  noted  the  message  and  its   terms,

particularly  that  part  especially,   Sir,   which

stated, "I look forward with every confidence to the

faithful discharge of this trust for I am sure  that

those  on whom this responsibility falls will  carry

it  out  with  foresight,  courage  and  honesty  of

purpose." Sir, it is reasonable to hope that as this

confidence is proved to have been well placed in the

months  ahead,  it  will be but  a  prelude  to  far

greater things. I beg to move, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to second

the  motion. I believe that Her Gracious Majesty has

indeed  done Singapore an honour to give us such  an

encouraging message.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House conveys its humble duty and thanks to Her Majesty the Queen for Her Majesty's gracious message.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SECRETARY OF STATE'S MESSAGE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I rise to move Motion No. 3

on  the  Order  Paper  in  the  name  of  the  Chief

Minister, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House conveys to the Secretary of State

an expression of warm appreciation for his message.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this message of greetings and goodwill is an

expression  of regret that neither the Secretary  of

State nor any of his Ministerial Colleagues could be

present  in  person to deliver the message.  I  feel

sure, Sir, that all of us share that regret, because

if  the Secretary of State or one of his Ministerial

Colleagues  could be present with us  that  day,  we

would  surely  have taken the immediate  opportunity

afforded us to discuss the question of complete self-government.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  second the motion moved by the Member  for

Havelock.  While seconding this motion, I am  deeply

moved by the message of the Secretary of State  when

he  said  that it was with every confidence that  he

looked  to the Assembly and the Council of Ministers

to   build  and  maintain  a  tradition  of   mature

deliberation    and   of   sound    and    impartial

administration. Sir, I do hope and believe that  all

of us will take that message to our hearts, and will

deliberate the various problems of this country with

maturity and impartiality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  are  asked  on this  motion  to  associate

ourselves with the Government to thank the Secretary

of  State for the Colonies for having sent  us  this

message.  Far  be it from the People's Action  Party

not  to  observe  the civilities and  courtesies  of

life,  but  I think it is important that  we  should

take  this occasion to remind ourselves what we have

to be grateful for. In his message he said,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It gives me great pleasure to send a message of

greetings  and goodwill to the Legislative  Assembly

of  Singapore on the historic occasion of its  first

meeting  under the New Constitution. My only  regret

is   that  neither  I  nor  any  of  my  Ministerial

Colleagues can be present in person to deliver it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must first of all congratulate all those who

have  taken  part  in the working out  of  this  New

Constitution,  the Committee under the  Chairmanship

of  Sir George Rendel who now see the fulfilment  of

their  labours and His Excellency the  Governor  and

his  officers who have devoted much time to  framing

and   bringing  the  Constitution  into   operation.

Secondly I want to express the satisfaction  of  Her

Majesty's  Government in the United Kingdom  at  the

successful completion of an important task which  is

signified  by  the convening of this Assembly  today

and  our most sincere good wishes for the prosperity

and  happiness of Singapore in the New Era which  is

now opening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with every confidence that I look to the

Assembly  and the Council of Ministers to build  and

maintain a tradition of mature deliberation  and  of

sound  and impartial administration. You will  I  am

sure prove yourselves worthy of the high trust which

has  been reposed in you by the people of Singapore.

Good luck to you all."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We join with the Chief Minister and the Secretary

of  State for the Colonies, Sir, in all these  pious

hopes, and we thank him for his good wishes, but  we

take  exception when he says, "I must first  of  all

congratulate all those who have taken  part  in  the

working  out of this New Constitution, the Committee

under  the Chairmanship of Sir George Rendel".  Sir,

the   authors  of  this  constitution,   with   some

exceptions, were not representatives of the  people.

Its  Chairman  was  a man with a very  distinguished

career in the diplomatic service, amongst whose many

achievements in life was a trip across Saudi  Arabia

at  the  invitation of King Ibn Saud. No doubt  that

gave him a sufficient understanding of our political

and  our  economic  problems,  but  the  people   of

Singapore  on  2nd April did not congratulate  these

men  and they decisively showed, with one exception,

that  they would not have the authors of this phoney

constitution.  That one exception, Sir,  is  because

the  Member  concerned is a man who is versatile,  a

man  of  many sides and many colours, a man who  was

agile at some later date to dissociate himself  from

some    very    spurious    provisions    of    that

recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame indeed on him for not

having  had  the courage to say then and  there,  "I

sign a minority report."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, not so very many months ago an

enterprising newspaper published a very  elucidating

article  in which the new Member for Cairnhill,  the

Hon. the Chief Minister, said this constitution  is

out-moded  even before it started,  and  if  men  of

stature  were  asked to operate the constitution  it

would not work.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Correction. That is an

inaccurate report of what was indicated. I said that

men  of  stature,  if elected, could  conflict  very

sharply  with  the Official Ministers designated  in

that constitution. I did not say it was unworkable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Sir. I am afraid I

must  apologise to the Hon. the Chief  Minister  for

having so inaccurately summarised it; but be that as

it  may, what the Hon. the Chief Minister said then,

and I hope he still believes it now, is that men  of

stature   will  find  it  difficult  to  work   this

constitution   in   opposition   to   the   Official

Ministers.  Now,  Sir, I think the  People's  Action

Party is charitable enough to believe that there are

men  of stature on the Benches opposite, and we look

forward with great anticipation, and even with  some

amusement,  to  the conflicts that  will  inevitably

arise  if  there  are  men of  stature.  We  in  the

People's  Action Party believe that freedom  is  the

inalienable  right  of any people  anywhere  in  the

world,  and  it is not for any retired diplomat  who

has  travelled across Saudi Arabia or  any  colonial

official to say that we are not fit to run;  we  are

not fit to walk; we are not even fit to stand on our

own  feet. The people of Singapore - is it on a  point

of  order, Sir? - I had hoped that there were  men  of

stature  opposite, but I might yet  be  mistaken  in

that pious hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Sir, that this country is fit now for

full  self-government, and, but  for  that  useless,

spineless  lot  that was supposed to  represent  the

people   of   Singapore   in   that   Constitutional

Commission,  we would not today find ourselves  with

the   Governor's  triumvirate,  the  men  whom   the

Government   has   referred   to   as   professional

administrators - and  no doubt they  are  capable  and

efficient.  Finance,  law,  the  police,  the  civil

service - these are the three keys on which the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



system  operates.  The People's  Action  Party  went

before the electorate and said that we rejected this

constitution in toto. We say this constitution is  a

sham.  We  say  this constitution is colonialism  in

disguise.  Only a few days ago an eminent  supporter

of  the Government Benches, who was in Bandoeng,  no

doubt exhilarated by the high rarified mountain  air

in   those  parts,  was  moved  to  say  that   this

constitution   was   nothing   but   a   cloak   for

colonialism. Sir, I can only hope that his thoughts,

the  inspiration  that he received in  those  parts,

will  not  be  altogether  lost  and  that  all  the

difficulties of booking air passages would have been

worth-while  when  he returns  and  carries  on  the

inspiration to his colleagues on the other  side  of

the  House.  But  we  need not  go  to  Bandoeng  to

understand  that  what the people want  is  freedom,

above   everything   else.  A   very   distinguished

politician  and diplomat once asked us  whether,  if

the  People's  Action Party lost the  elections,  it

would  mean  that  the people  did  not  believe  in

freedom, the people did not want freedom. We did not

say  that, that if that were so, the people did  not

want  freedom. But it is quite clear that  when  the

people  on  2nd  April  decisively  rejected   those

parties  which  were  tinkering  with  the  colonial

system,  those parties which were afraid of  change,

those  parties  which advocated orderly  gradualism,

they  were  swept out because the people would  have

none of them. And if they wanted to congratulate the

framers  of  this constitution, as the Secretary  of

State  for the Colonies wishes to congratulate them,

I  think  the  Chief Minister opposite and  quite  a

number of his friends and colleagues would not be in

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, no one in this House knows for how

long  this constitution will last. No one knows  for

how long this Assembly will last. But for as long as

this  Assembly lasts, let it never be forgotten that

there are only 25 men here who can stand up and  say

"I  speak for the people. I speak for the people  of

the  constituency I represent"; that  four  men  are

here  by  leave  and licence of His  Excellency  the

Governor  of Singapore; that they represent  no  one

but  themselves  and  their friends  whom  they  are

supposed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



typify;    and    that   the   three    professional

administrators  are in three pivotal positions.  And

we  can  only hope that there are men of stature  in

the  Front Benches opposite who will prove that this

constitution is not worth working and unworkable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would therefore move that the

motion  to  thank  the Secretary of  State  for  the

Colonies be amended by the addition of the following

words at the end of the message:



<br><br>"save  and  except for that passage in  his  message

where he congratulated all those who had taken  part

in  the  working  out of the new  Constitution,  the

Committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  Sir  George

Rendel".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a motion of no

confidence  in the Government. We fully endorse  the

Government's policy of civility and courtesy to  all

those  who are civil and courteous to us, and it  is

necessary  that  we should return the  felicitations

that  have  been sent to us. But right across  party

politics, we must, on this first business meeting of

this  House, make a clear and categorical  assertion

that we do not accept this constitution as befitting

the people of Singapore; that we do not say this  is

a  constitution which should be given to free men in

a  free world; that this is Asia and we are part  of

that  Asia  which  is  asserting  itself.  Both  the

Government and the Opposition, or some parts of  the

Opposition - I expect some parts of the Opposition  to

be  even  more vehement than the Government  Benches

opposite  in  their  defence of  the  Constitutional

Commission - but  apart  from them,  there  should  be

agreement as the Chief Minister said six months ago,

this constitution is out-moded; we do not thank  the

people  who  framed it; and that is the amendment  I

seek to move, and I hope the Chief Minister and  his

friends and colleagues are still of the opinion they

were  when they went before the electorate and  said

"This constitution is no good."



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to second the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with

very  real regret that I note an attempt to  make  a

political issue out of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



an  act  of  courtesy.  It is  not,  I  respectfully

submit, Sir, the appropriate moment and in so far as

we  have  been  attacked for moving that  motion  of

thanks,  which  is the normal act  of  courtesy  for

greetings and good wishes received, I should like to

make  our  position  clear  with  reference  to  the

particular  passage  envisaged  by  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we have clearly indicated in our policy

which will be debated in our motion of thanks to His

Excellency's Address, the Government is of the  view

that the present constitution is inadequate, but  it

is  not of the view that it is unworkable and  never

has been. There will be conflicts, Sir, there is  no

doubt  about  it, but the policy, the  doctrine,  of

collective Ministerial responsibility will, I think,

prevail  in all circumstances, and make it  workable

where  there  is  goodwill. Whatever  the  conflicts

within  the Ministerial ranks, it must be remembered

that the people have the majority representation  in

the  Council of Ministers, and the majority decision

will prevail, and I am satisfied, with only the past

fortnight's  experience,  that  I  will   have   the

Official  Ministers'  loyal  co-operation  in   this

House, whatever the conflicts within the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Sir George Rendel has been somewhat

slightingly referred to. I can say that I view  with

amazement  what  has been achieved in  view  of  the

atmosphere  of  the  times  when  certain  so-called

leaders  of the people of this country advised  him.

Sir,  but five months ago language was used in  this

House  which I dare not have used myself  and  would

never dream of using, language of so discourteous  a

character that I have no doubt you would not  permit

it,  but  which I trust you will permit me  to  read

since it is from the records of our predecessors. On

the  2nd of November, 1954, the President and leader

of  the  then only existing political party  of  any

standing, Mr C. C. Tan, made these remarks, Sir, in

this Council Chamber:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not think that anyone, except a few

dishonest,  self-seeking demagogues,  will  maintain

that  a  period of another eight years will  be  too

long to endure before we achieve self-government",



<br><br>and  it  is  my maligned colleague and   friend  the

Member for Havelock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



(Mr  Lim  Yew Hock) who said, "Too long."  Sir,  in

that  atmosphere,  with that advice,  with  the  so-called  leaders of this territory pleading, "Do  not

give  us self-government. We do not want it. We  are

not ready for it, please."- it is in that atmosphere

that  Sir  George Rendel and those  who  believe  in

freedom  and democracy managed to achieve  what  Her

Majesty  has  been  graciously  pleased  to  call  a

"significant  advance" in our political development,

and it is a significant advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with reference to this amendment which the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has asked us to view  on  a

non-political basis, I, as the Chief Minister,  will

not  seek to use the Whip on voting - if voted  on  it

must  be - but I will say for myself that  I  consider

the   amendment   discourteous,  inappropriate   and unfair.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

sympathise with the mover of the amended motion, but

I  would like to say this: that nobody in this House

who has the interests of the people of Singapore  at

heart would venture to suggest for a moment that the

constitution  suggested by the Rendel Commission  is

the  most  appropriate one for this  country.  I  do

believe  that  we are not considering  that  subject

now.  If  the constitution suggested by  Sir  George

Rendel has been faulty, I would say that it was  not

the fault of Sir George Rendel or the members of the

committee;  it  was  the  fault  of  the  people  of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> For some time they have been

apathetic towards the political problems facing this

country.  We  had  not mobilised our  resources  and

organised  political movements in the  way  that  we

should  have,  the fact being that the  people  have

been  organised into various political camps,  which

has  enabled  the Government to split hairs  in  the

political  scene. For example, we have a  number  of

political  parties here. They all  have  always  the

welfare of the people at heart. They all aim at one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



thing, but in different ways. If the whole political

structure  had  been  based  on  one  ideology   and

thought,  i.e. the political emancipation  of  this

country, then I would say that we would have  got  a

better  constitution than the one which we  have  at

the  moment.  On  the one hand, we  had  the  people

divided into various parties, and a solid Government

bloc   on   the  other  hand.  The  people   divided

themselves,  and  therefore we  had  to  suffer  the

consequences. All we can do at the moment is to seek

a better future, reorganize our political parties in

the  best  possible way, and see that in the  coming

years we get a better constitution. It may be, as my

colleague  has suggested, that the constitution  may

break,  but  we  will  have another  opportunity  of

holding general elections and put matters right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in opposing this move, may I suggest that I

have no intention of going into details of the whole

message. What I am doing is to say a word of  thanks

for  the  message which the Secretary of  State  has

sent in the normal courteous manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  stand now to speak against the amendment  to  the

motion.  We still believe that it is much too  early

for  us  to  do  anything  except  to  try  out  the

government   which  has  now  been   so   graciously

entrusted to us. We have seen with our own eyes what

is  happening  in  this part  of  the  world - in  the

territories  that are not more than  a  few  hundred

miles     from    us - with    all    the    disorder,

disorganization, corruption and troubles which  they

are  facing.  Should we, gentlemen, go through  that

phase  when everything has been promised to us?  Our

education  is notably far from complete. Our  system

requires   a  lot  of  overhauling.  Our   technical

training  is very poor, and we still have  very  few

people,   local  people,  to  man  all  those   very

important posts which will be open to us  in  a  few

years'  time. It may not be eight years, it  may  be

four,  but  let us take our time, learn our  lesson,

and do not run before we walk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the House will join with me in rejecting

this most unwelcome amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like

to  speak on the amendment. It is rather surprising,

Sir,  that so soon after the election we have  again

election speeches. I have just moved a very harmless

motion,  just  a motion to convey an  expression  of

warm appreciation for a message; and I even said  in

my  speech  just now, Sir, that I shared the  regret

that  if the Rt. Hon. the Secretary of State or  one

of  his Ministers could have been present with us at

the  official  opening, we would have accepted  that

immediate opportunity to discuss immediate  complete

self-government. I made it rather clear, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Otherwise you would not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. Otherwise, Sir, it would

mean  that we would have to go to the mountain. Sir,

I  find it difficult to reply to the, shall we  say,

odious  remarks that have been hurled at the members

of  the Rendel Commission, because I was one, but  I

am  here to say, Sir, the public knowing that I  was

one have returned me to this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  had no idea that I should rise so early  in

the House, but I now do so because I am delighted to

learn  from  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew) that I only represent myself. So I think I

have every right to say something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to remind the House of the conditions

the  British Prime Minister (Sir Anthony Eden)  when

he  was  Foreign Secretary laid down, I  should  say

suggested, should be fulfilled before the Federation

of   Malaya  attained  self-government.  They   were,

firstly,  to  suppress terrorism; secondly,  to  see

that  the  people  were on guard  against  Communist

infiltration and aggression; thirdly, to  develop  a

sound  economy and administration and to  achieve  a

durable  accord  between races;  and,  fourthly,  to

provide a secure system of defence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as I see it, the British Government, present

and  past, has been falling over backwards  to  give

self-government to these territories, and  in  doing

so,  I  feel  that in retarding - what the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar regards as retarding - this progress  I

think they have been wise and far-seeing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Speaking as a native of a country

that  has  experienced  seven centuries  of  freedom

since Magna Carta, I thoroughly sympathise with  the

feelings  of  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  but  I

agree  with the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon

Teck) that the time is not yet ripe.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not

intended to speak on this amendment which we  cannot

support, but I must express my regret that the Chief

Minister has used discourteous, phrases towards  his

recent opponent in the constituency of Cairnhill. He

himself expressed regret that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) had been discourteous  in

this House. Let us remember -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

proper for him to indulge in this personal attack on

a Question of the motion before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I do not think I was indulging

in any personal attack.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been asked to rule on a point

of  order,  whether  anything that  the  Member  for

Tanglin  (Mr  John  Ede) has  said  is  a  personal

attack.  I  for  one  have  not  as  yet  discovered

anything  of that nature in the Member for Tanglin's

speech,  but  if  he does speak in that  strain,  of

course  I will have to rule him out of order. Please

continue, Mr. Ede.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, all I wish to say is, let us

remember that the gentleman referred to was a member

of  the Constitutional Commission, and he helped  to

frame  the new constitution which the Chief Minister

himself has said is workable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now

actually only trying to frame a message of thanks to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



Colonial  Secretary.  We are  not  debating  on  any

political  issues. In effect, the Colonial Secretary

has  been correct in praising the people who sat  on

that Commission. Way back in 1947 or 1948 we started

our  election.  If there are people who  think  that

they are good enough to represent the people did not

come out and allow the other people whom -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We are not good enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - the people have trusted to

come  out and represent them, what grouse have  they

got in such a matter? Again we must see that credit

must  be given to those pioneers who are setting  us

up towards the road to independence. We cannot, at a

jump, achieve what other nations have achieved after

a long time, but we do not at the same time say that

we  are not fit for anything. I think it is the duty

of  Members  of this House to see that we  must  get

independence as fast as we can take it. I  think  it

is important that we should give this constitution a

fair  trial, and as it becomes evident that  we  are

able  to  take  on  more responsibilities,  then  we

should  so frame our constitution again in order  to

achieve the early aims of independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of colonialism, paternalism and all

that,  I  believe  that  there  are  two  forms   of

colonialism. We do not want both. Perhaps we are now

trying  to  get rid of one, but we do not  want  the

other type of colonialism. That is not only going to

tie   us  physically,  but  will  also  tie  us   up

spiritually.   We   detest  that   other   form   of

colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of the leader of my Party, I believe

that  he has been a good man, a very reasonable man.

If  he  had not been, he would not have been elected

once,  and again, and I believe that he was not  far

behind when the votes were counted. Such a man  has

given  his  service to this country for a  long  and

continuous period, and I think credit must be  given

to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Too long!

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the,motion that stands in my name is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His

Excellency the Governor for his Address delivered on

Friday, 22nd April, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this motion, Sir, it is traditional that the

policy of the Government is debated, its point of

view is amplified, and the Opposition has an

opportunity to attack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in our history, Sir, it is perhaps

appropriate to look back a little to see how and why

our policy has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



evolved  the way it has shaped in the Address.  Hon.

Members  have heard that at the beginning  Singapore

was  a village situate where this Assembly House now

stands,  and today it is the tenth busiest  port  in

the  world with a population of more than a million.

In  between,  Sir, we have established a gold-mining

town  economy. The law of the jungle translated into

business  terms was our basic philosophy of economy,

and  the god of money was the god of gods. Our gold,

Sir,  is  our geographical position - we are  at  the

crossroads  of the world; and also in the  flood  of

expatriates  from  many lands who  flocked  to  this

territory  to  make  their  fortunes.  The   English

expatriates,  Sir, whom Sir Stamford Raffles  called

"merchant  adventurers of our nation",  using  their

military and their political power, backed by  their

economic  resources  and  experience,  maintained  a

rigid  and  overwhelming domination over  the  Asian

expatriates to whom was relegated the role of worker

ants.  These are the people who became the  merchant

princes,   the  taipans  of  the  East,   with   the

Government officials their willing satellites.  They

found it convenient, Sir, for the better control  of

the  mass  of Asian labour, without which this  port

would  not have developed, to permit some few Asians

to achieve prominence in the economic field - and only

in  the  economic field. A sharp line of  domination

was   drawn  between  the  white  man - lord  of   the

earth - and   the   Asian,  his  humble   slave,   his

inarticulate  slave. To support this  political  and

economic set-up, we had that very convenient  theory

that  in  Singapore nobody lives, that Singapore  is

but  a  port of call. It is known as the  theory  of

expatriates,  the land of expatriates. Singapore  is

only the land of the prospectors for gold. The white

man did not live here permanently, was not domiciled

here,  and  it  was  convenient to  assume  and  for

Government to proceed on the basis that nobody lived

here,  and  eyes were closed to the cemeteries  that

proved  this  theory  false.  It  was  a  convenient

theory, Sir, because it meant that Government had no

obligations  for social services of any nature.  Its

only  obligation was to hold the ring  and  let  the

prospectors slug it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



out,  making quite certain that the expatriate  from

the  West had such political assistance that he  was

at  all times the victor, the dominating factor,  in

every  strategic aspect of our life. The  Government

services,  Sir,  were keyed to the  welfare  of  the

wealthy,  and only the wealthy. It is  true  we  had

medical    services,   but    that    is    because,

unfortunately,  Sir,  we have  never  been  able  to

educate  the bug of disease to recognise the  sacred

division between the wealthy and the poor, and so we

had to have medical services for the poor as well as

for the rich in order to protect the rich. There was

no  need  for  schools,  Sir,  since  there  was  no

expatriate  to educate. It was soon found,  however,

that  the  commercial machine required  cheap  local

fodder,  and  so  we  had schools  that  turned  out

tambies  and  clerks. Just a few. The  rest  of  the

children,  who  did not exist in  the  eyes  of  the

Government, had to depend on mission schools, on the

private  charity  of  communal  schools;  but  large

sections of them, Sir, were left uneducated; and how

convenient!  because  the uneducated  are  far  more

docile and far more amenable to the role of economic

slaves.  They  formed our bulk of untrained  labour,

cheap  labour,  Sir, and every effort  was  made  to

depress the labourers as far as possible. Our  gates

were  thrown open to floods of emigrants to maintain

cheap  labour  to the greater glory  of  the  profit

earner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was our tender regard for the wealthy that

Government  never  dared suggest  that  they  should

contribute  anything  to the  cost  of  running  the

Government.  The cost of running the Government  was

largely defrayed by profits from the sale of  opium,

encouraged amongst the poor, the coolies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when I was young, Sir, I remember

vividly  one  sunny day watching a Chinese  labourer

hefting heavy bales from a lorry to a godown, and  I

said  to him, "How much do you earn?", and he  said,

"50  to  60 cents a day." I asked, "What do  you  do

with  it?" He said he spent 35 to 40 cents on opium;

and   when   I   protested  at  this   extraordinary

extravagance, his calm reply was "If  I  don't  have

opium, what have I to live for?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this coolie, Sir, thrown on the slag-heap of

our  gold-mining town economy, who has largely  been

responsible for the development of our port.  It  is

this  coolie who has paid for our Government in  the

past. It is the sweat and the misery of this coolie,

extracted  from  him in generous measure,  that  has

been  transmuted to the milk and the honey on  which

the  wealthy  feed to slake their queer  thirst  for

more  money.  It is on this slag-heap, Sir,  of  our

economy  that  we are sacrificing the  mass  of  our

population,  the hundreds of thousands who  live  in

sties,  in dens of disease, on pavements, the  large

mass  of our school children who have to depend upon

private  charity for education. It is on this  slag-heap  that  we find our vaunted standard of  living,

the  highest in Asia. Even if that were  true,  Sir,

what  it  amounts  to is this. It  is  depressingly,

unnecessarily, dreadfully low - $3l a week is what our

manual  worker gets - when he gets work - $3l  a  week!

Can hon. Members understand $31 a week?

- to  have  a family, a home and to live normally - and

this  in  the richest country in all Asia,  with  an

estimated  income  every year of $2,000  million  or

more! The smouldering embers of the slag-heap,  Sir,

are  throwing  out  poisonous fumes  of  hatred,  so

bitter that it cannot distinguish between the system

and the rulers. These fumes and this slag-heap are a

danger  to the health of the entire people  of  this

territory. They are a menace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, Sir, that Government laid

its  plans,  and it is because of this context  that

primary  emphasis was laid on the need,  the  urgent

need, to free the people of this territory from  the

twin   evils  of  racial  domination  and   economic

slavery.  It is my belief that in this constitution,

which  we have so recently heard attacked, lies  the

opportunity to achieve those aims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been called a political

innocent-[Interruption.] (yes, out of the mouths  of

babes and sucklings it has been said, I would remind

the hon. Member) - and that, Sir, because I am told  I

place  too much faith in the English. Sir,  in  this

city  of my birth, which holds a unique position  of

being the crossroads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



of  the world, many peoples and many cultures  meet,

and  differing peoples absorb different  proportions

of the various cultures. I will freely admit that by

virtue of my education, particularly by virtue of my

training  and  professional  calling,  I  have  come

strongly under the influence of English concepts  of

living. Sir, I will freely admit that, whatever  the

transient antagonisms, I am basically pro-English. I

know it is supposed to be political suicide to admit

it.  I  have  been  told that repeatedly  during  my

campaign.  I  believe in facing facts, Sir. I  seek

nothing for myself, and from that fortunate point  I

can  indulge in the luxury of the truth.  During  my

political  campaign, whatever might  have  been  the

adverse  effects  of admitting it,  I  clarified  my

position and I would like to repeat it. As a Malayan

I have naturally sought to lean backwards against my

natural  bias  in order to assess wherein  lies  the

true welfare of the people of this territory, and  I

have  come back always to the same conclusion. I  am

convinced  that  the great majority of  the  English

people  are  now conscious of the evils of  colonial

rule,  and  I  will  say this to some  of  the  hon.

Members opposite - it is not fair to judge the English

people  by  the  conduct of the old guard  colonials

whom  we  find  in  these  territories.  It  was  an

Englishman,  Prof.  Silcock  of  the  University  of

Malaya,  who  said, "Colonial rule  is  unbelievably

corrupting to the ruler and to the ruled alike." But

those  of  us who have had the privilege of  knowing

the  English people in England will, I think,  admit

that  the Englishman is as fine and decent  a  human

being as any anywhere, and his consciousness of  the

evils  of  colonial  rule has brought  about - need  I

remind hon. Members? - the independence of India,  our

great neighbour, and those other great neighbours of

ours -  Burma and Ceylon. I hope some will remind  me

that  it  was  the Labour Government which  conceded

that  independence.  I think in  fairness  I  should

indicate  that only recently Sir Winston Churchill's

Government - a  Conservative Government I believe - gave

Sudan its independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, on a point of

order. Is it relevant, what he is speaking?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

the  truth,  he has always, I understand,  Sir,  the

liberty of walking out. I shall not miss him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that it is only in friendly

negotiation,  I  am convinced, and  in  co-operation

with  England that we can achieve complete  internal

self-government in peace. That is the keynote of our

entire   philosophy - peaceful   development   through

democratic  process - and I can assure  hon.  Members

present  that whether the mountain comes to  Mohamed

or  not, we shall commence within this year, I hope,

negotiations  with the Secretary of State  which  we

hope  will lead to complete internal self-government

within the life of this Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I think it comes ill, Sir,

from  us to question the good faith of a nation that

seeks  to  give us its hand to help us to our  feet.

The  present constitution is an earnest of that good

faith.  Our  present constitution  was  evolved,  no

thanks to our so-called leaders, because the English

people  are  aware of the inarticulate  cry  of  the

masses  who had no leaders to speak for them at  the

time   of  the  Rendel  Commission,  or  very,  very

few - one, as far as I know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from whatever angle we view this problem, we

always come back to the same conclusion, and I think

hon.  Members  will agree that the welfare  of  this

territory  is knit with close and friendly relations

with Great Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken of self-government. The question of

independence is tied with the question of union with

the   Federation.  Sir,  the  separation   of   this

territory   from   Malaya  and  from   the   Straits

Settlements has brought, I understand, some material

benefits.    We    are    the    richer    territory

proportionately, and if there is to be union we  may

have  to share our wealth. The Government is not  of

the  view that money is the all-important factor  in

human   life  and  as  soon  as  the  newly  elected

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



of   the   Federation  is  ready,  we   shall   open

negotiations  for  a  union  to  lead  directly   to

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-government, Sir, and even more, independence,

requires  a domiciled civil service, and although  I

am  advised that Malayanisation of the civil service

has  been  the  policy for many years,  the  present

position  is most unsatisfactory and this matter  is

receiving  anxious priority consideration  from  our

side   of  the  House.  There  will  be  no  further

recruitment  of  expatriates  except  in  imperative

circumstances where we have no alternative, and even

then, even then, generally on contract only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Always.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, that is the political aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic field Government is anxious not to

alarm  capital. We do not wish to do anything  which

would prejudice the already meagre livelihood of our

people,  and  in order to achieve our twin  aims  of

increasing trade and commerce and industry,  and  to

move  steadily towards a welfare state, we plan,  as

hon. Members have heard, to have an economic adviser

of  world repute, an economic planning commission of

men  of  recognised standing, and a  trade  advisory

council   representative  of  all   commercial   and

industrial  interests in this  territory  to  advise

Government.  Hon. Members need not  fear  that  they

will  hinder Government's aims. There is no question

of  that. But it is our view, Sir, that business men

who,  by virtue of survival in competitive callings,

are normally of more than average intelligence, once

they  are  satisfied  that we are  being  guided  by

experts, once they are satisfied that they  have  to

deal  with  men who seek to give them fair treatment

and   not   the   Frankensteins  of   their   heated

imagination,  we  believe  that  these  people  will

awaken  to a realisation of one important factor  to

commerce, and that is this, that the success of  our

welfare  projects  will mean  greater  security  for

their own investments in this territory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of housing, Sir, my friend and

colleague, the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and Housing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



(Inche  Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat), will deal  with

this,  but  I think I should deal briefly  with  the

policy  of  Government with reference  to  immovable

property.   Immovable  property  is   an   essential

commodity  of life, as necessary to human beings  as

food  and  water. To-date, Sir, there has  been  the

most extraordinary profiteering in pursuance of  our

jungle law economy in that essential commodity,  and

this  to the very grave prejudice of the welfare  of

the  people  of this territory. There  is  the  Land

Acquisition Bill which our predecessors did not care

to  pass. The Government is of the view that that is

very  anaemic, whatever others may have thought.  It

is  wholly  inadequate, and it is our  intention  to

bring  before you a comprehensive bill freezing  all

values   of   immovable  property,   probably   with

retrospective effect to the date of the Address, and

we will seek additional powers of acquisition. There

will be no more profiteering in land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to some, the question of free legal aid may

seem  minor. I am of the view that it could  have  a

tremendous  influence on the life of the  people  of

this  country,  and  a  truly beneficial  influence.

Those  of  us, Sir, who know our system of  justice,

know  the  comfort  and the pride  we  take  in  it,

recognise that it is one of the principal pillars of

the   development   of   this   territory.   It   is

unfortunately  true, Sir, that  the  heavy  cost  of

legal   assistance  in  many  instances   makes   it

impossible  for  the common man to obtain  the  full

protection  and  seek  the  full  advantage  of  our

magnificent system of justice. I know, Sir, as  does

my  hon.  Friend opposite, that a certain amount  of

good  work  is being done in the Social  Welfare  to

advise  those  in need on legal problems.  There  is

also  in forma pauperis procedure which some  fifty

people   a   year  take  advantage  of.  These   are

superficial palliatives. It is the intention of  the

Government  to  take  the  law  to  the  people,  to

decentralise our law courts as far as possible,  and

by   making   available  fully   trained   qualified

Government  employees  in a  legal  aid  bureau,  to

assist the poor both in civil and criminal cases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



and in advice out of Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been hoped that today we would have at least

one  more  Bill  tabled, Sir, the  City  and  Island

Council  Bill. The Government recognises how  urgent

is  the measure and how important that we should not

further  prolong the prolonged life of  the  present

City  Council,  which  does  not  reflect  the  true

balance  of  opinion of the people of the territory.

But,  Sir,  principles  of  an  extremely  important

character connected with that Bill have been raised,

and all I can say is that we shall do our utmost  to

present it at the next meeting, on the 24th of May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a short acquaintance, a very short

acquaintance, with Government, does seem to indicate

that  we  are  apt  in many spheres  to  live  on  a

somewhat  extravagant scale, and we intend  to  take

action  shortly to bring about a realisation by  the

various  Departments  of  the  important  need   for

economy. Every dollar saved, Sir, is an extra dollar

for social services for which there is such a crying

need. In every sphere of Government activity Members

sitting  on  this side of the House are  finding  it

necessary to reassess the existing policy and to lay

down  fresh  instructions. The task is considerable.

Our  programme has been called ambitious.  I  freely

admit   we   are  ambitious,  very  ambitious.   Our

ambition,  Sir, is to bring hope and  sustenance  to

the  frustrated and the dispossessed majority of the

people in this Island. Our hope is to gather in  the

bitter,  the angry, the despairing, within the  warm

fold  of  fellowship and mutual  help  in  a  united

people. Our hope is to bring a realisation, Sir,  to

these people so far left out in the cold, that  this

Government  is  their Government, that  we  on  this

Front Bench are not the heaven-born, sitting on  the

snow-capped  peaks of Olympus, but in all  sincerity

their  servants, seeking their welfare.  It  is  our

hope  to  bring this Government to the  people  ever

more closely, so that it can be true that it is they

who govern. If we can only impress the people with a

realisation,  with the vision that  is  ours,  of  a

peaceful  evolution to a dignified way of  life  for

all the domiciled races of this country,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



Sir, we may look forward with confidence to the  day

when the various peoples and the various cultures of

this  country  have  so  inspired  each  other  that

Singapore, the crossroads of the world, will be  the

brightest star in the Eastern sky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our ambition, and this is our task, Sir,

and  I  would like to say to Members opposite, "This

is  your  task  too." I expect, we  all  expect,  we

welcome from hon. Members opposite honest criticism,

because  in  that way we learn. Where we  err,  hurl

your  rocks. I shall gather each and cherish it  and

build  my  house the better for it.  But  where  you

agree  with  our  platforms, do  not  only  pay  lip

service.  Whatever party you may belong to,  and  if

you  belong to no party at all, Sir, I would say  to

you, "Come in and help. The birth of a new Singapore

should not be a matter of a political party. Come in

and  give us your assistance. Our doors are open day

and night to you, and not only on Mondays."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better make certain

points  quite  clear to hon. Members.  Hon.  Members

must  remember that when a Member is speaking, there

must   be   silence.  There  must  be  no   unseemly

interruptions. I have been indulgent, and I  propose

to continue being indulgent in this formative stage,

but  my  indulgence may be strained.  Let  the  item

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to second the motion of the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister in expressing the Assembly's  thanks

to  His  Excellency  the Governor  for  his  Address

delivered on Friday last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may appear to some people, as the Chief

Minister  has  just said, that the  programme  which

Government has laid before this Assembly is somewhat

ambitious,  but if I may say so, it is  a  programme

which  should meet the pressing needs of the  people

of  Singapore today. We shall endeavour to implement

the policies laid down in His Excellency's Speech in

a spirit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



honesty  and  a  sincerity of purpose, for these are  two  assets which this Government has in abundance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been indicated in His Excellency's Address,

three  of the important measures that we propose  to

carry  fall within my portfolio as the Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing. The  first  is

legislation  to  freeze  the  values  of   immovable

property  and give the Government additional  powers

for  the  acquisition of land for  public  purposes.

Such  legislation is designed to ensure  that  land,

which  is  a  very scarce and valuable commodity  in

Singapore  at the present moment, is made  available

to  the people at reasonably non-speculative prices.

This  is necessary if the Government is to keep  its

pledge  of improving the standard of living  of  the

poorer classes and providing them with adequate low-cost housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is proposed to tackle the housing

problem  more vigorously and efficiently by  setting

up a statutory Housing Authority, solely responsible

to  Government,  to  replace the  present  Singapore

Improvement Trust. It is hoped that such  a  Housing

Authority  would  be  able in a comparatively  short

time  to  bridge  the increasing gap between  public

housing programmes and the needs of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third important measure for which my Ministry

will  be responsible is the introduction of a system

of  land  title registration to replace the  present

cumbersome and costly system under which  rights  to

and  over  land are recorded by the registration  of

deeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superiority of land title registration over

registration of deeds is now universally recognised.

The new system will certainly result in considerable

reduction  in  the  cost  to  the  public  of   land

ownership. As hon. Members are aware, it is proposed

to  introduce  the  Torrens  system  of  land  title

registration,   a  system  which  was   successfully

introduced in South Australia about a hundred  years

ago,  and  later, in a more modified  form,  in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to conclude by repeating to the

people of Singapore my assurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



that this Government, which has assumed office on  a

mandate,  will work sincerely for the  promotion  of

their well-being and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just

heard  the  Chief Minister elaborating  on  what  he

would  like to do during this year. He has drawn  to

us  a  picture of past Singapore. He has  painted  a

picture  of  the  difficulties of the  labourer,  of

economic  exploitation, but I am more interested  in

what  concrete plans the Government is going to  put

up  to  achieve all this. Indeed, when I first heard

His  Excellency's  Address on Friday,  I  could  not

fully interpret it. At most I could call it as being

for  the  most  part a mixture of  pious  hopes  and

slogans.  The new Government, as we know  it  today,

has  inherited from the previous Government a  great

deal  of benefit and, in many instances, it has only

to  repeat and carry out such plans as have  already

been approved. I quote instances:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the policy of this Government to finance

low-rental  housing for those in  the  lower  income

group",



<br><br>but  this was approved unanimously as a result of  a

motion   by  the  Progressive  Party  in  the   last

Legislative Council. Public memory may be short, but

I think credit must be given to whom credit is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important question is the union of

Singapore  with  the Federation of Malaya.  We  need

clarification  on this point. Is it going  to  be  a

union  like that of South Africa, or is it going  to

be  a  federal government on the basis of Australia?

In  any case, we must sound a warning that in no way

must  it be a sell-out for Singapore. The people  of

this great trading centre have a right to be assured

that at the minimum it must be an equal partner with

the  Federation, and I hope the Government will bear

this fully in mind when it puts up any plan for  the

union.  Perhaps  you  all  know  that  not  only  is

Singapore  small, but the union with the  Federation

is still too small a territory to stand alone. And I

believe that it would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



very much better if it be not only a federation with

the  hinterland,  but  a  federal  union  with  such

territories as North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak.  If

such  a  federation were to be realised,  I  believe

that  greater benefits would accrue to each  one  of

the  members. And I believe that it becomes not  two

sections - the  port  and the hinterland - but  it  can

become a co-operation between many territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question again of the Government

policy  on  public services, I would like  to  state

that  it has always been one of the platforms of  my

Party  to Malayanise the civil service. Previous  to

this,  recruitment of expatriates has  been  in  the

hands  of the permanent executives, with the  Public

Services  Commission acting in an advisory capacity.

The  power  now lies with the Council of  Ministers,

and  if there should be unnecessary recruitment,  or

further  recruitment, of expatriates, we  will  know

where  that responsibility lies. It is very good  to

gloss  over  what  we  want  to  do,  but  the  more

important thing is, can we do it? How can we do  it?

I  look at the policy of the Government, and I  find

that  there  must be a means whereby we can  get  to

that  end.  The question of staffing of  our  senior

services with local people ties up very closely with

our   educational  system.  There  is  no   mention,

however, of higher education in that Address.  There

might  be primary education. There might be training

of  workers in industries, but no amount of  primary

education  and no amount of training of  workers  in

industry  will ever lead us to have men sufficiently

qualified  to  take  over that senior  service.  The

emphasis,  may  I  suggest,  should  lie  with   the

expansion  of  more  secondary  schools.  We  should

assist  to  a  far greater extent the University  of

Malaya  and other higher institutions of  study.  We

must  give our unstinted help to the much publicized

Singapore  Polytechnic, which  was  passed  in  the

previous  Legislative Council, and if such  measures

should  be  insufficient to  meet  our  need,  would

Government  be  prepared to augment  our  supply  of

locally trained men by granting more scholarships to

our promising youths for overseas studies?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the raising of the standard of

living, I believe that everyone of us in this  House

here must agree most whole-heartedly. I find in  the

Address  that  farmers and fishermen were  specially

mentioned.  Farmers,  however,  need  no   fair   to

stimulate  their  interest. What  is  most  urgently

required  is more speedy development of rural  areas

and  early implementation of the policy made by  the

previous  Government  for the development  of  rural

areas  with  a  grant of $20 million  to  bring  the

services to a proper standard. We have learnt in the

past and for a very long time that the coastline  of

Singapore  is  not too very long, and  whatever  in-shore  fishing  by small fishermen  has  been  fully

exploited.  If  we  do want to bring  in  a  greater

supply of food to lower the cost of commodities  and

thereby raise the standard of living, we must search

for   other   means   such  as   organised   fishing

industries. We hope Government will encourage that,

because  in all these cases the standard  of  living

can  only be brought down by more food to bring down

prices,  or increase individual income so  that  the

people   have   more   money  to   buy   foodstuffs.

Encouragement in this direction must be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We noted from the Chief Minister's Address that he

has  been  grumbling about the exploitation  of  the

workers,  about how the prosperity of  this  country

has  been  built  on  labour;  but  as  I  go  round

Singapore  I always meet a certain group of  people,

the  most hard-hit people, the group of people  that

requires   most  assistance.  They  are  the   small

hawkers.  They number thousands. High licence  fees,

constant  raids  and heavy fines  have  driven  this

group  of  people to desperation. I have met  a  few

more unfortunate ones, and some have even said to me

that  it  would be better to be thieves rather  than

try  to  earn  an  honest living by  hawking.  Would

Government devise ways and means to assist them earn

a peaceful living? Would Government try and get more

open  spaces to build shelters for them?  I  believe

that the preponderance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



of  the number of hawkers in this country is a  good

indication of the unemployment problem, and this can

only  be  avoided by an increase of industries.  And

whilst I am on this subject of unemployment, I feel,

too,  that  unemployment in the  educated  class  of

people who are coming out of secondary schools would

be  acute.  I  forecast that  the  problem  will  be

serious  in the near future. We would like  to  know

what plans Government has to combat such a problem.



<br><br>Coming  round  to  the Emergency Regulations,  I  am

really  surprised  that the  new  Government  is  no

better  than the old one. Perhaps their  views  have

now  changed,  now that they are in power.  We  know

that  the  new  Government  is  contented  with  the

removal  of  a  few  petty  Regulations,  but  these

Regulations are already dead letters. The  power  to

arrest without trial, the most important clause, has

been  left  untouched. It is difficult to  reconcile

this with the Labour Front's platform which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation in Singapore does not warrant the

continuation  of the Emergency Regulations  and  the

Labour   Front  will  seek  the  removal   of   this

unnecessary  and  undemocratic  restriction  on  the

liberty of the people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has further reinforced this

platform over Radio Malaya by saying in no uncertain

terms   that  the  Emergency  Regulations  are   not

justifiable. Under the Emergency Regulations, a  man

can  be  convicted  out  of  hand  as  a  result  of

confidential reports of which he and his lawyer know

nothing  or  very little. We are for law and  order,

but  we believe they can be maintained without these

extraordinary laws. And now I believe that those who

have  voted  Labour will know what  they  have  been

voting  for.  We  do  not, however,  say  that  this

attitude  of  the  Labour Government  is  wrong.  We

believe, too, that the security of the whole  people

of  Singapore  at large must be maintained,  but  we

always believe in an honest platform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think while we are on these Emergency

Regulations  we might also refer to such Regulations

as those relating to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



the   Publication,  Control,  Sale  and  Circulation

Regulations, 1950, for the Press. These  Regulations

were  introduced in 1950 during the Korean war.  And

again  there  were  the highly  unpopular  Emergency

Newspaper  Regulations  of  1951.  These  are  still

allowed to remain undisturbed. I believe that it  is

high time that such repressive Regulations should be

repealed, and I believe, too, that the laws  in  our

ordinary  statute  book  should  be  sufficient   to

control the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of social services, we must

congratulate   the  Government  for   focusing   its

attention  on  the  aged,  the  disabled,  and   the

unemployed.  For the youths of Singapore  at  large,

however, the Government policy is silent.  It  is  a

matter  of  right  and urgency that  the  youths  of

Singapore  today,  who  will  be  the  citizens   of

tomorrow,  deserve  a  little  attention  from   the

Government. At present youth clubs and organisations

are mainly the responsibility of public spirited and

generous  people. I would like you to  compare  what

they  did  in  England or what they are still  doing

now.  In a county called Glamorgan, where the  youth

population is 57,500 between the ages of 11 and  20,

the total estimated expenditure for the year 1955 to

1956 is �63,000. How does this compare with our  own

budget  for  assisting youth clubs? The problems  of

today  must  be tackled. If the youths of  Singapore

today  are  to  be  the good citizens  of  tomorrow,

conscious   of  their  responsibilities,   then,   I

believe,  they must be guided. Not only  must  their

education be adequately catered for in schools,  but

after  school-hours their excess  energy  and  their

leisure  hours should be channelised and  guided  by

experts.  We  ask Government that it be  considered,

and  that  plans  for enhanced assistance  to  youth

clubs  be  considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to refer to

another point in the Address, namely income tax. The

present  income tax laws have not taken into account

the  family  unit  in Singapore, which  is  entirely

different  from that of the West. Parents  out  here

are  regarded as very important parts of the family,

and rightly so; they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



should  remain  to enjoy the support  and  continued

love  of their children even after retirement.  Hon.

Members  here will agree with me that it is  a  good

system.  Further, I believe we can  all  agree  that

because  of  such an attitude, it has  made  old-age

pensions, as practised in Australia, unnecessary  in

Singapore. Furthermore, we have less people in  need

of  public  assistance owing to the  Social  Welfare

Department. I make this point in order that  in  our

income tax laws the regulations may be revised so as

to include parents under income tax relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must come down to what has always

received  the  popular support of all parties - multi-lingualism. My Party has never been opposed  to  it.

We  have  always  been  motivated  by  the  idea  of

efficient  despatch  of  public  matters.   We   are

agreeable  that any system that meets  with  popular

approval  should be given a trial, and a  very  fair

trial.  We are agreeable that if it should be  tried

out  in the City and Island Council, no restrictions

on   dialects  and  languages  should  be  made,  no

sections  of any population should be debarred  from

using their language. If it is successful, I believe

it will receive also the blessings of my Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before I end, I would like to assure the

Government side that whatever proposals or  projects

that  are  good for the people and the country  will

always  receive our support. On the other  hand,  we

trust that the Government will serve all sections of

the people without bias.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, I take this

opportunity to express my views on certain planks on

the  Government's programme as stated in broad lines

in  His  Excellency the Governor's Address  to  this

Assembly  at  its inaugural meeting on  22nd  April,

1955,  and the address by the Chief Minister  a  few

moments   ago.  The  programme  is,  of  course,   a

programme  of  the Welfare State, which  the  Labour

Front has promised its electorate and now endeavours

to present to the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, the Government should bear in mind the

fact  that  in  order to carry out the programme  it

will be necessary to consider how and from where the

funds  may be obtained. The simple answer  that  the

Government  may  provide would, of  course,  be  the

raising  of  taxation,  but  before  the  Government

resorts to this measure it should first explore  all

possibilities of increasing the revenue  and  income

for  the Colony. The Democratic Party has emphasized

the  importance of expanding trade and industry, and

I hope that the Government will bear this in mind in

carrying out their programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's policy on education, I am

pleased to note that the policy of the Government is

to  aim  at equal treatment for all schools and  all

teachers in those schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order. Is the hon.

Member permitted to read his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Standing Orders are, of course,

against Members reading their speeches, but  I  have

not  noticed that the hon. Member has, in fact, read

his speech. Carry on, Mr William Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> On the Government's policy on

education,  I would like to quote these  few  words:

"the  policy  of the Government is to aim  at  equal

treatment for all schools and all teachers in  those

schools".  By  this  I take it that  the  Government

means  that  it intends to have a common policy  for

all  schools. May I ask the Government,  is  it  for

only schools for one particular language, or schools

for all languages? And I feel and believe that there

must  be  no  discrimination  between  English   and

vernacular schools. I feel also that Government  may

wish  to bear in mind the underlying principle  that

education   for   all  citizens  is   properly   the

Government's responsibility, and aids should not  be

used  as  reward for behaviour nor lever  to  secure

obedience.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order. Is the Chair

satisfied that the hon. Member was reading from  his

speech, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not, in fact, noticed anything

out of the ordinary. Mr William Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> On the subject of acquisition of

land   for   public  purposes,  we  note  that   the

Government   intends  to  acquire  land.  Additional

acquisition  of lands means additional revenue.  Due

regard  must be paid to the interest of  the  people

whose lands are being acquired, and safeguards  must

be  made  to  protect their interests.  Considerable

extent of land has already been acquired - take,  for

instance, Changi - and this land, I believe, is  still

yet undeveloped. The Government should therefore  reconsider from where this additional revenue  may  be

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Service. I, of course, heartily support the

Government's policy of Malayanisation of  the  Civil

Service  and  venture to express that it  should  be

carried  out without undue delay together  with  the

attendant training schemes for local personnel.  But

I  would  like  to ask the actual meaning  of  these

three words - "adequate abolition terms". What does it

mean  by  "adequate  abolition terms"?  How  do  you

consider  the  terms  to  be  adequate?  Take,   for

instance, when we engage an officer, the officer  in

this  case will say that he expects to rise  to  the

rank of a Governor, and the terms to satisfy such an

officer may be colossal, and I trust that the  words

"adequate abolition terms" will be clarified by  the

Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to the speech of the

Member  for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), much  of

which was quite commendable, I feel I would like  to

comment on one or two statements made by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the question of the schemes in respect

of  low housing formulated by the former Government,

he  asked that credit be given where credit is  due.

That  sounds  to me like the cry of  a  dying  swan,

crying  out  for  credit  and  thanks  in  the  last

flutter. The necessity for any scheme of low housing

was  so  dire and so desperately acute at that  time

that  the last Government had to do something  about

it to justify its existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, his reference to multi-lingualism is

most  surprising. I think his memory is very  short-lived  because  his great leader, my formidable  and

Tarzanesque opponent in Katong in the last election,

when  he was publicly asked whether he or his  Party

was  in  favour of multi-lingualism, he shouted  out

with all the force at his command, "No! Never!" This

gymnastic somersault is most surprising but welcome.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  really  amuses me to know that  the  Progressive

Party  has  thought  fit to draw  the  attention  of

Government  on the question of hawkers. Little  does

the  Member  for  Serangoon  (Mr  Lim  Choon  Mong)

realize  that this is a matter for the City  Council

and  not for this Assembly. I quite believe that  it

is  because  of the defeat of the Progressive  Party

that  the  Member for Serangoon is trying  to  catch

publicity in this Assembly so that by his speech  in

this  Assembly  he  may  be able  to  hypnotise  the

hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the attention of the Member for

Serangoon  that  in  the  City  Council,  when   the

recommendations of the Hawkers Inquiry  Report  came

under  discussion, it was the Progressive Party  who

caused all the obstructions. As a Member of the City

Council,  I  had put forth a number of  suggestions,

but to my great disappointment it was again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



the  Progressive Party who are the majority  in  the

City   Council  that  caused  obstruction  for   the

betterment  of  the  hawkers. I have  also  on  many

instances  tried  to initiate the implementation  of

the Hawkers Advisory Board, which was recommended by

the  Hawkers Commission, but time and again  it  was

turned  down.  I am again very much disappointed  at

that.  But  now  the Progressives come  forward  and

claim that they will look into the interests of  the

hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that when the City and Island

Council  comes into being, the Government will  take

into  consideration the vacant lands  owned  by  the

Crown, so that the hawkers may have public lands  or

private lands to erect more shelters for themselves.

I  have  lately  in  the City  Council  initiated  a

suggestion  to  have prefabricated markets  so  that

instead of putting up elaborate markets at extensive

cost  the  hawkers will be able to put up  temporary

markets, movable at all times at a very low cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak,  not  as  a member of the Opposition  though,

technically, I am sitting on this side of the  House

with  the  somewhat scattered remnants of  the  once

ambitious   party  who,  somehow   or   the   other,

miscalculated  the  intelligence of  the  electorate

and, even worse, miscalculated their choice of songs

and   dances.   There  is  a  lot  of   speculation,

particularly from those who sit on the same side  of

the  House  as myself, but whose views  are  as  far

apart  from me, as from me and the man in the  moon.

They would wish to know, how long is this Government

going  to last, when is it going to finish  up,  and

when they will have another bash? To those gentlemen

who  technically sit together with me I  would  have

them know that the People's Action Party stands  for

freedom  and will fight and support any  party  that

fights for freedom. So long as the parties to  which

hon. Members on the other side belong strive towards

that goal, we in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



the  People's  Action Party will  be  always  behind

them.  We  shall be behind them to support them  and

encourage  them and, at the same time,  to  obstruct

them  resolutely  if they should choose  to  beat  a

hasty  retreat  from their declared goals,  which  I

hope will never happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having prefaced my remarks, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  now  proceed  to deal with  His  Excellency's

Address in which the Labour Front have so gracefully

and so skilfully enunciated their plans and policies

for this coming session. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  in

a  spirit of friendliness and constructive criticism

that  I wish to launch into what the People's Action

Party  considers this policy statement of the Labour

Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased that for the first time since

Stamford Raffles, it has been acknowledged that  the

welfare of the people is directly connected with the

early  attainment  of complete self-government;  and

for  the People's Action Party it can never  be  too

early.  We are pleased that in furtherance  of  this

declared  objective, Malayanisation  of  the  Public

Service occupies an important place, a first  place,

in  the policy statement of the Labour Front,  which

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In pursuance of these aims (the aims of self-government) the Government intends to give its

vigorous  support  to  the policy  of  staffing  the

Public  Service  with  locally  domiciled  officers.

Whilst   seeking  this  objective,  the   Government

recognises  the  just claims of  officers  recruited

from overseas who have taken part in building up the

present administration, and undertakes to look after

their  interests. If any of these officers are found

to be redundant as a result of the implementation of

the   Malayanisation  policy,  the  Government  will

ensure  that adequate abolition terms will be  fixed

having  regard  to the interruption  of  the  career

which  the  officer had a right to  expect  when  he

accepted his appointment. In the meantime,  no  more

expatriate officers will be appointed without  prior

reference   to   the  Council  of   Ministers.   The

Government has implicit confidence in the  continued

loyalty of the Civil Service."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister today has expanded on the

statement  and  said that there will be  no  further

recruitment  of  any  expatriate  on  the  permanent

establishment unless it is absolutely essential.  We

in  the People's Action Party are disappointed  that

this  policy of Malayanisation, this declaration  of

policy,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



does  not  go far enough, and has not laid  down  in

more concrete terms, the methods, the ways and means

by which this policy is to be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Labour Front that they were

somewhat less concerned with quelling the alarms and

anxieties  of expatriate officers when  they  framed

their  election  four-year programme?  This  present

declaration of policy is full of solace, consolation

and  reassurances, of bounties to come and  bounties

to  go.  But  when they went to the electorate,  and

they were elected on this programme, they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front stands for complete and rapid

Malayanisation of the Public Services  by  domiciled

officers.  Transients, whose loyalties are elsewhere

and who regard Malaya merely as a stepping-stone  in

their personal careers, may be retained on temporary

contracts, coterminous with their utility."



<br><br>That is a much fiercer statement, more becoming of a

very  fierce party. But be that as it may,  I  think

the  Labour Front can be confident that if it  fails

in  this Malayanisation policy, then it will fail as

the Progressive Party has failed, for Malayanisation

is  the first test of bona fides, your first act  of

faith.  If you say, "I am going to give you freedom,

I  am  prepared to lose my job to give you freedom,"

then let us see it in the Civil Service. Let us  see

it  in  all  the  Public Services - not  just  in  the

Administrative  Branches - in the Legal  Branches,  in

the City Council and in the Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is necessary, first of all, to remember

what the present position is. By the constitution of

this Colony, the Order in Council, paragraph 11, the

supreme power of appointment to any public office is

vested in the Governor. It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of any law for the time

being  in force in the Colony or to any instructions

from  time  to time given to the Governor under  Her

Majesty's  Sign  Manual  and  Signet  or  through  a

Secretary  of State, the Governor, in Her  Majesty's

name  and  on  Her Majesty's behalf, may  constitute

such judgeships and other offices for the Colony  as

may  be lawfully constituted by Her Majesty and  may

make   appointments   (including   promotions    and

transfers)   to  any  judgeship  or   other   office

constituted for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



Colony,  and any person so appointed shall,  unless

it  is otherwise provided by law, hold office during

Her Majesty's pleasure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Services Commission is constituted by

local  Ordinance. It has powers only to  advise  and

its  advice  can  be ignored. Over and  above  these

powers  reserved by the Governor, the  Secretary  of

State  has  got over-riding powers, by despatch,  to

appoint  any  officer  in any public  service  whose

commencing emolument is above a thousand pounds  per

annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, then, is the present situation in a

dependent  territory, and it is  because  we  are  a

dependent  territory that we were never at Bandoeng.

Sir  John  Kotelawala is in a much more  independent

position,  his  Public  Service  and  the  power  of

appointment to it is laid out in the constitution of

Ceylon - it  is  also  in  our draft  constitution - and

section 6 of the constitution reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The appointment, transfer, dismissal and

disciplinary  control of public officers  is  hereby

vested in the Public Services Commission."



<br><br>Supreme    authority   -   appointment,    transfer,

dismissal, disciplinary control. A similar provision

exists for the judicial officers in Ceylon, and  all

the   officers  on  the  Commission  are  local  men

appointed  by  the Governor-General of Ceylon,  with

the  recommendation or suggestion of the  Government

of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a very great difference, these things,

for  our Public Services Commission does not command

any  respect  or confidence from any member  in  the

Civil Service that I know of. It has been staffed in

its Chairman since its inception, by expatriates, ex-Judges,    ex-Directors   of    Education,    people

conditioned, not out of any wickedness or malice  on

their  part,  but  by  their  years  of  office   as

professional  administrators,  conditioned   to   be

unsympathetic  to  a Malaya that  is  determined  to

Malayanise  at any price, that is determined  to  be

free, that is determined to have its own men run its

own affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a makes of paramount importance that if this

Government   wishes  to  execute   its   policy   of

Malayanisation, there must be a review of the Public

Services Commission, its powers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



constitution,  and there must be a reorientation  of

the policy of that Commission. I would elaborate  on

that  in  a few moments, but first I would  like  to

mention to the Government Benches opposite that  if,

136 years after Stamford Raffles, you end up with 68

expatriate  executive officers as against  23  local

men,  all  these pious protestations of enlightened,

benign, charitable colonial rule just do not  stick.

I  hear the Chief Secretary querying himself. I  beg

his  pardon. 63 to 28 - a little more for the colonial

system.  If, after all these 136 years, out of  that

28,  only three were found capable of becoming,  not

the  Permanent Secretaries who embellish the corners

of   this   House,   but   just   Deputy   Permanent

Secretaries;  I  would say 3 out of  a  hundred  and

thirty-six  years makes it an average  of  45  years

each  to produce a Deputy Permanent Secretary;  that

is  the  glowing tribute to an Administration  which

says,  "We have come here to give you your  freedom.

Slowly, gentlemen."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Paper before the Legislative Council last

year  the  old  Government (which my colleague,  who

really  ought to be on some other side of the  House

than mine, has praised as part of the achievement of

the  old  Government) adopted this Council Paper  in

which  they  suggested  Malayanisation  was  a  very

important  thing, and they should go on with  it  at

the rate of four recruits per annum. At the rate  of

four  recruits per annum to replace the  63  serving

officers  I should think 16 years will be  required,

and  I  believe even his ex-leader said eight years.

Sir,  I  do  not  know  if anybody  worked  out  the

arithmetic of that one. But in this Council Paper it

is stated in paragraph 11:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In view of the shortage of personnel in sister

territories, where possibly the inflow of  qualified

candidates  is  not as great as ours,  we  would  be

helping their recruiting position by withdrawing our

claims  on the services of expatriate staff  of  the

non-specialist category, and review our  indents  on

the  Secretary  of  State  accordingly.  Sarawak  in

particular"-  God bless Sarawak-"has  intimated  the

difficulty   experienced  in  attracting  expatriate

officers  to  her Services because of  the  superior

salary scales offered here. On our part, we can  but

observe  the injunctions in the paragraph  from  the

Command Paper quoted above: it is not hastening, but

regarding, the process of gradual assumption of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  by local people to  continue  to  be

dependent  on  expatriate  staff  when  the   duties

involved  can  be performed just as  well  by  local

people.  Apart from implementing what is really  our

recruitment policy, the employment of local staff of

equivalent  standard  in place of  expatriate  staff

represents a definite financial saving."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an admission by the Committee which sat

on  it,  including  expatriate  officers,  that  the

talents  of  these professional administrators  were

much  more  urgently  required elsewhere,  but  they

chose  to  come  to  Singapore for  some  altruistic

reason connected with the salary scales. And we  are

asked  today,  having attracted  and  retained  them

because   of   this  wonderful  salary,   expatriate

allowances   and   pensionable  and  non-pensionable

expatriate  allowances, to tell  them  that  we  are

sorry   that   since  their  careers   are   to   be

interrupted,     they    must    receive     special

consideration. As, not my friend, but the leader  of

the  Democratic Party - one of the two,  so  one  must

lead - has  said,  there has been  no  clear  detailed

submission of what these abolition terms are; so  my

remarks  here  are purely by way of suggestion.  The

Government has not said what it proposes to do.  The

Government  has  declared  its  intention,  declared

itself  very strongly in favour of compensating  and

comforting  those  who may lose their  jobs.  But  I

think  it  is useful to remember the present  terms,

apart  from abolition terms, the present pensionable

terms  given to a man who is allowed to retire  from

the  Public  Service prematurely, on the  ground  of

temperamental  incompatibility  or  for  reasons  of

health;  he automatically gets a pension at  a  very

early age of life, whatever his age may be, and  for

the rest of his life, and he gets a pension if he is

an    expatriate   officer   on   his    pensionable

expatriation allowance, that allowance which we  pay

him  to attract and retain him but which we continue

to pay him long after we do not want him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, one must remember that it is as well in

these  matters to reach broad agreement between  the

Parties in the House because, as the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  will know, no government can bind  us,  no

declaration of intention, no declaration of  policy,

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



bind   the   succeeding  government,  or  even   the

government  of  the day. Speaking for  the  People's

Action Party, I cannot assure any expatriate officer

largesse galore and bounties galore. Their rights as

public servants will be respected, but we cannot  be

party  to  anything  which  is  by  way  of  special

consolation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on this question of Malayanisation, I

think  there  is  considerable  cynicism  not   only

amongst  local  serving officers, but  also  amongst

local  people  outside the government service.  This

business of looking for talented young men and being

unable  to  find them either in the universities  or

even  in the Public Services themselves is one which

we  have  got  very tired of. Every  year  from  the

University  of Malaya, every year from  universities

in  Britain  and Australia and other  parts  of  the

English-speaking Dominions, returned  students  come

back,  and  I think it is a brave man who would  say

that  they  are not the equal, broadly speaking,  in

intelligence and grit of any other student  anywhere

in  the  world.  And yet, we get this dismal  story.

Where there is personality, for some other reason  a

man  is  not acceptable, probably because  he  holds

views  not akin to those which are held by  the  ex-Director  of  Education or the ex-Puisne  Judge  who

happens to head the Commission and the two gentlemen

who  sit  with  him and who certainly have  not  the

confidence of the people reposed in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think immediately a proper Commission has been

set up, a review must be made of all cases of people

who have been turned down for one reason or another,

for  there is a very strong suspicion that a man who

does  not hold the views which the Government  would

like a civil servant to hold is never allowed to  be

a  public servant. Of course, sometimes a few people

do  become civil servants and then alter their views

so radically that the Government wish they had never

employed  them. But having employed them  and  being

caught  by their rules, they then set about amending

the Pensions Ordinance to see how they can set about

putting  the matter right. I would repeat once  more

that the first test before this Labour Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



is  the  expedition, the drive, with which  they  go

into their Malayanisation policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Labour-Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Labour-Alliance cum colonial

government,  because let it never be forgotten  that

it is not the Chief Minister but the Chief Secretary

who  is  in charge of these matters and he has  them

very  well  under his control; and I  hope  he  will

accept the collective responsibility because  it  is

finally  his Chief Minister who must answer  to  the

electorate  for  his sins of omission  and  sins  of

commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is always said that we, as the Member

for  Serangoon has said, have no talents. If we have

talents,   we  have  no  experience.  If   we   have

experience,  we have no talents. If we have  talents

and  experience, we have no qualification. It is one

of those curious things. So in the City Council, for

instance,  out  of 228 Executive Officers,  159  are

expatriates and 69 are local; and this,  I  believe,

after  four years, or was it six years, of the  good

Progressive   Party  administration  in   the   City

Council. And I think the City Council's servants and

their  friends have had a great deal to do with  the

results  of the last election, because local  people

do  not  take kindly, when you say, as they said  in

the  case of three very senior appointments  in  the

City  Council:  "You  cannot  be  the  Deputy  Water

Engineer because Mr White or Mr Black is senior in

status."  That  was  said on two occasions.  On  the

third occasion the unfortunate Malayan was senior in

status and so they said: "Well, it is very bad luck,

but you have not got anti-malarial experience and so

you  cannot be Deputy Health Officer, and Mr  Green

will be the Deputy Health Officer because he had one

year's special anti-malarial training." That is  the

sort  of  thing that breeds cynicism and a sense  of

hopelessness  that there is no good  faith  in  this

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hope the admission of six new blood,

injected  into  the old colonial system,  will  have

changed  the  whole  outlook and character  of  this

Government. In fact, we are looking forward to  some

drastic changes in its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



outward  manifestations. These are the  difficulties

you  have to face, Mr Speaker, Sir, that unless the

Government  can pursue this policy of Malayanisation

not  only in the Government Public Services, but  in

all the Public Services and, last but not least,  in

the  Singapore Harbour Board, where a very important

Public   Service   is  run  almost  exclusively   by

expatriate  officers, there is going to be  a  great

deal  of, I would not call it sabotage, but I  would

just   say,  general  dislocation,  when  a   really

vigorous  Malayan Nationalist Government takes  over

in  the  very  near  future, when the  Labour  Front

Government, as I hope, would have succeeded by  then

in  removing the gentlemen who ought not  to  be  in

this  House.  I hope therefore they will  give  this

matter   their  earnest  consideration  and,   after

earnest  consideration,  their  untiring  drive  and

devotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, two more important but somewhat less

exciting  matters  like Emergency  Regulations.  The

Labour  Front, particularly the Chief  Minister,  (a

very,  very able exponent of Socialism, having  sat,

according  to one learned American journal,  at  the

feet  of  Mr  Attlee and one Mr Bevan)  has  said,

perhaps in a moment of exuberance, that he wanted to

repeal  the  Emergency  Regulations.  Now,  Sir,  my

Party, for some reason or the other, has always been

the  target  for  rather unhappy,  disconsolate  and

disconcerted attack-that we are extremists, that  we

do not stand for law and order, that we deliberately

foster chaos, dissension and disaster. I think it is

refreshing if this House could be reminded  that  it

was   the  People's  Action  Party  which  carefully

weighed  and  considered the Emergency  Regulations,

and as its election programme said, not a repeal  of

the   Emergency  Regulations,  but  "repeal  of  the

arbitrary  powers  of arrest and  detention  without

trial, of the restrictions on freedoms of speech, of

assembly and of publication, which are all contained

in the Emergency Regulations." It is said with care,

with  circumspection  and with  deliberation - as  the

People's    Action    Party   always    makes    its

pronouncements. We do not issue statements and  then

afterwards want to retract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



them, amend them, and, if possible, tear them up and

forget  that we have ever said them. But it was  the

Labour  Front,  in  a beautifully printed  manifesto

which  says, as the Member for Serangoon  has  said,

that  they  were going to repeal, according  to  the

heading,  "THE  REPRESSIVE  LAWS",  and  I  have  to

endorse, they are repressive laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we either believe in democracy or we do not.

If  we  do, then we must say categorically,  without

qualification, that no restraint from any democratic

process, other than by the ordinary law of the land,

should be allowed. If a man chooses to carry a  hand

grenade  or a revolver, or some other lethal weapon,

in times when the Governor and the High Commissioner

have  proclaimed a state of emergency, then he takes

the  supreme penalty the law has laid down for  him.

But  if  a political party wants to hold an election

meeting,  or  even a post-election meeting  after  7

o'clock,  they  are  told: "We  do  not  believe  in

democracy  after  the election. We only  believe  in

democracy  once in four years, for one month."  That

is  not  the kind of democracy that you can  inspire

men  with, to fight for and die for. That is not the

kind  of democracy that is going to make it tick  in

South-East Asia, if you tell us that we can  hold  a

public  meeting  in  the heat of  the  sun  at  four

o'clock  or five o'clock when nobody would  come  to

listen to us, when therefore there would be no  real

danger of any democratic movement starting, but that

we  cannot  hold a public meeting after  7  o'clock,

when  by  the habits of the workers they would  have

returned  from work, the earth has got  cooler,  the

walls  have got cooler, the night is getting  mellow

and  warm speeches can be made. But, no! That is not

allowed. And yet, we are asked to believe that  this

is  democracy.  I must say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

this  is  a  very  queer and curious democracy,  the

definition  of which is not in the P.A.P. pamphlets.

I  sincerely hope the Labour Front will have time - I

acknowledge  that they have not as yet had  time  to

consider all these aspects for the time being, but I

hope  they  will  have the time - to consider  whether

they would place their faith in democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe in democracy, you must believe in

it  unconditionally. If you believe that men  should

be  free,  then they should have the right  of  free

association,  of  free speech, of free  publication.

Then no law should permit those democratic processes

to  be  set  at  nought, and no excuse,  whether  of

security,   inconvenience   to   the   traffic,   or

inconvenience  to police officers,  should  allow  a

government to be deterred from doing what  it  knows

to  be  right,  and what it must know to  be  right.

There  are, of course, a number of relaxations  such

as the firing of crackers after dark, and I am quite

sure that someone has said, I do not know whether it

is  stated  in malice, Mr Speaker, Sir, but  it  is

said  that  perhaps  they wanted  the  Labour  Front

supporters to be able to fire crackers, to celebrate

their  victory after dark. But I am quite sure  that

there  will  have  to  be a  great  deal  of  heart-searching on this question of Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister in his pamphlet and in

his  broadcasts under the old apple tree, which  has

stopped  bearing apples ever since, has  said  again

and  again, "Out with it! It is unjust! We  are  the

inheritors  of  a  magnificent system  of  justice."

Well, let us have it now. Let us now, now that it is

in  the  hands of people who have such  fervent  and

fiery  convictions, translate them into action.  Let

us  see  whether this fiery demagogue is  a  man  of

action.  I  would say if he would go as far  as  the

People's  Action Party, which has said these  things

perhaps with less zeal or resilience, warmth,  fire,

expression,   but   with  more  circumspection   and

deliberation, he would have done very  well  indeed,

and he would be assured of the support of my Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, may I, after being somewhat uncomplimentary

on   the   Emergency  Regulations,  compliment   his

Minister  for  Labour for the prompt  assertion  and

categorical  statement that trade unions  should  be

allowed  to  take  part  in  politics?  Some   other

gentleman who thought trade unions should  not  take

part  in  politics but should form organizations  as

they do in America has now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



been  put into premature retirement and I think that

is just as well for himself and for the public which

he  never  served. And we also like to  express  our

happiness  that this foolish business of  preventing

Government  trade unions from mixing up  with  other

trade  unions  just  in case they get  revolutionary

ideas  about  how to deal with their employers,  the

Singapore Government - we are glad that that  is  also

gone. But let me remind the Minister for Labour that

there  is  such  a thing called the  Trade  Disputes

Ordinance,  I think passed some time in 1941 - perhaps

the  Hon. the Attorney-General will correct me if  I

am  wrong - and it is a copy, more or less,  from  the

English   Trade   Disputes  Act   passed   in   1927

immediately after the General Strike. It was  passed

by a Tory Government that was determined to see that

there  was  no other general strike in Britain  like

the  one they saw that year. It was opposed bitterly

by  the whole British trade union movement, and  the

first  act  of the British Labour Government,  which

had  a majority in the House of Commons in 1945, was

to  pass  a  complete repeal of this Trade  Disputes

Act. Now, Sir, I hope I will have the opportunity in

the  near future of congratulating the Minister  for

Labour  for an equally expeditious despatch of  this

piece of anti-labour legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, to multi-lingualism. Lots of people

change their views lots of times, but I have yet  to

see  the  cool  impertinence, the insolence  of  the

Member  for Serangoon. He is either deaf, or perhaps

he  is  a  man with considerable courage in  telling

things  which are not true, and we look  forward  to

the energetic advance of the cause of the people, of

the  non-English-speaking peoples in Singapore  from

the  Progressive Party. Almost everybody  lives  and

learn, even the Progressive Party; but I think it is

a little bit too late in the day for them to support

multi-lingualism. The former Member for Katong said,

"I oppose - with all my strength," and somebody else

came  up with a policy statement, I believe  it  was

someone  very close to the former Member for Katong,

the Member for Tanglin, who came up with some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



great  categorical assertions on what is  right  and

proper  for Singapore. Having been born and bred  in

some  other  part  of the world,  he  must  be  well

qualified to say this. We wish the Labour Government

now  every success in implementing it; we hope  that

they will not be beguiled by the suggestions made by

the  Member for Serangoon into making it a  failure.

It  has  got to be made a success. There is a  clear

mandate from the people; they want it; they want  to

try  it. The principle is accepted, and let us  make

it work for their sake and for our sake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say on education that I was

somewhat disappointed. When the Labour Front set out

the education programme they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front's Policy on education is free

compulsory schooling for all children, in English or

vernacular  schools, for the first six  years  as  a

matter of first priority. Thereafter scholarships or

grants may be provided in deserving cases."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, somehow, when it was translated into the

Address  by His Excellency, the position,  I  think,

has been somewhat diluted. I just would like to make

sure  that  I have not misunderstood it.  What  they

have  said is: "The policy of the Government  is  to

aim  at  equal  treatment for all  schools  and  all

teachers  in those schools. The foundation stone  of

the policy will be a six-year course of free primary

education  for all children." It could be  construed

to  mean including vernacular schools. On the  other

hand,  it  can  be construed not to  mean  including

vernacular schools, and I hope the Director - one gets

so  used to colonialism that one is apt to refer  to

the  "Director of Education" - the Hon. the  Minister

for  Education  will elucidate this  at  some  later

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the word "compulsory" been dropped? One

must  assume  that the Labour Front is  a  party  of

intellectuals, not all of whom, of course, have  had

the  benefit  of  a  three months'  cram  course  on

Socialism,  but nevertheless capable of  cogent  and

deliberate thought. There must have been good reason

why  "compulsory"  was  put in  the  programme,  and

"compulsory"  is the People's Action  Party's  view,

for no child should go without education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



Now,  the  Labour Bill. We congratulate  the  Labour

Front  in  its ambition to try and bring  the  Armed

Services  within  the  Labour Bill,  but  we  cannot

congratulate them for not attempting to  bring  them

within  all  the  other Codes,  including  Workmen's

Compensation, the Central Provident Fund as it  will

be  amended,  and all the rest of it. Why  only  the

Labour Bill? Why should the Armed Services be  in  a

special position of immunity? Only as and when  they

please,  they  would say, "We will be bound  by  the

Code,  but only by our leave and licence." It  is  a

matter  which affects a very large number of  people

in  Singapore, and I take it that it is  because  it

affects  a  very large number of people in Singapore

that  the  Labour Front in their four-year programme

said:  "The  Labour Front will seek to  provide  for

similar   conditions  of  service  to  the  civilian

employees  of the three Services as are  offered  to

Government  servants  of the Colony."  I  would  not

imagine that that was said not purely to get  votes,

but  surely  also  to see that very large  sections,

some 40,000 civilian employees in the Army, Navy and

Air  Force, are given conditions of employment which

are  akin  to  those offered by  the  Crown  in  its

manifestation as the Singapore Government.  I  would

not wish to remind Members on the other side that if

you  say that the Crown is one and indivisible, then

you  should act according to your theory  and  treat

employees of the Crown, be they government  servants

or  employees  of the Armed Services,  on  the  same

footing.  It  is a matter, I think,  which  will  be

received   with  great  approval  by  the   civilian

employees of the Armed Services. There again, I hope

the Chief Minister - it does not appear to fall within

any   other   Minister's  duties - would  review   the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the land acquisition and the Torrens system, we

extend our hearty congratulations to both the  Chief

Minister  and  his colleague primarily  responsible,

the Minister for Lands and Housing. We hope that  he

will be able to translate that policy into action as

quickly as possible and they can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



assured   of   our  friendly  and  our  constructive

support.  But  there is one thing about  housing  to

which  I  think  I  must draw the attention  of  the

Member  for  Ulu Bedok. Perhaps that is why  he  has

chosen rural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one does not make these promises to a

relatively enlightened electorate and then forget to

mention them subsequently. If there is an urgent and

cogent reason why it cannot be done, then the public

has a right to know why. They have said on page 4 of

the Labour Front programme:"A  reduction  of  the  present  interest  rates  on

Government  loans  to the S.I.T., thereby  providing

for  cheaper  rentals  for Trust  accommodation  and

carrying  this important social amenity to a  larger

number  of the lower income group." Now, Sir,  there

are  a  large number of people living in Improvement

Trust flats and I believe a large number of them are

voters and they have been promised this - as they have

been  promised by the People's Action Party that  if

ever they get into this Legislature - an abolition  of

the  interest  to  the Singapore Improvement  Trust.

Sir, the Labour Front has said that they believe  in

subsidized  housing.  So does  the  People's  Action

Party.  If  housing is going to be subsidized,  then

the first act it can do, the least it can do, is  to

remove  this piece of businesslike economics on  the

part  of the Singapore Government, supported so ably

previously  by the Progressive Party and  I  believe

even  sometimes by the present Minister  for  Labour

and Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No, no! Never!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Never? I withdraw. But be that

as it may, there you are; three per cent interest to

the   Singapore  Improvement  Trust.  Is  it  2�?

Whatever it is - 3, 4, and everything breaks even. You

collect  rent, you pay the caretaker, you  whitewash

once in six years or whatever it may be, and you pay

your Improvement Trust trustees, directors, manager,

estate  managers, estate supervisors, and  you  have

the profit for it. Then you can go to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



people  and  say,  "We  have got  a  sound  economy.

Singapore is flourishing."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think these Improvement Trust flat-dwellers are very pleased about the rates they are

paying,  and I also do not believe that this promise

made  to  them was completely unconnected  with  the

election results. I think they are entitled, if  not

to  a  reduction  as was offered,  to  a  very  good

explanation  why  the reduction  is  not  now  being

offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of this Passenger Transport Board,

Sir,  the  People's Action Party  never  said,  even

though  they always like to believe these things  of

the  People's Action Party, that they were going  to

nationalize all these beautiful trams and omnibuses.

But  the Labour Front did, and nobody said that they

were  extremists. They said on page 6,  "The  Labour

Front   will  nationalize  the  passenger  transport

system  in  Singapore",  and  after  that  came  the

announcement that they are going to have a board  to

fix  fares  and  calculate mileages. How  did  these

things  come  to  pass? One finds it  difficult  to

understand  it. Here they say in the  Address:  "The

unsatisfactory state of public transport  calls  for

early   action,  and  to  this  end  the  Government

contemplates the setting up of a Transport Authority

which  will  include in its functions the allocation

of  routes and the fixing of fares." What about this

nationalisation?  Does  nationalisation   mean   the

allocation of routes and the fixing of fares?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Singapore Traction Company's charter

is   due  to  expire  in  June  this  year,  and   a

Progressive   Party-dominated   City   Council   had



expressed  a desire earlier that it had no intention

of  upsetting  this system of free enterprise.  Free

enterprise! We are all free; we are all  equal  men.

If  you fail, it is because your luck is not as good

as  mine and you do not work as hard as I. They said

they  did  not want to upset things. The charter  is

expiring  soon  and the City Council can  take  over

this  transport system intact. The Company is making

profits ranging, over the last four years, from  the

rate  of  one  and  a half million  to  two  million

dollars a year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



according  to their Singapore operative accounts  of

profits  published. But the City Council passed  the

buck  up  to  the Singapore Government, "We  do  not

think  we ought to take over. Why do you not form  a

Public  Transport Board?" But the L.P.T.B. and  the

Singapore  Government then, with all these  go-slow,

play-safe  gentlemen who no longer are  here,  said:

"Oh,  no.  We  do  not think we  ought  to  do  such

things." But I am sure hon. Members opposite are not

of the same calibre or the same inclination, even if

they are of the same intention as the gentlemen  who

occupied seats in that old Council which was  always

placed  in the Victoria Memorial Hall, where  people

hold concerts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think action should be taken. The People's

Action   Party  believes  that  here  is   a   clear

opportunity where, without having to pass any  Bill,

a  notice  could  be given to the Company  informing

them  that  by  the end of this year the  Government

intends  to put up a Transport Board and  take  over

their  assets.  There  is no cutting  short  of  any

expectation  involved. And even if  operative  costs

were  to  go  up  for some unknown  reasons,  either

because the officers in strategic position decide to

retire  rather than to make the system  function,  I

think  still there would certainly be no loss. There

is no loss in any public transport board anywhere in

the  world. The railways which never make money  are

always nationalized and the State always pay for it.

But private road transport is never nationalized and

all   the   profits   go  to   the   directors   and

shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is up to the Labour Front to tell the

people  what  they propose to do about this,  and  I

think it is important that they should remember that

the   responsibility  of  power  should  not  cause

confusion  with  responsibility to  the  people  who

elected them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last of all the other points in this Labour Front

declaration  of policy is the question  of  national

service.  The  People's Action Party still  says  in

categorical  terms that no government  that  is  not

elected by the people, no government which has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



the  right  to  make wars, or declare  wars  in  the

interests  of  the people, should conscript,  should

have the right to say:



"You will train and you will die for us." Sir, I  am

no  apologist for being anti-colonial. My Party says

clearly  that  we like freedom and we  do  not  like

colonialism, and we are prepared to fight it all the

way - by democratic and constitutional methods of mass

struggle, in case the Attorney-General has any ideas

about  anything. Now, Sir, Mr Nehru  never  had  to

say: "I am pro-British, but I hate colonialism." Mr

Nehru  spent  many  years of  his  life  in  British

prisons   in  India.  He  never  hated  the  British

personally.  And  I can assure all  these  gentlemen

here  who  are not Malayans, that we in the People's

Action  Party do not hate any Englishman  personally

because  he is an Englishman. Of course,  there  are

some Englishmen we hate for some other reasons.  But

we are not afraid to say that we are one hundred per

cent  against colonialism and we are not making  any

qualification about it by being pro-British. It is a

difference of approach. The day I can say, "I  am  a

free  man.  This  is my country", that  day  I  will

welcome you as a friendly host would do a guest. But

I will not be a guest in my own country. That is our

attitude.  Mr  Nehru never agreed to  allow  Indian

soldiers to fight British battles in Saigon, in Indo-China  or  in  Indonesia. He  wrote  many  a  strong

lamentation.  When  imprisoned  together  with   his

colleagues, he was helpless and impotent, while  the

British recruited Indians to fight their battles. No

nationalist, no man who says, "I am a Malayan; I  am

proud  to  be a Malayan, and I am going to see  that

there  is  an independent, democratic Malaya",  will

say,  "Let us train to be soldiers." What  for?  Why

for?  Whom  are we going to fight? Who is  going  to

decide  we are going to be involved in a war or  not

to  be  involved in a war? Who is going  to  be  our

ally?  Who  is to be our foe? There is no  provision

anywhere  in  the  National Service Ordinance  which

says  that  a man cannot be sent overseas  to  fight

some other battle in some other battlefield. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



my submission it would be un-Malayan to say that our

youth  should  train and fight for  somebody  else's

battles.  That  is the stand of the People's  Action

Party before the election, and that is the stand  of

the People's Action Party now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, we come to the milk and honey, the

economy. Before the elections we had some, if I  may

say  so  with great respect, Sir, really  patriotic,

very    expressive   phrases   which   stick.   "Our

economy" - and  I  am told from very reliable  sources

who  the author of this little bit was - "is to fulfil

the  urgent  need of the rapidly growing population.

The  Labour Front stands for a reorganization of its

economy,  now  cast in the role of a milching  cow."

Sir,  I do not know why "milching", because I always

thought  it was "milch cow"; but perhaps it  is  for

the  rhythm and the milk in it. And quite good.  But

what  a  far cry from this: "We must not  alarm  our

businessmen." If that was not designed to alarm  the

businessmen  I  do not know what that  was  designed

for.  The Labour Front said categorically: "We stand

for  reorganization of our economy. We are not going

to  have  this 136-years' trading outpost forever  a

trading  outpost. We are going to industrialize.  We

are  going to do this and we are going to do  that.

We are going to subsidize this. We are going to make

sure  that  these things are done." They  were  good

things  and they are still good things. The People's

Action  Party  still believes in those  things,  and

they hope the Labour Front still does. But this is a

very far cry from the anxious reassurances that have

been issued time and time again since April the 2nd.

Capital will not fly from this country, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for one very good reason - because it is  making

good  profits.  All  the  assurances  and  all   the

blandishments  of  the Labour Front  and  its  Chief

Minister will not attract one cent here if that  one

cent is not going to produce two cents by the end of

the year. Anyone who cares to pay his fifty cents to

the Companies Registry could check the profits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



and balance sheets of Robinson's, White-away's, John

Little's,  and United Metal Works. You  do  not  get

foreign  capital because you are nice to  them.  You

get  foreign capital because you offer returns.  And

there  are returns. There is no need, in my opinion,

to  try and appease these men who say: "Otherwise  I

am  going  home, and when I go home,  God,  you  are

finished  lah." Well, I would like to see them  try.

They will not go, because we offer them profits. All

this scare, all this fright to reassure them is,  in

my  opinion, quite unnecessary. A sober policy  will

impress  upon them this fact, that this  country  is

not  interested  in having factories and  industries

for the sake of factories and industries, but in  so

far  as  these  factories and  industries  pay  high

wages, increase the national income and increase the

standard  of living. We are not interested in  trade

for  trade's  sake.  We  are interested  in  income,

national  income, an increase in national income.  I

see   the  Financial  Secretary  doing  some  mental

calculations,  but  I  think  I  am  right.  If  you

increase the national income and you spread it  more

equitably  all  around, a larger number  of  persons

will  have  more money to buy singlets, sandals  and

short pants, even if they cannot buy bush jackets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important, in my opinion,

that  we should assure the Labour Front that a cold,

deliberate,  calculating policy,  as  enunciated  in

their programme, will not drive any capital out  and

will  do  a  great deal to bring about a  more  just

distribution  of wealth. And then you will  have  no

more  of these smouldering slag-heap fumes poisoning

the  air,  and we shall have more of the  peace  and

prosperity  which we, I think on all  sides  of  the

House,   even  those  who  belong  to   some   other

countries, want here. Because we are attracting  and

retaining  them  they  would also  like  to  see  us

prosperous and happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is this vision which drives the People's

Action  Party on and on. We have not come here,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in order that some laws may be  passed

and some laws may be unpassed. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



us,  and I say this, that I am more of a Malayan and

more  English educated even than the Chief  Minister

himself;  for  us it is the vision  of  a  free  and

independent,  democratic Malaya - a small  country  of

seven millions, but proud and free. Proud because it

is  independent in an Asia which is reasserting  its

self-respect.     We     believe     in     freedom,

unconditionally.  We  have  no  fears,  no   terrors

because those who have protected us for so long will

no  longer  protect us, because they are not  making

profits  out of us, or because we are not  going  to

pay  them expatriation allowances. For us it is this

dream,  this  hope  which, in our opinion,  is  just

round  the  corner; of a Malaya  in  which  all  its

peoples, regardless of class, race or religion, will

be  given  the same opportunities to live their  own

lives,  preserve their own cultures, even their  own

languages,  in  so  far as it is compatible  with  a

Malaya  which  is  united  together  in  one  common

purpose;  a  Malaya  in which all  its  peoples  are

dedicated  to its own prosperity, its own happiness;

and  in which there will be none of this bitterness,

frustrations,   angers,  between  race   and   race,

religion and religion, or even class and class. That

is  the Malaya that we dream of, that we will  fight

for,  and,  if  necessary, go to jail for,  and,  if

necessary,  die for. And so far as the Labour  Front

pursues  a policy which leads this country  to  that

goal,  the People's Action Party will be with  them,

as  we  would  be with any party that pursues  those

aims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel even more strongly, even though we cannot

express  it with the same bitterness, that  all  the

injustices, all the wickedness of the past, and  all

these     indecent    discrepancies    of    wealth,

opportunities, fortunes of the past are things  that

should never have been and would never have been  if

there    had   been   an   independent   government,

responsible to the people it was supposed to govern.

It  was  because  they  had a  lot  of  professional

administrators who were determined to do  what  they

thought  in their text books and in their experience

in other territories was the right thing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



to  do  and  who  got, for the sake of  cover,  men,

supine, servile, bred in a generation that has  lost

its  self-respect,  to  support  them  as  committee

members,  men  on whom are ultimately showered  even

K.B.E.'s. That is a Malaya which we are ashamed  of.

And  we  say - it is not in His Excellency's speech - we

say  this from the bottom of our hearts, that we are

ashamed of the people who have sold us for so  long,

those - some  people do not like the word - "Quislings".

But  they sold out the people all the same for  very

good  reason. They believe in peaceful  and  orderly

foreign government. They believe that the local  man

is not as good as the white man. They believe if you

have  the qualification you must have the experience

and anyway you have not got the tradition. They were

the  people who for long, long years have made fools

of  us.  And  when the people went to the  polls  on

April the 2nd it was they who were rejected, perhaps

forever,  because Asia today will not tolerate  such

men. You may be silent before an official because it

is  prudent to be silent and submissive. But in your

heart  you  neither respect him nor admire  him  for

what  he does. And they cast their votes for  people

who  are  prepared to fight colonialism. Not because

they   want  disruption,  disorder,  disaster,   but

because they, like us, share this vision of  a  free

country  where a Malayan who is proud and  free  can

look  any  man in the eye and say: "I am a  Malayan,

this  is my country, this is my home. I am proud  of

it, I will make it better and better as the years go

by, more just and more just." And it is that Malaya,

that  dream, that drives the People's Action  Party,

and that has sent four representatives here to help,

to  encourage,  to exhort, to advise, and  sometimes

even to admonish the Labour Front a little - always in

the  hope  that  it  will go for  that  goal  of  an

independent,   democratic  Malaya   and   no   other

attenuated version. That is our dream, and  we  hope

it  is your dream for the sake of yourselves, of the

Labour Front and the Alliance, and of the people not

only of Singapore but of Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I think we have all listened with

very great interest, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the Member

for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew). He reminds  me

irresistibly of the old cock in the story who turned

to  his admiring harem of wives, having observed the

first signs of dawn in the sky, and said, "I am  now

going  to  make the sun rise." He then  flapped  his

wings,  crowed vigorously and continuously,  and  in

due  course  the sun rose. Throughout his incursions

into  the  debate the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

pointed  out  the things that we have  said  we  are

going  to  do, and then he says, "I am now going  to

crow very vigorously to make sure that you do them."

I  think he is premature in crowing about it; he had

better wait and see whether the sun does rise before

he makes so much of this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But there may be an eclipse. One

never knows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The sun still rises even

behind  an  eclipse, is still going up, and  finally

emerges.  The  Member for Tanjong Pagar  raised  one

question about Malayanisation, where he referred  to

one part of this well-known document (Labour Front's

Four-year Programme), but I think he has not read on

far  enough  to  notice  No.  12  of  the  Four-year

Programme:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front will immediately expand

technological training at all levels  not  only  for

the  young but also for those at present functioning

in  Government  service and commercial  undertakings

with   a   view  to  entrusting  locally   domiciled

personnel  with the responsibilities that  they  are

now  deprived  of  but  which  responsibilities  are

essential  for  the  effective control  of  our  own

planned economy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in regard to the Departments that come

within  my  own Ministry (Ministry of Communications

and  Works),  there  is a very real  need  for  this

expansion  of technological training. It is  useless

putting a man to build an airport who does not  know

how to build it. You will not get an airport out  of

it.  It  is  a  fact  that before  I  got  into  the

Ministry,  there had been advertisements out  almost

on  name  your own terms for technical  people,  and

nobody has cared to name his terms, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



he is already satisfactorily employed elsewhere, and

there is that real problem, that you have got to get

technical training before you can go on to putting a

man into the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also made some

complaint  about an undue tenderness by  the  Labour

Front  towards the capitalists, and assured us  that

it  was  quite unnecessary to say anything  nice  to

capitalists at all. I do not mind about that in  the

least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether he gets the documents of the

Socialist International Information -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Far from it, my dear Sir. It

is published by Morgan Philips, or somebody. Anyhow,

it comes to me from that sort of source. I have here

anyhow   the  People's  National  Party   Plan   for

Development  in Jamaica. This was their  approximate

equivalent of our little green booklet -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Whose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The People's National Party,

not "Action", in Jamaica.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We pledge the fullest support in the maintenance

and improvement of all schemes and laws designed  to

attract foreign capital to Jamaica for investment in

local  industry. We guarantee to maintain the utmost

good  faith in our relations for investors,  and  to

give  them  security and protection  in  all  proper

ways.  We explicitly repudiate and condemn all  talk

to the contrary as mere election propaganda."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this People's National Party is, of course, a

member of the Socialist International, and it is Mr

Norman Manley, a Queen's Counsel, and a man of  very

high standing and a very well reputed Socialist, who

has  just put out a thoroughly - perhaps I had  better

not  use  unparliamentary language - a pamphlet  about

Mr  Bustamente's Labour Party, which  was  no  more

Labour than other Labour parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to one further thing - my eloquence cannot

keep  your attention for an hour, as the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar succeeded in doing - the matter  of  the

nationalisation  of the passenger transport  system.

There are, I think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



four  criteria  which should be checked  before  you

attempt to nationalise any industry. I have  a  note

on them in my file, but I think I can deal with them

without  referring  to it. The  first  one  is, of

course,   that  it  must  produce  efficiency,   and

preferably more efficiency than you had with the un-nationalised industry. Another point is,  of  course

that   it   must   reduce  or   completely   abolish

monopolistic exploitation. It must form  a  part  of

the overall planning of the economy, and it must  be

ripe  for  nationalisation at the time  that  it  is

taken  over.  It  is no use nationalising  something

before  it  is  ripe.  And  a  further  point  about

nationalisation which could be added to  the  fourth

criterion   is   that   in   certain   circumstances

nationalisation  is necessary in order  to  get  the

capital required for some form of development  which

you  cannot expect to get from private sources. You

have to get it from public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the nationalisation of passenger transport in

Singapore  is  not  a  matter of  nationalising  the

Singapore  Traction Company. My impression  is  that

they  would  be  happy to sell  themselves  to  the

Government  if  the Government were willing  to  buy

them; and probably a number of other companies would

also, in fact have been hopefully looking for- ward

to  a  Labour Front victory with a view  to  saying,

"Now  I  have got so many routes licensed. Will  you

kindly take over and I can sit back and live on  the

profits  for the rest of my life?" That  is  not  my

notion of nationalisation by any means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we should nationalise passenger

transport,  but  I am not prepared to  say  that  we

should  immediately  rush out and  hand  out  public

funds to a lot of transport operators, some ten  or

twelve  companies,  operating  on  this  very  small

island, until we have gone first through the process

of   rationalisation  and  getting  things  into   a

reasonably  orderly system, from  which  we  can  go

forward  to the next step when the time is ripe.  It

is  not,  as far as I know, possible to give  exact

figures  yet for what the cost of nationalising  the

industry at present would be. If we take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>





passenger  transport simply in the usual meaning  of

buses  and  trolley-buses, it is probable  that  the

Singapore  Traction Company does not represent  more

than  about  50 per cent of the total  capital  that

would  be  required for the takeover; and there  are

going to be very urgent and necessary projects which

will  call for considerable sums of capital,  and  I

think  that it is fair to say that with the existing

powers,  and  with the powers that may  have  to  be

added,  it  will  be  possible  to  deal  with   the

passenger   transport  system  and  to  make   quite

considerable   improvements   without    necessarily

immediately  having to go over into  nationalisation

of  the whole industry at once. I am not prepared at

this stage to indicate precisely what detailed plans

I  have  in  mind in this connection, but they  will

come  before this House at. I hope, quite  an  early

date and will provide a more lengthy opportunity for

discussion.  But  I  would like  to  revert  to  the

People's National Party Programme again where  they,

on  a  rather similar island, Jamaica, also envisage

first of all a radical reorganisation and reform  of

public transport outside the corporate area, that is

to  say,  the system of passenger transport  dealing

primarily  with the rural areas, which is of  course

one  of  the  most  important parts  of  the  future

development of passenger transport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, knowing the

temper  of this House today on multi-lingualism,  he

must be a very brave man indeed to explain the stand

that  the  Progressive Party took on this  question.

Our  Party had never made an issue of this  question

in our platform. We had left it to the honest belief

and  opinion of each individual member. We were  the

only Party honest enough not to make capital out  of

it  to catch votes. We found it to our cost, but  we

were  prepared to face the issue and let the  people

of  Singapore  know that we would  rather  lose  the

election  than try something which, to our mind,  is

impracticable and impossible for the time being.  We

never  said  we were against it. Being a Chinese,  I

would  like  to see Chinese spoken in this  Chamber,

but can you,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



gentlemen,  visualise  six  languages  being  spoken

today?  That is our stand. In this election  it  was

impossible,  and we made it clear.  Mr  Laycock  on

that  day spoke for himself. He never mentioned  our

Party - that  was our Party directive - and if  he  made

that  mistake,  it was the Member for Katong's  (Mr

Braga's) gain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What do you say today?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> We have never been against it.

Let us try it out in the City and Island Council. It

takes time, Sir, to obtain interpreters. You have to

have   at  least  16  interpreters.  You  have  your

additional  staff,  and it will cost  you  a  pretty

penny,  which  can  be  much better  spent  on  your

welfare work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after attacking the Chief Minister. I want to

give him a bouquet. I congratulate him -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Orchids.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> - on his very quick action in

putting through this legal free aid to the poor. Two

or three years ago we took up this question with the

support  of  another gentleman. That failed  because

of,  shall we say, vested interests. I am very  glad

indeed  to  see it being pushed through so  rapidly,

and I think it will have a very important bearing on

the  new  Faculty  of Law. It will provide  work,  a

great  deal of work, for the young men who  will  be

qualified locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister started by saying that

the  law of the jungle was applied to trade in  this

country,  and  that the "taipans" of  business  grew

very  fat on it. That may be true, but at this time,

when we are changing to a Socialist government,  let

us  not be ungrateful, for it is they who have built

us  this  golden heritage. But for them,  our  Chief

Minister may still be speaking under the apple  tree

instead of in this well-appointed House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the uncertainty of the elections, it is most

reassuring  to  see that Government recognises  that

commerce is the lifeblood of the local economy. This

has  never  been  mentioned in  the  Labour  Front's

election platform, nor in its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



Four-year Programme. This has always been the  chief

aim of the Progressive Party. Tied to this, however,

is  the  encouragement of local industries,  and  an

endeavour  to  seek more equitable  distribution  of

wealth.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan

Yew)  seems  to  think  that just  by  shouting  the

words - "You   will  make  profit  in   Singapore" - the

capitalists will come. We shall find that is a great

mistake.  Without  security, stability  and  without

people  who  wish  to  invest their  money  in  this

country  knowing that they are going to get  a  safe

return  in  future  years, you  will  not  get  your

factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest aims of this Labour Front is

social  welfare work. We all agree with this and  we

shall all support it; but we must be careful not  to

push  it  too far, because once you go on  with  all

these  schemes there must be all sorts of  taxation.

And  when you have taxation, you are going  to  curb

local  industries.  When the prices  of  your  local

products  are  too  high, you  will  have  to  apply

controls.  Controls  mean the  curtailment  of  your

entrepot trade. It requires a magician to keep these

three   undertakings - trade,  local  industries   and

equitable distribution of wealth - going together, and

we  shall  wait with great interest to see  how  our

chief  magician,  our Chief Minister,  juggles  with

these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of housing, I think we are all

agreed  that it is essential and it is not necessary

for  any Party to claim any credit. What we want  to

know  is  how  rapidly  and  how  cheaply  will  the

Minister  for  Local Government, Lands  and  Housing

(Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) be able to  build

his houses. In one of the election campaigns I think

it was mentioned that loans would be given to people

who wish to purchase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



houses  without interest. As a businessman,  I  have

never  known  how  it is possible  to  obtain  money

without paying interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A most striking note about Government's policy on

the  question of housing is the problem of  clearing

of  slum and attap areas, and in the Address it  was

mentioned  that it may have to be met  by  the  most

vigorous and, in some cases, drastic measures. Well,

the  clearing  of  slums  has  already  caused  much

distress and much consternation. Last Sunday I spent

the  whole  day going through 40 houses  which  have

been  ordered to be demolished. These 40 houses  are

inhabited   by   400  people.  I   have   gone   and

investigated the cases, and I am satisfied that the

compensation offered by the Government is, shall  we

say,  by  a colonial government, and cannot  be  one

that is to be offered by our Labour Front. Some were

offered  lands  in Jurong, which is about  14  miles

from  the  place where they are to be shifted,  that

is, on the south end of the Airport.

It is not possible to forecast how many boys; clubs may be started

in the constituency of Tanglin in 1955 as the readiness of the youth service to

assist is only one of the factors to be taken into consideration. Other principal

factors are the spontaneous desire and efforts of public-spirited members of the

public. The siting of boys' clubs in particular is not a matter which is decided

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for Education how many primary

and secondary schools have been approved for construction during the

year 1955; and how many of these schools are expected to be completed in 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Because of piling and constructional difficulties encountered,

it is difficult to separate the building of schools into quotas for calendar years.

For the combined period 1952-54 the number of schools approved was 38 Primary and 3 Secondary.

Of that number 10 Primary and 2 Secondary were completed by 31st March, 1955; the rest were all

under construction. It is expected that 9 Primary and one Secondary will be completed by

mid-1955, 12 Primary by the end of 1955, and the remaining 7 very early in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen additional Primary schools, and 6 Secondary schools have been approved in the 1955

Estimates.  While work will begin on all of them in 1955, it is not expected that any of them will

be ready for occupation before February 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the number of schools which will be finished and ready for

occupation during the calendar year 1955 will be 23 Primary and one Secondary. These

figures do not include an extension which will double the accommodation of one school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme approved includes, in addition, the building of two Secondary

Technical Schools. Work on these is in progress.
