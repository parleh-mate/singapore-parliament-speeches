<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION REPORT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will

recall  that  I  made a Ministerial  Statement  in

Parliament  on  22nd December  last  year  on  the

setting  up  of a Constitutional Commission  under

the  chairmanship  of  the  Honourable  the  Chief

Justice, with the Speaker as Deputy Chairman,  and

consisting  of  eminent legal  persons,  with  the

following terms of reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To receive and consider representations on

how the rights of the racial, linguistic and

religious   minorities  can  be   adequately

safeguarded in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To consider what provisions should be made

to  ensure that no legislation, which by its

practical  application is considered  likely

to  be discriminatory against members of any

racial, linguistic or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



religious  group, should be  enacted  before

adequate  opportunities have been given  for

representation  from parties  likely  to  be

aggrieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To consider what remedies should be provided

for  any  citizen or group of  citizens  who

claim   that   he   or   they   have    been

discriminated against by any act or decision

of  the government or the administration  or

any   statutory   board   or   public   body

constituted  by  law and  to  recommend  the

machinery for the redress of any complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To consider how such provisions can be

entrenched in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission presented its Report to the

President on 27th August, 1966, and copies of this

Report  have  been tabled before  this  House  for

information  and study by Members.  This  valuable

Report  is the culmination of careful deliberation

by  eminent  legal personalities  and  I  wish  to

record  Government's appreciation of their  public

service.  I wish to take the opportunity  also  to

thank  the  various individuals and  organisations

listed in the Appendices to the Report, for  their

representations  and  views  which  were  of  much

assistance to the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Commission have

received   the   very  careful  consideration   of

Government and I am glad to state that most of the

recommendations are acceptable in their  entirety.

On others, while Government agrees in principle to

the  recommendations, it differs in  the  detailed

recommendations.  A  few of  the  recommendations,

however, are not acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has made various recommendations

in  regard to the protection of fundamental rights

and  freedoms of the individual and the manner  in

which  the  various provisions of the Constitution

ought  to  be entrenched. The Commission has  also

suggested the creation of a non-elected advisory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



body  to be called the "Council of State", with  a

small  membership, not subject to dissolution  but

renewing  itself  at  regular  intervals  by   the

retirement and replacement of a proportion of  its

members  in  rotation, and  the  creation  of  the

office     of    Ombudsman    (or    Parliamentary

Commissioner). The Commission also touched on  two

matters  not  expressly covered by their  specific

terms of reference, namely, the Judiciary and  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal briefly with these recommendations.

At  Chapter  II  of their Report,  the  Commission

makes  recommendations in regard to the protection

of  the right of life and personal liberty of  the

individual,  the  prohibition of slavery  and  all

forms   of   forced  labour,  protection   against

retrospective  criminal laws and repeated  trials,

equality   of   all   persons  before   the   law,

prohibition of banishment and freedom of movement,

freedom  of  speech, assembly and association  and

religion. All these recommendations are acceptable

to Government. The Commission has also recommended

the inclusion of three new Articles not written in

the Malaysian Constitution, viz. -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the right of every individual not to be

subjected to torture;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the granting to the citizens of Singapore

the  right to elect a Government  of  their

own choice; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the right to apply to court for the

enforcement of those provisions relating to

fundamental rights and liberties.



<br><br>These are all acceptable in principle and will  be

incorporated  in some form in the new Constitution

to be drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to property rights, the Commission

recognises the fact that Singapore is only a small

island of 225 square miles and more and more  land

will  be  required  for  public  purposes  as  the

population  increases.  The  Commission  therefore

does  not recommend the reintroduction of  Article

13  of the Constitution of Malaysia in its present

form. However, the Commission recommends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



that  there  should he an  Article  in  the

Constitution providing as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) No person shall be deprived of property

save in accordance with law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No law shall provide for the compulsory

acquisition or use of property except for  a

public  purpose  or  a  purpose  useful   or

beneficial  to  the public and  except  upon

just terms.'



<br><br>The  Government would accept this Article but  for

the  words  at the end, namely, "and  except  upon

just terms".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be aware that we have, at various

times  while  within  Malaysia,  sought  to  amend

Article  13 of the Malaysian Constitution  in  its

application  to  Singapore. The intention  was  to

follow  the  provisions in the Indian Constitution

so  that  any  law  providing for  the  compulsory

acquisition of property shall be valid so long  as

that law provides for compensation and that such a

law  shall  not be questioned in court as  to  the

adequacy   of  the  compensation.  The  new   Land

Acquisition  Act, which has been  passed  by  this

House  and  will  be brought into  force  shortly,

provides  for  the setting up of a  Lands  Appeals

Board and it is not considered desirable that  the

intentions  of that legislation should be  stifled

by  landowners  being able to raise constitutional

issues   when   disputes  over  the   quantum   of

compensation arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has recommended three methods of

entrenchment  in respect of various provisions  of

the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method is a provision in the

Constitution  that  the  Bill  for   an   Act   of

Parliament altering the Constitution shall not  be

passed by Parliament until it is expressed  to  be

one for amendment of the Constitution and contains

no other provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method is a provision in the

Constitution  that  the  Bill  for   an   Act   of

Parliament  altering certain named  provisions  of

the Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament

unless  the Bill is supported at the final  voting

in  Parliament by the votes of not less than  two-thirds of all the elected Members of Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third method is that any alteration of

certain  provisions  can  only  be  made  by   the

affirmative vote of a very substantial majority of

people  qualified to vote in general elections  as

well  as  of  a very substantial majority  of  the

legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given very careful

consideration  to  all  three  methods   and   the

implications  of  each and  has  decided,  in  the

situation  now prevailing in Singapore,  to  adopt

the  second  method  of  entrenchment.  All  those

recommendations  accepted by  the  Government  and

also    recommended   by   the   Commission    for

entrenchment will be so entrenched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation on the creation

of  a  non-elected advisory body to be called "the

Council  of  State",  while Government  agrees  in

principle  to  the creation of  such  a  body,  it

differs   in   the   suggested   composition   and

functions.  Further, it is the view of  Government

that  it would be more in keeping with its  purely

advisory capacity for the Council of State to  sit

in  private rather than in public. This will  also

ensure that discussions taking place are frank and

constructive and not held with an eye on the Press

or publicity or with a view to scoring a political

point.  Membership of this Council, which will  be

analagous  to the Privy Council, would be  of  two

types -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Permanent members: This would consist of men

of distinction who will be chosen from those who

hold or have held high offices, e.g. Cabinet

Ministers, former Chief Ministers, the Chief

Justice, the Speaker, the Chairman of the Public

Service Commission, Puisne Judges, the Attorney-General and former Permanent Secretaries. There

would be no age limit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Members who are removable: Appointments

would  be on the advice of Cabinet and  would

be  for  a fixed period of, say, three years,

Persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



appointed would be mature citizens  who  have

either  rendered distinguished public service

or  attained  eminence  in  their  respective

walks  of life regardless of race, colour  or

creed as recommended by the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation on the creation

of   the  office  of  Ombudsman  or  Parliamentary

Commissioner,  while Government  is  in  agreement

with  the thinking behind this recommendation,  it

is  considered that the time is not opportune  for

the  introduction of such an office in  Singapore.

Members  may  be  aware that  the  system  of  the

Ombudsman,  which has its origins  in  Scandinavia

and  seems  to  be  working fairly  satisfactorily

there, is a novel idea insofar as the Commonwealth

is   concerned.   New   Zealand   is   the   first

Commonwealth  country to have an Ombudsman  -  the

system, having been introduced there recently,  is

still  in its experimental state. It is considered

that the creation of the Ombudsman on the lines of

the  recommendations of the Commission  should  be

deferred  until the results of the  experiment  in

New Zealand and elsewhere are known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also made recommendations - not

expressly covered by their terms of reference - in

regard  to  the  Judiciary and the Public  Service

Commission.  The  Commission has recommended  that

provision be made in the Constitution vesting  the

power  of appointment of judges in the High  Court

and other superior judges, in the President acting

on  the  advice of a body comprising the  superior

judges  and  presided over by the  holder  of  the

highest  judicial office in the Republic.  It  is,

however,  considered  that the  present  practice,

whereby  judges  are appointed  by  the  President

acting  on  the advice of the Prime  Minister  who

consults   the  incumbent  Chief  Justice   before

tendering  such  advice  to  the  President,   has

hitherto   worked   satisfactorily   and    should

continue. It is considered undesirable that judges

as  a  body should form a self-perpetuating group,

detached  from  the  community  and  the   elected

political leadership. The recommendation that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



provision  be  made  in the Constitution  for  the

remuneration of judges to be provided by  law  and

to  be  charged on the Consolidated Fund, for  the

remuneration and other terms of office  (including

pension rights, allowances, etc.) of a judge to be

unalterable to his disadvantage during the  tenure

of his appointment and for the non-abolition of  a

judicial  office so long as it has  a  substantive

holder,  is  acceptable. It  is  agreed  that  the

remuneration  of  judges  should  be  such  as  to

attract   the  ablest  men  of  high  professional

ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Public Service Commission, it

is  agreed  that the Chairman and members  of  the

Public  Service Commission should be  persons  who

can  command the respect and enjoy the  confidence

of  all sections of the population. They should be

men   of  high  administrative  ability  and  wide

experience  and  should  not  be  members  of  any

political party. In this connection, consideration

will be given to enlargement of the membership  of

the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  you  are  aware,  this Report  has  just  been

presented  to  this House for the  information  of

Members here only five minutes ago. I feel that by

doing  it  in  this  manner, Members  who  may  be

interested to have a debate on it are deprived  of

the opportunity. May I ask the Minister whether he

will  give an opportunity to Members of this House

to debate on this Report?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I call upon the Minister to

reply, I must state, Mr Ho, that your saying that

the Report was available only five minutes ago  is

not   correct.  My  information  is  that  it  was

available at 2 o'clock. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we will not be in Parliament

after today, but I can assure the hon. Member  for

Bras  Basah  that  when we next  meet  here  again

probably  early next year, Members  of  the  House

will  he  given  ample opportunity to  debate  the

contents of the Report and the Government's  views

thereon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I only want to know from the

Minister when the Ombudsman was introduced in New

Zealand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my understanding is

that  the  relevant  New Zealand  Bill  was  first

tabled in their Parliament sometime in 1961,  that

the  Bill  became law in 1962, and  that  the  New

Zealand  Ombudsman (or Parliamentary Commissioner)

was appointed on the 1st of October, 1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from a perusal

of   this  Report,  it  appears  to  me  that  the

recommendations  of  this  Report  are  unanimous.

Nevertheless  I would like to ask a question  -was

there any dissenting voice on this Report?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Report is a

unanimous  Report. There was no dissenting  voice,

though  the members of the Commission were  multi-racial and multi-religious; hence the value of the

Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I will allow any

further   questions  in  view  of  the  Minister's

indication of a full opportunity for debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure

for   the  year  1967  have  been  considered  and

approved  by the House as Cmd. Paper 26  of  1966.

Under section 85 of the Constitution of Singapore,

heads   of   expenditure  other   than   statutory

expenditure  to be met from the Consolidated  Fund

have to be included in the Bill to be known as the

Supply  Bill.  The purpose of such a  Bill  is  to

provide  for the issue from the Consolidated  Fund

of  the sums necessary to meet the expenditure and

the  appropriation of these sums for the  purposes

specified therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give

legislative approval for the issue of  funds  from

the   Consolidated  Fund  to  meet  the  sums   of

expenditure for 1967. In the Schedule to the  Bill

are shown the various heads of expenditure and the

sums that may be incurred in respect of each head.

These  have  been  approved by the  House  in  the

Estimates  of Expenditure for 1967 and  appear  in

pages 53 and 54 of Paper Cmd. 26 of 1966. Once the

Supply  Bill  is approved, I will be empowered  to

issue  warrants authorising expenditure up to  the

amount under each head as shown in the Bill to  be

paid out from the Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Fees Ordinance was first passed in

Singapore, as far back as 1881, to provide for the

levy  of fees and payments for licences where  not

otherwise  provided by law. It was  added  to  and

amended, the last time in 1958, to provide for the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara to frame fees by Order  and

to   carry   out   such  other  acts   which   are

administrative by nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make such amendments and

deletions   to  the  Ordinance  as  are  necessary

consequent upon Singapore establishing herself  as

a sovereign Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is taken in clause 4 to provide

for  the  transfer of the power of the  "Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara"  to  prescribe  fees,  and   the

carrying out of the functions of the Ordinance, to

the   "Minister  for  Finance".  As   it   is   an

administrative procedure for all fees and  charges

levied under the Ordinance to be referred for  the

prior  approval  of the Treasury,  it  is  neither

necessary,    nor    appropriate,     to     refer

administrative  acts  of  this   nature   to   the

President.  It  is accordingly provided  that  the

power  to prescribe fees, and other administrative

acts,  be transferred to the Minister for  Finance

in accordance with constitutional practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to delete

references to "the Colony" and to the "Legislative

Assembly"   and  to  substitute  "Singapore"   and

"Parliament" instead.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is a simple one, namely,

to  re-enact  with  suitable  changes  the  former

Holidays  Ordinance which had  been  in  force  in

Singapore prior to the establishment of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, when Singapore became

part  of Malaysia, the Malaysian Government by  an

Order  extended  the Malaysia Holidays  Ordinance,

1951,  to  Singapore,  with the  result  that  the

Singapore Holidays Ordinance ceased to have effect

in Singapore. Now that Singapore has left Malaysia

and   has   become  a  sovereign  and  independent

Republic,  it is obviously desirable to  have  our

own holidays legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, in the main, repeats the provisions of

the  former  Holidays  Ordinance,  but  makes  one

important change. There is no provision  to  allow

Bank  Holidays to be observed, as used to  be  the

practice  in  the  past when  1st  July  and  31st

December were observed as Bank Holidays to  enable

the  banks  to close the mid-year and  end-of-year

accounts.    Subsequently,   as   a   result    of

consultations  with the Singapore  banks,  it  has

been agreed that, by reorganising their work,  the

banks  can dispense with Bank Holidays in  future,

and thus provide a more convenient service for the

public. I should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



mention that the banks in Malaysia have also  been

managing without Bank Holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Bill, which may be modified

from  time  to  time, lists a total of  16  public

holidays  for  the year which are currently  being

observed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Societies Ordinance is a very old

piece of legislation which was first enacted  more

than 50 years ago. Now that Singapore has become a

sovereign   and   independent  Republic,   it   is

considered desirable to bring the law up to  date.

The  purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to repeal

and   re-enact   with  suitable   amendments   the

provisions of the Societies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the amendments which have been made are

those dealing with political associations. I think

hon.   Members  will  agree  that,  in   view   of

Singapore's sovereign and independent  status,  it

is   necessary  to  provide  that  any   political

association  registered in Singapore  should  have

its  membership confined to Singapore citizens and

should   have   no   affiliation   or   connection

whatsoever   with   political   parties    outside

Singapore  which are considered to be contrary  to

the  national interest. We have at the  moment  in

Singapore a number of political parties which  had

been  registered as Singapore branches  of  parent

bodies in Western Malaysia many years ago



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



and which, during the time when Singapore was part

of   Malaysia,  quite  naturally  became  strongly

orientated  towards Kuala Lumpur.  This  situation

was  perfectly all right as long as Singapore  was

part  of Malaysia. But with Singapore's withdrawal

from  Malaysia,  it  is quite clear  that  such  a

situation cannot be allowed to continue.  I  think

it is only reasonable to expect that these various

political  parties should now move with the  times

and   take   appropriate  steps  to  ensure   that

membership  is confined to Singapore citizens  and

to  cut  off all affiliations or connections  with

political  parties  outside  Singapore.   It   is,

therefore,  proposed to empower the  Registrar  to

refuse  registration to any political  association

which   does   not  meet  this  requirement.   Any

political  association which is already registered

will be given a reasonable period within which  to

amend   its  constitution  to  comply  with   this

requirement, and should such society fail to amend

its  constitution  accordingly within  the  period

allowed, there is provision in the Bill for action

to be taken to dissolve the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the Registrar to keep track of the

activities of registered societies, it is provided

that any registered society seeking to establish a

branch  must  seek  the  prior  approval  of   the

Registrar who may withhold his approval on certain

grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar or Assistant Registrar is also

empowered  to  order  any  registered  society  to

furnish  him  with  any information  that  he  may

require  concerning the society, or any  document,

accounts and books relating to the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also considered desirable to provide for

more  effective  control in  the  registration  of

societies. Accordingly, the Registrar is empowered

to  refuse  registration in  certain  cases  where

there   are   reasonable  grounds   for   refusing

registration. For example, a proposed society  may

be   refused   registration  if  its   rules   are

considered to be insufficient to provide  for  its

proper  management and control, or the society  is

likely  to  be used for unlawful purposes  or  for

purposes prejudicial to public peace



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



and  welfare  in  Singapore. In  any  case,  where

registration  has been refused by  the  Registrar,

there is provision for an appeal to be made to the

Minister for reconsideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any society which has not been registered will be

deemed  to  be  an  unlawful  society  and  it  is

considered   desirable  to  expand   the   present

provisions  relating to unlawful  societies  which

are not considered adequate. Thus, in addition  to

the  existing provision which makes it an  offence

for  any  person to act as a member of an unlawful

society,  attend a meeting of an unlawful society,

or allow such a meeting to be held in any premises

belonging to or occupied by him, it is proposed to

provide   that   certain   other   activities   in

connection  with  unlawful societies  should  also

constitute  offences under the law. Thus  it  will

also  be  an offence for any person to  incite  or

induce another person to become a member or assist

in  the  management  of  an unlawful  society,  to

procure from any other person any subscription  or

aid  for  the purposes of an unlawful society,  to

print,  publish or sell any newspaper or  document

issued by or on behalf of an unlawful society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill are a re-enactment of the present provisions of the

Societies  Ordinance  with appropriate  amendments

and additions where necessary to bring them up  to

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support wholly the

Bill which has been introduced by the Minister for

Social  Affairs.  I believe it  will  resolve  the

impasse  faced by the Registrar. It is appropriate

that  it  should  be implemented  because,  as  an

independent   sovereign   State,   the   Singapore

Government  must  have  a positive  stand  towards

societies  in Singapore, irrespective  of  whether

they    are   political   parties,   non-political

associations, pro-Communist or non-Communist. What

is necessary for the Government is to protect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



prosperity  and  the  safety  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  In  Singapore,  there  are   political

parties  which  have the same name  and  the  same

symbol as some political parties have in Malaysia.

As  we  have  become an independent and  sovereign

State,  we  must  protect  the  good  relationship

between   Singapore  and  neighbouring  countries,

particularly  Malaysia. And  it  is  necessary  to

avoid   any  misunderstanding  between   the   two

Governments and the two peoples, so that political

parties  with  the same name and the  same  symbol

must  be  made  to alter their names and  symbols.

Also to avoid any misunderstanding between the two

peoples,  I believe we do not wish to see repeated

the incident created by U.M.N.O. at the behest  of

Ahmad  Haji Taff, the leader of U.M.N.O., who  has

used  U.M.N.O. Singapore for his own selfish  ends

and for the ends of political parties in Malaysia.

As  the leader of U.M.N.O. Singapore, he has  been

airing the interest of the Malaysian Government. I

believe  in this way he thinks that the  Malaysian

Government  will  one  day  appoint  him   as   an

Ambassador abroad, like Dato Haji Jumat, a  former

Minister  of  Singapore and an ex-Assemblyman  for

Geylang  Serai, who was appointed as an Ambassador

for the Malaysian Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the aid of the amendments moved by the

Minister for Culture and Social Affairs, I am sure

the  Registrar will be able to exercise the powers

given   to   him  to  overcome  his  difficulties.

Political parties and non-political parties  which

have  misused their associations will have  to  be

dealt with accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wholly support this Bill.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support the  Societies

Bill.  I  personally feel that it  has  got  three

basic  features. One is to bring us into  the  new

situation. Secondly, it is to protect the interest

of  our  citizens. Thirdly, it is  to  stop  anti-national  elements  from  infiltrating  into   our

country. As the Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



already  said,  the  old  Societies  Ordinance  is

outmoded and cannot be effectively used in our new

situation. When we were in Malaysia we  were  part

of  Malaysia  as  a State. But, according  to  the

Constitution of Malaysia, the people  of  Malaysia

or Sarawak were not Singapore citizens unless they

were  registered  under the Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance.  But, at that time, our Government  was

adopting   an  enlightened  and  liberal  attitude

towards  people  who came from Malaysia  or  other

territories  within Malaysia. So we allowed  these

people to register themselves as a society or as a

political  society in Singapore.  They  were  also

allowed  to  hold  office in such  societies.  But

since  we became independent on the 9th of August,

1965,  the  whole situation has changed.  We  have

entered a new stage. Therefore, if we continue  to

allow the old situation to exist, then it would be

unwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, freedom of assembly is one of the

fundamental rights of the people. The formation of

a  political  society  is an  expression  of  this

freedom  of  assembly. So the societies registered

under  the Societies Ordinance will have all their

legitimate activities recognised by the law. It is

only fair that only citizens of Singapore will  be

allowed to hold important office in the societies.

This is one of the basic rights of the people. But

this  was  not the situation in the past.  Whether

you  were  a  citizen or not, you were allowed  to

hold  office  in  the societies  then  registered.

Because  of this unhealthy situation in the  past,

it was possible for some anti-national elements to

infiltrate  into  some  societies  registered   in

Singapore,  particularly some political societies,

old  boys' associations and trade unions. We could

see all these facts from the statements issued  by

political detainees recently released. These anti-national  elements,  formed  under  the  guise  of

registered  societies,  were  carrying  out  anti-national  activities against the interest  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Societies Bill, which makes provision to

confine  membership  of any society  to  Singapore

citizens  only, is a very correct move indeed.  It

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that  our  societies  will  no  longer  be

infiltrated by anti-national elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one point, however, which

I  wish to bring to the attention of the Minister,

and  that is as follows. Those who are law-abiding

and  loyal  residents should be allowed to  become

citizens  of Singapore within one or two years.  I

believe there are some such persons holding office

in  our registered societies. So I would like  the

Minister to exercise his powers under the Bill  to

allow such persons to continue holding office  for

the   time   being  until  they  become  Singapore

citizens by law. As long as the interests  of  the

people of Singapore are protected, I believe  that

all loyal citizens will support this Bill.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my full

support  for this Bill. At the same time, I  would

like   the  Minister  to  explain  certain  points

relating  to  it.  I  do  not  know  whether   the

Registrar  will have to consider  the  name  of  a

political  party  to  be  also  in  the   national

language when he carries out the provisions of the

Bill  relating  to the registration  of  political

parties.  I  do not, for a moment,  say  that  the

other  languages  are  not official  languages  in

Singapore.  We  know that this is a  fact.  But  I

think  it  must  be stressed that the  name  of  a

political  party or society must also  be  in  the

national  language so that it can  be  made  clear

that  it is fully loyal to the country. There  are

some political parties in Singapore which are  yet

to   be   registered,  like  U.M.N.O.,  and  these

initials,  in  my view, represent  English  words.

They   stand   for  the  United  Malays   National

Organisation.  The initials may be misleading  and

could    stand    for   Ultra   Malays    National

Organisation. Even if we do not say that this name

has  come from the English-educated people, we can

say   that  it  has  come  from  our  very   close

neighbour. So if every political party is required

to  submit several names in the different official

languages, this will be of great assistance to the

Registrar   of  Societies  when  considering   its

application.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  I would like  the  Minister  to

explain  his  stand on this question in  order  to

facilitate the work of the Registrar of Societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been a common feature

in  the  political history of Singapore and Malaya

that  the  names  of many political  parties  have

appeared  in  the national language. This  feature

was  quite prevalent even as far back as ten years

ago.  So  this  is  a historical tendency  of  the

times. That is why the P.A.P. also has its name in

the national language. We had the foresight to  do

this.  So  I  hope  the  Minister  will  give   an

explanation on this point.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill  which  has

just  been introduced by the Minister for  Culture

and  Social Affairs. Actually it should  not  have

been  introduced  at the present  moment,  but  it

should have been introduced much earlier to  amend

the defects in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill contains 20 pages

with  38  clauses which should have been  compiled

much earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a fact that the events described by the

Minister did take place many years ago, we  should

take  steps not only to deal with the registration

of  political  parties but also to deal  with  the

registration    of    labour    unions,    welfare

associations, deaf and dumb associations,  and  so

on.  May I know whether the Registrar is empowered

to  withhold the registration of any organisations

like  the  old  boys' associations  which  conduct

kindergarten  classes in many parts of  Singapore?

We  have no objection to kindergarten classes  run

by  associations with the object of  moulding  our

children into loyal subjects. The same can be said

of  political parties. Some Members  have  said  a

while   ago  that  although  there  are  political

parties  which  have their names in  the  national

language,  like the Barisan Sosialis,  they  carry

out  subversive activities and they owe allegiance

to  pro-Communist or Communist countries. This  is

contrary  to  what their names stand  for  in  the

national language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, when this Bill is passed in

due  course, the Registrar should use  his  powers

wisely  and  give due consideration before  taking

any action.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I

would like to thank hon. Members for their support

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the point made by the Member for

Kampong  Kapor,  I would like to stress  that  the

decision  to  introduce this Bill  was  not  taken

haphazardly. It was very carefully considered  and

it  took  us  almost l« years to  arrive  at  this

decision.  It is not the policy of this Government

to  do things without first considering them  very

carefully.  I  can  assure  the  Member  that  the

Registrar will not abuse the powers given  to  him

in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Bukit Merah

that  political  parties in  Singapore  should  be

asked to use the national language for their names -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  mean is that the other official languages

should   be  used  in  addition  to  the  national

language  for the names of political  parties  and

organisations. Our identity cards also have -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member can clarify, but he

should not go into a debate.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> It has been the practice of

political parties to have their names in more than

one  language. For instance, U.M.N.O. at one  time

had  two  names - the one in English is still  the

United Malays National Organisation and the one in

Malay  was  Persatuan Kebangsaan  Melayu  Bersatu.

They   used  both  names,  but  at  their  General

Assembly a few years ago, they decided to use only

the   initials  of  the  English  name,  U.M.N.O.,

because   they   are  very  well   known,   easily

pronounced and understood by the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for

Sembawang  whether it would be possible for  those

loyal  officials of associations who are  not  yet

Singapore  citizens to be allowed to  continue  to

hold   office   while   their   applications   for

citizenship are being considered, I can only  tell

him that we will look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to stress is

that the clause in the Bill which states that  any

political   association  registered  in  Singapore

should  have its membership confined to  Singapore

citizens   and  should  have  no  affiliation   or

connection   whatsoever  with  political   parties

outside  Singapore  which  are  considered  to  be

contrary  to  the  national interest,  covers  all

political parties now functioning in the Republic,

including the Party in power.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

wish to know whether under clause 12 a citizen  of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



who has become a bankrupt can hold office.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I think the clause here is

clear  -  "for  an offence involving the  unlawful

expenditure  of the funds of the society;  or".  A

man  who  has  become a bankrupt  must  have  been

involved  in an offence. If the Member means  that

because of debt ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member's question

implies  a  desire  on his part  that  a  bankrupt

should be among those disqualified.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I do not think that a person

who  is  a  bankrupt should be included  in  this.

There is always a danger because this involves the

funds of a society.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the point the Member was

trying  to  make  was  that a bankrupt  should  be

disqualified from holding office.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Oh! I beg your pardon. I

thought he wants a bankrupt to be included! Yes, I

should say that a bankrupt should be disqualified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need for an up-to-date company

legislation has become a matter of urgency as  our

existing legislation on companies, which is  based

on  the  English  Companies Act of  1929,  is  now

completely  out  of date. The main  provisions  in

this   Bill   are  outlined  in  the   Explanatory

Statement attached to the Bill. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



now  propose to give only a brief outline  of  the

significant  changes in the law proposed  by  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 15 of the Bill a private company is

prohibited  from  inviting the  public  to  invest

money  with it. Existing private companies  should

convert  themselves to public  companies  if  they

desire to continue to borrow from the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 170 requires every company to send copies

of the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Account, and

Auditor's  Report to all members  of  the  company

before  the  general meeting,  whereas  under  the

existing law private companies are not required to

do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 181 gives a remedy to minority interests

who  are  being  oppressed by  the  majority.  The

provisions, which are new, are also applicable  to

private companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "director" has been widened to

include   a   person  in  accordance  with   whose

directions  or  instructions  the  directors   are

accustomed to act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 122 requires every company to have at

least two directors, one of whom shall be resident

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 131 and 132 impose upon the directors the

duty  of disclosing any conflicting interests they

might  have  and prohibit officers of the  company

from acquiring an advantage because of information

gained by virtue of their position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 133 restricts the right of companies to

make  loans to their directors or to directors  of

related  companies,  and  clause  135  requires  a

director  to  inform the company promptly  of  any

matters  affecting  his  own  position  which  are

required to be known by the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 136 prohibits tax-free payments to

directors,  and  clause 137  strictly  limits  the

right  of a company to make payments to a director

on his retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions will ensure that directors do

not  take undue advantage of their position in the

company  and will prevent the company from  giving

undue preference to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special provisions have been introduced in this

Bill  to  control  unit and  property  trusts  and

investment  companies. The Minister has  to  grant

his  approval to a company, acting as trustee, for

the  purposes of a trust deed, and the trust  deed

is  required to contain certain covenants and  has

to be approved by the Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns have to be made to the Registrar every

year  containing  a list of all  persons  who  are

holders  of  the  interests  to  which  the   deed

relates,   and   containing  statements   of   all

purchases   and  sales  of  land  and   marketable

security, and of all other investments,  and  also

of  the  total amount of brokerage paid or charged

by the management company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards investment companies, there are

restrictions  on  borrowing,  on  investment,   on

underwriting, etc. They are also required to  keep

an investment fluctuation reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign companies are regulated by Division 2 of

Part  XI of the Bill. Every foreign company  shall

have  a  registered office in Singapore and shall,

if  it  invites  the public to subscribe  for  its

shares, keep a Branch Register in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Part IX of the Bill, which

deals  with  the  investigation of companies,  are

more  extensive than the corresponding  provisions

of  the  existing Ordinance. Clauses  207  to  209

enable  the  Minister  to investigate  the  actual

ownership  of  the shares of the company.  He  can

restrain  dealings in the shares and the  exercise

of  rights  attached to the shares  if  the  owner

refuses to co-operate in the investigation.  These

are   new  provisions.  Clause  210  enables   the

Government  to  co-operate  with  other  countries

having   similar  legislation  with   respect   to

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law the Registry of Companies

is  little  more than a repository  for  documents

required  to  be lodged with the Registrar.  Under

this  Bill  the Registrar's duties and powers  are

extensive and are basic to any proper control over

companies  and  to the active enforcement  of  the

law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 374 to 388 authorise the Minister to make

arrangements  with Malaysia for the  extension  to

Singapore  of Winding-Up Orders made  in  Malaysia

and  for  the  extension to Malaya  of  Winding-Up

Orders  made in Singapore. I understand  that  the

Malaysian   Government  is   prepared   to   enact

legislation containing reciprocal provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to give the investing public

adequate protection, but, at the same time,  tries

not  to place an undue or unnecessary burden  upon

honest  business enterprises. It will do  much  to

provide  a  healthy climate for investment  and  a

sound  basis  for  action against  fraudulent  and

undesirable   practices.   As   this    Bill    is

comprehensive and far-reaching in its effects,  it

is proposed to refer it to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the Bill be committed to a Select

Committee  consisting  of  eight  Members  to   be

nominated  by  the  Committee of Selection." - [Mr

Barker]

<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board as at present

constituted consists of (a) the Chairman, (b)  the

Director  of  the  Board, (c)  a  nominee  of  the

Economic Development Board, (d) a nominee  of  the

Singapore  Tourist  Association,  (e)   a   public

officer  appointed by the Minister, and  (f)  four

other   members  appointed  by  the  Minister   to

represent tourist enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to amend the constitution of the

Board   by   increasing  the  number  of   members

appointed by the Minister from four to five and to

remove  the statutory stipulation that they should

represent tourist enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourist enterprises have direct representation on

the Board in the person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



of   the   nominee   of   the  Singapore   Tourist

Association. It would be beneficial to  the  Board

to  have  also as members persons who are actively

interested  in  tourism and might have  worthwhile

contributions  to  make  but  are  not  themselves

directly concerned with the tourist industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable the Tourist Promotion

Board,  with  the  approval of  the  Minister,  to

establish  a  scheme  for  the  payment   to   its

employees of pensions, gratuities, provident  fund

or other superannuation benefits on their death or

on  their retirement or resignation from the Board

as in the case of other statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is, as stated in the

Long  Title,  "to  establish the  Board  of  Legal

Education,  to constitute the Singapore  Advocates

and   Solicitors   Society  and   to   amend   and

consolidate   the  law  relating  to   the   legal

profession" in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill, which deals with the

admission  of  advocates and solicitors,  provides

for  the  setting up of a Board of Legal Education

to    consist    of   the   Attorney-General,    a

representative     of    the    Chief     Justice,

representatives  from  the legal  profession,  and

representatives from the Faculty  of  Law  of  the

University of Singapore. This Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



will in future be responsible for the organisation

of  pupillage and instruction of qualified persons

who seek admission as advocates and solicitors  in

Singapore  and for their examination  before  such

admission.  Special  provision  is  made  for  the

admission of legal practitioners already  admitted

in West Malaysia, the ad hoc admissions of Queen's

Counsel from the United Kingdom, and the admission

of articled clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petitions for admission will be heard by the High

Court, and provision is made for the keeping of  a

Roll of advocates and solicitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill deals with practising

certificates. Every advocate and solicitor, if  he

intends  to  practise, must  obtain  a  practising

certificate.  In  order  to  obtain  a  practising

certificate, an advocate and solicitor must  first

obtain  an annual certificate from the Council  of

the  Society  of Advocates and Solicitors.  Before

this  annual  certificate is issued,  the  Council

must  be  satisfied  that  the  applicant  is  not

prohibited  from holding a practising certificate,

that   he  has  delivered  or  is  exempted   from

delivering an accountant's report relating to  his

accounts for the last year, and that he is not  in

arrears  in  his contribution to the  Compensation

Fund  and the subscriptions or other dues  to  the

Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practising certificate is issued by the

Registrar of the High Court on production  of  the

annual  certificate,  and  of  a  declaration   in

writing  giving the full name and address  of  the

advocate  and solicitor, his firm's name  and  his

office  address, and on payment of the  prescribed

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill sets out the privileges of

advocates and solicitors and the provisions are in

the  main a re-enactment of the provisions in  the

existing Advocates and Solicitors Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with the establishment,

contributions  and  functions  of  the   Singapore

Advocates  and  Solicitors Society.  Provision  is

made  for the election of a Council of the Society

which  will  be responsible for the management  of

the affairs of the Society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



and  which  will  take over the functions  of  the

present Singapore Bar Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill relates to professional

practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors and

their clerks. Power is given to the Council of the

Society  to  make  rules relating to  professional

etiquette,  conduct  and discipline,  and  to  the

keeping  of accounts by solicitors. A Compensation

Fund  is  set up from which grants may be made  to

persons who have sustained loss in consequence  of

dishonesty  on  the part of any solicitor  or  any

clerk  or  servant of the solicitor in  connection

with  his  practice. Provision  is  made  for  the

control of solicitors' clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill relates to disciplinary

proceedings   and  in  the  main   re-enacts   the

provisions  of  the  existing Ordinance  with  the

Council of the Society taking over the powers  and

the functions of the Singapore Bar Committee.



Part  VIII of the Bill relates to the remuneration

of  solicitors  in contentious  as  well  as  non-contentious  business, and again in the  main  re-

enacts the provisions of the existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX of the Bill relating to the recovery and

taxation  of costs also in the main re-enacts  the

provisions of the existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X of the Bill deals with miscellaneous

matters. Part XI contains transitional provisions,

and  Part  XII  provides for  the  repeal  of  the

existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has the full support of the Singapore

Bar Committee and was, in fact, drafted by it, and

in  this,  Sir,  I understand you played  a  major

part.  I should like to express the thanks of  the

Government  to  you,  Sir,  and  members  of   the

Singapore Bar Committee for their efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are some amendments contained

in  the  notice  of amendments and  in  a  further

notice. I will deal with them as we come to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note, in page 2, line

40, to leave out "practice" and insert "practise".

This will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 12 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 27, to leave out "examination as

the Board may prescribe" and insert "examinations

as may be prescribed by the Board".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an amendment of fundamental

importance, but it will make the terminology

uniform with that of clause 10 (e) on page 7 of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 10, lines 4 and 5, to leave out "any

order shall be made on the petition" and insert

"the petitioner is admitted as an advocate and

solicitor"; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 10, to leave out lines 17 and 18 and

insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) a certificate signed by the Secretary of the

Board that the petitioner has satisfactorily

served the period of pupillage or articles,

attended the courses of instruction and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



passed the examinations required in his case

under the provisions of this Act.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the first amendment to this clause

is considered necessary as, instead of an order of

court, it is envisaged there will be delivered  to

each  petitioner, who is admitted as  provided  in

clause  28  (5) of the Bill, a more dignified  and

impressive  instrument of admission, patterned  on

the  lines of Call Certificates for barristers and

Admission  Certificates for solicitors  signed  by

the Master of the Rolls. The admission should,  it

is  felt,  be  clothed  with  solemnity,  and  the

present  order  of court which, in format,  typing

and  wording varies from petitioner to  petitioner

and  is  sent round for approval, fails to achieve

this.  Further, this order of court  is  extracted

many days after the admission. The delivery of  an

instrument of admission in open court after  prior

payment  of  the  prescribed  fee  will  give  the

admission the solemnity it now lacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second amendment, the clause as

now  worded  seeks  to make the  Board  usurp  the

functions  of the court. It is better  to  specify

the  matters for which the Board's certificate  is

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 to 22 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 14, after line 10, to insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(3) No

articled clerk shall without the special leave

in writing of the Board hold any office or

engage in any employment of whatsoever kind

and whether full-time or part-time during his

articles:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the provisions of this

subsection shall not preclude an articled  clerk

receiving remuneration from his principal.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this amendment will make for

uniformity  with  clause 11 (4) of  the  Bill  for

qualified  persons.  It  will  also  preclude  any

attempt to apply the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



expressio unius rule by an articled clerk who may

seek outside employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 14, lines 31 and 32, to leave out "any

order shall be made on the petition" and insert

"the petitioner is admitted as an advocate and

solicitor".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this amendment is similar to that

given for the first amendment to clause 14 dealt

with just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 26 to 29 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not given

notice of amendment of this clause. But with  your

permission and with the leave of the House, I  beg

to move an amendment under Standing Order 32. Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, I will obtain the

pleasure  of  hon.  Members that  notice  of  this

amendment proposed to be moved be dispensed with?

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 17, to leave out lines 30 to 32 inclusive

and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this

section   shall  not  apply  to  a   solicitor

employed by the Housing and Development Board,

the   Public  Utilities  Board,  the  Economic

Development  Board  or the Port  of  Singapore

Authority  if  the Attorney-General  issues  a

certificate under his hand certifying that the

solicitor   is  so  employed  and   specifying

therein the matters in which the solicitor  so

employed may appear and plead in courts of law

and  upon  such solicitor otherwise  complying

with the provisions of this Act, the Registrar

shall  issue  to him a practising  certificate

specifying therein the matters in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



he  may  appear  and plead as contained  in  the

Attorney-General's certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A practising certificate issued to a

solicitor  shall cease to have  effect  when  he

ceases  to practise or he ceases to be  employed

as provided in this section.".



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as it now stands, the

disqualifications   for   practising   certificate

listed  in  paragraphs (a), (b) and  (c)  of  sub-clause  (1) of clause 30 of the Bill would exclude

the  solicitor of a statutory board from  carrying

out  his duties. It is considered desirable  that,

in the performance of his duties, the solicitor of

a   statutory   board  should,  insofar   as   his

professional etiquette and duties to the court are

concerned,   be   under  the   control   of   some

responsible  legal  officer. This  amendment  will

achieve   the  result  of  giving  solicitors   of

statutory boards licence to practise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 31 to 36 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 (2) (c) of the Bill is taken from

sections 72, 76 and 111(b) of the British Columbia

Legal  Profession  Act,  section  47  (2)  of  the

Manitoba   Law  Society  Act  and  other  Canadian

legislation.   The  corresponding   East   African

legislation is narrower in that documents relating

to  dissolution or winding up are not  within  the

prohibition  - section  39 (1)  (c)  of  the  Kenya

Advocates Ordinance and section 43 (1) (c) of  the

Tanganyika Advocates Ordinance refer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some accountants have expressed misgivings about

our clause 37 (2) (c) extending to dissolution and

winding  up documents. Documents for use in  court

will  in  any case be caught by paragraph (a)  and

there is no desire on the part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



the  profession to preclude accountants  preparing

documents in a dissolution or winding up that  are

not  for  use in court. It is therefore  suggested

that  dissolution and winding up be excluded  from

this paragraph. Hence the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 24, after line 23, to insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(g) any arbitrator or umpire lawfully acting

under any written law relating to arbitration,

settling or attempting to settle the dispute

between the parties to the arbitration;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be certain consequential amendments,

Sir, in the lettering of the subsequent paragraphs

which will have to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this paragraph is directed against

touts,  unofficial advisers, adjusters and private

detective agencies who are being engaged to settle

running down cases without the claimant having  an

opportunity for proper advice on damages. Where in

such  settlements the sum paid is  not  manifestly

inadequate, the hands of the Court and the  Public

Trustee are tied. It comes from section 111 (c) of

the  British Columbia Act, section 47 (2)  (b)  of

the  Manitoba  Act and other Canadian legislation.

Bona  fide  and full-time employees  of  insurance

companies  are  exempted from  this  paragraph  by

clause  38  (1)  (f) . The fear has been  expressed

that  clause  38  may  preclude  arbitrators   and

umpires from trying to settle a claim before them.

In  order  to  remove this fear, the amendment  is

proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Consequential amendments to

subsequent paragraphs (g) , (h) and (i) to  be  re-lettered  (h) ,  (i) and (j) respectively  will  be

made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, again I beg to seek

your  leave  and  the  leave of  the  House  under

Standing  Order  No. 32 to move another  amendment

without notice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I give my consent. Is it the

pleasure of hon. Members that notice of the

amendment proposed to be moved be dispensed with?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 24, after line 30, to insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(k) any approved company auditor drawing or

preparing any instrument which he is empowered

to do under any law for the time being in force

relating to companies.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 37 (2) as it now stands, paragraphs (a)

or   (c)  or  (e)  would  prohibit  auditors  from

carrying   on  the  functions  which  an  approved

company  auditor will be allowed to perform  under

the new Companies Act if this Act is enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 (3) imposes a duty on the Registrar to

require  a certificate from one of three  persons,

including an approved company auditor, as  to  the

identity of the subscribers to a memorandum or  of

any persons named in the memorandum or Articles as

officers of the proposed company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the present clause 37 (2) (c) now stands, a

company auditor may not be able to carry out  even

this  relatively  minor function. Furthermore,  an

approved  company auditor may be  called  upon  to

certify  the correctness of accounts of  companies

turning public. As these certifications are to  be

made  on the prospective companies, it is arguable

that such an act may not be legally carried out by

an  approved company auditor. In order that  these

doubts  be  removed,  it  is  proposed  that  this

further  amendment be made so as to make it  quite

clear  that  any approved company auditor  who  is

merely performing acts which he will be allowed to

perform under the proposed Companies Act would not

be excluded by this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> A necessary consequential amendment

is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present provisions in the Bill,

the   Board   will  be  dependent   on   voluntary

contributions  and fees collected.  The  amendment

will provide a statutory payment of $10 per member

as  a  statutory subsidy to the Board  which  will

enable  its  ordinary running  and  administrative

expenses  to  be met without the Board  having  to

depend on profits from fees paid by pupils.
