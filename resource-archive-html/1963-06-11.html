<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will publish the correspondence between his office and Amnesty International of London

on the subject of Political Detainees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The

correspondence between  my  office  and   Amnesty

International of London is circulated herewith.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the correspondence+(Appendix II, Cols. 855-60) been tabled?





<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19630611/19630611-HA-0200855.pdf"">POLITICAL DETAINEES(Cols 0855-0860)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think so. As I understand

it, my Secretary has supplied enough copies.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> I would like to ask the

Prime   Minister  whether  he  will  consider   the

suggestion   made  by  Amnesty  to  release   those

detainees  who are prepared to leave the  State  of

Singapore  and Malaysia for purposes of  furthering

their studies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson

has  read  the  reply which my  Secretary  sent  to

Amnesty International.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Members of the House who did

not see the document, may I just refer to paragraph

(5)  of the letter by Anwar Ibrahim, my Secretary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As in (4) above, the decision to detain and to

release  detainees rests with the Internal Security

Council in which the Singapore Government has  only

three  out  of  seven members.  But  the  Singapore

Government's  three members will consider  allowing

detainees freedom to leave Singapore provided  they

are satisfied that the applicant who offers to give

a  written  undertaking not to engage  in  politics

abroad is one whose conduct in the past is not such

as to make his words worth less than the paper they

are typed on.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  is  aware  that that  sort  of  condition

invalidates  the entire assurance given.  Would  he

consider that whether these persons whose words  he

is  not  prepared  to  accept  undertake  political

activities  elsewhere  or not  cannot  in  any  way

damage  the  security  of Malaya?  If  they  go  to

territories like Australia or the United Kingdom or

the  United States of America, would he  take  into

consideration the places to which they seek  to  go

for the purpose of pursuing their studies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

that the statement made by the Member for Anson  is

somewhat naive in its approach if he believes  that

a place like London is innocuous. From our point of

view, a great amount of energy and effort has  been

spent  to  counter the activities of Mr John  Eber

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



the  Movement for Colonial Freedom. I see no reason

why Mr John Eber should receive further assistance

from  more able united front Communist leaders.  If

we  are  convinced  that any  particular  gentleman

wishes  to go to London for the salubrious air  and

to  learn through the scholarship with which London

and  its  universities are endowed,  then  we  will

seriously  consider the proposition. But if - as  the

professional experts believe -  there is a plan afoot

to try, now that they are neutralised, to move them

into positions where they can once again be put  to

good use, then, as I say, our three votes will  not

be  used to help them. But if we are convinced that

they really want to lead a quiet and peaceful life,

then I say that there is no reason why we would not

consider them for a job in the Ministry of  Culture

looking  after  dances and cultural shows - innocuous

things like that.

<div align="center"><b>SEMBAWANG BY-ELECTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Further Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he has any further statement to make as  to

when  it is proposed to hold a by-election for  the

Electoral Division of Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Statistics  Department is working at full  capacity

to  complete the election registers by the  end  of

this month, or the beginning of next. As I said  at

the last sitting, the Sembawang by-election will be

held soon thereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I remember

right, we were assured at the last sitting that the

by-election would take place within two months. May

I ask the Prime Minister whether we can expect that

by-election next month?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, I challenge the

statement  that the Member for Anson has attributed

to  me. You will notice that even when my Secretary

writes to Amnesty International, he writes in  very

circumspect language.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Dictated by you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I hope he has in his

association  with  me  learned  how  to  deal  with

difficult gentlemen who ask difficult questions.  I

would  assure  the  Member for Anson  that  however

insidious  he  can  be,  he  would  never  find  me

committed in writing in this Assembly or outside to

a  categorical statement that it would  take  place

within  two months. He has not found it so even  in

this  statement. What I have said  is  that  it  is

hoped - and  it  is working at full capacity  to  the

knowledge  of all members of the civil service  and

the  people  outside. In fact,  I  have  moved  two

machines  from the City Council to help them.  What

machines are they?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

High-speed sorting machines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have loaned from the City

Council  two  high-speed sorting  machines  to  the

Statistics Department to discharge these  functions

more efficaciously. And my answer stands.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FIRST GENERAL ELECTIONS IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE UNDER PROPOSED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA CONSTITUTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he will make a statement on the subject  of

the  first General Elections in Singapore under the

proposed  Malaysia Constitution,  and  whether  any

changes    are   contemplated   in   the   existing

constitutional   position   relating   to   general

elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are two general

elections  which  will arise with  Malaysia.  There

again,  I  think the Member for Anson  will  notice

that  the  preposition has been  chosen  carefully - "with" Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the election of 15 seats to the

Central  Parliament. The second is the election  of

51  seats  to  the State Assembly. As soon  as  the

necessary  legislation is ready, it will be  tabled

in this House for adoption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundary of the 15 seats will be decided by

the Federal Elections Commission. But for the first

elections to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



Central  Parliament, there may  not  be  sufficient

Time  for  the  Commission  to  delineate  the   15

constituencies. So the 15 constituencies  may  have

to   be  formed  by  joining  up  the  51  Assembly

constituencies in threes and fours so  as  to  give

even representation throughout the island. Just  in

case the Federal Elections Commission cannot get on

with  the  job in time, my colleague, the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs, will be introducing  for  First

Reading  a Bill meant for discussion in this  House

in  Select Committee on the joining up of the seats

in threes and fours within the next few days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change contemplated relates to the Members

elected  to  the 51 seats in the next Assembly.  At

present,  individual Members of the Assembly,  once

elected, can hold their party to ransom by changing

sides.  In, future,  it is proposed  that  when  a

person  resigns or is expelled from  the  party  on

whose   platform   he   was   elected,   he    will

automatically vacate his seat.

<div align="center"><b>1960 REPORT OF DIVISION OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Reason for delay in publication)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  why it took two years and three months  to

publish the Report of the Division of commerce  and

Industry for the year 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to

reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not accept that a time lag of two scars and

three months is unreasonable for the publication of

the  Annual  Report  of the Trade  Division  of  my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the Annual Report must wait

upon  completion of trade statistics for that year.

Major  reorganisation  in  the  Ministry  in   1961

necessarily  engaged the officers  in  more  urgent

duties, and compilation of the 1960 Report  had  to

be held in abeyance during the period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson was the Minister for

Commerce  and  industry sometime during  1955/1956,

and  he  will doubtless recollect that  during  his

tenure  of office, he did not publish the 1953/1954

Annual  Report  for the Ministry  of  Commerce  and

Industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I am reminded of the remark

that  one asks the organ-grinder and gets  a  reply

from  the monkey. But I would ask the Parliamentary

Secretary  whether he is seriously contending  that

two  years  and three months is a period indicative

of  efficiency in the Department in the  production

of so slim a document as that Annual Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have said that the officers were

engaged on some other urgent duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ah, I hear the organ-grinder!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DECLINE IN 1960 EXPORTS TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DOLLAR AREA AND NON-STERLING ASIAN COUNTRIES AS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMPARED WITH 1959</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether he knows of any reasons why exports

from  Singapore in 1960 to the Dollar area and non-Sterling  Asian countries should have  declined  as

compared  with  1959, and whether he  will  make  a

statement on developments in that sphere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, exports from Singapore to the dollar

area  declined  by $62.2 million as  compared  with

1959   and   exports  to  the  non-Sterling   Asian

countries declined by $63.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the dollar area is concerned, the

decrease in exports to the United States of America

and  Canada in 1960 as compared with 1959 was $59.7

million. Thus the decrease in exports to the dollar

area was mainly owing to the decrease in exports to

the United States of America and Canada. Similarly,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



decrease  in  exports from Singapore to  Japan  and

China  in  1960  as compared with  1959  was  $67.7

million.  Thus the decrease in exports to the  non-Sterling Asian countries was due mainly to decrease

in exports to Japan and China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, the export of rubber from Singapore came

up  to  almost  53 per cent of total  exports  from

Singapore. This gives us the first clue. The export

of  rubber  from Singapore to the United States  of

America  and  Canada,  and  to  Japan  and   China,

expressed  as  a percentage of total  exports  from

Singapore to these countries for the two years  was

more  than  80 per cent in the case of  the  United

States of America and Canada, and more than 70  per

cent  in  the case of Japan and China. The decrease

in  total  export to these countries was  therefore

mainly  owing to a decrease in the export of rubber

to these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the decrease in the value and

quantity of rubber exported from Singapore in  1960

as  compared with 1959 have already been  given  on

page 6 of the 1960 Annual Report of the Division of

Commerce and Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the sales from the American and British

stockpiles and the greater use of synthetic  rubber

were the main causes of a decline in the export  of

natural rubber from Singapore in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that since then the volume of

exports  of rubber has increased from 598,000  tons

in 1960 to 677,000 tons in 1961.

<div align="center"><b>BEDOK RECLAMATION SCHEME</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  whether  he  will   make   a

statement  on  the  Bedok Reclamation  Scheme,  and

whether any extension thereof is being considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I do not propose to add

much  to  what  the Prime Minister  stated  in  his

speech   in  the  debate  on  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech of 8th April, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is proceeding

with  the  pilot  project  which  will  entail  the

reclamation  of 48 acres near the Fisheries  School

at Bedok,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



8½ milestone.  This  project  is  expected  to  be

completed  in about three months' time.  Initially,

it  is intended that the reclaimed area will be  an

open  park.  In  the  meantime, the  technical  and

financial  aspects of reclaiming further land  from

Bedok to Nicoll Highway are under consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Could the Minister indicate the

anticipated cost of this reclamation?

<div align="center"><b>POLICY ON ERECTION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ADVERTISEMENTS IN PUBLIC HIGHWAYS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a)  whether he  will  make  a

statement of policy with reference to the  erection

of  advertisements in or near public highways;  and

(b)  whether any, and what licences, were granted to

permit the erection of the advertising structure in

North Bridge Road near the Capitol Car Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the erection of

advertisements in or near public highways may  only

be  allowed if written permission has been obtained

from  the  competent authority under  the  Planning

Ordinance, provided the structure is not within  an

area    prohibited    for   the    exhibition    of

advertisements  and complies with the  requirements

of  the  relevant by-laws. The competent authority,

in  examining  any  such  development,  takes  into

account  many  important  considerations,  such  as

aesthetic, amenity and traffic, and is advised by a

Development  Control Committee. The following  were

granted   for   the  erection  of  the  advertising

structure  in North Bridge Road, near  the  Capitol

Car Park :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Planning permission by the competent

authority, on 14th February, 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Approval to building plans by the Chief

Building  Surveyor's  Department   for   the

construction of the structure, on 11th  May,

1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Licences for the exhibition of three sky

signs  and  one advertisement by  the  Chief

Building Surveyor's Department, on different

dates in April and May this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would ask the Minister whether he

was  aware  personally, before these licences  were

granted,  of  the  proposal for  this  monument  to

advertising, and whether having seen it now and the

grave   effect  it  has  on  the  dignity  of   the

waterfront   of   Singapore,  he   would   consider

cancelling those licences.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The first part of the

supplementary question is in order, but the  second

part is completely out of order because it seeks an

expression of opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I then take the first part and

enquire  from the Minister whether he was conscious

of these plans before the granting of the licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, as I have said just now,

licences   from   the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[7th June, 1963],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1963."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first,  let  me  point out that this  is  the  most

unusual  Time to have a Budget debate in Singapore.

Half  the year has already gone by and we  are  now

asked  to  approve only the Budget for  the  second

half  of  1963.  The first half year's  Budget  was

passed in 1961, and according to the P.A.P.,  there

would   be   "numerous  complicated   and   onerous

technical problems of details" involved because  of

the  P.A.P. merger with the Federation on or before

June  1963. But June has come by and there is still

no  merger. Where are the "complicated and  onerous

technical  problems  of details"  involved  in  the

present   Budget  that  necessitate   the   present

procedure? And how is the present Budget  different

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



essence  from the usual Budgets that  we  see  year

after  year,  that it could not have been  prepared

earlier  in  December  1962?  The  reason  for  the

present  procedure is, of course, that  the  P.A.P.

has  no use of the Legislative Assembly other  than

to   use   it   as  a  rubber  stamp   for   P.A.P.

machinations. Passing the Budget early in 1961 made

it  unnecessary for the P.A.P. to hold  Legislative

Assembly  sittings  again for a  long  period.  And

indeed,  there  has  been no Assembly  sitting  for

months    at    a   stretch.   This   unprecedented

parliamentary  procedure, like the  telescoping  of

the time-table for the present Budget debate, shows

what  parliamentary practice we have  in  Singapore

today.  We have already had a long Assembly holiday

of eight months and an Assembly seat vacant for ten

months. Today, the P.A.P. merely wears the garb  of

parliamentary  democracy  for  the  convenience  of

deceiving  the  people  both  inside  and   outside

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is hardly anything that one can enthuse

about  in the Budget statement of the Minister  for

Finance. As usual he talks of P.A.P. successes. But

take  away  the grease, the paint and the  make-up.

What  is  there  left to show?  Like  the  previous

years,  the  year  1962 has been  another  year  of

dismal failure. Funds had been voted for use by the

Government  on development projects in  order  that

they  may  benefit the people. But what development

projects do we see in 1962? Until today, the people

of Singapore have not been told as to how funds had

been  spent on the development projects in 1962.  A

sum of $207 million had been voted in December 1961

for  the  1962 Development Estimates. The whole  of

Singapore can see that the money has not been spent

as  was  budgeted for. As the Minister himself  has

admitted in the statement, in 1962 there was a huge

surplus  of $97 million, just as there was  a  huge

surplus  of $110 million in 1961. What has happened

to the surplus of $97 million in 1962? Why does the

Minister  not  inform the House and the  people  of

Singapore as to what he has done with the money - the

people's money and not P.A.P.'s money?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Not

Barisan money either!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister may try to hide

all  the ugly facts behind a mass of verbiage,  but

the  people  have the right to know  the  state  of

financial affairs of Singapore. It is the duty  and

responsibility of the Government to inform them  of

what it has done to their money - not P.A.P. money!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> When

did we say "P.A.P. money"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let the P.A.P. tell the people

why  there is repeated under-performance,  and  let

the  P.A.P. openly admit its own inefficiency  and

incompetence  and even negligence  in  the  matter.

There has been too much boasting about this surplus

which  the  Prime Minister claims is the result  of

P.A.P. efficiency and good government. We say  that

it is nothing of the sort, and let the P.A.P. admit this  tact.  If the surplus had come  about  as  a

result  of  unexpected  windfalls  due  to  a  more

efficient  collection of revenue, then there  would

have  been  something to crow  about.  But  if  the

surplus  had come about as a result of funds  voted

for  and  passed  in the Legislative  Assembly  not

being   used,  then  it  could  only   have   meant

incompetent and bad government. It could only  have

been  a  source of shame to the P.A.P. and  not  a

source of boasting and bragging. For the P.A.P. to

go about telling the people that the surplus is due

to  the  good government of the P.A.P. is therefore

sheer deception. The people, of course, are not  so

easily  deceived; nevertheless, the P.A.P. must  be

condemned  for  such  attempted  deception  of  the

people,  and  we ask the P.A.P. not to repeat  this

deception.  The  Prime  Minister  goes  round   the

constituencies. Let the Ministers here tell him not

to brag about this surplus anymore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, Sir, we can also see that the

P.A.P.  Ministers do not mean what they  say.  When

they  say  success, they in fact mean failure.  But

however  much slick talk the Minister  may  indulge

in,  he  will  not  be able to get  this  past  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. called the year 1961 the year of

construction. But now we know that there is nothing

constructive about 1961. It was a year of  sell-out

as far as we know ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and there was a surplus of

$110 million of work not done and money not used on

the people ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> You must be blind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. did not give a name

to the year 1962. We can help them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The year of fulfilment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is quite clear that the year

1962 was a year of P.A.P. deceit and coercion. That

is  how  they  managed their 70  per  cent  in  the

referendum. If the 70 per cent was correct ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> 71 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But what of 1963? What shall we

call it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The year of the Rabbit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We shall call it the year of

surrender -  abject surrender - in spite of  all

the  brave talk of the Minister for Finance and the

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Barisan finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Four years of P.A.P. misrule

have  passed, and the time will come for the people

to  pass  judgment on the Government. In the  first

two years, the P.A.P. Ministers spent most of their

Time  throwing  their  weight about  with  habitual

arrogance. They abused civil servants, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> You were one of

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- instituted pay cuts and

generally   insulted,  threatened  and  intimidated

people all around. To make things worse, taxes were

raised   on  petrol  and  tobacco  and  the  P.A.P.

persisted  in taking a tough line because  at  that

Time   the   P.A.P. thought   that   it   was   an

indispensable  force. Today, with  popular  support

gone, ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Really?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- the P.A.P. Ministers have to

resort  to  the buying of votes in preparation  for

the coming elections. In fact, they are ready to do

almost  anything,  and  they  are  already  bending

themselves backwards to please every Tom, Dick  and

Harry.   The  Prime  Minister  has  to  run  around

attending dinner functions of clan associations and

other private functions. He wears all sorts of head

gears  including turbans, and he  is  ready  to  do

almost anything in order to ingratiate himself with

all  those whom he used to despise and ridicule not

so  very  long  ago. Pictures in the Straits  Times

showed  the  Prime  Minister  openly  hugging   the

Minister for Farrer Park ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> You have not had enough sleep.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And today, they have even gone

to  the extent of giving medals and what-not to the

civil servants ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You did not get any.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- the very people whom the

P.A.P. despised and bullied but yesterday!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the years of P.A.P. misrule, we see broken

promises, underfulfilment of projects, shortages in

staff  and  equipment  in  the  various  Government

departments. The Prime Minister wants to  give  the

impression   that   he  is  concerned   about   the

hospitals. Does he know that today all the  various

departments   in  the  hospitals   are   short   of

equipment? The essential drugs are missing ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You pinched them,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and there is increasing

hardship  for the people. The unemployment  problem

is  worsening.  In  addition, of course,  there  is

repression and the deprivation of the basic  rights

and  freedoms of the people. Only in one department

do  the P.A.P. Ministers excel in, and that is  the

department  of malicious distortion, deception  and

treachery. The P.A.P. excels in sell-outs. That  is

the only thing they are good in, nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of the financial merger talks, in

spite  of all the brave talk of the Prime Minister,

it  is  clear  that the P.A.P. is  already  getting

ready to surrender in toto to the Federation.  This

talk  of limited common market terms is only  meant

to  save  the  face of the Prime  Minister  in  his

abject  surrender. The Minister for  Finance  still

talks of independence through merger. But he cannot

be  serious. He was talking with his tongue in  his

cheek  because  there is no independence  with  the

P.A.P. merger and the P.A.P. itself has admitted as

much  in  the  financial  talks  tussle  with   the

Federation.  If  it  really thinks  that  there  is

independence,  why should it fight  or  pretend  to

fight?  Therefore, let us get rid of this  nonsense

about independence through merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talks of finding the money to pay for new schools and houses. But although we had the money in hand in 1962, we nevertheless did not have the many new schools and hospitals. Nor the equipment and staff for them. We have surpluses which have merely been sent overseas for investment. In 1959, the surplus funds invested

overseas   amounted  to  $139  million.   The   sum

increased to $249 million in 1960 and by  1961  the

amount  invested  overseas had increased  to  $316 million.  I  do  not  wish to repeat  what  I  have

already  said only two months ago in the debate  on

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. It can always

be found in the Hansard. Unfortunately, the figures

for  1962 have not come out yet. But I am sure that

the  figure for 1962 will be much higher  than  for

1961. The P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan advocates the use

of  local funds for investment in Singapore. Today,

we  see  that  the P.A.P. has not only not  brought

back to Singapore money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



invested  overseas, but, on the  contrary,  it  has

increased  the  investment abroad. What  good  will

money   invested  abroad  do  to  the   people   of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem in Singapore's economy remains

the  problem  of unemployment. How are  we  to  get

enough jobs for the increasing number of unemployed

in Singapore? Every year, more than 30,000 students

leave  school. What has the P.A.P. done  to  obtain

jobs for all these job-seekers? How does the P.A.P.

deal  with  this  problem of -  according  to  the

Minister - sustaining   the   economic   growth    of

Singapore to keep pace with the yearly increase  in

population?  For  four years, the P.A.P. has  been

playing  politics. Although the Five-Year  Plan  in

The  Tasks Ahead was announced to the people before

1959,  and  the  Four-Year  Development  Plan   was

prepared  more  than two years ago, no  appreciable

concrete results have been shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialisation programme has been left

stagnating  as  a  result  of  the  P.A.P. playing

politics and the Ministers' obsession to fix  their

political opponents. The Minister boasts of pioneer

certificates  for industries, that they  will  soon

commence  operation  and  provide  jobs  for  3,500

people, and of a range of goods, which if and  when

they  go  into production, will provide  employment

for  1,620  people.  Even  if  these  figures  were

realised, for the sake of argument, it still  would

not  help  the situation. In four years  of  P.A.P.

misrule. 30,000 times 4, that is, 120,000 young men

and  women have left school to look for jobs. Where

are  the  120,000  jobs for these  120,000  people?

There  have  not  been enough jobs,  and  the  only

result so far is that there is a steady increase in

the already large number of hawkers and other under-employed people. So what is there for the P.A.P. to

crow about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect of this

industrialisation scheme of the P.A.P. which is not

so  well  known. It is that Singapore has to  spend

millions in the provision of the basic services for

the  industrial site, namely, roads, railways, post

offices,   power,  water,  telephones   and   other

services.  Now,  if this money had  been  spent  on

these   services  for  the  benefit  of  our  local

businessmen,  then it would have  been  money  well

spent. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



our  fear,  Sir,  is that this money  will  benefit

mostly  the foreign capitalists. The present trends

are  that  all the benefit will go to  the  foreign

capitalists and not to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation has always been linked with the

formation  of  the common market between  Singapore

and  the Federation. Yet from the financial  merger

talks  between the two Governments, we  learn  that

the subject of the common market has never actually

been  discussed until very recently. This tells  us

one very important thing, that during the crisis of

the chicken and egg war in November and December of

last  year  and  January of this  year,  the  Prime

Minister  was merely deceiving the people  when  he

told diem that there would be a common market.  Why

should the people be deceived in this manner? As we

have  all  the Time pointed out, the Causeway  will

remain   a  barrier  between  Singapore   and   the

Federation even after the P.A.P. merger.  We  still

do not know what sort of common market arrangements

there will be, Rueff Report or no Rueff Report,  we

must hear in mind that, with overall control in the

hands  of the Federation, Singapore will he treated

as  and  will  remain, a very  junior  and  unequal

partner.  In  which ease, all the major  industries

will  have  to be approved first by the  Federation

before  they  will  be allowed  to  be  set  up  in

Singapore. This is a far cry from the common market

originally  envisaged,  which  would  permit  joint

Federation  /  Singapore control  and  planning  of

industrial  programme for all Malaya.  Now  without

even  proportional  representation  to  exert   the

appropriate  influence on the  Central  Parliament.

Singapore  will  not be able to set  up  industries

that  may  compete with similar industries  in  the

Federation, whether they be in actual operation  or

still under planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. industrialisation has obviously failed so

far   as  local  businessmen  are  concerned.   The

Ministers   cannot  even  persuade  importers   and

traders    to   take   a   serious   interest    in

industrialisation.  Why  are  these  importers  and

traders reluctant to change to industry? There  are

various  reasons. But a very important one is  that

there has never been political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



stability  in  the country. Of course,  the  P.A.P.

would  like to pass the buck on to the workers  and

their  unions. But the facts cannot  be  hidden  so

easily.  The  Government has only 25  seats  in  an

Assembly  of  51, and is so afraid of  meeting  the

people  that it has not even dared to face them  in

the  Sembawang  constituency, now vacant  for  more

than  ten  months.  The P.A.P. today  exists  as  a

Government  only because all the P.A.P. Assemblymen

have  a  vested  interest  in  keeping  a  wobbling

Government  going,  and,  of  course,  because  the

S.P.A./  U.M.N.O. Alliance for the Time being,  for

their  own  reasons,  want to keep  it  going.  But

already  a new crisis is looming. The Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture has  resigned

from  his  post of Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister, and the question arises as to whether  or

not  he  will cross the Floor. Whether  or  not  he

crosses  the Floor, the new crisis merely  confirms

what all Singapore already knows, namely, that  the

P.A.P.   Government  is  soon  going   under.   The

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture

believes  that it is safer to depend on the  nurses

and P.T. workers than on the Government itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture should now be

referred to as the Member for Kampong Kapor.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir. The Member for

Kampong Kapor finds it safer to depend on the union

organisations than on the P.A.P. Government itself.

He  knows  that the P.A.P. is already  sinking.  He

does  not have to sink together with it, if he  can

help it. Hence, he is breaking away from the P.A.P.

If the people on the Benches opposite still persist

in their dreams, it is Time that they realised ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Nightmare!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nightmare? There are not many

people  who  have  brothers who profit  from  their

brothers  holding positions in the Government.  Let

those people who are talking realise all this.  The

P.A.P. always talks of its cleanliness and purity.

Corruption can be seen everywhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order. May I

ask  the  Member for Queenstown to produce evidence

instead of alleging corruption?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

The   Member  for  Queenstown  is  making   serious

allegations, and if the allegations are false,  he,

of  course, takes the risk of facing the  Committee

of  Privileges.  It  is his  statement  and  he  is

privileged to make that statement here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for  Education  need  do  is  to

institute a Commission of Inquiry since they are so

fond  of Commissions of Inquiry, and then they will

get at the truth. It is very easy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Repeat it outside the House!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, there is no political

stability  in Singapore with the P.A.P. Government,

and  arrests  of  political opponents  cannot  give

stability to the Government. On the contrary,  they

merely   show   the  death  throes   of   desperate

politicians about to drown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that the common market is the most decisive single factor in accelerating industrial growth. But from all that we can see, political instability is the most decisive factor here in Singapore. The sham referendum on the 1st September, 1962, has not helped to stabilise the shaky P.A.P. Government. Even the Prime Minister of

the  Federation  said that the sham referendum  did

not  show the strength of the pro-Malaysian forces.

So  fearful,  Sir, are the investors of Singapore's

political  instability that not so  very  long  ago

Newsweek  gave  prominence to $20  million  fleeing

from  Singapore  to  Hong Kong  for  investment.  I

remember the Minister for Finance saying that  Hong

Kong  has  succeeded  in industrialisation  because

there  are  no  trade unions in Hong Kong.  But  he

conveniently  forgets that few people  today  trust

the P.A.P. Government. Even the Federation does not

trust the P.A.P. But from that small remark by  the

Minister  for  Finance, we can also  see  that,  in

fact, the Minister secretly harbours hopes of doing

away with unions that are opposed to the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is curious, Sir, that with so much money

around,  we  still need to borrow  money  from  the

World  Bank.  A loan from the World Bank  does  not

mean  confidence in the Government as the  Minister

claims.  All  sorts of conditions are imposed.  The

interest  is  not  low either.  5½  per  cent  plus

incidentals comes to about 7 per cent.  Why  should

we  pay 7 per cent? The Minister should follow what

he  himself had advocated long ago, and make use of

local   funds  for  whatever  we  want  to  do   in

Singapore.  Why  does he not do  so?  It  would  be

interesting to learn from the Minister who are  the

people  who subscribe to the loans floated  by  the

Government in Singapore. Are they local citizens or

are  they  foreigners? Are the  subscribers  mostly

banks and insurance companies and, if so, are  they

local  banks  or foreign banks? We  must  warn  the

P.A.P. of unnecessarily getting deeper and  deeper

into  the  clutches  of  neo-colonialism.  For  the

benefit  of the P.A.P. Members, neo-colonialism  is

economic  and  military domination after  political

independence  has been apparently  granted  to  the

people.  As far as possible, it is our policy  that

the  people of Singapore should rely on the  people

of Singapore themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to the increased volume of trade. But it has not brought with it a corresponding increase in national income. In fact, with the falling prices of our raw materials and products and the rising prices of imported manufactured goods and foodstuffs, the loss to us of national income becomes greater and greater

every  year.  The  end result of  it  all  is  that

Singapore  will sink further and further  into  the

clutches  of neo-colonialism. The present  economic

policy of the Government with its pro-colonial bias

can  only  lead us to be under tighter and  tighter

foreign  indirect control which,  in  effect,  will

mean  that  the rich in Singapore will get  richer,

and the poor will get poorer, with a daily widening

of  the economic gap. This is what we must ask  the

P.A.P. to avoid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was elected to office by the people in

1959. All we ask of it is that it should admit  its

mistakes of the past and immediately attend more to

the needs of the poor. Of course, with the approach

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



election  time, the P.A.P. is fast  putting  up  an

appearance of attending to the needs of  the  poor.

The Minister crows of so-called concessions made to

owner-occupied attap houses. But these are not true

and   sincere  concessions.  The  P.A.P. has   the

intention  of collecting as much money as  possible

from  whatever  source  there  is,  regardless   of

whether it is from the poor or the rich. It is only

the  fear of loss of whatever support there is left

for  the P.A.P. amongst the attap dwellers that the

Minister   has  been  forced  to  grant   so-called

concessions. We urge the P.A.P. to change the error

of its ways and stop taxing the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. takes great pride in its so-called

housing  achievements. Thousands of  housing  units

have  been  built, but they are built  in  such  an

unplanned  manner that they have, in  fact,  become

white  elephants.  Thousands  of  flats  are  still

vacant,  unsuitable in site and in  rent,  for  the

vast  majority  of  the people  of  Singapore.  The

question  then  arises: for whom  are  the  housing

flats  built?  For the comparatively well-to-do  or

for the poor? A big show was made of Selegie House.

We just want to ask the Minister a simple question:

how  does  he  expect a poor man to  stay  in  such

expensive flats at rents of $60, $90, and $120? All

that a poor man can earn will not be enough to  pay

for  the rent. Is that the way to build houses?  Is

money  collected  in taxes from the  poor  and  the

exploited   to   be   used  as  subsidy   for   the

comparatively   well-to-do?   Are    these    flats

subsidised with taxes from the poor to he  used  as

barracks for military troops brought into Singapore

to suppress the legitimate hopes and aspirations of

the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To suppress the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has happened to the

promises of cheap housing in the P.A.P.'s Five-Year

Plan?  Is the Housing Board building flats for  the

people  or  barracks for the troops? We know  there

are  a few housing units at cheap rentals, but they

are  only  a  mere  handful. The  majority  of  the

Housing units are too expensive for the ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



worker. Therefore, let the P.A.P. remember this: we

must not build merely for the sake of building. The

Government must build for the use of the poor,  and

let   the   P.A.P. amend   its   housing   policy

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the decision of subsidy for housing,

but  let the subsidy be really used for housing for

the  poor and not for the comparatively well-to-do.

We still remember, Sir, the adamant attitude of the

P.A.P.  Ministers  in their wanting  to  raise  the

rentals  of all the Housing Board flats,  beginning

with the flats at the Kallang Airport, in spite  of

strong protests and opposition from us who are  now

in  the Barisan Sosialis. And we are glad that  our

strong  protests  have borne  fruit  and  that  the

P.A.P. has  not  dared  to  raise  the  rents  any

further. In fact, they have done an about-turn  and

are  trying to gain the goodwill of the  people  by

telling them of Government subsidies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the Government also to spend more on

improving public amenities in the rural areas.  Let

the   P.A.P. not  just  concentrate  on  community

centres  and  T.V. for the  sake  of  forcing  its

propaganda on the people. Let more rural  roads  be

built.  Let  electric lights and  pipe  water,  the

essentials of a modern society, reach the  tens  of

thousands  in the rural areas and in the  kampongs,

whose  people  still do not enjoy  these  essential

amenities.  In  order  to  buy  votes,  the   Prime

Minister  announces the so-called improvements  for

the   rural  constituencies  during  his   week-end

visits. But the unfortunate thing about it  all  is

that  these improvements have come three years  too

late.  We object to the delay in the implementation

of  these  projects which should have been  carried

out  more than three years ago. But for the  coming

elections,  these projects might  never  even  been

thought  of  again by the arrogant and self-centred

Ministers, so busy are they in playing politics  to

fix their political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also much talk of increased

expenditure  on  Education.  But  until  today  the

Nanyang  University question has not been  settled.

This  question  cannot be settled by just  ignoring

it.  It  is  there,  and it must  be  settled.  The

Government  should  stop playing  politics  on  the

question of aid to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



Nanyang University, and until adequate aid is given

to  Nantah, the P.A.P. need not put up any  further

pretence of pursuing a policy of equal treatment of

the four streams of education. There is no question

of not having the money. Millions of dollars are in

the  Singapore  kitty. Let us use the  money  taken

from the people on a seat of learning that has been

built by the sweat and toil of the people, for  the

people,  not  only of Singapore  but  also  of  the

Federation  and surrounding territories  in  South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, just a word about Malaysia. Malaysia

is  not  something that comes from the  spontaneous

desire of the people to have national unity. On the

contrary, Sir, it is designed to be a strategic and

an  aggressive  bloc  for the  use  of  imperialist

powers   to  suppress  the  legitimate  hopes   and

aspirations  of the people in the whole  of  South-East  Asia. More than two-thirds of the  people  in

the world condemn Malaysia. The wrangle for finance

from Singapore for the expansion of Malaysian armed

forces  tells  us  what  we  can  expect  with  the

formation of Malaysia. It will not do Singapore any

good.  The  P.A.P. must realise that the future  of

Singapore   is   not  tied  up  with   the   Borneo

territories and so with the present Malaysia  plan.

Our future is with the Federation. All this talk of

Malaysian   prosperity  sounds  very  hollow   when

genuine   job  opportunities  for  the  people   of

Singapore   are   restricted  to  the   island   of

Singapore.   People   from  all   the   surrounding

territories  can  come into Singapore  and  compete

with  the people here for jobs. On the contrary  we

in  Singapore  cannot freely go to  the  other  so-called  Malaysian territories for jobs  because  of

immigration    restrictions   and   our    inferior

citizenship status.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Do you want to go there yourself?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister talks of golden

geese  and  golden  eggs. I am  glad  the  Minister

admits that Singapore is golden. We do not have  to

worry  about  whether the egg or  the  goose  comes

first. But whether goose or egg,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



both  are  golden. Singapore, therefore,  need  not

have  to go in as a junior and unequal partner with

its  citizens  becoming second-class citizens.  The

P.A.P. need  not have to sell Singapore  down  the

river.  Let  them remember that gold  matches  gold

and, therefore, negotiations between Singapore  and

the  Federation  must be on the basis  of  justice,

equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Oh, please stop talking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank God for that.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  noticed that the Minister for Finance in  his

Budget   speech  this  year  has  spoken   with   a

surprisingly new voice. His language is so moderate

and reasonable that it is almost like a lullaby. He

is  trying to soothe the Opposition and the  nerves

of nervous merchants, traders, and workers, so that

they  think  that they now have a new Minister  for

Finance and a new Party ruling over them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statements are so different from the

days  of 1959 and 1960 when the P.A.P. wielded  the

big axe and the big stick that the Barisan Sosialis

say  that they have sold themselves out to somebody

somewhere. To quote an example from paragraph 28 of

the  Minister's speech, beginning with  the  second

sentence in page 10 ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If possible, I ask hon.

Members to use our Official Report, which has  come

into the hands of Members - the Official Report which

has been produced overnight.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am sorry, Sir,I have been

using the other copy. I am unable to locate in  the

Official  Report the particular paragraph*

that  I wish to quote from the other copy.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue from the previous

copy of the speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This being the case, our plan of industrial

expansion must be more circumspect and judicious.'



<br><br>It  implies  here, Sir, that previously  there  was

less  circumspection and maybe measures  that  were

not so judicious were undertaken.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir. The Member has misunderstood me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When I said that our policy

must  be more circumspect and more judicious,  this

was  in comparison with larger countries with large

natural resources and large population. I think  if

the  Member  will read the preceding paragraph,  he

will  get  the comparison clear enough. I  was  not

comparing present policy with past policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, that might have been the

Finance  Minister's intention, but in the Singapore

context    it    happen   to   be    an    accurate

description - that in the first year the  P.A.P. was

so over-confident that they took measures that were

so   drastic   that   they  frightened   away   the

capitalists  who were meant to help them.  Now,  of

course,  they  have  learnt from bitter  experience

that  there  are other people with other  wills  of

their  own and who cannot be ridden roughshod over,

and  I am glad that they have learnt that they must

be  more  circumspect and judicious in their  ways.

But  at  least we all live and learn and I am  glad

that they have learnt. Time has taught them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, in the concluding paragraph of

his  speech,  indirectly he  praised  the  approach

which we in the Alliance have been advocating  from

the  very  start. Our policy has been  one  of  co-operation  rather  than one  of  confrontation  and

strife   between  races  and  between  labour   and

management.   In  the  second  sentence   of   that

concluding paragraph, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Singapore, the history of the last ten scars

have been full of strife, tumult and excitement.'



<br><br>It sounds like a speech from one of us, Sir:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are many people who consider that we have

had  more than our share of strife and that  it  is

about  Time that the energies and effervescence  of

our    youthful   society   be   diverted   towards

constructive  endeavours. There is much  wisdom  in

this approach.'



<br><br>Sir, I am glad that they too have learnt that there

is wisdom from this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this in appreciation of their

change  of  tone and stand, I must  also  place  on

record  the  doubts  of many  people  in  Singapore

regarding this change. They ask: "Is this a sincere

change  on  the part of the P.A.P., or  is  this  a

calculated  move,  a pose, because  of  the  coming

general  elections? Having lost their support  from

the  extreme Left, have they therefore  decided  to

confuse the Centre and Right, so that they can take

away  votes  that  would otherwise  belong  to  the

Alliance  group?"  Sir, this is a  common  form  of

strategy  taught  by  the Communists.  Three  steps

forward  and two steps backwards will mean  in  the

end  an  advance.  I  for one  welcome  the  change

revealed in the Finance Minister's speech if it  is

sincere, if it denotes a change of heart and not  a

change  of  the skin for the sake of the people  of

Singapore.  But  I  regret  that  I  have   to   be

realistic,  and if the people of Singapore  are  to

believe that this change is sincere and going to be

lasting,  there  is  much  in  the  past  that  the

People's Action Party will have to live down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have to be consistent. In the past,

along  the road of their political progress to  the

pinnacle  of  success, they have left  behind  them

wounded bodies ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mangled bodies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I will not say "mangled"; some

of  them are not mangled - just the wounded bodies of

their friends, comrades and allies. To name just  a

few,  Sir, for whom the People's Action Party  will

have  to  make some kind of sacrifice to  recognise

that they have learnt their lesson and have changed

deeply,  there was the late Mr John  Laycock,  who

appointed,  as  his  trusted  election  agent,  the

present  Prime Minister. The present Prime Minister

was  then  a lawyer in his office. And his  trusted

election agent, Sir, turned out later on to be  his

bitter foe. I think I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



can  say honestly that the old man died of a broken

heart.  Another  victim, Sir, was  the  Member  for

Anson, the then Chief Minister, who found too  late

to his cost that being too friendly with the P.A.P.

meant  his being misled. Similarly, Sir, the Member

for Cairnhill, the then leader of the Labour Front.

He  agreed  that  the  Labour Front  should  be  in

alliance  with  the  P.A.P. to  contest  the  City

Council elections ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What about you now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- but too late, he found that

the  Labour Front and he were just being  exploited

and  they suffered terribly. Now, what happened  to

the  Member for Hong Lim and to Messrs.  Lim  Ching

Siong  and  company is well known. Therefore,  Sir,

with that record behind them, this new tone in  the

voice of the Finance Minister does not convince the

people unless the P.A.P. can outlive this record of

a Party with the kiss of Judas. That is the fear of

many  people, the fear of the Tunku,  the  fear  of

many  in Singapore, that if they support the P.A.P.

again,  they  will  be betrayed after  the  general

elections. I sincerely hope that my words  are  not

true, that this change of heart is a deep one, that

they  can  be trusted, regardless of the result  of

the  coming elections, to be consistent  with  this

new line, this new approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the question of new jobs. All

political  Parties  in Singapore  are  agreed  that

there must be more and more jobs because there  are

more and more people in Singapore, and because  the

rate of increase of the population in Singapore  is

so   tremendous,  then  the  rate  of  increase  of

employment  opportunities must also  be  rapid.  In

1959, the P.A.P. said the same thing and today they

say  the  same thing. In that, they are consistent.

All  Parties have been consistent in that. So  they

say,  [Page  49  of  the  unrevised  transcript   -

Hansard, Vol. 20, No. 5, dated 7th June, 1963, col.

556]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Recognising that the creation of new jobs is of

over-riding importance, the Government believes

that the attack must be mounted on s broad front.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives are the same. What we believe has

been wrong, has been the method of achieving these

objectives with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



the  result  that  today  the  mistakes  made  have

nullified even the efforts of previous governments.

I will come to that with statistics, Sir. We cannot

ignore ideologies. In Singapore any Party which  is

short-sighted will adopt the policy  of  the  class

struggle.  But  in  the light of the  situation  in

Singapore, and the Finance Minister knows  it,  and

in  this  nuclear age, the ideology  of  the  class

struggle and of class hatred will lead Singapore to

disaster  and the world to a nuclear war.  We  have

got  to  face those facts. If we are realistic,  we

must  not  allow any resentments from the  past  to

obscure the fact that for the sake of the future of

Singapore  and of humanity, we must rise above  our

resentments and learn to co-operate. Now,  Sir,  if

the P.A.P. fully believe in this new approach of co-operation, then there is a chance that all  Parties

working  together instead of being  at  loggerheads

with  one  another can produce a new tempo,  a  new

productivity  which  will  help  us  to  solve  our

serious unemployment problem. We know that hitherto

the P.A.P. has played a double game with labour and

management.  They  have  shown  one  face  to   the

employer  and another face to the trade  union.  It

tells one union to go on strike; then it tells  the

employer  to  hold on. Sir, politics  have  entered

into  the  field of labour - the Barisan for  certain

unions,  the  P.A.P. for certain  unions   - and  the

result, I think, is considerable labour unrest  and

strikes,  and  the  number  of  jobs  available  in

Singapore  has  not  only increased  commensurately

with  the population, but has diminished.  Sir,  in

September 1957, the Labour Ministry Report recorded

that  there were 123,000 workers in employment;  in

September  1960, there were 105,600;  in  September

1961,  there were 109,286. So after four  years  of

P.A.P. rule, Singapore has less jobs  for  workmen

than  in  1957. That is our present position,  that

with  increasing  population we  have  a  situation

where there are less and less jobs. I would like to

inform the Finance Minister of some of the reasons.

I asked one employer why, since this is a period of

expansion,  he  does not expand  and  take  in  new

hands.  His reply was, "We dare not expand  because

we  do  not know what the labour situation will  be

like  later, and if we take in new hands we  cannot

dismiss   them   if   they   are   found   to    be

unsatisfactory. So we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



have  found that the best thing to do is to  remain

as  we are." Sir, that is a defeatist attitude  for

Singapore  because  we  must  have  a  climate   of

confidence  so  that there is rapid  expansion  and

therefore a corresponding increase in the number of

jobs. I think the Finance Minister himself realises

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come now to surpluses. It is expected

that  this  year will end with a surplus of  nearly

$100  million.  The  figure given,  Sir,  is  $97.1

million ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Last year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Last year. This year's surplus

may even be bigger because that has been the record

so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of budget surpluses, I find, is

linked   up  very  closely  with  the  problem   of

unemployment. Finance Ministers all over the  world

would  like to have large surpluses just as private

individuals   like  to  have  large  savings.   But

economists  say  that there  is  such  a  thing  as

excessive  surpluses, and excessive  surpluses  are

bad for the people's welfare ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Talking about socialism?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If the surplus is excessive,

then either the people are being overtaxed or there

is   under-expenditure  depriving  the  people   of

benefits they should have or depriving them of more

jobs. The remedy then could be reducing some of the

taxes,  like the taxes on petrol or providing  more

tax  reliefs or spending more on projects  to  give

more employment to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I be regarded as just guessing, took

the trouble to consult an economist ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Your daughter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No. And I took the trouble to

read a book on Principles of Public Finance by Hugh

Dalton, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the

United Kingdom ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> He is dead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> He may be dead, Sir, but his

thoughts   are   still  relevant.   He   talks   of

overbalanced  and  underbalanced budgets.  He  says

that    public   policy   may   sometimes   require

deliberately  that  temporary  budget  deficits  be

incurred  in  pursuit of larger  aims,  notably  an

increase  of  employment through  an  expansion  of

credit.   Therefore,  when  Singapore   has   large

surpluses,  although the Government may take  great

pride  in  them and look forward to more surpluses,

this  achievement may have been at the  expense  of

the  people of Singapore. More jobs could have been

produced if more money had been spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also conscience money in that big

bag. Now, as the Finance Minister is interested  in

income tax payers being honest and not cheating the

Income  Tax  Department by keeping back some  facts

about  their incomes, in the same way I  think  the

Government should set a good example and  not  keep

in  their surplus bags money which really does  not

belong to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were young we learnt some poetry

which  is  relevant,  I think,  in  this  situation

because  these  are words of wisdom  which  can  be

remembered and applied even when we are old:





<pre>

               'I'll fares the land,

                To hastening ills a prey,

                Where wealth accumulates,

                And men decay.'

</pre>





<br>And the wealth can accumulate also in a government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever anybody talks of his successes he

shows  the  real  spirit of  humility  if  he  also

acknowledges the debt he owes to the past,  to  his

predecessors.  Now, one mistake  which  the  P.A.P.

have  made and which they have not admitted so  far

is  that  they  assume  that  everything  that  has

happened  in  Singapore to the credit of  Singapore

belongs to them. Nothing good came from those  past

governments,  from  the government  of  the  Labour

Front,   of  the  imperialists - nothing.  [Laughter]

Everything  good  began from 1959 onwards.  I  see,

Sir,   that   the  Barisan  friends  are   enjoying

themselves. Maybe they appreciate that point too ---

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The Finance Minister said in

[page 48 of the Un-revised Transcript-Hansard, Vol.

20, No. 5 dated 7th June, 1963, col. 554]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We both possessed and still so far have retained

all  the pre-requisites of economic growth. We have

a strong and stable currency. There is a firm legal

framework   in  which  contracts  are  enforceable,

thereby    making    future   business    relations

predictable.    There   is   also   an    effective

administration and reasonable supply of experienced

managerial skills.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We possessed and have" - to be accurate, Sir, it

should  have  been "We inherited and  have  so  far

retained  all  the  pre-requisites  of  growth."  A

"strong  and stable currency" was here  before  the

P.A.P. came into existence. "Firm legal framework",

the  same. So I am glad the Finance Minister admits

that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Concede, concede.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes. Same with the Polytechnic.

Will he concede that also?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Concede.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In page 49 [Unrevised

Transcript] (Hansard, col. 555), when talking about

trade  and expansion, they spoke about the previous

laissez  faire policy. They said that it could  not

be relied upon to generate economic growth. I agree

that  we  cannot depend on that alone. But we  have

heard   time  and  again  reference  made  to   the

entrepreneur spirit of the people of Singapore, and

that is a great asset. But the mistake made by  the

P.A.P.,  Sir,  is  that  they  went  to  the  other

extreme.  They said they must remedy this  by  some

form  of positive State action. Sir, I want to  say

here  that they took so much State action  that  it

became  almost  gross interference with  individual

enterprise and the people said that if :we have  no

freedom and we are bound by this and that, we would

have  to  go to the Federation and Hongkong.  I  am

glad  that  today they have come in  between.  They

admit  that  laissez faire and  the  trade  of  the

entrepreneur  is  important  because  it   develops

enterprise in each man who has got initiative,  and

there  must also be State encouragement  and  State

help.  The reason why we are in difficulty is  that

with  the  Jurong scheme well advanced,  the  sites

ready,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  find  that  there  is  not  enough

response from the industrialists and they  have  to

give some advice to the local merchants saying that

the  local  merchants had better transfer  some  of

their  investments to industries.  I  am  sure  the

local merchants are keen on making profits. But  if

what  they put in is going to disappear because  of

the  uncertain labour situation, or  because  of  a

possible  change  in  the policy  of  the  People's

Action  Party after the general elections, so  many

of  them say, "We will wait until after the general

elections."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I ought to remind the

Member  for Tanglin that the Speaker is  seated  in

this Chair and not in the Minister's Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Thank you for reminding me,

Sir.  There were so many interruptions coming  from

there   that  my  attention  was  drawn   to   that

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding tariff barriers, I made a point when

the  Bill went to Select Committee, Sir, and  I  am

glad that the Finance Minister accepted it that  we

must  not sacrifice our entrepot trade for any  new

industry  unless  the  result  is  an  increase  in

employment  for our people. An increase  in  profit

for  any  particular company or individual  is  not

going  to  be  the criterion. The criterion  is  an

increase  in the number of people employed.  If  by

introducing  a tariff, we thereby cause  firms  and

organisations to be closed for the sake  of  a  new

factory, then we have got to calculate whether  the

number of workers thrown out of employment would be

less or more. Even then, Sir, it should be done  in

such  a way that they should not be suddenly thrown

out of employment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the integration of the

City  Council is still a moot point. In theory,  we

agree  that  it  leads  to economy  if  we  prevent

conflicts   between  the  City  Council   and   the

Government.  But  in practice, it  sometimes  means

over-centralisation in the hands of a few. In fact,

there  is  talk  now that the City Council  is  the

Prime Minister and the Prime Minister is the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



Council. In fact, certain decisions cannot be  made

by  officers,  who  before  could  make  decisions,

because the Prime Minister is the one and only  one

who can give the directives. Sir, we hope that this

experiment  will  succeed.  But  if  it  does   not

succeed, then it may be that we have to think again

in    future   of   introducing   some   kind    of

decentralisation,  so  that  there  can   be   more

participation   democratically  by   the   people's

representatives at lower levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, we say that the Budget speech

of  the Finance Minister is unusually moderate, and

we  can  only hope that what he says he means,  and

that  the  future will show no more double-crossing

by  the  P.A.P. of  its friends  and  allies.  But

already  we  see, Sir, one Parliamentary  Secretary

resigning  his job, and we wonder what is happening

inside the P.A.P. at this time.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after  four  years  and  one  week  of  the  P.A.P.

management,  we  can say with confidence  that  the

P.A.P. is  on  the last stage of  winding  up.  As

nothing  in  the crucial months before the  general

elections in 1959 could stem the tide of the P.A.P.

victory,  today  no  power on earth  can  save  the

P.A.P. from  extinction  as  a  political  force.

Hundreds   of   Canutes   cannot   forestall   this

inevitability.  As  the  P.A.P. had   wanted   the

Malaysia  Plan  to  save  its  skin,  so  will  the

Malaysia Plan like a Frankenstein scratch  out  the

P.A.P. from the political arena. The P.A.P. leaders

might  entertain high hopes and, Sir,  let  us  not

forget  that  they are capable of projecting  their

minds   into   impossible   flights   of   fanciful

imagination, like during the counting in  the  Hong

Lim by-election at the Victoria Memorial Hall, they

were  all ready with lion and dragon dances  hidden

behind  the  Victoria  Memorial  Theatre,   and   I

understand  two  lorry-loads of fire-crackers  were

also ready, for a P.A.P. victory celebration to  be

followed by a victory march into Anson, where a by-election was pending at the Time. Sir, if I may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



say  so, nobody on this side of the House knows the

P.A.P. leaders, their tactics, their organisation,

their  support, better than I do. And  I  say  that

they  are  finished. I must admit that I am  partly

responsible for their downfall. [Interruption]  You

see,  Sir,  without us, a person like the  Minister

for  Finance, on his own, would not have been  able

to  get even 200 votes in Kreta Ayer in April 1959.

The  Minister for Education would not even get  100

votes  in  Geylang West. Who knows him there?  But,

Sir, why has it led to all this? It is because  the

P.A.P. has betrayed the people, has departed  from

its  objectives, and deviated from its  principles.

Why should the P.A.P. leaders be so bitter, as they

are today? They should not he so, for they have not

lost  anything. Most of them, or almost all of them

here,  came  into the picture at a  Time  when  the

going was good - never so good in the history of  any

political  Party in the world - when the  P.A.P. was

sure  of  victory, when it was sure of forming  the

Government. They have by now enjoyed for four years

and one week, Sir - and I have counted 1,467 luscious

days - and  if  at  the end of it all  they  are  not

returned  again,  they should  not  complain.  They

should he grateful to me for the lovely Time I have

given them. Sir, half of the blame for the downfall

of the P.A.P. should be apportioned to the policies

of  the  Minister for Finance. We are not concerned

in   today's  Budget  debate  with  the  Minister's

political plots, which, though misfired,  would  be

more  appropriate subjects for debate on some other

occasion.  It is sufficient for today's  debate  to

say  that  the  Minister  for  Finance,  more  than

anybody  else  in  the Government,  has  served  to

alienate the people from the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the word go, the Minister's financial policies were a flop. Every scheme, every new measure he introduced turned more and more sections of the people against the P.A.P. Everything that his magic wand touched turned into cold lead, generating the anger and hostility of

the  people against the P.A.P. Government. The Hong

Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



by-election  was  the  water-shed  of  the   P.A.P.

policies,  in  particular  its  financial   policy.

Before   Hong  Lim,  we  had  so  many  new   taxes

introduced, new fees, new contrivances  to  squeeze

the  masses of the people. During that period,  the

big  European firms were never asked to  share  the

additional burden of taxation on a fair,  just  and

equitable  basis.  The weight of  the  Government's

onslaught  fell  mainly and  heavily  on  the  poor

people  and  the middle class. After Hong  Lim,  of

course,  there was a moratorium. No new taxes  were

introduced.  Some old ones were even repealed.  The

middle class was let off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant feature in this change of

policy  is that despite the change or the shift  in

emphasis,  the  basic  position  has  not  altered,

either   before  or  after  Hong  Lim.  The  P.A.P.

Government sees to it that the interest of and  the

big  profits earned and reaped by the big  European

firms  are  not  only  well protected  but  further

advanced  by it. Sir, the Hong Lim by-election  was

also  the  water-shed  of the  P.A.P.  Government's

industrial  policy. Before Hong Lim,  the  Minister

was  only interested in one huge industry, a  giant

steel  mill  with  $600  million  capital  covering

almost half the area of Singapore, and when  I  was

in  the P.A.P., I remember an occasion when he told

me  that this giant steel mill of his could  create

employment for 80,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in those days, all his mind was bent on

the  fruition of this laudable project.  His  great

ambition was to turn Singapore into a Newcastle  or

an  Anshan.  We know that it was a mirage.  It  was

like building castles in the air. I told him so  in

those  days,  but he turned a deaf ear.  Therefore,

the  first two years of the P.A.P. Government  were

wasted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the defeat in Hong Lim, the change came

about.  The  shift  in emphasis  came.  The  P.A.P.

Government  gradually  began  to  understand   that

Singapore  can  only accommodate small  and  medium

scale  type of light industries. However, to  cover

up the failure in the impracticability of a genuine

steel mill in Singapore, the P.A.P. Government went

out of its way to give away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



millions to a scrap plant. One had already  existed

in  Bukit  Timah Road for many years. I  understand

that  this  scrap  plant in Bukit  Timah  Road  was

established  under the Lim Yew Hock Government  and

that  it  was struggling along and finding it  very

difficult  to  carry on. This plant was  forced  to

close  down.  And  I believe it  did  approach  the

Government  for  aid. But the Government  for  some

reason  or  other did not come forward to  help  an

existing scrap plant. Instead, the Government  gave

away  millions to a new scrap plant. Sir,  why  was

this  so?  The answer is simple. It is because,  by

establishing   a  new  scrap  plant,   the   P.A.P.

Government can claim that it has established a  new

industry- a new steel mill. It can claim  that  its

programme  of a steel mill has been realised.  Sir,

what  nonsense! The difference between a steel mill

and a scrap plant is like the difference between  a

motor-car  factory and a motor-car assembly  plant;

between  the  Yang-tze River and the Tebrau  River:

(the Tebrau River is about six feet wide and it  is about six feet deep); between the Prime Minister of

a  country like India and the Prime Minister  of  a

small semi-colonial State like Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is a very interesting

conversation going on across the Floor. The Speaker

is  just  being overlooked. Shall we just carry  on

with the debate?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, after Hong Lim, the

emphasis  on  the industrial policy of  the  P.A.P.

Government was shifted on to small and medium-sized

light  industries. And they were  wise  to  do  so.

These  past  mistakes were realised after  so  many

years  at  the  expense  of  our  economy  and  the

deteriorating  unemployment situation.  The  P.A.P.

Government  is  to  be blamed  for  the  increasing

number of people who have swelled the ranks of  the

unemployed today. For the first Time in the history

of   Singapore  and  under  P.A.P. rule,   a   new

phenomenon  has emerged. There are now hundreds  of

graduates  from the Universities of  Singapore  and

Nanyang,  the Polytechnic, and overseas educational

institutions who are wanting jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is because of the failure of the

P.A.P.'s  industrial policy. Despite the change  of

emphasis,   the   basic  feature  of   the   P.A.P.

Government's  industrial policy remains  unaltered.

The   encouragement  and  the  support   given   by

Government   has  been  concentrated   on   foreign

capital.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government does not bother with and is

not interested in tapping the national resources at

our  disposal, our local entrepreneurs,  our  local

capital, and divert all of them into industry.  The

P.A.P. has  deviated  from  its  enunciation   of

economic principles in its election manifesto,  The

Tasks  Ahead,  where it has solemnly declared  that

local businessmen can help in the industrialisation

of  our economy and our country and we do not  need

to  depend solely on foreign capitalists. What  has

happened  to  the  P.A.P.  Government's  industrial

policy   is   the  same  as  the   Lim   Yew   Hock

Government's.   In   fact,  even   worse.   Foreign

capitalists are now given every encouragement which

is denied to local men.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Example, example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, take

the  Shell  Company. There is no  need  to  give  a

pioneer  certificate to Shell. They  will  have  to

build an oil refinery in Singapore because one  has

already  been  built,  and  I  have  said  in  this

Assembly that by giving a pioneer certificate,  for

instance,  to  one  of Shell subsidiary  companies,

they  can  play if they want to with the accounting

in  such a way that they do not have to pay tax  in

other  Shell  subsidiary companies  which  are  not

granted pioneer certificates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will carry on. The Minister

will  have  a chance to reply. Pioneer certificates

are  given to those who will set up industries here

and  are  denied to those industries which  require

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance's industrialisation

and  taxation  policy is basically to preserve  and

advance  the  interests of foreign capital.  It  is

this  blatant,  open and consistent championing  of

foreign economic interests which is one of the main

contributing factors which have brought  about  the

downfall of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against foreign capital coming in to

invest in this country, but we must give incentives

to  our  local businessmen, give them  support  and

encouragement,  show them how to start  industries,

give   them   more  liberal  pioneer  certificates,

instead  of giving these certificates liberally  to

foreign firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said at the beginning of my

speech,  the economic policies of the Minister  for

Finance  have  served more than  anything  else  to

alienate  many  people from the  P.A.P.  Today  the

P.A.P. is no more a political organisation,  but  a

mere grouping of individuals hanging on together in

their last days of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the humble trishaw-rider to the civil

servants and the local businessmen, from every race

and   in   every   walk  of  life  except   foreign

businessmen, no section of the people has not  been

harassed  and  oppressed by the P.A.P.  Government.

The petrol tax, the cigarette tax, the increase  in

traffic  and  hawkers' fines, the twakow  tax,  all

forms of new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



taxes  and  many new fees have been introduced  and

have  made  the masses of the people bitter.  Their

attempts   to   introduce  the  shopkeepers'   tax,

although  cancelled after the Hong Lim by-election,

have   annoyed  the  shopkeepers.   The   rise   in

assessment  rates  on  huts  in  rural  areas   has

antagonised the rural dwellers and farmers. The pay

cuts,  though  restored after Hong  Lim,  have,  in

conjunction   with  P.A.P. arrogance,   completely

alienated  the  civil  servants  from  the   P.A.P.

Government. Where is the P.A.P. going to  draw  its

future  support?  From the Work Brigade?  From  the

community  centres? I do not think that  those  who

work  in the Work Brigade and those who go  to  the

community centres will support the P.A.P. when  the

Time for decision comes. Even the last vestiges  of

P.A.P. support in Singapore - the foreign capitalists

and  the local compradores -  are now switching their

support to the M.C.A., which has made the P.A.P. so

bitter  in the past few months. Sir, the P.A.P. is

finished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that in the first two

years  of  P.A.P. rule, how tight  was  the  money

circulation in Singapore. The economy was in a very

bad  condition.  Taxis  switched  away  from  their

meters  to collecting passengers at as low as  five

cents  each on some routes. What was the  cause  of

all this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last year of the Lim Yew Hock

Government,  there  was a stop  in  new  Government

construction   and   development   programmes.    I

understand there is also a standstill now - that  the

P.A.P.   Government  is  no  more  initiating   new

projects,  so  that `the next government  will  not

reap  the  benefits of opening them.  This  is,  of

course, playing party politics without the interest

of  the people at heart. From June 1959 until about

May  1961, when the P.A.P. Government took over the

legacy  of the Lim Yew Hock Government, when  there

was  a standstill in the economy, the Minister  for

Finance   embarked  on  the  suicidal   policy   of

deflation  by  pressing  even  lower  the   already

depressed economy. He did it with his pay cuts  and

his  new  taxes  on  the  poor,  which  immediately

reduced spending power in the country; floating new

loans  at  six  per cent interest and  keeping  the

money presumably in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



banks  at a loss with lower interest; freezing  all

major  Government expenditure. All this  and  other

sundry   measures  to  tighten  credit  and   money

circulation have helped to bring down 1959 and 1960

as   the  darkest  years  in  Singapore's  economic

history.  There  were curses everywhere.  In  those

days,  the policy of injecting more money and  more

credit  into the economy should have been  embarked

upon.  On  the contrary, the Minister  for  Finance

ventured   into  the  self-destruction  policy   of

deflation  and it was only due to the  catastrophic

defeat of the P.A.P. in Hong Lim, where one of  our

main planks is the P.A.P.'s financial policy, that

the  Prime  Minister realised the mistakes  of  his

Minister for Finance and put a brake to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one does not have the interest of the

people  at  heart, one can never learn. The  P.A.P.

Government does not have the interest of the people

at  heart and whatever, it embarks upon is for  its

self-interest.  Any worthwhile  things  they  might

have done during the past one year or so were meant

merely  to capture votes or to play party politics.

It is not sincere and the people know it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember the Four-Year Plan in a

blue-coloured  book - the Four-Year Development  Plan

1961-1964  of  the  State  of  Singapore - which  was

introduced into this Assembly at the height of  the

Hong Lim by-election. Everybody knew it was for the

purpose of capturing votes. After three years  have

elapsed, it is very evident that the so-called Four-Year Plan was a bluff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in page 35 of the Four-Year Development Plan the Government promised to spend $650 million in 1961, 1962 and 1963 on capital development projects. I do not think the Government has fulfilled even a small quota of the Plan. The P.A.P. Ministers cannot organise the

whole government machinery into fulfilling the many

projects  envisaged in the Plan; and that  explains

the  $400  million surplus which the Government  is

now  boasting  of.  If I were on the  P.A.P.  Front

bench,  I  would really be ashamed of it.  This  is

another example of the P.A.P. twisting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only item in the Four-Year Plan where the

P.A.P.  Government  has made  some  headway  is  in

housing.  Sir,  when  the P.A.P.  Ministers  search

their conscience in the dark of night - if they  ever

do so [Laughter] - they know why that is so. If I may

put  it,  the Four-Year Plan, which was printed  on

high  quality, first-class glossy paper,  bound  in

thick  blue  covers at much expense to  the  State,

took  a  much  shorter  Time to  travel  into  this

Chamber  than  this  flimsy 1963  Budget  which  is

nothing but a routine job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget has come in by the slow way, by

a  bullock-cart, but the Four-Year Development Plan

has  come  in  by a jet plane. It took  the  P.A.P.

Government  only a few weeks to cook up this  Four-Year Plan, but it took them one and a half years to

frame, prepare and submit this 1963 Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you one instance which will

serve  to expose P.A.P. cheat. Since at present  we

are  experiencing  the  worst  water  rationing  in

Singapore for many years, it is perhaps appropriate

to  refer  to only one item in the Four-Year  Plan,

the  item on water. Page 77 of the Four-Year  Plan

has one paragraph to say about providing additional

supplies of water to Singapore. The Plan reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide additional supplies of water, it is

proposed to have a new waterwork, the Johore  River

project,  which  will, when completed,  produce  25

million gallons per day. Pending its completion, it

is  proposed to have a stop-gap scheme, the  Scudai

River project by means of which water will be drawn

from  the  Scudai River to meet increased  demands,

especially  during spells of dry weather  when  the

water supply would be in a precarious position.  At

the  same  Time,  it  is intended  to  augment  the

storage facilities. In this respect, it is proposed

to  construct  the Seletar Dam which will  increase

the   storage  capacity  of  the  present   Seletar

Reservoir.  This dam will replace the existing  dam

which is too low resulting in low storage and  less

effective  utilisation of total rainfall.  Further,

it  is  proposed to construct another  two  Service

Reservoirs, one at Telok Blangah and the  other  at

Jurong,  to  increase storage of treated  water  to

balance the peak and idle low pressures, since  the

pressure  variations  in these  areas  tend  to  be

marked.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, so many schemes to augment our water supply. None of these schemes have been carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



out.  Only the Scudai River Scheme  - one out  of  so

many,  a stop-gap scheme due to P.A.P. inefficiency

where  millions of dollars were spent and would  be

wasted  - a scheme which had merely been scratched on

the surface. By this month, in June 1963, according

to  the Four-Year Plan, it is proposed to spend $13

million on another more important scheme - the Johore

River project. From what we can read in the papers,

the  Government is still debating on this  project,

and therefore not even within smelling distance  of

initiating the project. Nothing has been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Johore River project - not done; the Scudai River - just only

scratched; the Seletar Dam - has not been done; Telok

Blangah  Reservoir - not done;  Jurong  Reservoir - not

done.  Five  schemes - all not done. Only the  Scudai

River scheme has been scratched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it shows that the Four-Year Plan is nothing but a device to deceive the people for the purpose of electioneering. Sir, every Time I hear about this $400 million surplus, which was repeated in this Chamber again yesterday, I laugh. The moral of it is like that of a father

sending  his  son  with $3 to a  shop  to  buy  ten

katties of rice. The son played truant and, instead

of  going  to the shop, had a game of marbles.  The

shop  having closed after the boy had finished  his

game, he returned home without rice for the evening

meal.   Being  a  very  smart  boy - and  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  are very smart boys, there is  no  doubt

about it - and before the father could scold and cane

him,  he  jumped  up and exclaimed to  his  father,

"Daddy, daddy, I have saved $3 for you." The family

went without rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if I remember rightly, the Minister for

Finance once said that this surplus money has  been

invested mostly in countries overseas. Sir, on  the

one hand, we are investing hundreds of millions  of

dollars  overseas, but, on the other hand,  we  are

borrowing,  begging  a  few  tens  of  millions  of

dollars  from  the World Bank at a higher  rate  of

interest and with all sorts of conditions attached.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This is P.A.P. finance. If you

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way?

He will not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister will have his time

in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is P.A.P. finance, as in the early days when

the P.A.P. Government floated loans, paying six per

cent  interest and keeping the money safely in  the

bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, after four years of P.A.P. government, the people are already fed up. Even their Parliamentary Secretaries are getting fed up and quitting one by one. They have no more confidence in whatever the Government says or does. For instance, in the past few weeks the people were not jubilant over the announcement that the

principle  of  a  common market  has  been  reached

between  the  Governments  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation.  They have seen too many  sell-outs  by

the  P.A.P. Government. They are only watching  the

situation  closely  until the  details  are  known.

Could it be another attempt to cover up P.A.P. sins

and P.A.P. sell-outs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have reached the stage that whatever the

P.A.P. Government says is never believed, is always

distrusted.  Can  a  Party,  arriving  at  such   a

predicament  and such a situation, still  hold  out

hopes  of staging a come-back? It is easier  for  a

camel  to  go through the eye of a needle than  for

the  P.A.P. to  stage a political  come-back.  The

P.A.P. could very soon only interest  students  of

history  It is finished. There is no use to  stifle

the  Opposition  Members in this  Chamber.  By  its

manoeuvres during the past few days, each of us was

given so little Time to study the Budget. But,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, the opposition to the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



is  not  only  found in this Assembly Chamber,  but

there  are more than a million of them outside  the

House.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had

a  very  interesting half-hour just  now  when  the

Member  for  Hong Lim was on his feet.  He  claimed

that he of all persons in the Opposition knows best

the  way  the  minds  of the P.A.P.  Ministers  are

working,  and  he  would like to  take  credit  for

having helped to put them in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is only when comrades fall out that we

can get at the truth of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget speech of the Minister for Finance

provides interesting reading because it is quite  a

toning down of all his previous speeches. He  tries

to explain in his Budget Speech the manner in which

the P.A.P. Government is going about to ensure that

there is greater industrialisation in Singapore, so

that  more and more employment opportunities  could

be offered to the mass of unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tackle his Budget speech in the

sequence  that it has been presented. On the  first

page  of  his Budget speech he says there are  only

two  outstanding issues remaining to be settled  in

regard  to  the financial talks which the Singapore

Government  has  been  having with  the  Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we had a very lengthy debate on the

progress that these talks have taken, and the Prime

Minister  considered it to be such a good  tactical

move  that he moved an amendment in order  to  nail

the  Opposition, particularly us,  whom  he  rudely

described  as  the  agents of principals  in  Kuala

Lumpur.  Sir, we gave our support to the  amendment

because  we feel, in the same manner as the  P.A.P.

feel  (if  they honestly feel), that the  financial

talks in Kuala Lumpur have been dragged on for  too

long and that some finality must be reached so that

Malaysia  can come into existence on  the  31st  of

August.  He  did disclose in his speech last  night

that  if  we  were to give him our support  in  his

representations  to the Federation Government,  his

Government would feel greatly strengthened  in  its

representations in the talks that will be resumed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



early  next week. We gladly  give  him  that

support and we hope that with it he will be able to

secure for the people of Singapore terms that  will

be in the best interest of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech has

said  that  the most important pursuit in Singapore

is  trade  and its related occupations  -  banking,

shipping and transportation. We agree with him, and

we  also agree with him when he says that it  would

be an error to take measures harmful to established

economic  functions in the quest of  something  new

and  uncertain.  Not only should  we  maintain  and

improve our efficiency as a trading centre, but  we

should also do so in other established lines.  This

then  brings me to the industrialisation policy  of

the  Government and to their claim  that  a  common

market  for Malaysia would be in the best interests

of industrialisation in Singapore and would help to

build up the economy of Singapore. I will touch  on

that when I come to his speech on industrialisation

and the common market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is nearly five o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It would seem that the Minister

for  Finance  wants a tea-break. Sir, the  Minister

for  Finance would feel obliged if he could have  a

tea-break. [Laughter] I have at least another half-hour  or  more to speak. Pardon, Sir. No  tea-break

for the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation. Other speakers have touched on

the industrialisation policy of the Government. The

Minister  for Finance is very fond of crowing  that

the    P.A.P. has   the   right   approach    to

industrialisation; that the Government has done all

it could to induce local capital as well as foreign

capital to open up industries in Kuala Lumpur.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already remarked that

the  Government Whip does not seem to be doing  his

job.  It is one of his duties to see that a  quorum

being  conducted or carried out. Does anybody  wish

to call for a quorum?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would like to refer to

fact that there is no quorum in the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

pursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting resumed

upon a quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had occasion to remark in the past

that it is one of the duties of the Government Whip

to  see  that a quorum is present, especially  when

that  we  start after a break without a  quorum,  I

think, must bring this Assembly into disrespect  by

members of the public. Tun Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed "That the Assembly

approves the financial policy of the Government for

the year 1963."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the

tea  break, I was touching on the industrialization

programme  of the Government, but before I  proceed

on  this  subject,  Sir, may I touch  on  the  more

important  issue,  that is,  that  Budget  Time  is

Opposition  Time  and that despite  the  fact  that

Budget Time is Opposition Time, the Government  has

felt  it  imperative that it should make an  inroad

into Opposition Time. Not contented with that,  the

Government is treating Budget day as an unimportant

day,  so  much so that the Government Front benches

were totally empty when this sitting was reconvened

after the tea break. The Opposition cannot but take

very  strong objection to the manner in  which  the

Government is treating this Budget debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government says that it has a

wonderful industrialization programme. It  must  be

admitted  that it tried all it could  to  implement

its   industrialization  policy,   and,   in   this

implementation,  it  did  adopt  certain   of   the

important  measures  that were  introduced  by  the

previous  Government,  such  as  the  granting   of

pioneer certificates, tax holidays, inducements  by

offering industrial sites at very attractive rates.

But one thing the P.A.P. has done which has damaged

the   industrialization  policy  is  that  it   has

actively participated in the trade union war. It is

useless  to offer all kinds of inducements such  as

pioneer  status, tax holidays and sites at economic

rents  if there is industrial unrest. What is  more

reprehensible is that such industrial unrest  arose

as a result of P.A.P. manoeuvres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has been in office for the past

four years and all its industrialization policy and

its  claim  to  having industrialized Singapore  is

just  nothing but a paper claim. I have heard,  and

even  the  Minister  has  himself  said,  that  the

Government  has set aside large sums  of  money  to

lend  to would-be industrialists. That would  be  a

very   big   draw,   lending  money   to   would-be

industrialists to open up factories.  Despite  this

very  attractive offer, there have been very,  very

few  industrialists  taking advantage  of  it.  The

reason  is obvious. The labour situation is out  of

hand.  The Government claims that these politically

inspired  labour  troubles are  happily  now  under

control.  Where  is  the  control?  The  number  of

strikes  keeps  mounting  up,  and  even   an   ex-Parliamentary  Secretary of the Government  is  now

with the pickets on strike.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is democracy.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Leader of the House

calls it "democracy", but I say that it is a P.A.P.

twist  of  the meaning of "democracy" to pay  money

out  of  public funds to a Member, to  make  him  a

Parliamentary Secretary, to make use of him to  try

and  control the civil service for the  benefit  of

the  P.A.P. But, as there is a God above us, it has

boomeranged. What they hoped to control has now got

out of hand. And yet the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



says  that the politically-inspired labour troubles

are now under control. It is because of this labour

unrest  that industrialists are rather hesitant  to

come to Singapore and open up factories, and it  is

also  because of this unhealthy climate that  there

have been more and more factories opening up in the

Federation.  And  now to beat  this  labour  unrest

which   has  come  about  as  a  result  of  P.A.P.

manoeuvres,  the Government thought of another  way

to induce capital to come into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. Government took office in

1959, and in order to lay claim that new industries

had  been  set  up almost overnight,  they  gave  a

British-owned tobacco company, known as the Malayan

Tobacco Distributors Limited, the opportunity to re-start  its  factory in Tanjong Pagar with  100  per

cent   British  capital.  When  we  were   in   the

Government, this Company approached us with a  view

to reopening that tobacco factory. We did not allow

it  to  reopen  except with the acceptance  of  our

condition that local capital participation must  be

accepted  by the company to the extent  of  51  per

cent local capital. We felt that this condition was

imperative   in   the   interests   of   Singapore,

especially as we knew that the very minute the well-known   brands  of  this  company  like  "Players",

"Capstan"    and   other   popular   brands    were

manufactured in Singapore, they would knock out all

the  other  local brands manufactured by  factories

owned  by  local capital. But the P.A.P., in  their

wisdom  to show that they had new factories opening

up,  allowed  this tobacco company to re-open  with

100  per cent British capital and, as we knew,  the

local  factories of other brands that  were  making

good business had to close down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are very fond of claiming

that they are the true socialists of Singapore, and

yet  they sold away the rights of local capital  to

British  vested  interests. Yet  the  Minister  for

Finance in his speech says that local capital  need

not  worry,  that there is a place for  them,  that

they  can  divert  their  capital  from  trade  and

commerce  to  industry.  But  when  there  was   an

opportunity  for  local capital to  have  a  proper

share of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



the profits of the manufacture of popular brands of

cigarettes in Singapore, the Government  just  gave

them away to British vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, Sir, of the P.A.P. Government's

desire  to produce results, whatever the  cost,  is

this oil refinery at Pasir Panjang. During our time

the Shell Company negotiated with us for occupation

of  that  piece of land. We were adamant.  We  were

quite  firm  in  our  attitude  towards  the  Shell

Company,  because our view was that  as  they  were

making  good money, there was no reason  why  there

should be special concession rates offered to  them

for  that piece of land at Pasir Panjang, Labrador.

We were firm. We demanded economic rates. The Shell

Company  hummed  and hawed and did  their  best  to

persuade us to give in at concession rates. We  did

not give in. But the very minute the P.A.P. came to

power,  what did they do? They gave that land  away

to  a  Japanese  company at rates which  were  very

attractive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is another point to

which the Minister would say rubbish too. It is  up

to him. Sir, we see in the papers today, "Singapore

to  get third refinery: $39m plan." This is in  the

Straits  Times  of  today. Would the  Minister  say

"rubbish"  if I say here that all the  capital  for

this oil refinery is going to be American?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We do not want that rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Say "rubbish". Why is it in an

oil refinery where money is to be made for jam that

local    capital   should   have   no   right    of

participation?   Whereas  in  the  Federation   the

Federation Government has never claimed that it  is

a   true  socialist,  yet  the  refineries  in  the

Federation  before they could open up  must  invite

local participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister for Finance did not

say  rubbish - that this oil refinery is to be  built

out  of 100 per cent foreign capital. And as it  is

an  oil  refinery, it is going to make good  money,

money to be taken out of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



And  what  is  all  this  pious  talk  about  local

capital? "Do not worry, you will have your share in

the profits out of industrialisation of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more heinous is this, Sir. They have

not yet settled the terms of the common market. But

for  the  Singapore Government to go and  encourage

100 per cent foreign capital to come in and then go

and talk to the Federation, "Ah, common market. Our

oil  must go in easy, your oil can come down  easy,

therefore let us talk terms." Is this the right way

to  go about it? An oil refinery in Singapore built

with  100 per cent foreign capital, to get  special

treatment or equal treatment with oil refineries in

the    Federation   built   with   local    capital

participation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How much participation?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance

is  just concerned with the percentage. He  is  not

concerned with the principle The principle  can  go

overboard.   P.A.P.!  What  is  the  principle   of

democracy?  What is the principle  of  Budget  Time

being Opposition Time? Al! that can be rubbed  off.

The  P.A.P. can do it. The principle is  involved,

What  is  the use of expressing a pious  wish  that

local capital will have its share of the profits of

industrialisation when by its very  act  it  denies

local capital a share in the profits that are to be

derived  by an oil industry that is bound  to  make

money? The greater the percentage, the greater will

be  the crime of the P.A.P. Whatever the percentage

may  be, it is still a crime. The degree is  to  be

measured by the percentage of participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the use of offering incentives, as I say,

when  there  is  labour  unrest?  And  because  the

Government  must produce some results,  that  there

are industries opening up in Singapore. It is going

against their own declared principles of socialism.

I only hope, Sir, that when they go to Kuala Lumpur

next  week  to  talk about the common market,  they

will realise and admit the error of their ways  and

try  to  get a deal that is fair and square in  the

circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance fathers the common market idea. When the Government took office in its very first stage, "Ah, we must have a common commodity market." He seems to think that that is a wonderful thing and he ran down the previous Government. He said, "Ah, the previous Government never thought of that idea." The pros and cons of

the common market have not yet been debated in this

House,  but the way this Government is going  about

trying to secure a common market is making it  more

difficult. A common market is meant for the good of

all  the participants. A common market is not meant

for  serious competition between participants.  The

previous Government had thought and discussed  with

the  Federation  Government that a  better  way  of

protecting industry on a Pan-Malayan basis - at  that

Time  it  was Pan-Malayan, there was no thought  of

Pan-Malaysian  - was for a Joint Committee to  advise

both  Governments on the types of  industries  that

could  be set up. If it was felt that because there

is  rubber in the Federation it is better for  them

to  manufacture  rubber shoes and rubber  slippers,

then  no  rubber shoes and rubber slippers need  be

made  in Singapore. And if it was felt that it  was

better  for  textiles and shirts to be manufactured

in  Singapore, then there need not be a factory  in

the  Federation to manufacture textiles and shirts.

So  in this way there would be a fair distribution.

There would not be that element of competition. And

if  the  Singapore Government want  to  enter  into

competition with the Federation Government, can  we

expect  the two competitors will sit down to  think

of  a  way out whereby both competitors can  go  to

town?  It  cannot be done that way. Here they  have

oil  refineries in the Federation  - you know we have

oil  refineries here all right. But now rush on  to

another oil refinery.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is not the Government's

refinery.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not the Government's

refinery but it is the Government that is going  to

grant  all the facilities for this refinery  to  be

started in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If they want to.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And in fact this company, if I

read   it  correctly,  is  also  demanding  certain

assurances from the Government. I do not know  what

those  assurances  are, but  anyway,  unless  those

assurances  are  satisfied  by  a  Government  that

claims to be socialist, by a Government that  tells

local   capital  that  their  interests   will   be

protected, that company may not start. But the fact

that  it  has  come  out in the papers  means  that

assurances  have  already been  given.  What  those

assurances are is always done in the P.A.P. style,

never  disclose.  What will be the  effect  on  the

common   market   talks?  Not  knowing   what   the

recommendations  of  the Rueff Commission  are,  we

cannot debate on that. But there is one point  that

has  been  brought out by the Minister for Finance.

He  says,  "You  know, we have this common  market.

Therefore,  we  have to have bonded warehouses  for

goods  manufactured  either  in  Singapore  or   in

Malaysia  where there is this common market.  Never

mind  the  people oil Singapore will benefit."  But

how will it benefit the people of Singapore if they

have  to pay more for goods which they are used  to

having as a result of tariffs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a free port and therefore goods

manufactured  in  the Federation or  elsewhere  can

come freely into Singapore. The Singapore market is

already  open to the Federation, but the Federation

market  is  not open to Singapore goods. Therefore,

this  common market is aimed at allowing  Singapore

goods  to  flow  freely into  the  Federation.  But

surely, Sir, the price that has to be paid for that

free  flow of Singapore manufactured goods  to  the

Federation  is  going to be a price the  people  of

Singapore  will  have to pay. Suppose  shirts  were

manufactured  here, because of this  common  market

agreement, the local people would have  to  pay  an

extra tax for all foreign-made shirts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is yours?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Tooth paste is one of the

commodities   in  this  common  market   agreement.

Therefore,  tooth  paste manufactured  outside  and

sold in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  will  be  sold at a  higher  price.  Of

course,  the  Government  can  say  the  people  of

Singapore can buy locally manufactured tooth paste,

but  the Government cannot ride roughshod over  the

fact  that  there  is  such a thing  as  consumer's

prejudice.  It is strange that although  a  certain

thing  is manufactured locally and there is a known

similar  product  manufactured outside,  a  product

which  we  are  used  to, we keep  on  buying  that

product. Therefore, the people will have to  pay  a

higher price for what they are used to getting.  It

depends  on what the common market is for. We  keep

on  talking  about  the common market  without  the

Minister for Finance letting us know what the terms

of the common market are. We do not know the terms,

so  we cannot debate them. But I want to point  out

that  no  matter  What it is, a Common  Market  may

result  in higher prices of goods which the  people

of  Singapore  are  used to having.  There  is  one

sentence  here that has got me tickled  about  this

Common  Market  on  page 55 [Unrevised  Transcript]

(Hansard, col. 564). The Minister for Finance  says

in his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For nearly four years we have strained every

resource and ingenuity to achieve it,'.



<br><br>For  nearly  four  years they have  strained  every

resource  and  ingenuity. Ingenuity! What  kind  of

ingenuity? Just to show that they are cleverer than

the  Federation! Is it ingenuity to allow a hundred

per  cent foreign capital to start a refinery  here

in  Singapore? Ingenuity indeed! Is it ingenuity to

go  about telling the people of Singapore  how  bad

the  Government  of  the Federation  was?  Is  that

ingenuity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they call that ingenuity, they are

entitled  to  call it, but I call  it  nothing  but

P.A.P. twist and double talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 56 [Unrevised Transcript] (Hansard, col.

566)  we see the Minister for Finance crowing  that

the  Housing and Development Board completed 12,230

houses,  but  during  the debate  on  the  Negara's

speech  I pointed out to the Government that  there

were 4,000 units



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



unoccupied-vacant-resulting in a loss of revenue to

the  Housing and Development Board of a few hundred

thousand dollars a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the way to look after the economy of the

country? What the P.A.P. is interested in is to try

to  put up more and more buildings and then  if  it

cannot get anybody to go and stay in the buildings,

it  might find some way whereby it can force people

to occupy Housing and Development Board houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has touched on the

water shortage. Although the Government in its Four-Year  Development Programme has stated  very,  very

categorically that it would proceed with the  water

scheme  more than two years ago, it has  failed  in

this  important task. Singapore is facing  a  water

shortage for the second time since the P.A.P. took

office. Why was there a delay in implementing  this

scheme?  It  was  because the Government  wants  to

borrow $50 million from the World Bank.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance

is  fond  of  saying  rubbish, but  did  the  Prime

Minister  not  say that when we were  debating  the

Bill  to enable the Government to enter into a loan

agreement?  He  did  disclose that  the  Government

wanted  $50 million from the World Bank to  develop

the Johore River Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of explanation. Sir,

we  did inform this House that any loan negotiation

with the World Bank or any development project will

not  mean  slowing down of work on this  particular

project.  For  instance, work on the  Johore  River

Scheme  is  already afoot. Plans and specifications

for  tenders are being drawn up, and regardless  of

the  final  details of the terms of the loan,  work

proceeds.  The  same thing happened  to  the  power

station, as I have explained so often in the  past.

I  cannot understand how is it that the Member  for

Cairnhill cannot grasp this elementary point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance

cannot grasp his own elementary statement that  the

Johore  River Project will be completed by the  end

of  1963. That is what his Government said in  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, no. Quote.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Right, we will quote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> How can we complete the Johore

River Project in 1963?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was said in 1961, two

years  ago,  when they had a Four-Year  Development

Plan just for the Hong Lim by-election.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. When

the  Leader  of the Opposition makes  such  serious

charges, surely it is incumbent upon him to produce

evidence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

The  responsibility is the Member for  Cairnhill's.

If  he makes a statement like that and he is proved

wrong, he takes the responsibility for being wrong.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Cairnhill will

remain  standing until the Member for  Farrer  Park

brings that Hansard and show it to the Minister for

Finance when, in reply to a question by the  Member

for  Farrer  Park,  the Government  said  that  the

Johore  River Project would be completed  within  a

stipulated  Time.  And  I  hope  that   when   this

confrontation takes place, the Minister for Finance

would  be  cultured  enough to admit  that  he  was

wrong, but I do not expect that of him, Sir, I  do

not  expect  such things of him. Sir, the  Minister

for  Finance seems to feel the strain. It  is  only

when  he feels the strain that he jumps up now  and

then on points of order, points of explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to the water project when I have the

Hansard with me. But there is another sentence here

as   I  go  through  this  on  page  58  [unrevised

transcript]  (Hansard, col.  569)  about  the  Work

Brigade:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main reason was that the Work Brigade did

not expand to the full extent we provided for. This

was principally due to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



better  economic  conditions which  resulted  in  a

smaller  number  of  applicants  joining  the  Work

Brigade.'



<br><br>Better  economic conditions! Less and  less  people

join  the  Work  Brigade. Is it because  of  better

economic  conditions? It is because more  and  more

unemployed have come to the realisation  that  they

will  not  be  made  use of by  the  P.A.P. for  a

beggarly $1.50 a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is the reason. More and

more  people have woken up to this manipulation  of

the  P.A.P. to  make members of the  Work  Brigade

attend their rallies, to bring members of the  Work

Brigade  to  visit rural constituencies - almost  the

same  faces  every time - welcoming the  great  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is why more and more people do not want

to join the Work Brigade for $1.50 per day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You can join if you want to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Member for Farrer Park handed to Tun Lim Yew Hock the Hansard].



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, he says Scudai River - poor

Finance  Minister. Sir, Hansard, Volume 12,  No.  1

dated 13th January, 1960, column 3: Oral Answers to

Questions. Johore River Scheme (not Scudai River):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr A. P. Rajah asked the Prime Minister when

the  Johore River Scheme will be completed to  meet

the   additional   water  supplies   required   for

Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 13th January, 1960, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Chan Sun Wing,

now  on this side of the House [Laughter] (for  the

Prime Minister):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker. Sir, I have been asked by the Prime

Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johore River Scheme will take about four

years to complete. On completion it will be able to

supply  Singapore  with  an additional  25  million

gallons of water a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scheme is expected to ensure an adequate

water  supply  for the island's population  over  a

period of five to ten years.'

started - 1960, 1961, 1962 ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The passage reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Johore River Scheme will take about four

years to complete.'



<br><br>It  does not say it has already been started there.

Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is the whole answer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Scheme is expected to ensure an adequate

water  supply  for the island's population  over  a

period of five to ten years. Should the consumption

increase  beyond what is expected at  present,  the

Scheme  would be extended. The minimum  yield  from

the  Johore  River  is  approximately  300  million

gallons a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the foreseeable future Singapore's consumption

of  water  cannot exceed the potential supply  from

<br><br>Foreseeable future!

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not the foresight but

rather  the  hind sight of the P.A.P. That  is  why

they say "foreseeable future".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member for Cairnhill

would like to carry on reading right up to the end.

It will throw a little more light on the subject.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, yes. Supplement. Mr Rajah:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, am I to understand that the

first  supply  from  the  Johore  River  cannot  be

expected in Singapore before four years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> The answer is yes.'



<br><br>Before four years? The answer is yes. So, it  means

in  4 years. It cannot be earlier than 4 years, but

the latest is 4 years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

charge!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the important

thing to note is this. The Member for Cairnhill has

been  alleging in his speech that we promised  that

the Johore River Scheme would be completed by 1963.

Now, nowhere is it stated in the records of Hansard

that  the scheme would really be completed in  1963

or  1964. All it says is that the scheme will  take

four years from its commencement. Now how could  it

be  possible  for  the Johore River  Scheme  to  be

ready - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Deputy is now embarking on a

speech. He wanted some elucidation. I think he  has

already elucidated the position. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Using the elucidation now given

by  the Leader of the House, it takes four years to

complete. Right. They have just started. So only in

1968  can  we  get  the  water.  What  kind  of   a

Government is this? 1968 - before the water shortage ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I do not see any reason

why  the Member for Cairnhill should now raise  his

voice.  He  has  been very calm,  very  cool,  very

collected, even under pressure up till now.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I apologise, Sir.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This shortage of water is making

every one parched. Four years more from 1964.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Never mind. The people have put

up  with  all  this  P.A.P. nonsense  about  water

shortage  for such a long Time. Sir, I  was  saying

just  now I was attracted by one paragraph  of  the

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Get on to your next point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is a very important point.

This is on page 60 [unrevised transcript] (Hansard,

col. 572):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the same time, we must not forget how much we

owe  to  the dedicated corps of teachers and school

principals  whose  hands  will  mould  the   future

generations of Malaysians.'



<br><br>But  we  must  not forget that the Government  have

immorally cut down their total emoluments.  And  if

the  Government  really feel  that  they  must  not

forget  the  good work done by these people  "whose

hands  will mould the future.". I call on  them  to

express  their thoughts in a more constructive  and

understandable form: that they refund back to these

people the money which they extorted from them when

they  came into office in 1959. Sweet words  butter

no  parsnips. We must not forget, indeed, but I  am

sure  these people do not forget the arbitrary  act

of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to housing again. They tried to claim

that the budgeting of a subsidy to the Housing  and

Development  Board is an innovation  introduced  by

them.  This is not correct. The previous Government

had  already started this. That there should be  no

hidden subsidies in the S.I.T. it was arranged that

every  year the S.I.T. would have to apply  to  the

Government for a Vote for the subsidy in rents. Now

they  try  to  run down the previous Government  by

saying  this,  and  I could not allow  this  to  go

without  challenge. And this is what  the  Minister

says,  on  page  61  of  the  unrevised  transcript

[Hansard, col. 574]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I should mention here that a substantial subsidy

arose  from the uneconomic rents which the previous

administration had fixed in 1958/59 shortly  before

the general elections.'



<br><br>That  is  an allegation which I cannot accept.  The

previous   Government  gave  them  special   rights

because   these  were  fire  victims.   They   lost

everything.  And  they  were  given  the  specially

reduced  rents for a certain period. Not like  this

hard-hearted  P.A.P. Government during  whose  Time

there were a number of fires, shortage of water-all

sorts of disasters during the P.A.P. Time. They did

not  treat the fire victims with the same  sympathy

and  understanding  that  the  previous  Government

extended to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are an amateur fire

fighter - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Amateur fire fighter? Sir, it is

funny  that  the Minister for Finance should  bring

this  up.  In  fact, it has been even said  outside

that  the  fires that took place were  set  by  the

P.A.P. He gave me an opportunity to say this:  that

in order to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

yesterday admitted to having heard rumours. Is it a

fact or a rumour?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if it is a fact, I will

have  nailed the P.A.P. Government. They have heard

it.  I would not have said it if he had not said  I

am  a  fire fighter or something or other.  If  the

Government Front Benchers, as you have pointed out,

Sir,  had been a little bit more respectful to  the

Opposition, such exchanges of harsh words would not

have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and another wonderful thing I have on page 63

[Hansard, col. 577] is this. Something about  "pro-Communist  elements who are now  being  kept  under

control."  I  will ask the Government,  "Who  keeps

them under control?" The Internal Security Council?

Laughable.  It  is the P.A.P. Government  that  has

taken  this action. Of course, I can understand  it

is  a  little embarrassing to the P.A.P. Government

to  have  to take action against their ex-comrades.

But they should not shirk their responsibility. The

fact  that this sentence has crept into the  speech

of  the  Minister for Finance is a clear indication

that  the  Government feels that it  has  put  pro-Communist elements under control. If they have  not

done  it,  why  have  they  put  it  in  here?  The

Government  have  put  the  pro-Communist  elements

under  control, and for that we are with them.  But

we find it difficult to forgive the Prime Minister,

who  still  hides the identity of the  "Plen".  And

that  we can never forgive. And if we do come back,

when  the  Prime  Minister is  just  a  citizen  of

Singapore, we - [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We will ask him to tell us. He

will have to disclose who the Plen is, or face  the

consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one subject which I want to touch

on,  and  I  want the Government - the  Minister  for

Finance  particularly - to give serious consideration

to this. We support and congratulate the Government

on  making  life  a little bit easier  for  old-age

pensioners  by having their pensions  paid  out  to

them  at Post Offices near their homes. That  is  a

good  move  and  a good thing. It  helps  the  aged

pensioners.  But  there is one complaint  that  has

arisen,  and  I hope the Minister for Finance  will

look  into this. Previously, when they went to  the

Treasury  to get their pensions, they got  them  on

time.  But  now  because payment is  made  by  Post

Offices,  there has been a delay of a week  or  ten

days.  I am sure that is not the intention  of  the

Government,  and  I hope the Minister  for  Finance

will  look  into  the  matter  and  see  that  aged

pensioners get their pensions on the first  of  the

month, as they used to previously.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, may I draw your attention

to  the  fact that you were away from this  Chamber

for some time? All the speakers so far this evening

have been from the Opposition. You may be under the

impression  that while you were away, some  Members

from the Government Benches spoke, but that in fact

is  not  the  case.  You  will  recollect  that  in

previous years - although we concede it is Opposition

time, at the same time, there must be some balance,

say,  two from the Opposition Benches and one  from

here, or three to one, but so far there has been  a

complete run of Opposition speakers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In other words, the debate has

side  of the Floor, nevertheless, if some equitable

balance in time is given, it will be appreciated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position is quite clear, as

indicated by the Standing Orders. One day has  been

allotted  for the debate on the Budget speech,  and

it  is the parliamentary practice that that one day

is  Opposition time; except for this very important

proviso,  that sufficient time must be allowed  the

Government  to  answer  any points  raised  by  the

Opposition. And when I say Government, it does  not

mean necessarily only the Minister for Finance, but

there may be other Ministers who may wish to answer

points  affecting  their Ministries.  Therefore,  I

shall  watch  the  time  very  carefully,  and   if

Ministers  could  indicate to me how  many  minutes

they require, I shall try to control the debate  in

such a way that they will have their opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chan Sun Wing, in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on  the 7th of June the Minister for Finance,

on  the  occasion  of making his financial  speech,

described the financial situation of this  year  as

compared with that of last year as very smooth  and

very  satisfactory. He said that this year has been

a  very  good financial year. There is  no  problem

except  that the question of the common market  has

not  been  resolved  yet. In  his  speech  when  he

reviewed  the  economic situation of Singapore,  he

said  that  in 1962 the people of Singapore  bought

more cars, more refrigerators, more radio sets  and

more cameras. He also said that more people went to

the cinemas to enjoy the pictures. That was why, he

said,  the  people of Singapore had  been  enjoying

better  amenities  and had more enjoyment  in  this

particular  year. If it had been true,  then  there

must have been peace and prosperity in Singapore. I

believe  that  the  picture  as presented  by  the Minister for Finance is true. But the question  is, who bought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



the  cars?  Which  class  of  people  bought  those

things, such as cameras? Who enjoyed these luxuries

of  life?  The Minister for Finance did  not  point

that  out. We say that for the past one year  there

were many symptoms, facts and phenomena which go to

show  that the labouring class and the poorer class

of Singapore have been worse off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you have seen that there are increasing numbers of hawkers. Why is that so? In the Press every day, we can read lots of news concerning more and more robberies, thefts and all sorts of crimes. If the people have been enjoying a better livelihood and have been enjoying a more prosperous year, how is that there have been so

many criminal activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has built a good number of

housing units with all sorts of sanitary amenities.

How   is   that  that  there  are  so  many   units

vacant - 4,000 units are still vacant? It is  because

the  people have not been able to afford to pay the

rents.   If   there  had  been  opportunities   for

employment,   then  why  should   there   be   such

phenomena?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of gambling has also increased. We

read  also  from  the  Press  that  more  and  more

graduates   of  secondary  schools   as   well   as

universities  and  higher  institutes  of  learning

advertise  in  the newspapers for jobs  as  private

tutors. They have been looking everywhere for jobs.

All these go to show one aspect of the true picture

which  the Minister for Finance has not been daring

enough to point out to the people of Singapore.  It

is   that  the  working  people  of  Singapore  are

becoming worse off and their livelihood is becoming

more difficult day by day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in his speech, said that if the volume of Singapore's exports increased, then the employment opportunities and the income of the people would accordingly increase. Perhaps statistics clearly show that in the past one year the volume of exports in tonnage has increased, but the Minister for Finance has not

been  able to cover one aspect of it, which is that

in the past one year the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



prices of the basic local produce have fallen.  The

price  of  rubber  has also fallen.  The  price  of

coconut oil has also dropped. The prices for pepper

and  coffee have also dropped in the past one year.

Why  is  that? And why did the Minister for Finance

not  dare  to  point out these facts? The  fall  in

price   has   increased   the   profits   of    the

industrialised countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures of exports and imports given by

the Minister for Finance, we can see that under the

P.A.P. rule, Singapore's colonial economic system,

which is subjected to foreign exploitation, has not

changed.  For the foreign industrialised  countries

profits   have   increased  more.   These   foreign

countries   could  therefore  benefit   more   from

Singapore and thus benefit the bourgeois  and  they

can  throw out more crumbs. Now can we say that  it

is  a  merit to the P.A.P.? It is not. The Minister

for  Finance seems to be satisfied with last year's

final  results and has credited this to the  P.A.P.

Government  and P.A.P. policy. But I  think  it  is

very  shameful. The P.A.P. has left  the  socialist

line and stand. That is why it has been expelled by

all socialist parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a socialist political Party, with a socialist

platform,  the main concern of such a Party  should

be  how  to  distribute wealth,  the  profits  from

Singapore's  entrepot trade. In their  distribution

of  the  profits, have the P.A.P. changed? We  have

seen  that during P.A.P. rule, the total number  of

employed workers has not increased. Even the Member

for  Tanglin  has pointed this out  just  now.  The

Minister for Finance knows this very well. That  is

why  at  rallies and on various other occasions  he

has dared not point out these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech he has only pointed out that there

have  been  larger surpluses in the  previous  year

which  have been derived from such taxes as customs

tax,  property  tax, tobacco tax,  petrol  tax  and

others. But who has paid most of these taxes? I can

say  the labouring class. From this we can see that

the P.A.P. Government have squeezed a great deal of

taxes from the large masses of the labouring class,

but  they  have not used the taxation derived  from

them for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



benefit  of  these  people. The  Jurong  industrial

site,   the   making  of  roads,  the   supply   of

electricity,  water-all these projects  and  social

amenities  depend on money derived  from  the  poor

people in various forms of taxes. Therefore, we can

see  that  the so-called Development Plans  of  the

P.A.P. have  nothing to be praised  about  because

they  use  revenue derived from the poor people  to

benefit  foreign capitalists and to give them  more

concessions  and  better terms to make  more  money

locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government have been boasting about

their  housing  plan, but they dare not  point  out

that  behind these buildings there are poor  people

living in houses which are in a very bad condition.

They talk about the Toa Payoh Housing Plan. Why  is

it  that  the people living in that area  have  not

been   willing  to  remove  especially   when   the

Government are going to provide them with very good

housing accommodation? The Government blame this on

Communist instigation, but, in fact, it is  because

the P.A.P. Government do not have a proper plan  to

carry  out  the project in that area and  have  not

paid   sufficient   attention  to   the   immediate

interests of the people staying there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in Toa Payoh there are many poor

people who, in addition to growing vegetables,  are

also  engaged  in  many other  sidelines,  such  as

making  bean  curd, bean shoots,  rattan  work  and

things  like that, the so-called cottage or  family

industries.  But  the  Government  have  not   paid

attention to these other means of livelihood.  That

is  why  these people are not willing to move  out.

When  they  remove, how are they to maintain  their

livelihood and earn money? The Government have  not

paid   sufficient   attention  to   these   people.

Therefore,   do  the  so-called  industrialisation,

economic  development, and the Economic Development

Board and all these other things mean that they can

boast  about them? But these poor people  have  not

been   paid  sufficient  attention  by   the   PAP.

Government.  The  P.A.P. Government  want  to  show

their  achievements, such as building houses;  but,

on the other hand, they are ignoring the livelihood

of these people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



How can you explain away this sort of policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have been able to see the building

of  bridges  and the installation of street  lights

and  stand-pipes in the rural areas. The Government

has  done a lot in this respect. One thing I do not

understand  is  this. They have put  up  all  these

things,  e.g. in the Ponggol and Serangoon  areas,

but  for  the things that they have failed  to  do,

they put all the blame on my shoulders. This is one

of the things that I do not understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, perhaps you will remember when I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, I was appointed Chairman of the Rural and Urban Services Consultative Committee. I believe there are many Backbenchers in the Government who know how much money the Committee had at its

disposal when I was the Chairman. The Minister  for

Finance  refused to provide us with money.  Because

of  the refusal of the Treasury to provide us  with

money,  many  of  the programmes  approved  by  the

Committee  were not implemented. At that time,  the

City Council Treasurer wrote to us saying that this

Committee had no legal rights to ask for money from

the  Treasury  because  the  Committee  was  not  a

statutory body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are these. The P.A.P. Government is

installing  these  stand-pipes  and  street  lights

because of the coming general election. That is why

they  are  trying to do something. And the Minister

for Finance, in order to further his own interests,

has seen fit to give some money in order to improve

the  amenities in the rural areas so as to  deceive

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Bras Basah left the .P.A.P.

she pointed out in this House that, when she was  a

member of the Rural and Urban Services Consultative

Committee, the Committee threatened to resign if it

was not provided with money. Sir, from this, we can

see   that  the  economic  policy  of  the  Finance

Minister was not aimed at bettering the lot of  the

people.  This blame should not fall on  the  P.A.P.

but on the Minister for Finance alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Minister for Finance also

mentioned  the  stability on the industrial  front,

and  that  this  was attributed to  the  repressive

action  taken by the P.A.P. I say that this is  all

wrong.  The  fact is that the progressive  workers'

organisations have matured in the past  few  years.

As   long   as  they  are  safeguarded   in   their

organisations and they have the right  to  organise

themselves,  they will be able to  look  after  the

interests  of the nation, provided their legitimate

rights are looked after. The decrease in the number

of  strikes  was  not  because  of  the  Government

policy. This was brought about as a result  of  the

co-operation  between employers and  employees.  It

was  also  because  of  the  confidence  the  local

employers  had in the Left-wing trade unions.  That

is  why  we  have  been able to  see  quite  stable

industrial   relations   between   employers    and

employees in the past years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. thinks that it can make use of

repressive  actions and the Police  to  reduce  the

number of strikes. I say that this is a very  wrong

approach.   If  the  working  class  have   genuine

grievances they will not kow-tow or succumb to this

high-handed action. The glowing picture painted  by

the Minister for Finance about Singapore's economic

activities  cannot conceal this fact. Although  the

Government  has been able to accumulate  surpluses,

these  surpluses have not been equally  distributed

among  the population. The overall increase in  the

Government  surpluses  points  to  one  thing:  the

people  in  Singapore can maintain their prosperity

through maintaining its entrepot trade. In the next

five or ten years they can depend on themselves  to

expand  their  prosperity  without  help  from  the

Federation.  But  the  P.A.P.,  because  of   their

attempt to prolong their political life, have  sold

out  the  rights  of economic independence  of  the

people  in Singapore. The P.A.P. Government  intend

to  deceive the people by saying that after  merger

there  will  be very good conditions in respect  of

industrialisation and that there will be  a  common

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speech of the Minister for Finance and

the  statement delivered by the Prime  Minister  on

the progress on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



the  financial talks, we are able to see  that  the

whole picture of a common market is not very clear.

All  the  terms are not finalised yet.  The  P.A.P.

Government try to deceive the people in the  matter

of  economy by saying that after Malaysia  all  our

economic  problems can be resolved. All  this  talk

cannot deceive the people. We have a very grave and

serious  unemployment  problem,  and  so  has   the

Federation Government. I do not understand how  the

Minister  for Finance can come to this  conclusion,

that  is,  unemployment  plus  unemployment  equals

prosperity.  He also mentioned in his speech  about

Government's effort on technical education. He also

boastfully said that we have a Polytechnic and  the

Faculty  of Science in the University of  Singapore

which  can  cater for the training of  professional

personnel  and  that  the  courses  which  are  not

provided  locally  for the training  of  our  local

people  will  be provided by other countries  under

the Colombo Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the Minister for Finance of one thing. The P.A.P.'s so-called technical education is biased in favour of English education. In the Polytechnic, the University of Singapore and the so-called Secondary Technical School, in all these institutes of learning, the

medium  of instruction is English. That is to  say,

those  who are not educated in English are deprived

of  an  opportunity to receive technical education.

If   the  P.A.P. does  not  want  to  change  this

policy - even if they want to change it  now,  it  is

too  late - the problem of unemployment in  Singapore

will  get worse especially for those who come  from

Chinese  schools; then there will be grave problems

in  the future. Therefore, the P.A.P.'s support  of

the  English-educated in the  matter  of  technical

education  can only ensure the English-educated  an

opportunity to get technical education. This  is  a

very dangerous and risky approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with one point raised by the Member

for Cairnhill, which is about the Work Brigade.  In

his speech the Minister for Finance pointed out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



that the Work Brigade was not expanded according to

the   original  plan  because  there  had  been   a

reduction of applicants into the Work Brigade.  The

original  intention of setting up the Work  Brigade

is  to  alleviate the unemployment problem  in  the

form   of   public   assistance.  With   increasing

unemployment, why is it that the Work Brigade, as a

social  relief  work, is not able to  attract  more

people?  The  correct  inference  is  that,   being

controlled  by  the P.A.P., it is no  more  than  a

party piece of machinery. That is why they are  not

willing,  for the sake of half a bowl of  rice,  to

become lackeys of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on economic problems the fundamental thing is the economic system of a country. In the manifesto of the P.A.P., it is clearly stated that the P.A.P. was determined to alter the system of distribution of wealth. However, the P.A.P. has forgotten about this pledge

of eliminating the system of exploitation of man by

man   according  to  the  socialist  platform.  The

Minister's  speech is a confession that the  P.A.P.

is   now  working  for  the  vested  interests   of

cosmopolitan  countries. They  have  now  lost  all

their   revolutionary  fervour.  They  shout  about

industrialisation and foreign investment, but today

everyone  of  us can see that although Britain  and

the U.S. are highly industrialised countries, there

are  millions of unemployed people there.  How  can

they  come here to help the people in the  colonial

territories  when they have millions of  people  in

their  own  countries who have no jobs? Because  of

Singapore's unique geographical position,  that  is

why  when the colonialist countries intend to carry

out  exploitation  in  this  area,  they  must   do

something  for  the  benefit of  the  people  here.

Because   of   their   connections   with   British

interests,  that is why the civil service  here  is

all  along  under  stricter  control.  Because   of

Singapore's economic position and its importance to

the  British, they are willing to throw more crumbs

to  the people here. That is why although Singapore

is  still a colonial country, outwardly the  people

here  seem to be better off than the people in  the

surrounding countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know how much longer the

Member  intends  to  speak.  I  did  indicate  that

reasonable  Time should be given to the  Government

to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Five minutes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Five minutes, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The P.A.P. do

not   look  at  the  development  problems  of  the

neighbouring countries from the historical point of

view. They do not understand because of their  long

exploitation  by the colonialist countries  in  the

past.  Although  they have become independent,  yet

they  are not able to solve their economic problems

and  to  raise their living standards  in  a  short

Time. This is not to the credit of the P.A.P.  This

is   because  of  Singapore's  unique  geographical

position  as a centre of British exploitation,  and

that  is  why the British are willing to give  more

crumbs and benefits to the people here. Now, we can

see   the   P.A.P.,  which  professes   to   be   a

revolutionary  Party, is complacent  and  satisfied

with   the   crumbs  dealt  out  by   the   British

imperialists  and laughs at the sufferings  of  the

people  in  our neighbouring countries. The  P.A.P.

Government  does not make use of the surplus  which

was   accumulated  in  the  past  few   years   and

distribute  it  to  the labouring  masses.  On  the

contrary,  because of its shaky  position  and  its

desire to enter Malaysia, the P.A.P. is now willing

to  hand over control of economic affairs to a pro-capitalist  Government in the Federation.  Although

the  speech of the Minister for Finance is  a  very

beautifully written one, it is hollow.  The  P.A.P.

Government  should not forget the fact that  it  is

not the P.A.P. alone who can look after the welfare

of  the  people. Even the past colonial  Government

did  something for the benefit of the  people.  The

Lim  Yew  Hock  Government also  carried  out  some

measures,  but they were very foolish because  they

did  not  make  use of publicity or  do  propaganda

work.  Before I left the P.A.P., I told the  P.A.P.

Ministers that the people of Singapore would not be

satisfied  with the small amount of social  welfare

work. What they demanded was political emancipation

and economic freedom from foreign control.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  S.P.A.'s  economic  plans

envisaged  that industry could be promoted  locally

by  compelling local capitalists to put up  51  per

cent   of   the  investments  and  getting  foreign

capitalists  to put up the balance of  the  49  per

cent  of the money required, the reason being  that

they wished local capitalists to have a controlling

interest  in the industries to be started up.  They

found  that  no foreign investors were prepared  to

invest and contribute their skill and expertise  if

the  controlling interest was in local hands.  That

is   why   they  were  not  able  to  get   foreign

participation  for  any  of  the  industries   they

thought  of setting up. Nor have they been able  to

get  any local capitalists to be interested in  any

of   their  industrial  schemes.  This  was  mainly

because  local capitalists distrusted them as  they

did  not  like the idea of well-connected outsiders

being given nominee shares in undertakings in which

they were expected to put up the money. Because  we

did  not  try  to do the same foolish  and  unclean

things  as  the  S.P.A. Government  did,  they  now

charge us with favouring foreign capitalists at the

expense of local capitalists. Is it not better  for

us to have three foreign oil companies - one British,

one  Japanese  and one American - than to  allow  one

foreign well-established oil company to expand  its

activities so that it gets a local monopoly in oil?

The  S.P.A. thinking was that if they could get  an

economic  price for the new site in which  a  well-established  foreign  oil company  was  interested,

they were quite prepared to let it have a perpetual

monopoly  in  oil. Is it not very much cleaner  and

more   in  accord  with  socialist  principles   to

stimulate   keen   competition   amongst    foreign

capitalists  as  we  have  done?  The  Member   for

Cairnhill spoke about the Inter-Governmental  Joint

Committee  of  Federation and  Singapore  Ministers

which  the  SPA.  Government set up to  co-ordinate

industrial development in both territories.  Except

for  the  fact  that once or twice it met,  nothing

else happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare all this, Sir, with the massive schemes

of  the  P.A.P. Government in the public sector  of

industrial development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



All that the S.P.A. Government could think

of  doing  was to set up sites for small industries

and  set  up a puny Industrial Promotion  Board  to

make  coffee-shop loans, many of which were written

off. One such loan which had to be written off  was

to the owner of a piece of land for the development

of  a  quarry  who did not even possess  the  title

deeds  to  the  land.  The  S.P.A.  Government  was

incapable  of looking at the industrial development

of Singapore with anything like the depth of vision

and acumen that our Minister for Finance possesses;

nor  could  they conceive of an industrial  complex

like  that  to be sited at Jurong. The  Member  for

Cairn-hill's  criticism of  the  P.A.P. industrial

development  programme  is  in  keeping  with   the

conscribed  thinking of which  he  and  the  S.P.A.

leaders are only capable.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this is

Opposition time, I will not take up too much ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now Government time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Anyway, I shall not take up too

much  of  the Opposition time. But I want to  point

out  that  in this debate the Opposition  obviously

had  great difficulty in coming to grips  with  the

speech  of  the  Minister for  Finance.  They  went

through the motions of trying to pick holes in  his

speech.  There  were facts and figures  which  they

could not refute and, therefore, they launched  out

into  rumours,  conjectures, and so  on.  But  what

should be made quite clear, Sir, is that it is  all

too easy for Opposition Members to say, "Yes, but I

could have done better." If we had done better,  it

is  always possible for them to say, "I could  have

done  still better." We should go by what  each  of

the  three Opposition groups had done when they had

the  power  to do something for the country.  Take,

for  example,  the  Labour  Front  Government,  now

called  the S.P.A. [Interruption] The Labour  Front

was  a  relative, somewhat a cousin of the  S.P.A.,

because at that time they could not agree with  the

family but since then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



there  has  been  a family reconciliation  and  the

S.P.A. and  the Labour Front are all in  the  same

clique.  So  there was the Labour Front  Government

representing  the Right-wing. They were  given  the

opportunity to show what they could



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> More employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The only monumental and

constructive  effort, as I understand  it,  was  an

iron   mine  in  the  Federation.  That  is   their

testimony.  That was the last stage of  the  Labour

Front  Government, because towards the end of their

term, they ended up in political corruption and  in

general  melee. They had the chance  to  show  what

they  could  do, and they failed. Therefore  today,

every  Time they see concrete evidence  of  what  a

social  democratic government can do, it  naturally

annoys  them. They even have to refute  that  these

achievements are either not there, or that if  they

are  there, that they are not as good as they could

have been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, the Member for Tanglin. His

speech  always  reminds me of a gentleman  who  has

been  to a gay party and goes back meandering  home

but  never  quite getting home. The  hon.  Member's

speech was something like this, it went on and  on,

and I was not quite sure whether he approved of the

achievements  of the Government or  disapproved  of

them.  He meandered on and on, but what he did  say

was  that  he claimed to have read Dalton,  and  in

between  he spouted poetry. But where have we  gone

wrong in our policy? What suggestions has he got to

show  us  how  we could have done better?  The  two

important essentials for economic development  are,

first,  political stability, and second,  a  clean,

honest  and efficient government. No capitalist  is

going  to  put money into any venture if he  thinks

that  the government is not efficient, is not clean

and  is not incorruptible. Therefore, ill the first

year  of the P.A.P. Government, we were just trying

ourselves out -  studying the lie of the land. In the

second  year, everybody knows that it was  a  fight

with the Communists because the Communists had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



other  reasons  for  halting  and  sabotaging   the

economic  plans of a non-Communist Government.  The

Communists  believe, and they tell their  followers - like  the  Member for Upper Serangoon who  spent  a

great deal of time speaking - that you cannot  give

the  people  anything but crumbs unless you  change

society.  The  Member  kept  on  referring   to   a

socialist society, but we know that he was  talking

of a Communist society. Therefore, any advance made

under  a non-Communist government is one more  nail

in   the  Communist  propaganda  that  unless   you

overthrow this system, you cannot improve  the  lot

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after two years when the Communists

could not get their was with us, they realised that

the  most  important thing, as far as the  economic

development  of  Singapore was concerned,  was  the

achievement  of  merger. For four years,  the  then

Labour   Front  kept  on  saying,  "In   the   1959

elections,  you  vote for us and we  will  get  you

merger."  But  they never got merger.  Today,  they

say,  "Yes" but at that Time, they said. "Don't  if

you  vote  for the P.A.P., there will be no  common

market  and no merger." We have proved that we  can

get  merger  and common market. I think the  S.P.A.

was the Party that offered the third alternative in

the last referendum. They did not want merger. They

said  that  they wanted something like Sarawak  and

North   Borneo.  Just  before  the   eve   of   the

referendum, they told their own followers. "Switch,

and  vote for Alternative A." These are the  people

who  switch and change their attitude. But we said.

"This  is what we want -  merger on the basis of  the

White Paper which we have approved and which we are

quite  convinced that the people of Singapore want,

not complete merger or merger on the same terms  as

Sarawak  and  North Borneo but the kind  of  merger

that  we have put through." We have got merger  and

therefore  we  are  waiting for the  prospects  for

economic  advancement. The only fly in the ointment

were the Communists. When they knew that merger was

about  to  be  achieved,  that  the  prospects  for

economic advancement were good and that there would

be less people unemployed, less discontent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



they  knew that they had to fight merger  not  only

for political but for economic reasons. That is why

today  you  will  notice that after the  Communists

have  been  conscribed and contained, stability  is

achieved, industrial disputes lessen, and  that  in

the  last eight or nine months there is an  air  of

prosperity and confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, we are now having trouble from

the  Right-wing. These same people - this time  the

M.C.A. and certain Senators from the Federation -

decided  to upset the merger arrangements  because

they  felt  that the Communists were out  and  that

therefore  the Right-wing had a chance.  Therefore,

they tried to discredit us because we got merger on

certain  terms.  And  they  went  round  to   local

merchants  and said, "Well, now that the Communists

are  on the way out, there is a good chance  of  an

election comeback." Therefore, they tried to  upset

our  merger  terms,  to change  them  and  to  give

economic  control to the Federation - in  fact,  to

certain M.C.A. Senators and so on. So that they can

manipulate  things  and tell the merchants,  "Well,

there you are. After merger, you must deal with us.

We  have got the financial strings." They attempted

it,  but fortunately for us we fought them  out  in

the open. And the two Senators were quiet. In fact,

one  of  them challenged to he named. We named  him

and  lie  has been keeping quiet. The other Senator

entered into an argument, but again he is quiet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, today the prospects for merger

are good and the prospects for economic advancement

are also good. The people know that there have been

concrete  achievements under the P.A.P. Government.

There  are facts and figures. The fact is that  the

buildings  are  there; the schools, roads,  lights,

and standpipes are there. This you cannot deny.  We

are not saying that we have created a Utopia. There

is  a lot of room for improvement, but what we  say

is   that   the  S.P.A. - the  former  Labour   Front

Government - were given a chance but they failed. The

Communists   are   not   interested   in   economic

construction and advancement. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



we have every reason to say that what we have

done  has been something for the cause of socialism

and democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>7.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget time,

as  recognised  by  everybody, is Opposition  time.

Unfortunately, the Opposition got to  a  bad  start

when  the Member for Queenstown opened the innings.

The  Member for Queenstown, as every Member in this

Assembly  knows, is a person who aspires  to  great

public oratory. But unfortunately, he labours under

the   mistaken  impression  that  quantity   is   a

sufficient  substitute for quality.  He  holds  the

record in the Assembly for the longest speech ever.

And  not  only that, he also holds the  runner's-up

record. But in his present state of mind, with  the

stresses and troubles which are now afflicting  his

Party,  he  has been reduced to a state  where  his

mind  is  unable  to distinguish between  fact  and

fantasy. So I think it would be a sheer waste of my

Time  to rebut at all the fantastic statements  and

assertions that he has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second speaker was the Member for Tanglin.

Sir, everyone in this House acknowledges the Member

for  Tanglin as a man with many sterling qualities.

His  performance today has given mc some hopes that

he  may  yet  move on to great things. Sir,  he  is

under  the  curious  illusion that  the  P.A.P. is

changing for the better - I mean, thank goodness, he

believes  that  we  are  improving,  we  are  being

rnoderate.  But  I  believe that his  standards  of

judgment are changing - we have been consistent,  but

he  has  modified  the way he looks  at  us  - his

approach  to  our political problems. I  see  great

hopes in this. He passed many complimentary remarks

about  our Government. I do wish to thank him  most

warmly  for his kind remarks, and I think he  means

well.  We  are  very  glad  that  we  have  on  the

Opposition Bench a man who, when he thinks that the

Government   has  done  well,  openly   gives   the

Government a pat on the back. We do accept his kind

remarks in the spirit that it was offered. I  would

say  that  the  trouble  is this:  the  Member  for

Tanglin,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



in  assessing the actions of the Government in  the

context  of  the  Party, is unable at  the  present

moment to realise that when conditions change  your

tactics  must  change although your basic  strategy

remains consistent. It is only after the Party  had

come  to an open clash with the pro-Communists  and

got  rid  of the Communists and their stooges  from

our  ranks that the differences between the  social

democrats in the Party and the Communists who  were

clinging  on  to  us became very  clear  and  self-evident.  And  so all the virtue  that  he  is  now

seeing  in the Party and in the Government is  more

evident than before. I will not argue at all in any

detail  about  some of the proposals  he  makes.  I

think  on  most matters we see eye to eye, although

in the little matter of deficit financing by credit

creation, I think I will reserve my position there,

because under the present Currency Board system  it

is  just impossible to do so. But when he says that

we  accepted his point of view in the deliberations

on the Tariff Board, may I say that it was just the

other  way round? We have always held the  position

that if you want to impose protective tariffs, then

you  must do the necessary calculations. There will

be  some  effect on trade especially the  re-export

trade.  It may diminish: it certainly will diminish

if  tariffs  are  too  high.  There  will  be  some

inconvenience to the entrepot trade. You have to  balance  that  against  the  gain  to  the  country

through employment in new industries that could  be

established as a result of tariff. That was, if you

will recollect, Mr Speaker. Sir, exactly the point

that  I  was trying to make in the Select Committee

on the Tariff Advisory Bill. I am very glad to hear

that  the Member for Tanglin has now come all  that

way with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third speaker was the Member for Hong

Lim.  He  is a curious gentleman, a very  ambitious

man. Even when lie was in the Party I remember that

when  we  prepared  our Sixth Anniversary  Souvenir

number,  and we asked various Ministers - he  was  a

Minister then - to contribute an article, we all  did

our little hit, and, of course, the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



Hong  Lim  sent  an article entitled  "When  I  was

Mayor".  Sir, in the history of mankind,  important

events   occur   which  serve   as   landmarks   to

historians.  For instance, the great  flood  before

which Noah brought animals in twos into his ark ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Adam and Eve.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Adam and Eve. For the Member

for  Hong  Lim, the great event in the  history  of

mankind  was the Hong Lim by-election. Before  then

all  was darkness, chaos and confusion. After that,

light,   progress.  Sir,  this  is  so   absurd   a

proposition  that  I  do  not  think   anybody   in

Singapore  will take him at all seriously  when  he

said  that before Hong Lim we wanted one big  steel

mill,  and  after  Hong Lim we saw  the  light  and

decided to have many small-scale industries. It  is

too  fantastic a proposition. It was not  the  Hong

Lim  by-election  nor  what  he  said  to  us.  Our

industrial policy was influenced by the  advice  we

received  from  several expert missions  which  the

United Nations and the World Bank sent to Singapore

at  our  request. The Member for Hong Lim sometimes

reminds  me  of Russian emigres after  the  October

Revolution  in  1917 in Russia. You will  recollect

that many landed aristocrats fled the country. Many

of them landed in London, impecunious. But they had

two great assets. They had an imposing physique,  a

tall  figure, blond hair, nice features and  plenty

of medals. This quality qualified them for the post

of  commissionaires  in London hotels.  Of  course,

these Russian emigres always hark back to the great

days before the October Revolution in the same  way

that  the  Member for Hong Lim harks  back  to  the

great days of the Hong Lim by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must most vigorously refute him, not on

all  his  inaccuracies, because that will  take  me

well past midnight, but at least on the subject  of

water expansion schemes. This is a subject of great

topical interest in Singapore today because of  the

shortage  of  water. The Member for  Hong  Lim,  in

castigating the present Government for  neglect  in

providing early enough these water expansion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



schemes,  forgot  that he was  Mayor  of  the  City

Council from 1957; in 1959, he graduated from Mayor

of  the  City  Council to the City Council  itself,

which august office he held until May 1960, when we

decided we had had enough of it. Sir, during  these

three  to  four years, he was responsible  for  the

water  supply  and for the expansion of  the  water

supply in Singapore. He was fully aware that  there

was  one  factor that prevented any  steps  towards

expanding the water supply, and that was  that  the

agreement  to draw water from Johore, the agreement

which  Singapore signed with the Johore  Government

to draw water for Singapore, had lapsed and it must

be renewed if there was to be any expansion to draw

more  water from Johore. He knew that. He  took  no

steps  at all when he was Mayor, when he  was  the

City Council, to renew negotiations with the Johore

Government so that water expansion schemes could be

set  afoot.  And if there is one man in  Singapore

who  is responsible for our present plight,  it  is

none other than the former Mayor of Singapore,  the

Member for Hong Lim, and the former City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim is one of the most

audacious  men it has been, my misfortune  to  meet

for the spreading of deliberate untruths, untruths

which  he  knows  to be completely  untrue,  to  be

false.  The Member for Anson is a different  kettle

of  fish.  He  does  have his  moods  of  euphoria,

sometimes  in  moments  of  rage  when  facts   and

fantasies  merge into each other.  The  Member  for

Hong Lim is not of that type. He is cold and he  is

calculating. And when he says that nothing had been

done  at  all to press on with our water  expansion

schemes  as  set  out in the Development  Plan,  he

knows  that what he said was absolutely untrue.  He

cited   four  instances  and  claimed  that  beyond

scratching the surface of the Scudai River  nothing

whatsoever  had been done. First, the Johore  River

scheme,  the  Scudai River scheme,  the  scheme  to

raise   the  height  of  the  dam  at  the  Seletar

Reservoir  and  the  scheme to provide  more  fresh

water  at  Jurong. His indictment of the Government

is  that  beyond  minor  works  at  Scudai  nothing

whatsoever had been done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the facts are just the reverse. The Johore

River  scheme, which is the biggest water expansion

scheme  to be undertaken by Singapore, is  well  on

foot  - detailed design, planning, specification  of

contract now being undertaken. In this work we have

the  benefit  of  advice from one of  the  foremost

firms  of water engineers in the world. As  I  have

said, we shall be applying for a World Bank loan to

finance part of this scheme, but the loan itself is

not  of the essence, Mr Speaker, as the Member for

Farrer  Park has said. It is to pay for the foreign

exchange  counterpart cost of  imported  materials;

that  is  not of importance. But work  is  in  full

swing. The Scudai River project has gone a long way

and  the date of completion is expected to  be  May

next   year.  The  scheme  to  raise  the   Seletar

Reservoir  dam has been abandoned on the advice  of

our  water consultants. The Jurong River scheme has

been extended not only to provide what is called  a

service  reservoir, raising it to  some  height  so

that  water pressure can be through gravitation  to

help  in  the distribution of water, but  also,  by

damming  the  Johore River, to build a  substantial

reservoir on what was formerly the Jurong River  to

provide  a  substantial supply of fresh  water  for

industries in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next speaker was the Member for

Cairnhill.  He  always likes  to  perform  in  this

Assembly. Sometimes I am in doubt whether I  should

take him seriously or whether I should sit back and

enjoy  the  performance. So I am not going  through

all the points he raised. But he and the Member for

Hong Lim and the Member for Upper Serangoon stated,

in  their  various ways, that our industrialisation

programme  has one great shortcoming, and  that  is

that  we  favour  the foreign investor  as  against

local  capital. Sir, my colleague the Minister  for

Health  has  given  some gruesome  details  of  how

industrial   promotion  took   place   during   his

Government  and I do not want to repeat  them.  But

there  was one point which the Member for Cairnhill

was  at  great  pains to stress, and that  is  that

whereas  his  Government insisted on  51  per  cent

participation by local capital and 49 per  cent  by

overseas capital, the P.A.P. Government is more lax

in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



respect.  In  fact,  in a number  of  undertakings,

particularly  the oil refineries, we were  prepared

to  see  the whole of the capital investment coming

from   abroad.   He  thought  this   was   a   very

reprehensible  and  unpatriotic practice.  Sir,  my

colleague,  the Minister for Health, has  explained

that  this  policy  of his had led  to  a  complete

cessation of industrial expansion between 1958  and

1959.  When  we took office there was obviously  no

prospect  at  all  of industrial  growth,  for  the

simple reason that if you want an overseas firm  to

come  to  Singapore and contribute their  know-how,

their techniques and their capital, they must he in

a  position  of control in regard to the management

of  the business. It is common sense and apparently

self-evident.  Maybe  what  the  former  Government

wanted  was for overseas manufacturers to make  all

the   necessary   contribution,   but   for   local

businessmen  to  have the final say in  management.

Mr Speaker, this is an excellent state of affairs.

I  have  no quarrel with that policy provided  they

could  deliver  the goods, and the  experience  was

that they had failed to deliver the goods. Not only

that. Between 1957 and 1959 there was a contraction

of industrial output in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin quoted labour statistics

to  bear out this point. That is quite true.  There

was  a  contraction of employment  in  industry  in

Singapore  during that period. Why was it  so,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir? The answer is simple.  In  1957  the

Federation of Malaya achieved independence and they

decided that they must have their own policy.  They

put   up  tariffs  for  products  manufactured   in

Singapore  purely on nationalist grounds.  That  is

quite  understandable.  The  net  result  was  that

whereas  before  1957 we had something  like  1,500

workers  employed in the industries  making  rubber

shoes, two or three years after that the number was

reduced to less than a third because the management

of  these  factories decided that they should  site

them  in  Johore, Kuala Lumpur, Kiang or elsewhere.

The  same  thing happened to other industries.  The

biscuit industry is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



outstanding  example.  The  result  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee to advise both  Governments

on  industrial expansion -  the committee  which  the

Member for Cairnhill was so proud of - the net result

to Singapore was extremely damaging. It was because

we  saw  an  unhealthy  trend  before  the  general

elections  that  we decided that unless  we  had  a

common market whereby one territory on one side  of

the  Causeway  does not try to pinch industry  from

the other side of the Causeway, we can never get  a

genuine  and balanced industrial growth  either  in

Singapore or in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have given sufficient details of

our  general proposals on the common market  in  my

Budget speech. I do not think I can go much further

than  that without breaking confidence, or  without

bringing in details of the Report of the World Bank

Mission. But I do wish to stress that the Singapore

Government    is    in   deadly    earnest    about

industrialisation. It sees the common market as the

vital    missing   factor   in   our   drive    for

industrialisation. We are determined that, as  part

of  the terms of merger of Singapore into Malaysia,

we  shall  have fair and legitimate  terms  on  the

common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not our intention, as has been

suggested  by the Member for Cairnhill, to  compete

as   a  Government  with  the  Government  of   the

Federation of Malaya. Governments do not compete in

industry, because they do not establish industries.

Industries are established by private enterprise in

Singapore  and  the Federation of  Malaya.  I  have

explained the reasons why this must be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon disagrees with the

policy. He considers the policy of allowing foreign

firms  to establish industries in Singapore  to  be

intensifying  the exploitation of  the  country  by

foreign  capital. But I will deal with that  matter

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, so far as the point raised by the Member for

Cairnhill, that Singapore is trying to compete with

Kuala Lumpur



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



in   the  matter  of  establishing  industries,  is

concerned,  may I say that that is a  most  harmful

and  mischievous statement to make? Towards the end

of  my Budget speech, in the concluding paragraphs,

I   particularly  stressed  the  point  that  after

Malaysia  we are likely to prosper as a  result  of

the  common market, and it would be quite wrong for

us,  wrong ethically, wrong morally and wrong  from

the  point of view of our own self-interest, to hog

the whole prosperity for ourselves. I have no doubt

that there will be fair and reasonable means of co-ordinating  industrial growth in the whole  of  the

Malaysian  territories.  In  fact,  not  merely  in

Singapore and the Federation but also in Borneo and

Sarawak, a reasonable and effective method  of  co-ordinating  industrial growth in  Malaysia  can  be

found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last speaker was the Member for

Upper Serangoon who, unfortunately, is not with  us

today.  I  am  not going to reply  to  the  various

nagging complaints and the minor belly aching  that

he has indulged in his speech. But I would say that

the  basis of his approach to the economic problems

facing  us  in  Singapore is a clearly recognisable

approach  to  me. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have  studied

the  Marxist  classics, from  Das  Kapital  to  the

selected  works of Stalin and Mao Tse-tung,  and  I

immediately recognise his approach. First, he  says

that we have lost our revolutionary fervour - mind

you,  he says we lost it only after he hopped  out,

not  before  that! - particularly in  our  economic

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, The Tasks Ahead, the Five-Year Plan on which

we   were  elected  to  office,  is  available  for

reference. In our election platform, it  is  stated

quite  clearly that in the entrepot trading economy

of  Singapore, you cannot have socialism. Socialism

is  not  possible. Anybody who thinks that you  can

establish  a  socialist  society  in  an   isolated

Singapore  needs to have his head examined.  If  he

has   any  pretence  to  being  a  Marxist   or   a

revolutionary,  he will do well to  study  some  of

Lenin's more serious works on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



subject. Lenin has got one epithet for such  types.

He  said, "These are not revolutionaries. They  are

only chatterboxes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member deplored the fact that I had

sought  to  draw a comparison in my  Budget  speech

between  the  modest  but nevertheless  significant

prosperity  which  Singapore  and  Malaya  are  now

enjoying,  and have enjoyed for the last two  years

or   so,  with  the  economic  depression  and  the

economic troubles in our neighbouring countries. He

said  the reason is simple. They have gone  through

colonial  exploitation  for  a  longer  Time   than

Singapore or Malaya had. We have been colonised  in

Singapore really since 1819, whereas in the case of

other  neighbouring  countries,  colonisation,   of

course,  dated much earlier - from the 17th  century,

in  fact, if my history serves me right.  But  the

trouble with this Marxist dogmatic approach is that

there are countries which have never been colonised

in  this  part  of  the  world  -  Thailand,  for

instance - or have never been colonised at  all  in

other  parts of the world, like parts of Melanesia.

They have never been colonised. They are not richer

than  us. In fact, they are poorer than us. So  how

does  he square up these hard facts of life,  which

cannot be contested, with his dogmatic approach? He

sees in our efforts to industrialise through openly

inviting overseas capital as an attempt to use  the

poor  people's  money  to pave  the  way  for  more

intensive exploitation by foreign capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in The Tasks Ahead we have already stated

openly  before the electorate that we shall welcome

foreign capital and foreign know-how and give  them

all  the  assistance that they require in order  to

establish  industries in Singapore  and  give  more

jobs to our people. That was the programme on which

not  only  we were elected but he was elected.  How

then  can  he complain of the loss of revolutionary

fervour,  the betrayal of the socialist revolution,

hobnobbing with the colonial exploiters and all the

rest of Marxist claptrap and rubbish?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not ever imagine I would succeed in

convincing him of the error of his ways. But  I  do

warn  his  other colleagues that the tone  and  the

beliefs  that this great theoretician of theirs  is

espousing in public and in this Assembly  is  quite

unmistakable. If they lend their support  to  these

policies  and  to this ideology, then  I  say,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, after 31st of August, they will  not

have a tolerant, democratic non-Communist socialist

Government in the Internal Security Council with at

least one hand on the steering wheel - not only that,

but  there  are three hands on the steering  wheel,

and one of them is ours. But after 31st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



of August, Mr Speaker, Sir, I say, "Well, chum,

you are on your own and if you come a cropper,

please do not say we have not warned you."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1963.
