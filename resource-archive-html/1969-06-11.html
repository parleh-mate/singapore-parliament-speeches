<div align="center"><b>TOURIST PROMOTION BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Resignations of officers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he  will  ascertain from the  Tourist  Promotion

Board  how  many officers of the Board had  resigned

between  1st  January and 31st May,  1969,  and  the

reasons  for  their resignations;  and  whether  the

resignations are likely to have adverse effects upon

the administration of the Board, and what steps have

been taken in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the lack of suitable staff to

undertake  the  various activities  of  the  Tourist

Promotion  Board  aimed  at  promoting  the  tourist

industry  in Singapore has long been felt. There  is

also  a need to strengthen the organisational set-up

of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these needs, plans were formulated

by   the  new  Board  to  reorganise  the  executive

structure  of  the Board and also to  recruit  high-calibre staff through open competition. As a result,

changes  had  to be made to the former  schedule  of

duties   of   the   staff.   Presumably,   the   new

dispensation  was not to the liking of some  members

of  the  staff. Thus, three officers, one clerk  and

four receptionists chose to resign from the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Board has not been

affected  by their resignations. The Board will  now

maintain  high  efficiency  and  discipline,  it  is

envisaged that in course of time the Board  will  be

able to project an image of a dynamic and aggressive

tourist  promotion  organisation  as  a  result   of

improvements



in    its   marketing   activities   and   in   its

organisation of local facilities for tourists.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE SALARIES COMMISSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Medical benefits to Government-aided school teachers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether and when directives have been issued for the

implementation of the recommendation  of  the  Civil

Service Salaries Commission that medical benefits be

extended  to  teaching personnel in Government-aided

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The recommendation of the Salaries Commission was

"that   consideration  should  be   given   to   the

possibility   of   extending   to   Government-Aided

Teaching  Personnel the Medical Benefits  applicable

to  Government  School Teachers". The Ministries  of

Education,  Health and Finance have been considering

this question since the beginning of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of study of this question, it was

noted   that  if  medical  benefits  applicable   to

Government  teachers were extended to  aided  school

teachers,  it would not be possible to exclude  non-teaching  staff of aided schools. If  all  staff  of

aided schools are to be included, the estimated cost

would be about $1.22 million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the question of cost, it will be

necessary  to  increase the staff and facilities  of

Government  hospitals and clinics in order  to  cope

with the increased work-load.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question whether aided school

staff should be required to undergo the same medical

examinations,  including X-ray of  the  chest,  that

civil  servants  have to undergo before  appointment

before   they  are  allowed  the  proposed   medical

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These and other related problems are being

studied,  and  it  is  not possible  to  come  to  a

decision until these problems are resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From the reply given by the Parliamentary

Secretary,  we can see that the Ministers  concerned

started  considering this problem from the beginning

of  this  year. But what is the date today? Has  not

half a year gone by with no decision? I believe  our

Government is still an efficient government. Can the

Parliamentary  Secretary assure the House  that  the

Ministries concerned will take speedy action?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I can assure the Member for Jurong that speedy

consideration  will be given to this matter.  But  I

hope  he  is  aware that the problem involves  three

Ministries - the Ministry of Education, the Ministry

of  Health and the Ministry of Finance. The  problem

was  first studied at the beginning of the year  and

it involves not only money but also the questions of

additional     hospital    facilities,    recruiting

professional  staff, etc. I can  assure  the  Member

that  a  decision  will  be  made  as  soon  as   is

practicable.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT FIGURES AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour if he will furnish

the employment figures gathered by the Ministry of

Labour  from 1st January, 1967, up to the  latest

convenient date; and whether he is satisfied with

the expansion in employment opportunities created by

the Government's policy of rapid industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the employment figures gathered

by  the  Ministry of Labour that are  now  available

cover  only  workmen,  shop assistants,  clerks  and

industrial  clerks. According to these figures,  the

total number in employment was in:



<pre>

         March 1967         -   208,565

         September 1967     -   213,733

         March 1968         -   222,044

         September 1968     -   226,754.

</pre>



<br>The  increase in employment in September  1968  over

that in March 1967 was, therefore, 18,189.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in employment occurred mainly in the

manufacturing sector where the number in  employment

increased by 10,546 between March 1967 and September

1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the figures gathered by the Ministry of

Labour  are  not  comprehensive,  they  nevertheless

reflect  the  expansion in employment  opportunities

and  therefore are a manifestation of the increasing

success    of   Government's   policy    of    rapid

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also pertinent to point out that during the

first  five months of 1968, 27 pioneer firms and  23

non-pioneer  firms went into production  in  Jurong,

bringing the total number of firms in production  to

240  as  compared with 198 for the  same  period  in

1967.  Employment  by  these firms  at  the  end  of

September  1968 was 22,800 as compared  with  16,800

for  the  same period in 1967, i.e., an increase  of

6,000 persons or 35.7 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a recent survey indicates that Singapore

needs  some  35,000  technicians and  other  skilled

workers by 1972. In addition, the growing electronic

industry  alone is expected to require  some  20,000

operatives within the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will see from these figures that

there  is  every  cause  for satisfaction  with  the

results of Government's policy of industrialisation.

Indeed  the  problem today is that, with  increasing

employment opportunities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



particularly in the skilled categories, there  is  a

shortage  of  trained operatives and other  workers.

When  this problem is solved in time. Singapore  may

be  faced  not with the problem of unemployment  but

with a shortage of labour in general.

<div align="center"><b>SEA TRAFFIC IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>WATERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  (a)  whether the  existing  sealanes

leading  in  and  out of the Port of  Singapore  are

adequate to cope with the increasing volume  of  sea

traffic:    (b)   whether   there   are   sufficient

experienced  pilots to ensure the safe movements  of

vessels  in  Singapore waters: and (c)  whether  all

individual  pilots  and tugs are now  equipped  with

portable transceivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the narrowest point in the

Straits of Singapore is situated near the approaches

to  the port and an average of 100 ships pass  daily

through  this  2�-mile wide channel  between  Pulau

Sekijang  Bendera on the Singapore  side, and  Batu

Berhanti  Lighthouse on the Indonesian side  of  the

Straits  based on a survey in February  1967.  About

half  of  these ships call at Singapore, whilst  the

other  half are in transit from the Indian Ocean  to

the South China Sea and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that the sealanes in the

approaches to the port are adequate to cope with the

increasing volume of traffic, but it has  been  felt

for  some  time that a system of traffic  separation

scheme would be desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government, therefore, submitted

tentative   proposals   to  the   inter-Governmental

Maritime Consultative Organisation, a United Nations

agency,  in September 1967, and Japan also forwarded

similar   proposals  about  the  same   time.   Both

proposals are now under study by I.M.C.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese Government has recently undertaken a

preliminary  hydrographic survey of the  Straits  of

Malacca and Singapore in co-operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



with  the  Governments  of Indonesia,  Malaysia  and

Singapore,  as a step prior to the establishment  of

such a traffic separation scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to assure the Member for Jalan Kayu

that  the Port of Singapore Authority has sufficient

experienced  pilots to ensure the safe  movement  of

vessels  in  Singapore waters, and their  number  is

steadily increasing as junior local pilots recruited

under   the  Authority's  Pilotage  Training  Scheme

develop and gain experience. There are at present 40

qualified  harbour  pilots  in  the  Port   Master's

Department  and  37  local  trainee  pilots  in  the

process  of  being trained for the posts of  harbour

pilot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All individual pilots and tugs are equipped with

portable  transceivers, and, in addition,  tugs  are

equipped   with  very  high  frequency  transceivers

capable  of operating in the International  Ship-to-Ship frequencies. Privately-owned tugs which operate

with P.S.A. pilots are also similarly equipped.

<div align="center"><b>(Removal of underwater obstructions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether there are adequate facilities

to   ensure   the   swift  removal   of   underwater

obstructions  in  the form of sunken  hulls  in  the

Singapore Harbour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, in common with most major world ports, the

Port of Singapore Authority does not operate its own

salvage  service  but depends  on  the  services  of

experienced professional salvors, of which there are

a  number operating in Singapore who can efficiently

and  effectively remove underwater obstructions  and

wrecks.

<div align="center"><b>(Resignations of senior officials)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if he will make a statement  on  the

reported  resignations of some senior  officials  of

the   Port  of  Singapore  Authority  recently,  and

whether those resignations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



are   likely  to  have  adverse  effects  upon   the

administration of the Authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Although seven senior officers have left the

service  of  the Port of Singapore Authority  within

the  last  five months, I can assure the Member  for

Jalan Kayu that these resignations are not likely to

have  any adverse effects on the continued efficient

administration of the Authority. Of  the  seven  who

have  left  the  service of the P.S.A. for  various

reasons,  four were expatriate officers.  Of  these,

one  has  had his contract of service terminated  by

the  Authority,  and  three  resigned  to  take   up

appointments in Fiji, the United Kingdom, and in the

World Bank respectively. Of the three local officers

who  have  resigned, one decided not  to  renew  his

contract  of  service  and  has  since  joined   the

Development Bank of Singapore, whilst the other  two

have  decided  to  join local  commercial  firms  to

better their prospects.

what  measures are being taken by the Public  Health

Department  against the spilling  of  earth  on  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are at present two big

projects carrying on in Jurong Town. It is estimated

that  about  5,000 trips are made by  earth-carrying

lorries per day. The Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



of Health has requested the contractors of these two

projects  to  take  certain preventive  measures  to

minimise the spilling of earth on the roads from the

earth-carrying lorries, such as raising the sides of

the lorries, laying of planks, timber and perforated

steel  sheets  along the path taken by  the  lorries

within  the  earth movement sites, removing  of  the

earth from the wheels before the lorries are allowed

on to the roads, and reducing the speed at which the

earth-carrying  lorries  move,  especially  at   the

circuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these preventive measures, the

contractors  were asked to deploy men and  equipment

to  clean  up  the roads and remove any earth  spilt

from   the  earth-carrying  lorries.  It   must   be

appreciated that in such big earth moving  projects,

some  earth  spillage on to the roads is inevitable.

However,  action  will be taken by the  Ministry  of

Health against the contractors if they fail to  take

adequate   preventive  measures  to   minimise   the

nuisance  caused by the spilling over  of  from  the

earth-carrying lorries.

<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill

intituled "An Act to amend the Currency Act, 1967."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir. I lay upon the Table

distribution to Members?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that there will be a gold

coin   issue  to  commemorate  Singapore's  150th

Anniversary. Originally the intention was  to  issue

commemorative coins which will not have legal tender

status.  Legal tender issues in gold have  generally

been frowned upon by monetary authorities in view of

the   limited  supply  of  monetary  gold  reserves.

However, with the introduction of the two-tier  gold

market  in March last year, this objection no longer

applies  and  legal gold tender issues are  becoming

more frequent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, therefore, also decided that the present

gold coin issue to commemorate the 150th Anniversary

will  also be a legal tender issue. Accordingly, it

is  necessary to amend the Currency Act, 1967, which

only allows the Currency Board to issue legal tender

coins   of  denominations  of  $I  and  below.   The

amendments proposed to sections 14 and 19 of the Act

therefore  authorise  the Currency  Board  to  issue

legal tender coins of any denominations and to  make

such  coins  legal  tender for the  payment  of  any

amount. This means that these gold coins can be used

to  pay  for goods and services and can be exchanged

at  the  Currency Board or the banks  for  notes  or

coins of other denominations up to their face value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins to be issued this August will be

minted  by  the  Chartered industries  of  Singapore

Limited.  Only a limited quantity will be available.

Designs  for  the  coins have been prepared  by  the

Royal  Mint on the concept submitted to them by  the

Government of Singapore. The coin has on its obverse

side  the  crest of the Republic and on the  reverse

the Raffles Lighthouse which symbolises the position

of Singapore as the beacon of South-east



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



Asia.  The  coin  measures  1.20  inches  in

diameter,  weighs 0.80 troy ounces, and has  a  gold

composition  of  22 carats. The face  value  of  the

coins will be $150. Arrangements are being made  for

the  coins  to be issued to the public  through  the

banks  as  well  as at the office  of  the  Currency

Board.

<div align="center"><b>PENSIONS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is at present no provision for persons who

render public service such as Members of Parliament,

Cabinet    Ministers,   Ministers   of   State    or

Parliamentary  Secretaries, to be  provided  for  in

their  latter  years  even if they  have  devoted  a

considerable portion of their working lives to  such

service.  Other  Commonwealth  countries,  such   as

Britain,  Australia, New Zealand  and  Canada,  have

pension schemes for their Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this Bill seeks to establish is a scheme for

payment  of  a  pension  to Members  of  Parliament,

Cabinet   Ministers,   Ministers   of   State    and

Parliamentary  Secretaries, who  have  completed  10

years  of  reckonable service and have attained  the

age of 50 years. "Reckonable service" is defined by

clause  2  of the Bill to mean service, on or  after

the  1st  day of January, 1955, in Parliament  as  a

Member  of Parliament or as Prime Minister or  as  a

Minister,   Minister  of  State, or   Parliamentary

Secretary.  The pension is for life and  is  payable

after  reaching  the age of 50 years  and  on  their

ceasing to be Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only circumstance in which a Member of

Parliament can receive a pension while he  is  still

in Parliament is when he has become what is known as

a  "backbencher". "Backbencher" is defined by clause

4,  sub-clause (1) of the Bill to mean a  Member  of

Parliament   who  does  not  hold  any   office   in

Parliament and who has previously served as a  Prime

Minister  or  Cabinet Minister for a period  of  not

less  than  three  years, and who has  completed  10

years'  reckonable service and has attained the  age

of 50 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of pension to be paid is to be

calculated  at  the  rate  of  one-thirtieth  of   a

Member's annual salary for every completed  year  of

reckonable service, and, in respect of any remaining

uncompleted year of reckonable service, at the  rate

of  one-three  hundred and sixtieth  of  a  Member's

annual  salary for each completed month  of  reckonable  service.  The maximum amount payable  is  two-thirds of his annual salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further provisions of the Bill are explained at

length in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, and

I do not think it necessary to elaborate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this Bill, the practices adopted by

other   Commonwealth  countries  were   taken   into

consideration. In Britain, for instance, a Member of

Parliament  can qualify for a pension  on  attaining

the  age  of  65  years, provided he has  10  years'

reckonable service, at the rate of �60 or about $450

for  each year of service for the first 15 years and

thereafter at the rate of �24 or about $180 for each

additional year, subject to a maximum of 45 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, a Member of Parliament can qualify

for  a pension at the age of 40 years. Here, pension

is received at the rate of 30 per cent of the Member

of  Parliament's allowance at the age of 40,  rising

by  four  per  cent each year until  he  reaches  44

years.  From the age of 45 years on, the  Member  of

Parliament gets a pension at the rate of 50 per cent

of his allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand Members of Parliament are entitled to

pensions  after  nine  years  of  service   and   on

attaining  the  age of 50 years. The  rate  is  one-thirty-second  of  the Member of  Parliament's  last

drawn salary, subject to a maximum of two-thirds  of

his last drawn salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, a pension is paid to a Member of

Parliament  who serves more than two  terms  with  a

maximum rate of Canadian $9,000 or S$27,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my opinion that our Ministers are grossly

underpaid. I, as Finance Minister, for example, earn

less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



a  branch manager of a bank and less than a  quarter

of  what  a managing director of a reputable company

would  earn. Our Prime Minister is earning something

like  10  per cent of what he could earn in  private

practice  as  a lawyer. Other of my colleagues  also

undergo financial sacrifice to some degree or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the old guard and we will soldier on. But

what  worries  us  is  the question  of  the  second

echelon  leadership who must in time take  over  the

torch  from  us.  We  cannot expect  to  get  future

leaders  of calibre on the cheap, whatever  was  the

case  in the past, and it is as well that the people

of  Singapore  realize and accept this fact.  Unless

Singaporeans  want to settle in  the  future  for  a

mediocre crack-pot or corrupt leadership, they  must

not  believe  they  can continue to  expect  men  of

ability   in  future  to  suffer  severe   financial

sacrifices  in  pursuit  of  a  hazardous  political

career.  In  my  opinion, a  mediocre  crack-pot  or

corrupt  political leadership will ruin this country

in  an  incredibly  short time, and  such  ruination

could be final, complete and permanent, as Singapore

has no natural resources or a large economic base on

which to effect a recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the passing of this Bill into law will not

guarantee  the attraction of leaders of calibre,  it

is  at least a first step in this direction. And  to

ensure  the  continued  prosperity  and  success  of

Singapore, the cost of the pension is a small  price

to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. Question

proposed.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I must

congratulate  the  Government  on  introducing  this

timely  Parliamentary Pensions Bill for the  Members

of  Parliament who will have to retire in the course

of  time.  The Government is concerned  about  their

future,  as the Minister for Finance has  said  that

the  Prime  Minister and other Ministers have  been

underpaid. But if you look at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



provisions  in the Bill, it provides  a  pension  of

only  one-thirtieth  of the  annual  salary  of  the

retired  Member of Parliament. I would have  thought

that  something like 50 per cent would be justified,

but not one-thirtieth of the annual salary, which is

a paltry sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think you will agree with me that in our

neighbouring countries, a Member of Parliament has a

lot  of opportunities to make money. But in the case

of  the  M.P.s in Singapore, especially  the  P.A.P.

M.P.s, there is nothing for them and they cannot  do

anything  at all. That is the reason why I say  that

the  Government  should give more  consideration  to

increase the quantum of pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is: why must the Government choose

the  magic figure of ten years' service in order for

an M.P. to be able to qualify for a pension? Why not

bring  it down to eight or nine years? Although  one

parliamentary term is five years, I feel  we  should

be  more  realistic. If we accept this Bill  without

amendment,  it means that an M.P. has  to  be  three

times lucky before he can qualify for a pension.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join the Member for Bras Basah

in  congratulating the Government and  the  Minister

for  Finance  on introducing this Bill in  order  to

help  Members of Parliament. But my main concern  is

with the ten years' reckonable service. I would like

to  inform  the House that as at present,  even  the

Minister for Finance does not qualify for a pension.

Only  the  Prime  Minister does.  The  Minister  for

Finance  will  qualify only next July. Therefore,  I

would like to suggest to him to amend "ten years" to

"nine   years"  because  most  of  the  Members   of

Parliament are young and there is no doubt that they

can  continue in Parliamentary service. I think nine

years'  reckonable service is more  appropriate.  As

the Minister for Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



has said, even in New Zealand a Member of Parliament

qualifies for a pension after nine years' service.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not belong to the second

echelon  leadership and it is doubtful  if  I  would

qualify  for  pension  as  a  Member  of  Parliament

because  I  am  already rather an old  man  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member has no grey hairs!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Thus, without any prospect of monetary gain, I can

say that this Bill is a sensible one. However, I  am

inclined  to  agree with the Member for  Bras  Basah

that  the proposed pension for Members of Parliament

would appear to be rather inadequate, because by the

time  a Member of Parliament reaches the age  of  50

-and  I can see from a look at Members in this House

that some of them will not take a long time to reach

the  age  of 50 - I am doubtful how much his pension

will  be worth. If a Member of Parliament can  serve

ten  years,  he will get only about $200.  I  agree

with the Member for Anson that if the figure of  ten

years' service is put down, it is very doubtful if a

third of the Members of this House will qualify  for

such a pension.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Bras Basah either

misunderstood the Bill or I have misunderstood  him.

He says it is one-thirtieth of his pension. Actually

it  is  one-thirtieth per year, so that if you serve

ten years, then you get one-third of $500, which  is

about $180.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is less than $180!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is $180 to the nearest $10. If you go on for 20

years, then you get about $360. I think the rate  of

one-thirtieth,  which is about 3 1/3  per  cent,  is

fairly generous by way of pension rights. The  civil

service gets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



only  half that rate. But then, of course, they have

security and a longer tenure of employment,  whereas

a  Member  of  Parliament does not  know  what  will

happen beyond five years at the most. Therefore,  we

thought  it  reasonable to give  a  higher  quantum.

There  are  Commonwealth countries like New  Zealand

which  pay  four per cent a year. So if the  Members

for  Bras Basah, Anson and Joo Chiat think that  the

total quantum is inadequate, I think the remedy lies

not  in  increasing the pension rate but perhaps  in

increasing the annual allowance of M.P.s. And it  is

up  to  them  to  settle this  question  with  their

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards nine years' or ten years' service, I do

not  think my colleagues would mind my revealing  to

this   House  that  this  has  been  a  subject   of

discussion and debate in Cabinet lasting for  weeks.

In  the end, we settled for ten years. The advantage

of  ten  years will be seen in the last year  before

the  next general election. I am quite certain  that

we  came to the right decision to opt for ten  years

and not for nine years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to make amendments to the Economic

Development Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  1961, to provide for greater flexibility

in  the  appointment of members to the Board and  to

expand  the  powers  conferred on  the  Board  under

section 16 of the principal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board Ordinance at

present provides that the Board shall consist of the

Chairman, the Director of the Board, the Chairman of

the  Housing  and Development Board and  five  other

members   to   represent   banking,   manufacturing,

commercial,   labour,  professional   and   academic

interests. It is proposed to amend this section  of

the  Ordinance to provide that, in addition  to  the

Chairman and Director of the Board, the Minister may

appoint  six  other members in his discretion.  This

amendment would give the Minister greater freedom to

appoint   persons   who,  in  his   opinion,   would

contribute  to  the  efficient  functioning  of  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 16 of the

principal  Ordinance  to  confer  on  the   Economic

Development  Board  the  power  to  establish,   and

promote   the   use  of,  industrial  standards   in

Singapore  and  to operate a Standard  Certification

Marks scheme. The establishment and operation  of  a

Certification   Marks   scheme   is   an   essential

concomitant  to  our  industrialization   programme.

There  is,  at  present, no recognized body  charged

with the responsibility to prepare, and promote  the

use   of,   industrial   standards.   The   Economic

Development  Board has set up a Singapore  Institute

of  Standards  and Industrial Research  which  will,

among  other things, prepare and popularise the  use

of  industrial  standards. The institute  will  also

operate  a  Certification Marks scheme,  which  will

serve  to  assure  the purchasers of  Singapore-made

goods of the quality of their purchases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this

Bill. It seeks to widen the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



scope  of the Economic Development Board and provide

for  a  greater  degree of efficiency  in  promoting

industrialisation.   Since   the   industrialisation

programme  was  introduced by the Government, under

the  able  leadership  of the  Economic  Development

Board, we  have seen the results of this programme.

At  present,  in  Jurong  and  in  other  industrial

estates,  there is a boom in industrial  activities.

The total number of workers employed exceeds 70,000.

I know that in some factories there is a shortage of

workers, especially skilled workers. This is a  very

good sign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of appointing six additional

members  to  the  Board, I hope  the  Minister  will

appoint people who are economists with a great  deal

of experience so that they can look into the problem

of promoting industrialisation more efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has just now mentioned

the  quality and standards of local products.  I  am

glad he has paid attention to this matter. This will

remind  our  industrialists that they should  ensure

that  the  quality of their products is sufficiently

competitive so that their products will be  able  to

compete  with foreign goods. In addition, this  will

give  a  greater degree of confidence to  our  local

consumers. Although our industrialisation  programme

has  been going on for about six or seven years,  we

already have had fairly good results and we are glad

about  this. I hope that the amendment to  the  Bill

will   further   speed   up  our   industrialisation

programme.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since we want to develop our

economy we must have more factories. We must not  be

choosy and should not impose restrictions. I  am  in

full agreement with the Minister on this Bill, but I

think  that industries should be allowed to  develop

freely. For example, I mentioned the other day  that

the  Government  should set up more iron  and  steel

mills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



If  there are more iron and steel mills, then  their

products  can be sold overseas. We should  therefore

allow  industries  to  develop  freely.  If  we  are

choosy,   then  it  is  tantamount  to   having   no

development.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that both the

Members  for  Sembawang and Ulu Pandan support  this

Bill.  I  need not reply to the Member for Sembawang

because  he fully supports the Bill, except possibly

on  the  question of appointment of experts  to  the

Board. In my opinion, experts should serve only in a

consultative  capacity. They may not necessarily  be

the  correct persons to be appointed to serve on the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point raised by the Member for Ulu

Pandan who advocated unregulated free enterprise,  I

am  afraid that this cannot be allowed in Singapore.

The   Minister  for  Finance  had  very   adequately

answered  his question on the free establishment  of

iron  and steel mills some time ago, and had pointed

out why an unregulated free-for-all system cannot be

allowed here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, our economy is doing very well and our

industrialisation  programme  is  progressing   very

satisfactorily. In fact, we are now in a position to

be  choosy  and to decide on what sort of industries

that will best benefit our economy and to allow only

such  industries to be established here, rather than

allow  every  Tom, Dick and Harry to come  here  and

open a factory to manufacture anything they wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to give greater

flexibility  to the Minister to appoint  members  of

the  Board and also to give the Board the powers  to

set  standards  for our industrial goods  to  ensure

that only quality goods are made so that we can gain

a strong foothold in the export market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April last year the Government decided that the

Port   of  Singapore  Authority  should  form  under

section  29  of  the  Port  of  Singapore  Authority

Ordinance, 1963, a private limited company  to  take

over as a going concern the dockyard undertakings of

the  Authority. The Authority also agreed  that  the

assets  and  liabilities of the  dockyard  would  be

handed  over  to  the new company. Accordingly,  the

company was incorporated on 3rd August, 1968, under

the  name  of the Singapore Dry Dock and Engineering

Co.  Ltd, with a registered share capital  of  $250

million.  On  23rd  August, 1968,  the  Company, by

resolution,  changed  its name  to  Keppel  Shipyard

(Private)  Ltd.,  and the new name  was  accordingly

registered with the Registrar of Companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities to be transferred to

the  Company include approximately 78 acres of land,

six dry docks, the buildings, plant and machinery of

the  former  Dockyard  Department  of  the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority, as well as  the  PSA's  shareholding   of   its   wholly-owned  subsidiary,   the

Singapore  Slipway  and Engineering  Co.  Ltd.  Also

included in the handover is the transfer of  half  a

million dollars in cash on 1st September, 1968,  and

$8�  million in Treasury Bills on 2nd September,

1968,  totalling  $9  million, which  represent  the

accrued  profits from 1st January, 1967.  The  total

value of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



these   assets  and  liabilities  amounts  to   $100

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return and as consideration for the handover of

the  assets and liabilities, the Company would issue

to  the  Port of Singapore Authority fully  paid  up

shares  and debenture loans totalling $100  million.

The  Government has decided, and the  Authority  has

agreed, that  after the shares  and  the  debenture

loans  have  been  issued  by  the  Company  to  the

Authority,  the P.S.A. would hand over these  shares

and  debenture  loans  to  the  Government  free  of

charge. In  order  to  carry out  the  Government's

decision, certain amendments would need to  be  made

to the Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to amend

the  Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance so as  to

enable    the   Authority   to   transfer    without

consideration all the securities of Keppel  Shipyard

(Private)  Ltd, held  by  the  Authority   to   the

Government. This is achieved by new section  31B  in

clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the transfer of

Dockyard personnel to the Company on terms  as  near

as  may  be  to  those applicable  to  such  persons

immediately prior to the transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes clear beyond doubt that the

Company shall have all the powers of a company under

the  Companies  Act, 1967, including  the  power  to

change   its   name   or  alter  its   articles   of

association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, the Bill

introduced  by  the Minister seeks to incorporate  a

company  in  shipbuilding,  and  this  is  a   clear

indication of the progress that we have made in  the

field of shipbuilding. We know that the shipbuilding

industry in Singapore has provided a great  deal  of

employment  opportunities  for  thousands   of   our

citizens,  and  has  also earned  a  great  deal  of

foreign  exchange  for Singapore,  amounting  to  at

least  $400  million per annum. This  is  a  pioneer

industry that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



we  should  seek to encourage further. For  example,

Sembawang Shipyard, now properly developed, has many

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued development of shipbuilding is, in

my opinion, a great step forward in the promotion of

our  economy. In the same way that we have developed

our  port  facilities - we have advanced to  be  the

fourth greatest port in the world - so we should try

to  go a step further in enhancing our reputation in

shipbuilding  in order to gain the fourth  place  in

shipbuilding  in the world. We can even  advance  to

first place if we put in further efforts, so that we

will  not  only  have a nice port but  also  a  fine

shipbuilding  industry in our Republic.  We  have  a

hard-working  labour force, high productivity,  fine

workmanship, and also an efficient Port of Singapore

Authority.  All these are favourable conditions  for

further increased development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, we have entered

into a new era in shipbuilding with the introduction

of  containerisation. We have spent a great deal  of

money  to  develop our port facilities in  order  to

meet  the  new  requirements of containerisation  so

that  we will be able to handle cargoes faster  than

ever  before.  We have a three-shift system  in  our

dockyard  so that cargoes can be handled  all  round

the clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the port of Singapore has played a

great  role  in  the development of  our  trade  and

economy.  It has been the lifeline of Singapore  for

the  last  100 years, and we will continue to  enjoy

the  same position side by side with our development

in  shipbuilding.  So  we must  do  all  we  can  to

maintain this rate of progress and high efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Member for

Sembawang  for  making his speech. The  position  is

quite  clear  to  him as, in his  constituency,  the

business of shipbuilding and ship repair is going on

there on a really big scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has decided to go quite deeply into

this industry because it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



very  labour  intensive and  will  greatly  help  to

create more job opportunities for our people.  I  do

not think I need to speak further except to say that

we   hope  we  can  encourage  and  establish   more

shipbuilding  yards  and ship-repairing  yards  in

Singapore  and, as the Member has put it, in  course

of time to gain a reputation as good as the port has

as  the  fourth  largest port in the  world  in  its

present capacity to handle cargoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend a few sections of the

National  Service  Ordinance,  1952, the  principal

amendment being the addition of a new subsection (3)

to  section 5. As section 5 now stands, a person who

has  been convicted for failing to register  is  not

legally  bound to register even though he  has  been

tried and convicted for the offence. The addition of

the  new  subsection will remedy this  situation  by

giving authority to the Court to direct persons  who

have  been  tried and convicted of this  offence  to

register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Act are to section 16K

(1).  Clause  5  of the Bill seeks to  increase  the

national service liability of persons who have  been

selected  for  officer training from  two  years  to

three  years.  This  is  desirable  because  officer

training is lengthy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



expensive. Besides, to be effective, an officer must

serve  at least 18 months after he has been trained.

He  can  then go into the Reserves. The total period

of  service  has,  therefore,  to  be  three  years.

Although   it  is  possible  to  retain  a  national

serviceman  in service for three years  or  for  any

longer  period  by  virtue of  section  16c  of  the

Ordinance, this is not the proper section to  invoke

because it was designed for times of emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill also amends sections 16K (2)

of  the  Ordinance  by enabling  part-time  national

servicemen to be deployed for duty for either  three

hours  per  week,  or six hours  per  fortnight,  or

twelve  hours per month. The deployment of part-time

national  servicemen in the People's Defence  Force,

the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary  on

police  duties has shown that three hours' duty  per

week  is  not practicable. By the time the  national

serviceman has been briefed and reaches his beat, he

has  only  a short actual duty period before  it  is

time  for  him to report off. The proposed amendment

will  enable national servicemen to be deployed  for

duty  for continuous periods of up to a total of  12

hours in a month, thereby making the deployment more

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 9 of the Ordinance by

adding  a  new  subsection (10) to ensure  that  the

medical examination of a person who is to be  called

up for national service has to undergo is a full and

proper   medical  examination,  including  a  dental

examination at the time of registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor amendment is also being made by including

the  expressions  "vigilante  corps"  and  "VIA"  to

section  26  (1)  (b) of the Ordinance,  which  were

inadvertently left unamended when the Ordinance  was

amended in March 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat what I have

said  before on the subject of national  service.  I

said that when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



national   service  involved  students   of   higher

institutions,  such  as universities  and  colleges,

their period of training should be reduced from  two

years to six months. Now the Minister, by this Bill,

is  increasing  the period from two years  to  three

years.  I  am  against the Bill on  this  point.  We

should  place  a  premium  on  our  specialists  and

scholars  from  the higher institutions.  We  should

give  them  special treatment. Why should  we  train

them as military officers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, as soon as they pick up a sword or a

gun,  are scared to death. We should recruit  people

who  are of stout heart and also physically fit  and

train  them as soldiers and officers. We should  not

enlist weaklings to fill military posts. I feel that

the National Service (Amendment) Bill is against the

spirit  which I am propounding. Only people who  are

tall  and  strong  should be enlisted  for  military

training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Member for Ulu

Pandan  does  not realise that not all officers  are

scholars  and not all scholars are officers  in  the

army here. I am afraid he is living in the past when

he  talks about an officer in the army being robust,

healthy  and an extrovert. That may be in the  past.

Although we need robust, healthy and young officers,

at  the same time we also need people with brains in

this  modern  technological age. Of course,  in  the

army  we  do have some university graduates who  are

officers.   But  not  all  officers  are  university

graduates. I think I have made it clear that officer

training  is expensive. It takes about 18 months  to

two years to train an officer, and just after he has

completed his training, we are letting him off. This

does not serve the purpose at all. Therefore, for an

officer  to  be effective after having received  his

training, he should spend another year in  the  army

and put all his training into practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan may have his own views

about giving six months' training to an officer  and

letting  him off. But I can assure him that  I  have

thoroughly  looked  into the question  and, on  the

advice of the experts, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



have decided that it is best for an officer to serve

three years in our army.

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill that is now before the

House seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code in

so far as it relates to trial by jury in capital

cases in Singapore. As a consequence of the

provisions in this Bill, trial by jury in Singapore

will be abolished altogether. In place of this

method of trial, in every case where an accused

person faces a charge, which upon conviction may

result in capital punishment being imposed, he will

be arraigned and tried before a Bench of three

Judges of the High Court. And as Members will see in

the provisions of this Bill, three High Court Judges

will arrive at their decision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



as  to  the guilt or otherwise of the accused either

unanimously  or by majority. The Government  regards

this  amendment to the law as necessary, in view  of

the  experiences in the past few years in Singapore,

if  respect for criminal procedure and confidence in

our  administration of justice is to be  maintained.

This then is the main reason for the proposed change

in  the  law. It is because of the unreliability  of

the system of trial by jury - and I am speaking,  of

course, in the particular context of Singapore -as I

have  heretofore  said, proved  by  the  results  of

recent cases where although ample evidence of  guilt

of  an  accused person had been adduced  before  the

court, accused persons have been acquitted. Speaking

for myself I feel that this very important aspect of

the administration of justice should not be left  in

the  hands  of  what are after all seven  laymen  but

rather  should be left solely in the  hands  of  the

professional Judge who would, to say the  least,  be

able  to  dispense  justice in  a  more  predictable

manner. Hon. Members will agree. I am sure,  when  I

say  that  it  cannot be disputed that professionals

will  be  able to "do the job" better than  ordinary

laymen.  I  might add that before this  contemplated

change  in  the law was drafted, the  views  of  the

Chief  Justice and several of the Puisne Judges  who

normally  take criminal cases, as well as  those  of

the  legal profession were sought. The Chief Justice

and  the  Judges were in agreement with the proposed

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury system has always had its protagonists

and  its critics. We have inherited this system,  it

must  be  admitted, from the English Common Law  and

one  of the main arguments for its retention is that

it   involves   the   ordinary   layman   with   the

administration of justice. Highly theoretical  views

that   such  association  and  involvement  by   the

ordinary  layman with the administration of  justice

as  demonstrating an important facet of the  meaning

of  democracy  have been oft-times  suggested  along

with   several   others  for  its  retention,   e.g.

quotations  by well-known and celebrated  Judges  in

England. Lord Halsbury is quoted to have said, "As a

rule, all juries are in my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



opinion more generally right than Judges", and  Lord

Du Parqc. "When questions of fact had to be decided,

there  is  no tribunal to equal a jury, directed  by

the  cold impartial Judge." Another famous quotation

is  by Mr Justice Humphreys, one of the greatest of

English  criminal Judges, who said, "The correctness

of a jury's verdict has almost come to be an axiom."

But  for  every such argument one can well  find  an

equal  argument for abolishment. I am  not  for  one

moment  disagreeing with the views of the celebrated

Judges in England as to their opinions on the  value

of  the  jury system but I would like merely to  say

that  these opinions held by English Judges  in  the

context of the social conditions of the time reflect

values deeply rooted in tradition and a way of life.

I  need  hardly  add, Sir, that these  concepts  and

values  are  not altogether relevant  in  Singapore.

Social  and  economic conditions are very  different

here. The jury consists of seven not twelve persons.

But  even  in England where the system is so  deeply

rooted  in tradition and way of life, very  forceful

and  deeply  critical comments have been  passed  by

eminent  Judges as well as laymen advocating reform.

The  result is even in England today there have been

amendments to the law relating to juries. Until very

recently  all twelve jurymen had to be unanimous  in

their  verdict. Today in England a majority  verdict

would be acceptable. In this respect, it can be said

that  our system of jury trial had anticipated these

changes  in  England  as here in  Singapore  it  has

always been the law that the majority verdicts would

suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One need not be a student of legal history to know

that  jury trials have through the ages become  less

and  less  important  a  method  of  trial  even  in

England, whereas two centuries ago trial by jury was

fashionable not only in criminal but also  in  civil

cases. Towards the middle of the last century, civil

juries  had fallen into desuetude. As a consequence,

of   course,  when  the  English  Common   Law   was

introduced to this part of the world this method  of

trial in regard to civil matters was never introduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



We have never known of this method of  trial

in  civil  suits. If we go back further in point  of

time,  and examine the origins of the jury, we  will

no  doubt  find that its original raison d'etre  was

quite different from its present purpose and use  as

a method of trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to criminal matters, while it is true

that  there  are very well-known lawyers,  statesmen

and eminent Judges in England who have advocated its

retention,  it would appear most of these  arguments

for  its  retention have, as their  premise,  social

conditions  where arguments of this  kind  might  be

appropriate. But, unfortunately, such arguments that

the  jury  is the bastion of democracy, etc.,  have

very little relevance in Singapore today. And it  is

not  in  a  light-hearted manner that the Government

has sought to bring about this change in the law. In

fact, it may be regarded as a logical conclusion  to

the  amendments introduced some nine  or  ten  years

ago.  We  have, in the recent past, done  away  with

trial  by  jury which used to be the only method  of

trial  in  all criminal cases triable  in  the  High

Court.  The  change now envisaged by this  Bill  has

become all the more desirable when one considers the

changes  to  the  system introduced  in  1960  where

instead of jury trials we had substituted trial by a

single High Court Judge except for capital offences.

Where  the  changes  brought  about  have  been   so

successfully  implemented,  may  it  not  be  asked,

whatever the objections to these changes proposed in

this  Bill, why have they not been extended to cover

all  criminal  cases irrespective of  the  penalties

involved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the vociferous objections from certain

quarters, namely from those members of the  Bar  who

practise almost exclusively in the criminal  courts,

and  in  order  that it may not be  said  that  this

Government  has without due deliberation  done  away

with  a long-standing practice of the administration

of  the  law  of  crime, we have, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

decided to send this Bill to Select Committee  where

such views as may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



raised  may be given every consideration  and  where

the  amendments to the Bill of which I have  already

given notice will be dealt with. For the information

of Members, the amendments(Appendix, Cols. 45-8) that are to be moved are

published as Supplement No. 7 dated 11th June, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to emphasise the fact that

this  proposed  change  in  the  law  has  not  been

conceived impulsively. Considerable thought has been

given  to  this Bill. Our experiences in the  recent

past cannot be ignored and rather than allow justice

to   be   thwarted  through  either   ignorance   or

squeamishness,   we   must  be   prepared   wherever

necessary  for  the well-being of the  community  to

amend  the  procedural methods of administering  the

law relating to offences carrying the death penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, only offences that carry the death

penalty  are subject to trial by judge and jury  and

this  Bill  seeks to amend section 178  (1)  of  the

Criminal Procedure Code by abolishing this  form  of

trial  and  substituting it with a  trial  by  three

Judges  of the High Court. To state this in  another

way,  henceforth,  a  human  being  charged  with  a

capital  offence would be convicted, if at all,  not

by the simple verdict of a jury, but by the reasoned

judgments of three Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the Bill was published, informed

opinion   has   become  inflamed  and  agitated   by

forebodings  of  dire consequences.  An  institution

that  had worked reasonably well for about 140 years

should not be lightly tampered with. It has an  aura

of  age;  and the issue now has become one on  which

the  principal  disputants are  the  traditionalists

supporting the jury and the rationalists questioning

the rational foundation or otherwise of jury trials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic and emotional statements have been made

about  the  nature and character of jury  trials  by

brilliant legal luminaries in England.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two such statements would bear quoting if only to

lay  bare  the  historical  inaccuracies  that  they

contain. About 200 years ago Lord Blackstone writing

about jury trials stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The liberties of England cannot but subsist, so

long as this palladium remains sacred and inviolate;

not  only from open attacks (which none will  be  so

hardy   as  to  make),  but  also  from  all  secret

machinations,  which may sap and  undermine  it;  by

introducing new and arbitrary methods of  trial,  by

justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue,

and  courts  of  conscience. And however  convenient

these   may  appear  at  first  (as  doubtless   all

arbitrary  powers,  well  executed,  are  the   most

convenient),  yet  let it be again  remembered  that

delays,  and  little inconveniences in the  form  of

justice,  are  the price that all free nations  must

pay  for  their liberty in more substantial matters;

that  these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of  the

nation  are fundamentally opposite to the spirit  of

our constitution; and that, though begun in trifles,

the precedent may gradually increase and spread,  to

the  utter disuse of juries in questions of the most

momentous concern.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rudimentary knowledge of British social history

would  be  sufficient to show that at  the  time  he

wrote,  Blackstone's liberties were but the property

of  but  a  very  small  class of  British  society.

Parliamentary democracy based on adult  suffrage  is

only  one  generation old in Britain;  and  yet  the

palladium  of  liberties has  become  a  catchphrase

among some of our own legal luminaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lord Devlin in writing about juries was able

to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Each jury is a little Parliament. The jury sense

is  the Parliament sense. I cannot see the one dying

and the other one surviving. The first object of any

tyrant   would   be   to  make  Parliament   utterly

subservient  to his will; and the next to  overthrow

or  diminish  trail  by jury, for  no  tyrant  could

afford  to have a subject's freedom in the hands  of

twelve  of his countrymen. So that trial by jury  is

more than an instrument of justice and more than one

wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows

that freedom lives.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can only be a piece of delightful rhetoric as

the  hard  facts  of British constitutional  history

would appear to militate against this assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In attempting to analyse the British attitude

towards  jury trial, two major matters ought  to  be

kept  in mind. The first is that jury trial has  for

long been regarded as a bulwark against oppression;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



it  is  part of British tradition  and  still

surrounded by sentiment and emotion. The  second  is

that  whilst there have been attempts to assess  its

efficacy, these are based on suppositions and not on

hard facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these assertions made in support of juries

should  be tested against decided cases. If all  the

cases  cited  in  Wade and Phillip's  Constitutional

Law, in the section on the Citizen and the State are

examined,  it  will be found that juries  played  an

insignificant part. When a jury was used,  the  jury

either answered questions so put that the jury could

not have known in whose favour they were finding, or

followed the Judge's opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who take seriously the assertion that

the  jury  is  a  safeguard of the  liberty  of  the

subject should read Howell's State Trials where  all

the political trials worth noting are recorded. Many

of  them are sedition trials and for every acquittal

there  was a conviction to balance it. In 1792 Paine

was  convicted  for publishing the  Rights  of  Man,

while  in  1793  his publisher Eaton  was  virtually

acquitted.  Daniel Holt was convicted in  1793,  and

completely  ruined, for publishing  suggestions  for

mild  reform  of  the  franchise  and  parliamentary

constituencies. Further examples could be multiplied

if  need  be.  The only cure for the  admiration  of

these  juries  is to read the State  Trials  and  to

ponder  over  the question of whether  these  juries

were  lamps  that  showed  that  freedom  lived   or

instruments of oppression and prejudice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the qualifications and mode of

selection of jurors would throw further light on the

character of British juries. A juror must be  a  �10

freeholder or a �20 leaseholder, or a householder in

a  valuation list of �30 in London and Middlesex  or

�20  elsewhere, or occupy a house with not less than

15 windows. This meant that jury service was largely

confined to the middle and upper classes. It is only

by  some  stretch of the imagination  that  a  lower

class  prisoner could be said to be tried by "twelve

representatives of his countrymen". The views and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



prejudices of jurors were more apt to be those  of

the  middle  classes  than  those  of  the  poorer

classes. In political terms it is true to say that

jurors  tend by and large to be supporters of  the

Conservative Party than the Labour Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Juries Act, 1922, the quaint practice

of   striking  a  jury  from  a  panel  of  jurors

obtained.  A  case  decided  early  this   century

illustrates how this is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lygon, M.P. (Conservative) brought a libel

action against Mr Greenwood, M.P. (Liberal) and a

newspaper  owned  by Mr Winfrey, M.P.  (Liberal).

Mr  Lygon  had  said that he was against  feeding

school children out of the rates, and he was cited

as  being  against  feeding school  children,  the

words "out of the rates" being omitted, so that  a

fearsome  innuendo  arose.  A  special  jury   was

ordered    to   be   struck.   The    venue    was

Northamptonshire, so the Sheriff of  that  country

sent  the  special jury list to his  London  agent

before whom the parties appeared and balloted  for

48  names.  Another appointment, a day later,  was

made for 'striking'. The plaintiffs' solicitor  at

once  set  off  for Northampton, followed  by  the

defendants' solicitor, to find out the politics of

the  panel. The result showed 35 Conservatives and 13  Liberals. The next day with unerring  accuracy

the  plaintiff struck out 12 out of  13  Liberals,

whilst  the defendant said he objected to  the  12

"most  violent Tories". That left 23 Conservatives

and  one  Liberal. At the Assizes the one  Liberal

got  in  on the ballot and because he was a quiet,

unobtrusive  Liberal, he was made foreman  of  the

jury and he brought down the verdict from �500  to

�100  by "sticking out". Had that particular panel

been  36  Conservatives to 12 Liberals, the  trial

jury  would  have been all Conservatives.  One  is

left with the question as to whether there is  any

need  to introduce these picturesque imponderables

into a mature system of administration of justice,

the  essential characteristics of which should  be

certainty and uniformity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predominant tendency in Britain today is to

have  fewer  and  fewer jury  trials,  and  it  is

doubtful  indeed  that  if Britain  were  given  a

chance  to  start  anew,  she  would  deliberately

choose to have jury trials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must seek to

discover  the  meaning of the  assertion  that  in

being tried by a jury, one is tried by one's peers

or  by  one's neighbourhood. The formula  goes  as

follows. "Was the prisoner willing to be judged by

the  neighbourhood? Would he put himself upon  his

country? If so, let him plead not guilty and  take

their verdict." In Britain it is still true that a

working class prisoner is never tried by his peers

or  his neighbourhood. More so in a multi-cultural

society like Singapore. Strictly, we should  allow

that a Malay-speaking prisoner should be tried  by

a  Malay  jury, a Chinese prisoner  by  a  Chinese

jury,  a  Tamil prisoner by a Tamil jury,  and  an

English-speaking  prisoner by an  English-speaking

jury.  The  irrational prejudices,  the  attendant

lack  of  certainty and uniformity and  the  havoc

that   would  be  injected  into  the  system   of

administration of justice should be sufficient  to

make any sensible person sit up and re-examine the

foundations of our society. It is always dangerous

to  think in vacuo. When Lord Devlin assessed  the

virtues  of  trials by jury, he rested  his  views

upon  the  matrix of British experience. He  dealt

with particulars and postulated no universals; and

this  is reason enough for us to ensure that these

traditional  notions  and  institutions   are   so

adjusted as to fit squarely into the fabric  of  a

multi-racial society. Justice must be seen  to  be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the proposed trial by

three  Judges would make for more rational,  uniform

and  fairer trials. The accused will have  the  same

old  safeguards.  The allegations against  him  must

be  proved beyond reasonable doubt. He can  only  be

convicted  of an offence known to and defined  by  a

written  law.  Judges, by their  very  training  and

experience, would be and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



should  be  free from caprice and prejudice  in  the

performance of their functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very oddly remarked that abolition of

juries would lead to executive interference with the

judiciary.  This  must  inevitably  imply  that  our

Judges  lack  integrity and a  sense  of  their  own

responsibilities   in  the  performance   of   their

functions. I should rather think, however, that they

would  respond more easily to problems of conscience

and  the  basic rights of citizens than any jury  is

able  to  do. For the nature of their work  requires

that  Judges  should be much more  than  mere  legal

technicians. They would, for the most part,  be  men

who  understand values and have deep convictions  on

great social questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only remains for me to say that clause 3 (3) of

the  Bill should be deleted. If three Judges of  the

High Court are unable to arrive at a decision either

unanimously  or by majority, the Court  must  acquit

and  discharge the accused, and there should  be  no

question of a retrial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step, Mr Speaker, Sir, in legal reform

should  now  have  to do with the whole  problem  of

capital punishment.



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I associate myself with the

views in support of the Bill expressed by the Member

for  Bukit  Panjang. However, in addition thereto  I

have certain observations to make on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether the jury system is an

integral  and an indispenable facet of criminal  law

practice and adjudication in our courts today  is  a

question  which  inevitably involves  lawyers.  This

must  be  so  because the system  is  basic  in  the

criminal  jurisprudence  in  which  the  lawyer   is

disciplined.  In the lawyer's eyes the  jury  system

and  justice  in criminal law are concomitant.  They

say  that  if  you  leave the  jury  system  out  of

criminal adjudication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



in the courts, you have impaired justice  by

so much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system, Sir, has been practised in Common Law

countries  for some hundreds of years and  in  those

countries   which  still  retain  the  system,   its

operation  had not been seriously questioned  as  to

initiate a thorough examination of the system with a

view  to discovering its efficacy in a given society

with  varying  social values or varying  ethnic  and

cultural responses. In fact, it has been the subject

of  continuous  commentary for  the  period  of  200

years,  almost  from Blackstone to Lord  Devlin, so

that  now  it  appears to be hallowed with  such  an

indispensability   in   the   field   of    criminal

jurisprudence that the Bill now before the House  is

to some lawyers anathema.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regard the jury system as an ingenious and

practical  instrument  of  justice  of  considerable

nicety, but depending on what context it is supposed

to  operate. As a citizen I would look to  the  jury

system  for reassuring signs of its efficacy  as  an

instrument  of  justice  in  the  context   of   the

realities within which it is meant to operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of this Bill are that in any trial of

a  capital offence, three Judges will make a finding

on  the  facts of the case which up to now has  been

the  function of the jury, and they will proceed  to

determine  the law and return the verdict.  By  this

Bill, therefore, the jury system is abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which ought to matter is whether this

system  of  trial  by three Judges will  ensure  the

consistency  of justice which is desired  and  which

the  jury system apparently does not assure in  this

multi-racial,  multi-cultural social milieu  of  the

moment.  If  the function of the jury is limited  to

making  a  finding  on the facts of  the  case,  why

cannot three Judges make an equally just, if  not  a

better finding of the facts? If the Judges' capacity

to  make a suitable finding of the facts is doubted,

what  do  these critics have to say about the  fact-findings of the Judges in civil matters in the  High

Court  and  in  the subordinate civil  and  criminal

courts?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, opposers of the Bill argue that the jury

system provides the opportunity for the community to

participate  in  the  administration  of   law   and

justice.  Such participation is negligible.  In  any

case  would  non-participation of the administration

of  law  and justice in the lower subordinate courts

to  any  extent impair the judgment of  our  Judges?

What  about  the mass convictions in the subordinate

criminal  courts? It has never been  theorised  that

such convictions are questionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the merit of this Bill is simply

the  fact  that  in trials of capital  offences,  it

removes from the functions of the Judge that arduous

and complex



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



task  of  directing the jury on which would  usually

depend  the  question of affirming or  allowing  the

conviction in the Court of Appeal. To sum up it  may

be  said that this Bill saves justice from having to

precariously tread on the high wire of  the  summing

up and therefore stabilise her image in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now 5.15 p.m.
