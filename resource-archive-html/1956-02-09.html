Speaker, Sir, may I seek the indulgence of  this

House  and  your permission to make  a  personal

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I was guilty

yesterday  of an epithet that is not  compatible

with  the dignity of this House. Being addressed

to  my  right, you did not hear it, and many  of

the  Members  on my left did not  hear  it.  But

others  did  and the Gallery did. I  should  not

like, Sir, to hide behind your ignorance, or  to

fail in my responsibility to this House. In  the

circumstances,  Sir, I should like  to  make  my

unreserved apologies to the House for my action.

<div align="center"><b>LANGUAGES OF THE ASSEMBLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Appointment of Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of proceedings - [8th February]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that for

the purposes of oral debate the languages of the

Assembly should be English, Malay, Mandarin  and

Tamil;  and that a Select Committee be appointed

to examine, report upon and make recommendations

in respect of matters necessary to enable effect

to be given to the proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir,

yesterday I dealt with one danger which I  think

we must face in this very crucial issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I would like to deal with just one

other   matter,  an  argument  which  has   been

consistently repeated in private, though  rarely

in public, and it was somewhat highlighted, Sir,

in  a  conversation  I  once  had  with  a  very

intelligent  Malayan whom I sought to  enrol  in

the  Labour  Front. He said to me,  "The  Labour

Front is too pro-Chinese. With multi-lingualism,

you  are  going to hand us over to the  Chinese.

They  will  swamp us." Sir, we must  face  these

things in the open. It is no use hiding them.  I

tried to explain that as we saw things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



we  did not believe in favouritism for any race.

We  were  for justice and we were for  political

justice,  which is democracy; that  if  one  has

faith  and believes in democracy, then one  must

accept  the rule of the majority. Yes, Sir,  one

must  accept  the  rule  of  the  majority.  The

Chinese  are 76 per cent of our population.  Let

us  not  avoid the issue. I am not sugaring  any

pill. We will face it squarely, Sir. This  is  a

serious debate. As I see things, it is right and

it is proper that the Chinese people should have

a  preponderant voice in the government of  this

country.  But,  Sir, I tried to explain - and  I

think  it  is important that we should here,  in

seeking  to  put the issues frankly  before  the

House, also seek to allay the very genuine fears

of a very honest group in our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy, though it means the rule of the

majority,  also means absolute respect  for  the

rights   of  the  minority.  It  means  justice.

Justice,  Sir, does not mean that  the  majority

can  steamroller through. They have got  to  use

their  powers  in harmony with  the  concept  of

natural  justice and with respect  for  minority

interests.  My  friend said - I hope  the  Chinese

here  would forgive me, but I think we ought  to

speak  bluntly - "What do the Chinese know  about

democracy?"  Sir, I can only speak  as  one  man

from  my  experience. I have  lived  with  them,

though  not  very closely, and I  have  gone  to

school  with  them. I have worked with  them.  I

have  been a clerk with them, and I believe that

the  Chinese people in Singapore - those  I  know,

Sir - are one of the most adaptable people and in

Singapore   one   of  the  most  peaceable   and

reasonable. I am - and this is genuine, Sir - full

of  admiration for their capacity to  appreciate

the  value  of  a new concept and  to  make  the

kernel  of that new concept, the valuable aspect

of it, their own. I believe, Sir, that given the

opportunity the Chinese people will be equal not

only  to understanding the virtues of democracy,

which I believe in wholeheartedly, but to making

adoptions  of parliamentary democracy their  own

and  adding to that doctrine in its practice  in

this Colony their own magnificent vitality. Sir,

I  was asked by this man how I could expect that

when the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



schools in Singapore give the same education  as

the  schools  in Amoy, and the schools  in  Amoy

have  produced Communists. I do not  know  about

the  schools in Amoy, Sir, and I would  like  to

know  a lot more about the schools in Singapore;

but I do say this - that even from Amoy there have

been  refugees,  refugees from  the  tyranny  of

Communism, into the quite squalid conditions  of

the  refugees in Hongkong. I do know  that  here

they   have   the  opportunities  to  understand

democracy. I hope they will have the opportunity

to participate in it, and I believe they will be

a new ally and a refreshing new strength to this

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked him what alternative he had, and

he  said,  "Why cannot we leave it as it  is - the

English  language?"  These are  arguments  other

Members must have heard, and I think it is  well

we should face them. I pointed out that if multi-lingualism  hands us over to the  Chinese,  then

English hands the people over to the very  small

English-speaking minority. He said, "Oh, we will

be  just  to  the Chinese." My reply  was,  "Why

should we think the Chinese would not be just to

the  minority races?" Why should we imagine that

under  the  process  of democracy,  which  means

majority rule, anybody would be submerged?  Sir,

in this very House we see examples of minorities

having  their full say without being  submerged.

We  have  seen in a solemn moment the expression

of   our   deepest  feelings,  a   single-Member

Party - Mr  Sutherland - standing  up  and   saying

that,   on  behalf  of  the  English  expatriate

community, he deplored our desire for  immediate

self-government, and he voted against it and  is

working  against  it. Are they being  submerged,

even in the minor processes of democracy that we

have,  much though we may deplore the fact  that

those  who find their prosperity from the people

of  the  country should work against the deepest

urges  of  those very people? Sir, we must  have

faith  in the basic decency of all human beings.

I  ask the Asian minority races of Singapore not

to   give  way  to  any  emotional  feelings  of

apprehension, to have faith in the value and  in

the  triumph of parliamentary democracy. I would

like  to  say  in  this  connection  that  I  am

particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



proud,  Sir - if you catch his eye - that  my  loyal

friend  and colleague the Hon. the Minister  for

Local  Government,  Lands and  Housing  will  be

supporting   this   motion  wholeheartedly   and

seconding it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, on the second part of my motion. I

ask for the appointment of a Committee. You see,

Sir, many issues have to be clarified. There  is

the question of the system of translation - it  is

my   hope   that   it  will  be  a  simultaneous

translation through electronic or other devices.

There  is the question of additional and  highly

skilled  staff; the question of the language  of

the official records; the question of amendments

to  our Standing Orders. Sir, there is no desire

at all for any delay - I can assure you - because  I

will  say  this:  that the draft instrument  for

amendment  of  the  Singapore  Colony  Order  in

Council, Sir, has, I am reliably informed,  been

forwarded   to   the  Regency  Council   and   I

anticipate that section 55 will be no more  very

shortly,  and  in fact even perhaps  before  the

Committee  has  had  time  to  report.   It   is

essential  that this House, when it proceeds  to

enforce  it,  should have it  with  the  maximum

possible efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that though hon. Members here

speak  English,  nevertheless to  some  of  them

English    comes    a    little    awkward - quite

naturally - and they would prefer to speak one  of

the  languages  which  I have  indicated  in  my

motion.   I   think   they  should   have   that

opportunity.  I hope they all should  have  that

opportunity. I trust that nobody would  seek  to

make  use of this motion for purposes of  public

propaganda or purposes of gaining votes, because

these  additional languages do add  in  a  small

measure  to  the inconvenience of the  Assembly,

and  I  am quite sure that all Members will  co-operate  in  seeking the comfort and convenience

of the Assembly. But, nevertheless, we ourselves

have experience that some of our hon. Members do

find  difficulty  in  expressing  themselves  in

English  and  would  be much  happier,  not  for

purposes of propaganda but sincerely in order to

express  themselves better,  to  use  their  own

language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore formally move the motion that

stands in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that for

the purposes of oral debate the languages of the

Assembly should be English, Malay, Mandarin  and

Tamil;  and that a Select Committee be appointed

to examine, report upon and make recommendations

in respect of matters necessary to enable effect

to be given to the proposal.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to second the  motion  now

before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, when the Chief Minister

started  his speech, he said he was not speaking

as  the  Chief  Minister of  the  Government  of

Singapore  but  as the Member for the  Cairnhill

Division. Today, Sir, I rise in the footsteps of

my  Chief  Minister. I say  I  speak  not  as  a

Minister of the Government of Singapore, but  as

a  representative of a group of people  of  this

island who could be termed the minorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion has the unqualified support

of  my  people and also of the Party to which  I

belong.  Looking  towards the  immediate  future

while this island is about to enter the doors of

self-government and independence, one cannot but

concede  that there is a necessity, if  not  for

the   sake  of  national  pride,  at  least  for

practical  reasons, that the people of Singapore

should   be  given  an  opportunity  of  voicing

themselves in this Assembly in the language best

suited  to  them. For over a hundred years,  the

affairs  of  public bodies, like this  Assembly,

have been conducted in the English language.  It

may  well be for some to say that English is the

universal language of the world, but to me, Sir,

English  is  not the universal language  of  the

people  of  Singapore.  We  all  believe,  quite

rightly,    too,   that   apart    from    other

qualifications, representatives  of  the  people

should  have a certain amount of education,  but

it  is  one of the peculiarities of this country

that  there are still some who accept  the  view

that  a  person can only be educated  if  he  is

educated in the English language. Sir, there are

thousands   of   people  in   Singapore-Chinese,

Indians and Malays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



- who  may not know the English language  at  all

but   who  do  not  lack  the  ability  nor  the

education to become leaders of the community.  I

do  not  see,  Sir, why these people  should  be

barred from sitting as Members of this Assembly.

Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  take pleasure in supporting the  motion

before  the  House.  I wish the  Chief  Minister

would  not have taken credit for this motion  or

for  many Bills which have been passed  in  this

Assembly.  I would like to deal with  it  first,

Sir,  because  it has been stated by  the  Chief

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, multi-lingualism was debated on this very

Floor by the previous Legislative Council on the

28th  of January, 1955. The motion was by a very

intelligent  local-born  Indian,   Mr   C.   R.

Dasaratha  Raj,  and claiming  a  division,  the

voting for was:

<pre>

            Ayes



  Mr M. P. D. Nair (who is here)

  Mr C. R. Dasaratha Raj

  Mr Thio Chan Bee (of the Progressive Party)

  Mr Lim Yew Hock (who is here)

  Mr R. Jumabhoy.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is nothing new. It is the duty of

any  government  to lake up the threads  of  the

past in the interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malayanisation - this motion was moved by

me on the 18th of November, 1952. Those who wish

to  see  the report can have a look at it.  This

motion was accepted by the Government as a whole

and  an ad hoc committee was appointed under the

chairmanship of Sir Han Hoe Lim. This  has  been

further pursued by this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Labour Code - this was a piece of

legislation  which was prepared by the  previous

Legislative  Council. It was left  over  in  the

hands  of  the  caretaker  Government  to  bring

forward in this new Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, freezing of land values and the Master

Plan - a  lot  of time and labour was  devoted  to

these two subjects by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



previous Government. They were also left over in

the  hands  of  the  caretaker  Government.  The

matter  was  taken up in1953, and my friend  the

Member  for  Seletar (Mr M. P. D.  Nair)  on  a

motion  on  14th  December,  1954,  raised   the

question  of  land  acquisition  for  a   Second

Reading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the Employers and Employees

Bill. This was brought into this Assembly by the

Progressive  Party,  but what  we  have  is  the

policy label of the Labour Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is a Government Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Given by the Progressive Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is a Government Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> May I have the attention of the House, Sir, undisturbed?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Continue, Mr R. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I have enough of disturbance, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think I have no doubt

that  I must give credit to the Labour Coalition

Government for bringing in the Public  Security

Bill.  Sir, coming to the motion now before  the

House, as I supported before, so am I supporting

it  now  in  the interests of the  people.  What

should  be  the languages for this Assembly?  We

have  got  English. We, have got Malay which  is

spoken, not written, by almost all people.  Then

we  have  got Chinese. It is for the Chinese  to

decide  what language is to be used. As  far  as

the  Indians are concerned, the majority of  the

Indians in this country are Tamil-speaking - over

70  per  cent. The Indian community as  a  whole

will gladly support the Tamil language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Chief Minister unfortunately

brought  in the subject of racial disharmony  if

this   was  to  take  place -  it  was   only   a

possibility, he said - and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



he brought in Bombay also. Sir, I have just come

back from Bombay. The disturbances there are not

at  all  concerned with language. It is to  have

Bombay  within its own state. It  is  just  like

Singapore   should   go   to   Johore   or    to

Penang - something like that - but it has nothing to

do with language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, multi-lingualism has been practised

successfully  in Switzerland, and  there  is  no

cause  for disharmony in this country as far  as

the  Indians are concerned. As I have said, Sir,

the  majority of Indians here are Tamils  and  I

must  give them credit for the fact that in  the

partition days not a single case of murder  took

place in that area. So you will realise that the

Indians   have   lived   here   peacefully   for

centuries, even before the British came in, with

the other communities and they will preserve the

same state of harmony and peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is happening in India today? Even

though about ten per cent of the population,  or

even  less, is English-speaking, and even though

India  has gained independence nearly nine years

now,  the  English language is still maintained,

although  they have decided that  in  15  or  20

years' time, by a slow process, they can replace

it  with  the official language, Hindi.  On  the

other hand, the provincial languages are allowed

in all the respective provinces, that is, Hindi,

English  and  any other provincial  language.  I

think, when the Committee comes to consider  the

question of multi-lingualism, they will  take  a

leaf out of India's book for study and guidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what happens if and when a united Malaya

comes?  Well, that is for the future; what  will

be  its language? Many may argue that that might

wait.  I do not think why it should wait. Things

will  take  their own course.  Sir,  as  in  the

previous  Legislative Council, I  wholeheartedly

support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to support the motion on behalf  of  the

Liberal-Socialist Party. One of the  objects  in

the Party's policy is the introduction of multi-lingualism  in the Assembly, and in laying  down

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



policy we had in mind precisely what this motion

envisages, namely, that for the purposes of oral

debate, the languages of the Assembly should  be

English,  Malay,  Mandarin and Tamil,  it  being

implied  that  for the time being at  least  the

written  word should continue to be  in  English

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also add that I do not subscribe to

this  view  simply as a loyal Party man,  but  I

have  come to the personal belief that  this  is

not  a retrograde step, as some of us would like

to  believe,  but  a forward move  in  the  best

ultimate  interests of the country. As the  only

elected European in this Assembly, I have to ask

myself  whether it is right to maintain, as  the

only   vehicle   of  speech  in  the   country's

Legislature,  a  language which,  while  it  can

claim  in some sense to be as indigenous as  any

other (if we take 1819 as the starting point  in

Singapore's  history), is not  the  only  living

language on this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to this thought there must be added

another  one.  Secondary  school  education   in

Government   English  schools  was  very   badly

neglected until the old Progressive Party  began

pressing  for it in recent years, and  thousands

of  citizens have not had adequate opportunities

of  learning the language in which they have  at

present  to  be proficient should they  wish  to

play their part in public affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point then arises. In a country which

is  close to self-government, is it possible  to

resist the argument that it must have the  right

to choose the language or languages in which its

elected   representatives  shall   conduct   the

business of the Legislature? Common sense, quite

apart from sentiment, supplies the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to two objections which have been

voiced on this subject. The first one is that it

would   be  better  to  experiment  with  multi-lingualism, first at the local government  level

rather than in the Assembly. My own view is that

there   will   be  more  practical  difficulties

encountered  at the City Council level  than  in

this  House. Local government is concerned  with

more   detailed   matters,  and  even   personal

problems, than the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



Assembly; such things as unauthorised structures

and  frontages,  hawkers and sewage  connections

and  so  on.  Most of the discussions  on  these

matters take place in Committees and not in open

forum,  and I can foresee the danger of a  great

slowing down in the work of the City Council  if

multi-lingualism  is  introduced   without   its

difficulties  having first been  ironed  out.  I

have  had  some experience of these difficulties

as  a  Municipal Commissioner in an Indian  city

where  the  languages were  English,  Hindi  and

Urdu. We shall find difficulties in this House - I

have no doubt. We shall have, to some extent, to

learn new techniques of procedure, but I believe

the  snags,  whatever they may be, can  best  be

smoothed  out here first under the able guidance

of Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objection is that the introduction

of   multi-lingualism  will  tend  to  encourage

racial  consciousness and racial antagonisms.  I

believe  that, given the abundance  of  goodwill

which  exists  in  Singapore  and  given  expert

interpreters of the highest standard,  the  very

opposite  may  well prove to  be  the  truth.  I

believe  that, through spontaneous  translation,

we shall be drawn closer to the thoughts and the

outlook of those from whom we are at the  moment

shut    off   from   communication.   Lack    of

understanding  arises  from  the   barriers   of

language,  from  asking people  to  speak  in  a

language in which they cannot think freely,  and

from  maintaining  the exclusiveness  which  one

language imposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this motion and we ask for its

early  implementation, for it is the first  step

on  the road to finding out for ourselves and of

our  own  free choice the most suitable language

or  languages  to be the lingua  franca  of  the

future, a problem over which we must hasten, but

hasten slowly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated in this House in the Budget

session,   all  the  four  main  languages   and

cultures  are  needed to make up that  composite

thing  that  can be called Malayan  nationalism,

and  they  must be regarded as complementary  to

each  other  and not as existing  separately  in

water-tight  compartments. Where  we  have  gone

wrong is in the propaganda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



so  prevalent today - and I hope I give no offence,

as  I  mean  none - which postulates  that  Chinese

culture  and the Chinese system of education  are

the  exclusive property of the Chinese  and  must

not  be  tampered  with; that Malay  culture  and

Malay history are being deliberately obliterated;

and   that  the  English  language  and  European

customs,  predominant for many years  because  of

British rule, seek obstinately to maintain  their

predominance  amid a growing Asian consciousness.

The  antagonisms  which are being  engendered  by

this  propaganda are all the more intense because

there  is no single obvious lingua franca for  an

independent Singapore of the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay has claims, because it is the oldest

living  language  of Malaya,  is  shared  by  the

millions of our neighbours in Indonesia,  and  is

spoken  to  some extent by the large majority  of

peoples  living in Malaya of whatever  race.  Its

handicap  is that it has no common usage  outside

South-East  Asia  and  it  is  not  well   enough

equipped  for the expression of modern scientific

thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese, too, has claims, because it is spoken

by  roughly half the population of Singapore  and

Malaya, because of its long history, longer  even

than  Malay  or  English, and its great  cultural

heritage.  Its  handicap is that  it  is  not  an

indigenous  language, is used almost  exclusively

by  the Chinese people alone, and is not strongly

equipped to cope with modern science, although  I

believe  that this difficulty is to  some  extent

being overcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English has claims, because it is the language

of international gatherings and modern scientific

thought. Its importance is inescapable because of

its  contacts for us with the rest of the  world.

Its  handicap,  however, is  that  it  bears  the

stigma, rightly or wrongly, of being the language

of  the  now  nearly  defunct  colonial  era  and

because  its culture is foreign and imposed  from

without.  English is the present  lingua  franca.

Whether  it will remain so is not for me to  say,

but  so  long as English is the main language  of

international trade and commerce, and so long  as

Singapore is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



to   retain  its  proud  position  as  a  leading

international port - as indeed it must - it seems to

me  imperative that English remains the  language

of communication with the outside world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Tamil, if I may be pardoned for saying

so,   has  the  least  claim  of  the  four  main

languages, simply because it happens to be spoken

by the smallest number of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so let us recognise that the introduction of

multi-lingualism in this House, however desirable

today,  is a makeshift and not the most important

thing  we have to do. The Liberal-Socialist Party

considers that what we must do, and do  with  all

possible  speed,  is to make  our  people  multi-lingual  by giving facilities to learn  at  least

three  languages, so that they can converse  with

one  another  and understand one another  without

interpreters and earphones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us indeed keep the proposed multi-lingual

scheme down to the absolute minimum cost, so that

most of our funds can go into welding together  a

composite nation through multi-lingual education.

So  when the day comes to choose a lingua franca,

perhaps I may be pardoned for hoping that it  may

be English, partly out of sentiment no doubt, but

mainly because I believe the English language  is

the  greatest single living unifying force in the

world  today. But whether or no that will be  the

choice,  the decision must come from  the  people

themselves and not be imposed from without.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I had thought no  Member  of  any

political  Party would offer outright  opposition

to  the motion before the House, because it would

be  political suicide to do so - almost as  bad  as

saying, "I like the British!"



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I, too, like the British.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I freely admit - I was quoting the

Chief  Minister,  Sir, actually  in  his  initial

speech in this House - that, prima facie, it  seems

reasonable that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



locally-born people should not be debarred  from

being  elected  to this Assembly simply  because

they   do  not  speak  English;  but  the  Chief

Minister  himself has admitted that his proposal

is  bristling with difficulties. If  we  examine

the  motion, what do we find? We find that  "for

the purposes of oral debate the languages of the

Assembly should be English, Malay, Mandarin  and

Tamil."  The records, notices, Bills,  etc.,  as

the  Member for Tanglin (Mr John Ede) has  just

said, would doubtless continue to be in English,

and   I  think  the  Chief  Minister  has   also

intimated  that possibly for a period  of  years

the  records might continue in English. In  that

interim   period  we  could  have  the  somewhat

anomalous situation of a Member being elected to

this  House and taking part in the oral  debates

but being unable to understand a single word  of

the papers passed to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister said yesterday that non-English speaking Ministers could have one or two

secretaries,   but  what  about   the   ordinary

Assemblyman?  He might find it rather  difficult

to  employ a secretary on his Assemblyman's pay - a   secretary   that  could  produce   adequate

translations of all the papers that come to  him

even  late at night for the next day's  sitting,

unless  he had a talented and erudite  wife  who

might do it in her spare time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, admittedly there might be Members in this

House who were merely not fluent in English  and

whose  oratorical powers were greater  in  their

own  language - I think there may be some such  in

this House today but on the other hand, a Member

might - in   the  interim  period  I  am   talking

about - be entirely illiterate in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what of the choice of languages

other  than English? If we must have  more  than

one language, then it seems to me that the Malay

tongue has at least the right of precedent.  But

the  statement made by the Member for Telok Ayer

(Mr  R.  Jumabhoy) and the Member  for  Tanglin

(Mr  Ede)  that Malay is spoken  by  the  great

majority  of the people in Singapore is,  in  my

opinion, quite wrong. I do not myself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



believe  that very many people in Singapore  can

speak  Malay at all. When I say that, I  mean  a

Malay  that  can  be used as a vehicle  in  this

House. If I may just introduce a little personal

note,  Sir? I was coming to the last sitting  of

this  Assembly two months ago and it was pouring

with  rain.  My  syce turned  to  me  and  said,

"Banyak hujan, tuan." I thought now, let us see.

I wanted to say, "Well, of course, there will be

a lot of rain, it is the North-east monsoon just

now. What do you expect?" So I said. "Oh, Betul,

sekarang angin dan Utara-Timor." He turned to me

with a blank face, so I thought that that was no

good.   I   then   came  into  the  Commonwealth

Parliamentary Association room here - I  am  sorry

that  the  Member for Telok Ayer is not  in  his

place - and I said to Mr R. Jumabhoy, "You  speak

Malay?"  He replied, "Of course, I speak Malay."

So  I  asked him, "Well, what is 'Northeast'  in

Malay?"  He  replied, "Oh, I do not  speak  that

kind  of Malay!" Then I approached the Hon. the

Financial Secretary who I thought must, at least

as a civil servant, speak reasonably good Malay,

and  I  said to him, "Mr Hart, what is  'North-east'  in  Malay?", and he said, "Oh, I  do  not

know."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. I do

regret     interrupting     these     delightful

reminiscences, Sir, but may I draw the attention

of  the House to the rule that no aspect of  the

conduct of a Member outside the House should  be

referred to in the House, and although  it  does

not  really  matter  at  the  moment,  it  is  a

principle, Sir, and it should be adhered to?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Chief Minister indicate

which Standing Order he is referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, it

is  31  (9).  I should like clarification,  Sir,

because I have myself constantly refrained  from

the references,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



thinking that we cannot say what a Member of the

House did outside.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That Standing Order reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the

Assembly shall not be referred to except upon  a

substantive motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hardly think that what a Member said or tried

to  say  in  respect  of the Malay  language  is

personal conduct! Mr Sutherland.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I regret the interruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. Of

course,  I could have refrained from using  the

actual  names of the people. It was just  giving

verisimilitude  to my story. Anyway,  if  I  may

finish  it - the hon. Gentleman whom  I  mentioned

last  came back to me, having contacted a  Malay

and he said, "The word is Tenggara." Sir, I went

back  that  evening and looked up my  dictionary

and found that Tenggara is South-east!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we must have another language, then I

should have thought the Malay tongue would  have

some  right  of precedence for obvious  reasons;

but   I   really   see  no  valid   reason   for

complicating matters by introducing Mandarin and

Tamil.  And  why  Mandarin?  If  this  were   an

entirely Chinese Assembly, then I could see some

reason  for  wishing to synthesize  the  various

Chinese  dialects,  but the Assembly  is  multi-racial. Sir, I know many people - not Chinese,  of

course -  think  that acquiring  a  knowledge  of

Mandarin is quite a simple thing. They know that

the  written ideograph is universally understood

and  they imagine that, by a little modification

of  the  tones and adjustment of a  few  hundred

vocables,  then anyone, for example, a  Hokkien,

can,  with  very little trouble, speak Mandarin.

But it is not nearly as simple as that. Sir,  it

is  true that Mandarin is more widely understood

today  than it was 20 years ago, but  there  are

tens of thousands of Chinese in this island  who

do  not  understand a word of it.  To  tell  the

truth, I was quite astonished yesterday to  hear

the  Chief  Minister say that  most  Chinese  in

Singapore thought it would be their truly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



representative  Chinese language.  To  my  mind,

that  sounded  like a statement of  the  Chinese

Chamber of Commerce!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a mono-lingual Member or Minister can

have  a secretary or two secretaries, then I  do

not really see why we should not have one or two

extra   translators,  and  instead   of   having

Mandarin  we could have Chinese Members speaking

in Fukienese or Cantonese or Hainanese or any of

the  other dialect; and in this motion, for  the

word  "Mandarin" we simply substitute "Chinese".

It seems to me, as it refers to oral debates why

only   have  Mandarin?  Most  of  them  do   not

understand it. Spoken Mandarin is not the mother

tongue  of more than a handful of local  Chinese

and  there  is  no doubt, to my mind,  that  the

epigrams  of our hon. and learned Friends  would

certainly   be   susceptible   of   far   better

translation into local dialects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess, Sir, that you may wonder

whether I am supporting this motion or no. I  do

not feel very strongly about it. Epitomising  as

I  do,  at  least  in  the  mind  of  the  Chief

Minister,  the  Colonel Blimps of  Singapore,  I

certainly do not wish to unleash on their  heads

the  fateful lightning of his terrible  rhetoric

and  in  that connection he certainly stole  the

thunder   of  the  P.A.P. yesterday  with   his

references   to   "the   vulture   clutches   of

colonialism"  and "the dead hand of colonialism"

and  his series of stinging indictments  of  the

colonial  regime.  Only  the  Communists  scored

higher  marks than my people yesterday. What  is

the  point,  Sir,  of whipping  oneself  into  a

passion over these matters? I said it once and I

will say it again - there has been no subjugation

of  races in this island. Apart from the Malays,

the  forbears of all Singaporeans came  here  of

their  own volition. In my opinion, that is  all

there is to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend in this motion to be again

in  a  minority  of  one.  I  would  point  out,

however,  that English is as good a vehicle  for

an  Assembly such as this as one could have.  It

was  the Chief Minister who said that if  multi-lingualism does not become an accomplished  fact

in  the  near future, this island would  explode

like  a hand-grenade. That sounds like hyperbole

to me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also true to say that the language

of  the  very  nearly  ex-colonial  power  will,  of

necessity, always be widely used in this  island  as

long as we live by international trade. And if we do

not  live  by  international trade,  we  shall  most

certainly die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Chief Minister's remarks about

the Swiss Confederation. Although four languages are

spoken there, the people are a closely knit ethnical

unit,  and their four languages are at least all  of

the  Indo-European  group. The proposal  to  have  a

multi-lingual  Assembly  in  Singapore   is   indeed

without analogy in any other part of the world,  but

a multi-lingual Assembly will not necessarily mean a

Tower  of  Babel  unless - I am sorry,  he  is  absent

again -  the  Member  for Telok Ayer  becomes  unduly

obstreperous.  On the contrary, it will  be,  in  my

opinion, a quieter Assembly with Members' ears glued

to   earphones  and  listening  to  the   phlegmatic

translations  of  impassioned  speeches.  I  greatly

fear,  Sir,  that  the effect  of  this  motion,  if

carried,  will be to render many debates  in  future

completely sterile.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  confess  that  I hesitated  before  rising  to

support this motion, because I am afraid that  there

may be some observation from both sides of the House

that  this motion will be of much benefit to  me.  I

must  admit that I am one of the few among the  hon.

Members in this House who cannot speak fluently  the

Queen's English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I

borrow a sentence that has quite often been used  by

the  Chief Minister? "Today is a great day  for  the

people of Singapore!" This was in my mind when  this

motion  was  brought up introducing multi-lingualism

into  this House for the purposes of oral debate.  I

believe  this  is  a  great  step  forward  in   the

democratic process in this country, because for  the

first  time  the  Malay, Indian, and Chinese  ketuas

will  have a chance to present their views  in  this

House  if  they are lucky enough to be elected.  The

leaders of these three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



communities  will  know that their  contribution  is

wanted.  Therefore, I sincerely hope that  not  only

will   the   25  elected  Members  in   this   House

wholeheartedly support this motion, but that the ex-officio Members and the nominated Members will  also

follow  the  step  which  the  Chief  Minister  took

yesterday when he said that he moved this motion not

as  the  head of the Government but as the  people's

representative of Cairnhill. And he  (the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister), I wish to remind the whole  House,

is the representative of the minority of minorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy that this motion is supported by

the leader of the only communal political Party, the

U.M.N.O.,  the  Member for Ulu  Bedok  (Inche  Abdul

Hamid Bin Haji Jumat). I can go further. This motion

also  gets support from the Member for Tanglin  (Mr

Ede) and the "Member for Tanglin Club", the hon. Mr

Sutherland. Sir, with your permission, I  must  say,

because many a time the hon. Mr Sutherland has been

accused  by  the  P.A.P. gang  as  the  "Member  for

Tanglin Club" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Point of order, Sir. Does the

hon. Member understand the word "gang"?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is hardly a point of order!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And whether it is proper to

refer to hon. Members in this House - once they are in

this House anyway - as a gang? They are quite unarmed!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order is whether the

word "gang" is or is not in order. I have been under

the   impression  that  the  hon.  Member  has  been

speaking with his tongue in his cheek, and  if  that

is  so, then I do not see any objection to the  word "gang".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. But this time I cannot not say that I

am not going to support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



the  statement  that  the  hon.  Mr  Sutherland

really  is the "Member for Tanglin Club" because

he  says  that Malay is not the popular language

in this country, and he seems to deny that Malay

is at least one of the popular languages in this

country. Secondly, he seems to make out to be  a

linguistic expert when he says that Mandarin  is

not  popular among the Chinese. From  these  two

statements we could come to the conclusion  that

the hon. Mr Sutherland lives very far away from

the  people of Singapore. Therefore, I am  sorry

to  classify  him  as  the "Member  for  Tanglin

Club".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Point of order, Sir. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I did not take objection  in  the

first  instance to this appellation, but I can - I

think  quite  legitimately - consider  it  to   be

mildly  opprobrious and therefore I  would  like

him to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is it not appropriate, the

"Member for Tanglin Club"? [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. The point raised is

whether  or  not  the  expression  "Member   for

Tanglin  Club" is offensive or insulting  within

the meaning of Standing Order 31 (4). It depends

entirely on the context in which it is used, how

it  is  used and how often it is used. But  once

objection  has  been taken to  it  by  the  hon.

Member, I must rule that it does come within the

meaning  of  the Standing Order and therefore  I

ask  the hon. Member who is speaking not to  use

that expression again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission, when I address Mr Sutherland as the

"Member  for Tanglin Club", I have in  mind  the

fact  that  he is a European expatriate,  and  I

believe all the members of the Tanglin Club  are

European expatriates - hence  he  is  the "Member for  Tanglin  Club".[Interruption.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. The hon. Member

must  remember  that  that expression  has  been

ruled out. It must not be used again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry. I will

withdraw  the  word. Now I wish to  clarify  two

remarks  which  have  been  made  by  the  Chief

Minister's friend. First he asked, "What do  the

Chinese people know about democracy?" A platform

does  not  entitle  me to  claim  that  I  am  a

representative from the Chinese community alone.

I  cannot enjoy the privilege which the Hon. the

Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

can  claim when he says, "I am the head  of  the

U.M.N.O. and  I  represent the Malay  community

here." But I am a Chinese. I think it is my duty

to  defend all this - that when that friend of the

Chief  Minister said that the Chinese people  in

this country know nothing about democracy, he is

entirely wrong. The last election clearly proved

that  the  Chinese in this country are the  most

non-communal-minded voters. They voted according

to  their  conscience. They elected their  truly

respected   leaders.  You  can  see   that   for

yourselves on the Government Front Bench. Is  it

because  the Chinese outnumber the other  races?

No!  Take the representative from Cairnhill, the

Hon. the Chief Minister. He is a minority among

the  minorities, and, as I have said, yet he was

voted  in.  And  the majority of  the  Cairnhill

voters   belong   to   the  Chinese   community.

Therefore  I  strongly object to the information

which  the  Chief Minister has given to  us - that

the Chinese know nothing about democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of personal

explanation,  Sir,I did not  associate  myself

with that opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am well aware that the

Chief Minister did not believe that, but I  only

want  to clarify it, that is all. Secondly,  the

same gentleman said that the Chinese schools  in

Amoy  are exactly the same as in Singapore. That

has   also  no  foundation  at  all.   In   this

connection,  I think the Hon. the  Minister  for

Education can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



give us a very clear picture. The curricula  and

the  textbooks  in  Amoy are entirely  different

from those in Singapore. These are the only  two

points  I  just  wish to clarify  as  a  Chinese

representative.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to support the motion moved by the  Hon.

the   Chief  Minister.  Today,  Sir,  with   the

introduction of this motion moved by  the  Chief

Minister, the Labour Front, with the aid of  its

Coalition  partners, is seeking  to  fulfil  yet

another  promise that it has made to the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak today not as a Member of the

Government  but as one who has been  elected  by

all  communities in the Stamford  Division.  The

majority  of the voters in the Stamford Division

are  Chinese, and I can say rightly,  Sir,  that

they  do  not have the faintest idea of swamping

the other communities, but that they believe  in

the  democratic  process and the  party  system.

That was shown in the last election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though I have been elected by all

communities,  yet - and I do not  want  it  to  be

misunderstood - I must say that  I  have  been  in

close   contact  (it  is  natural)  with  Indian

opinion in Singapore, and though the Indians are

in  the minority, I can safely say, Sir, so  far

as  I have heard, their opinion is that they are

all in support of this motion, and that they are

happy  and willing to co-operate that  Tamil  is

going  to  be  chosen as the  language  for  the

Indians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the people of Singapore must be

happy at the freedom that will be given to  them

from  the restrictive shackles of being confined

to  one  language. Today, Sir, the doors of  the

Assembly  are  going to be opened to  those  who

have   the   ability,  but  because   of   their

limitation of the knowledge of English, they  do

not  qualify to sit and legislate on  behalf  of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with due respect to the Member for Telok

Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy), I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



wish  to refer to one or two points that he  has

made. Sir, my principle has always been to  give

credit  where  it is due. Quotations  have  been

given to us of legislation that was pending when

the  last Legislative Council was dissolved, and

therefore it was stated that it was no credit to

this Government to have carried forward the same

legislation. Sir, there is one vital difference,

and  that is that many of the measures, like the

Labour Code, have been brought to this House  by

the  present  Government with vital  changes  in

them,  so  that the whole tone of these measures

has  been changed. Sir, it was thought that  the

credit should be taken away from this Government

and  that its efforts should be belittled.  But,

Sir,  the  last  Legislative  Council  had   the

opportunity  to discuss this subject  of  multi-lingualism   and  only  one  Member   from   the

Progressive  Party voted in favour of  it.  Sir,

they  had the chance to throw the doors open  to

everyone  in Singapore who had the ability,  but

they did not take that chance. Sir, I do believe

that credit must be given where it is due, and I

say,  Sir,  that this credit should  go  to  the

Labour  Front and its partners for  bringing  in

this measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Sutherland made the point

that    after    multi-lingualism    has    been

established,  the papers will still  be  in  one

language and therefore many Members will fail to

understand  one  word of it. Sir,  that  is  the

reason  why  the Chief Minister is  recommending

the  appointment of a Committee to go  into  the

question thoroughly, and if it feels that it  is

necessary,  it  can recommend  the  creation  of

posts  for translators and so on, so that  there

will  be  adequate  translation  facilities  for

Members who cannot understand English.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the speeches that I have heard this morning

make  me more than convinced that we should  not

delay  the  introduction of multi-lingualism  in

this Assembly. In our cosmopolitan Singapore the

lifting  of  the restriction on the use  of  the

English language only in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



Legislative Assembly will go a long way  towards

making  future elections to this Assembly  truly

representative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language restriction, in effect, has

created two classes of citizens. Those who speak

English fluently are able to vote and also stand

for election, and those who cannot speak English

or  speak English with insufficient fluency  are

able  to  vote  but  are  not  qualified  to  be

elected. Such a form of government which divides

the  people of Singapore must be done away  with

as  soon  as possible. There are among us  many,

many  loyal  and able citizens who are  educated

either  in Chinese. Malay or Tamil and who  will

no  doubt make as good legislators as those  who

speak   English,   if   they   are   given   the

opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope that all hon. Members of this

House  will, without hesitation, rise to support

the motion moved by the Hon. the Chief Minister,

who  has  the  good intention  of  giving  equal

justice to all races.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  the Labour Front stood for  election

last  year,  it had, as its aims and principles,

the  provision  of multi-lingual  facilities  in

this Government and local councils. Today we see

that this aim is achieved by having before us  a

motion  to  introduce four  languages  for  oral

debates.  I should say that this is due  to  the

efforts of the Chief Minister and his delegation

that went to the United Kingdom recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country is a country with many

nationalities, and several languages are spoken,

including   many   dialects   of   the   several

languages,  and if this Assembly is supposed  to

be a representative body of all people, then the

languages of all people should be spoken in this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many arguments have been put forward by those

who opposed the introduction of multi-lingualism

before  the elections, and the reason  why  they

opposed  it  was because they feared  that  much

time  would  be wasted in the interpretation  of

speeches from one language to another.  From  my

experience recently at the Labour Front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



conference - though  I  am on  the  opposite  side

now - I feel that there is no interruption at all.

I   have   gained  a  lot  of  experience   that

simultaneous interpretation of speeches could be

carried out very smoothly, and the procedure  at

that  conference  was not at all  in  the  least

interrupted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large majority of our younger generation do

not  have an English education, but, as the Hon.

the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing  has  said, they are fit  to  run  local

government or central government. Why  bar  them

because of the language difficulty? Let  us,  as

legislators of this country, open the  door  and

pave  the  way so that when they grow  up  there

will be no language difficulty and they can take

an active part in the running of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a firm believer of democracy, I am pledged

to  the electorate on the platform where I stood

and I think that it is the duty of every citizen

here  and every Member of this House to  support

this motion. I strongly support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

want to flog a dead horse. Multi-lingualism  has

been  one  of  the big issues since  the  Rendel

Commission. It  has killed one political  Party

and  has  changed the whole complex of political

life  of  Singapore. But to get  our  historical

perspective right, I think it might  be  useful,

in  view of the disclosure of the Chief Minister

yesterday  that  he  wrote a memorandum  to  the

Rendel Commission, if we could get the facts  in

their  proper chronological order.  I  have  had

access to the Singapore Standard library  and  I

have  with me here a file of all the letters  to

the  Press, news reports and memoranda connected

with  the  Rendel Commission. It  is  with  some

nostalgia that I look at some of these  reports,

for  I know the people who were responsible  for

these  reports and for the publication of  these

reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue was first raised by the Singapore

Senior  Officers Association in their memorandum

handed  to the Rendel Commission on the 28th  of

November,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



1953, and published in the Singapore Standard on

the 30th of November, 1953.



They said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Experience has shown that there is a large

element   of  the  population  who  are  British

subjects, who have been permanently resident  in

the  Colony  for  many years,  and  who  do  not

participate in the legislative processes open to

them  because  they  are  unable  to  speak  the

English language. On the other hand, there is  a

much smaller number of postwar emigrants who are

British subjects who have been able, because  of

a slight command of the English language and the

absence  of  any  residential qualification,  to

gain  an influence in local political activities

out of all proportion to their numbers and their

actual  ability. It is inconceivable  that  such

elements, known locally as birds of passage with

loyalties    elsewhere,   should    under    the

constitution  be  allowed  such  scope  in   the

political  arena; whereas others with very  much

better   claims  are  debarred  from  a   fuller

participation  in the legislative  processes  by

this language bar."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later member unions of the Council

of  Joint Action - a virile and vigorous  body  of

which I think the Hon. the Chief Secretary  must

have happy memories, sent in a memorandum to the

Rendel  Commission. It is like reading something

that  was  written  in  a  different  age.  This

memorandum  was submitted by the  Working  Class

Employees  Unions  of the Singapore  Government.

May  I read just the relevant passages? In  this

memorandum   they  explained  the   difficulties

against organised labour expressing itself. They

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a second handicap with which

organised labour has to contend. It is this: The

official language of the Legislature is English.

Since  the proportion of English-speaking people

in  the  Colony  is  very small - some  ten  per

cent - it  is  clear that the language restriction

serves  to confine political leadership to  this

small  section of the population. The effect  of

the  present arrangement has been disastrous  so

far  as the working class movement is concerned.

The movement has to rely for its leaders, or  at

least  as  its spokesmen in the Legislature,  on

members of the English-educated minority.  There

are two main Parties in Singapore - "



<br><br>This was then, Mr Speaker, 1953, -



<br><br>"the Progressive Party and the Singapore Labour

Party."



<br><br>They are both dead now!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first, namely, the Progressive Party, is,

to  judge  by  its  actions in  the  Legislative

Council  and  elsewhere, as  distinct  from  its

electoral  blandishments, the local  counterpart

of the Conservative Party in Britain, though,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



of  course,  it receives nothing like  the  mass

support  which  the  British Conservative  Party

enjoys. Organised labour recognises the right of

a  Right-wing  political Party  to  exist  in  a

democratic system, but it obviously cannot place

any  great confidence in such a Party to advance

the cause of the working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative at present open to the labour

movement  is  the Singapore Labour Party.  Grave

doubts  have  recently  been  expressed  as   to

whether  this Party exists other than  in  name.

Certainly  its activities, so far as the  public

is   aware,   consist  mainly   of   sensational

resignations, expulsions, charges  and  counter-charges in public of petty intrigues within  the

Party caucus. They have reduced the Party  to  a

state where it is regarded with open derision by

members of the public in general and members  of

the working class in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main cause of the deplorable state in

which  organised labour has found itself in  the

political scene of Singapore is clear. The  real

leaders of the labour movement in Singapore,  as

it  is elsewhere, are those who are thrown up in

the  evolution of the movement to  positions  of

leadership   by  their  fellow  workers.   These

natural  leaders  are, however,  prevented  from

active    participation   in    the    political

institutions of this Colony by the rule  in  the

Legislative  Council Standing  Orders  that  the

language  of the Council is English. The  result

has  been  to  give  scope  to  all  manner   of

opportunists  and  adventurers  who  speak   the

English language and who proclaim themselves  to

be  sympathetic to the labour movement. Some  of

these  have  contrived to obtain for  themselves

nominal  leadership of the labour movement.  The

result is only what one could expect, though  it

can  hardly be the one as is intended  by  those

who framed the present constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore urge the Commission, with all the

emphasis  at  our command, to make provision  in

the new constitution for various languages to be

spoken  in  the  Assembly. The difficulties  are

largely technical and may be solved by providing

earphones    and    translators.    Simultaneous

translations  of  speeches may  be  arranged  at

Council  meetings. For the paper work  necessary

in  the  management of public  affairs,  written

translations  could  be arranged  without  great

inconvenience or cost, and in Committee meetings

the  services  of  a  few  interpreters  may  be

necessary.  It  is  a trite, but,  nevertheless,

true  statement that Singapore is a cosmopolitan

city  with  people of many ethnic and linguistic

origins.   The  participation  of  the   natural

leaders of the people in public affairs  of  the

Colony  cannot be achieved unless due regard  is

paid to the range of languages spoken here."



<br><br>And so they went on to ask:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The actual languages for which it may be

necessary   to  arrange  translations   in   the

Legislative  Council meetings are  a  matter  of

detail



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



which could be settled without undue difficulty.

We  suggest  that  the following  languages  and

dialects  be regarded as the accepted medium  of

expression  in  the Legislature - English,  Malay,

Tamil,  two  or  three Chinese  dialects,  e.g.,

Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January that year these Unions made oral

representations before the Rendel Commission.  I

remember  the  story  in the Singapore  Standard

dated 15th January, 1954:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demand for a multi-lingual Legislature for

Singapore was made in three languages  by  three

trade unionists at the first open session of the

Rendel  Constitution Commission at the  Victoria

Memorial  Hall yesterday. The unionists stressed

that  the  language barrier placed on candidates

standing  for  elections to the Legislative  and

City  Councils  was preventing genuine  workers'

representatives from entering the Councils.  The

three  workers' representatives - Mr K. M. Byrne,

Mr   A.  K.  Karipaya  and  Inche  Ismail   Bin

Bajee - declared that Singapore was being ruled by

an  English-speaking minority of ten per cent of

the total population."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how it began, Sir. Looking back now, I

do   not  think  that  those  who  drafted   the

memoranda  which they presented  to  the  Rendel

Commission  fully  realised the  depths  of  the

problem that had been facing Singapore all  this

while.  We have heard today how everybody  feels

that  the demand for a multi-lingual Legislature

is  reasonable and just. But for two years there

was  bitter and fierce opposition put up by  one

of   the  English-language  papers  and  backed,

unfortunately  disastrously for that  Party,  by

the English-speaking middle class. They went  to

town  with  it  and they were  thrown  out.  The

Progressive  Party  is  today  dead.  They  have

become  Lib-Soc.  They have become  Liberals  ad

lib.   They  now  say  they  believe  in  multi-lingualism and, with a touch of drama, they  get

their  sole  European-elected representative  to

come here and put forward in reasonable language

why  this  is as it should be. But  I  think  we

should congratulate the hon. Mr Sutherland  for

nailing  the  lie. He says he is not  afraid  of

what  will happen to him. He is not elected.  He

does not care. The others are elected -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. With

respect,  it  is  true  that  they  are  in  the

Opposition.  They  held  views.  They  may  have

changed  their views. To speak of  "nailing  the

lie",  I respectfully suggest, is not the proper

procedure under our rules.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> An objection has been taken by the

Chief  Minister  and  I  must  deal  with   that

objection. The objection, as I take it, is  that

the  use  of  the phrase "nailing  the  lie"  in

respect  of Members of this Assembly is  out  of

order.  I must rule that it is, in fact, out  of

order and should never have been used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is tiresome to listen to these finickity

objections  on  points of order - however  I  must

abide  by your ruling. However, I think  I  have

conveyed enough to this House to show that  what

really is behind this demand is a force of  some

300,000 people who have voted unequivocably  for

multi-lingualism. Everyone of us who has  to  go

back  to his constituency in the not too distant

future must have this in mind. So we have  heard

all  these  blandishments that nobody need  take

any credit for it - "I am speaking for Cairnhill."

"I am speaking for Stamford." "I am speaking for

Ulu  Bedok."  "I  am  not the  Government."  "We

represent the voters." But comes the Member  for

Stamford  who  says, "We must give credit  where

credit  is due." That credit, I think,  must  be

due  to  the few who work with these unions  and

who wrote that memorandum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of record. I have recounted the

beginnings of this issue. When they started  it,

they  did not realise that it was going to  grow

into such enormous proportions and reach a point

where  the  whole  political  structure  of  our

constitution would change radically.  When  they

wrote  this  memorandum,  they  had  in  mind  a

transitory   period  where  we  would   have   a

multiplicity of languages, hoping that the  time

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



come  when  we  would  all be  one  homogeneous,

linguistic  whole.  But ethnic,  linguistic  and

racial   forces  are  more  powerful  than   the

thoughts - rational and logical even  though  they

may  be - of  an  English-educated minority.  This

issue has brought forward real and deep problems

which we must face not tomorrow but now. We have

to decide for ourselves the basis of the society

upon which an independent Malaya is to rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, and, as far as I am concerned,

with  considerable  amusement,  the  last  ditch

stand  by  the  hon.  Mr Sutherland.  There  is

something  engaging  about  the  Scots - they  are

doughty  warriors and they go down fighting.  "I

believe  in  what I believe, and  I  believe  in

English. It is the best language and let us have

no  nonsense with North-East monsoons and  South-West  monsoons! We all know what we are  talking

about when we talk English, but when we talk one

of  these bazaar languages we get all mixed up!"

I  thought  to myself then - what great luck  that

this  Assembly should constantly be reminded  of

what it might have been if all those who had won

the  election  were those who had supported  the

point  of  view  of the hon. Mr Sutherland.  We

would   have   seen   a  wonderful   facade,   a

legislature completely divorced from the people,

and  without the slightest knowledge of what was

going  on in the hearts and minds of the people.

I thought to myself also then - what an incredibly

dangerous thing to have admitted - that a  hundred

years  of  British domination  had  reduced  the

Malay  language  to  such a  pitiable  state  of

disrepair!  It  cannot even express  "North-East

monsoon", and therefore we should abandon it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 70 million Indonesians in

Indonesia  have officially abolished  the  Dutch

language, abjured forever their desire to  speak

Dutch,  introduced a new language  because  they

hated  the Dutch, and still hate the Dutch,  and

are  actively  building up  their  language  and

their literature. This is a matter where I think

that white



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



men  would be wise not to rush in. If they  want

to  be friends with the local people, they  must

understand why they are and what they are.  They

must  know that there is one urge stronger  than

any other in Asia, and that is the assertion  of

Asians  in Asia and in the world. That  was  the

spirit   of   the   Bandung   Conference.    The

demarcation line there was not Communism,  anti-Communism, pro-Communism or non-Communism. There

was   a   bigger   denominator.   We   are   the

dispossessed.  We have been that  for  the  last

century. They said the yellow man was a  coward,

the  black man was a fool, and the brown man was

lazy.  One cannot expect these natives  to  work

democracy. What can one do with their languages?

In  Bandung, Asia and Africa symbolised for  all

Asians  and Africans the spirit of the new  Asia

and  the  new world. If the white man  does  not

believe that the yellow man, or the brown man or

the  black man can do it, they are going to show

it to him in a very swift and decisive manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, apart from the emotional symbols, the

paraphernalia  of  building up  a  coherent  and

cohesive  state,  there is the question  of  the

national  language.  It is something  more  than

just  learning about the North-East monsoon.  It

is  something which becomes part of the  way  of

life,  of  the thoughts of a whole  race,  of  a

whole people. That is why the Chief Minister and

his  kin  can go back to Israel today and  speak

Hebrew  after  2,000 years of being  chased  all

over  the world. They can go back to Israel  and

they  can  speak  Hebrew, which they  have  kept

alive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we take this step today, we must

understand  that it is irreversible,  unless  at

the  point  of the bayonet, and even that  would

not  work for long. We must remember that  there

are  deeper and wider implications and  that  is

why,  in  our  All-Party  Education  Report   on

Chinese   education,  we   could   not   confine

ourselves  to the problem of Chinese  education.

The whole thing is tied up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



with  what kind of Malaya we are to have, and  I

hope  the most constructive suggestion  made  in

this  Education  Report is that  which  provides

that  whichever stream of education  you  enter,

you should come out at the end of that stream in

one confluence. We have here a proposal that  if

a  boy  goes  to an English-language school,  he

shall   immediately  also   learn   his   mother

language. He shall do that for the whole of  his

school life. In his secondary school he will opt

for one more of the four languages that will  be

offered him - Malay, Mandarin, Tamil or such other

language as the Indian community will decide for

themselves,  and  English as the  first  foreign

language. Let us face facts. Pandit Nehru (and I

think  few non-Europeans can claim to  have  the

same  facility  of  expression  in  the  English

language as Mr Nehru) has said that every  time

he  speaks  in  the  English language  he  feels

ashamed  that  he  is a product  of  a  colonial

society,  that he has not a command of  his  own

language  as he has of English. We have  decided

that   no  boy  in  Singapore - and  we  hope   in

Malaya - will ever be in the predicament in  which

some  Members  in this House find themselves - the

products   of   the  English-educated   colonial

system. So this scheme is devised in order  that

whatever school a boy goes into - if it is  Malay,

he  will  learn two other languages:  if  it  is

Chinese,  he will learn two other languages;  if

it  is  Tamil or Hindi, he will learn two  other

languages. And we hope that, with the content of

the  textbooks and the whole approach the  same,

then  at  the confluence of the four streams  of

education  we will have a Malayan as homogeneous

as  it  is culturally and ideologically possible

in  a  multi-racial society. That is one of  the

most  difficult  and one of the  most  important

problems of Malaya, and the only people who  can

solve  that  problem are the  people  of  Malaya

themselves.  However much we may be  pleased  at

the European elected Member, however much we may

be  amused  by  the  European nominated  Member,

those  of us who are Asians and who are  elected

have   the  task  not  only  of  satisfying   an

emotional urge of the people but also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



of guiding that urge along lines which will lead

to  a  cohesive, structurally sound  and  stable

Malaya.  When Mr Sutherland said, for instance,

"Mandarin, they do not speak it! I know they  do

not!  I  know! I have been there and I know  it!

They   speak  Hokkien  and  Teochew!   ",   he

completely  failed  to  understand  that  it  is

something  deeper. It is a primordial urge.  The

East has said, "We shall assert ourselves."  And

one  of  the ways in which the East is asserting

itself is the rejuvenation of its languages  and

its cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here today in Malaya three main

cultural     and    linguistic    streams - Malay-Indonesian, Chinese and Indian. We  are  at  the

confluence of these streams. We have the problem

of  building up a nation just at the moment when

the three outside sources of these civilisations

have themselves blossomed forth as international

forces.  We  are trying to build a  Malaya  when

there is an India which is growing more powerful

and  more  industrialised every day. We  have  a

China  which is growing more powerful  and  more

organised  every day. And so with Indonesia.  As

for  the  six to seven million Chinese,  Indians

and  Malays in Malaya, we have to ask  ourselves

whether our paths lie in reverting back  to  the

lands  of  our forbears, or whether  our  future

lies  in  seeking some common way which will  be

acceptable  to  all  and  which  would  make   a

democratic  Malaya a thing to be  proud  of.  We

have  to  have  faith  in "unity  in  diversity"

because, if we do not believe that, then we will

have to despair and we will have to leave it  to

the gods. We do not believe in leaving it to the

gods.  We  believe in channelising, marshalling,

and understanding these forces in order that  we

can bring them together to build this Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Party, and I am not

speaking just as the Member for Tanjong Pagar - it

is part of the programme of my Party - believes in

multi-lingualism.  We have  said  in  our  Party

manifesto  that Malay will be the lingua  franca

because it is the easiest language; but we  have

also  said that Mandarin and the Indian language

(whatever language the Indians may opt for) shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



be   part  of  the  official  languages  of  the

country.  This  is  my Party's  policy,  not  my

individual  thought,  my  personal  quirks,   my

personal  idiosyncrasies.  We  believe   in   it

because  we  believe therein  lies  the  way  to

salvation.  I have great pleasure in  supporting

this motion with this one proviso-that so far as

the  Tamil  language is concerned, it should  be

opened   to   the   Indian   community   to   make

representations  to  the  Select  Committee   to

choose  some other Indian language  if  they  so

desire.  In  our  Report on  Chinese  Education,

signed  by  all the parties, we stated  that  it

would  appear  that  Tamil is  the  most  widely

spoken  language,  but that if  for  reasons  of

national  convenience they wish to  choose  some

other language for their children to study, then

it  should  be  open to the Indian community  to

make   representations  as  to  what  particular

language they wish to have in the Assembly.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a great Chinese philosopher once said,  "A

complete man blushes when credit is given to him

for  any  good that he has done." It is  perhaps

difficult  to  find a complete man  amongst  the

elected  Members. We will have to  look  amongst

the nominated Members to find a complete man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer, Sir, to one of the

remarks  made  by  the hon. Mr Sutherland,  and

that  is  whether  it  is  altogether  wise   to

restrict  the Chinese language to Mandarin.  The

older  generation of Chinese either do not speak

Mandarin  or  do  not understand Mandarin.  They

have   various  dialects  of  their  own-Hokien,

Teochew, Cantonese and others. I do not say that

Mandarin  will not be acceptable to the  Chinese

as  a whole, but to restrict the Chinese dialect

only  to  Mandarin  may mean excluding  a  great

number  of the older Chinese who might be useful

in an Assembly of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  one of the most brilliant speeches delivered

yesterday, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



Chief Minister reiterated his belief in "justice

for  all"  in  Singapore.  That  has  been  well

received by almost all sections of the people in

Singapore, and I do not think that there is very

much  for  me to add to what the Chief  Minister

already stated yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents have always told me that they

desire  this  Assembly  to  be  a  multi-lingual

Assembly,  so that more of them could take  part

in  the  public affairs of this Colony, and,  as

such,  I  am  bound to support  this  motion.  I

personally   believe  that  this  principle   of

"justice  for all" is very good for the unity  of

the  people  of  this country, because  it  will

enable them to build a united Malayan nation  in

the  very  near  future. I  do  hope  that  this

principle will stand for all time in any  future

constitution for Malaya and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the language for the Indians in

this  Assembly,  Tamil has been  recommended.  I

feel  sure that all the Indians will agree  that

the  majority of the Indian population do  speak

Tamil,  and that there will not be much  quarrel

about  this language being introduced into  this

Assembly. If, however, any other section of  the

Indian  community would make representations  to

the  Select Committee that a language other than

Tamil should be introduced, I am sure the Select

Committee would consider their representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the privilege of supporting this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

policy of my Party -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Which Party?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - the Liberal-Socialist

Party,  the new Party that will have the support

of  all in Singapore, because it represents  all

shades of opinion and represents all races. This

is the Party that will be supported by all races

because it does not seek to depart -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, is this debate

relating to a Party or to the motion before  the

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> In answer to your question -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the hon.

Member  invited  those remarks.  Mr  Lim  Choon

Mong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I shall not dwell too much

on  that, Sir. I will get back to the debate. In

this  world today we fight for equality. We find

that  the  Western world have always  said  that

they  are  the  champions of democracy.  Indeed,

Sir,  we are also fighting for that ideal.  That

ideal,  however, must embrace  at  least  a  few

fundamental points. It must embrace  freedom  of

action  and freedom of expression. We do not  in

Singapore restrict people outside this  Assembly

from  speaking whatever they like to speak,  but

in this Assembly, however, we do confine them to

the  English language. Such freedom  of  speech,

Sir,  I  would say is not effective. It  is  not

what  the people want. The ideals of the people,

their aspirations, must be allowed to reach  the

masses,  to  reach  the  highest  of  Government

organs,  and it is therefore important that  the

people  of  this country should  be  allowed  to

speak  and  express their opinions in their  own

languages. Many people in this country feel that

there   are   practical  difficulties   on   the

introduction of multi-lingualism, but I ask you,

Sir, in whatever matter that we are starting, is

there  no difficulty? There must be difficulties

in  the beginning of everything. If we happen to

be  the  first  to meet with such  difficulties,

then we must have the courage and conviction  to

carry  on  and  overcome such difficulties,  and

make  the project work. We may not work at  full

efficiency  at  the  beginning,  but  it  is  my

hope - and I know - that in the end it will work.  I

know that this will come if it is implemented by

the  Ministry of Education. I have a  hope  that

one day we will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



able  to converse with people of all races,  who

comprise the population of Singapore and Malaya,

in  any language whatsoever. I have had a bit of

experience here and there, and I do know that in

Singapore today there are many who are  equipped

with  a knowledge of more than one language;  in

effect, they speak two, three or four languages.

Today  it may be possible for us to speak to  an

Englishman in Malay and make him understand  it,

although  he may not be able to express  himself

in  Malay;  and the Englishman may  be  able  to

speak to a Malay or a Chinese in English and the

other person may understand it, although he  may

not be able to express himself in English. It is

just another step forward whereby another person

may be made or persuaded to learn more languages

than  one.  I think it is essential that  multi-lingual  education should be introduced to  make

this   scheme   of   a  multi-lingual   Assembly

successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say, Sir, that every person in this

world    has   his   pride,   and    also    his

prejudice - pride and prejudice. I, let us say, am

a   European.  I  happen  to  know  the  English

language and no other. I therefore say that  the

English language is the best. If I happen to  be

a Malay, I am proud of being a Malay, and I will

say that the Malay language is the best. And  so

it   is   with   the  Chinese  and   the   other

communities. Such prejudices must be broken.  We

must  see  that we should have a more open  mind

and  that can only be achieved, Sir, by  knowing

the  languages of other races. If we should know

more  languages, we would be able to  understand

the cultures and the points of view of the other

sections  of the people that comprise Singapore.

If  we  should know and understand other people,

then  indeed, Sir, it would work towards a  more

harmonious Singapore. This, I believe, should be

the  aim  of  everybody inside and  outside  the

Assembly,  and in contrast to that,  Sir,  there

may  be people who want to champion one race and

make  that  race  hate another, just  for  their

political  ends  and  their own  selfishness.  I

think these people will do harm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



to  the  whole  nation. The people of  Singapore

must  recognise such leaders as people  who  are

not going to do them good but people who may, by

such action, cause bloodshed in the future.  Not

only  must  we unite the people of Singapore  by

language  and break the barrier in this cultural

life, we must also break the preaching of hatred

of  class. We must break the people who say,  "I

represented  the  workers.  I  wrote   all   the

memoranda for them. You must go against all  the

other  people  who are stopping us from  getting

what we should get." These people, Sir, are  not

actually giving the workers what they want. Just

as  they  are  going  to divide  the  people  of

Singapore by race, they will agitate the workers

to  go on strike and make them suffer, and  they

still call themselves champions. In Singapore we

want  harmony,  racial harmony, harmony  between

capital and labour. We must weld Singapore  into

one  strong  nation with only one  aim - that  aim

being  for the betterment of Singapore  and  not

for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back again, Sir, I would say that if

multi-lingualism is going to be introduced  into

the Assembly, then I think the Assembly will  be

able to get within its ranks people who are  the

natural leaders of the people. I have been going

round  the  whole of Singapore. I  have  visited

villages.  I  have visited shops  right  in  the

centre of the town, and I have always noted that

in  every locality there are one or two or  more

people whose opinions are valued, and they  are,

in fact, doing a great deal of work, leading the

people  there. Looking at Singapore as a  bigger

whole, Sir, I believe and I know that there  are

people  whom all Singapore respect, but  because

of  the  language barrier they cannot come  into

this  Assembly  to make their contributions  for

the  country.  It is not a loss to these  people

but  it is a loss to Singapore that we could not

have  the services of such good men. But  taking

away  the language barrier, I believe that  this

Assembly  will be filled by representatives  who

are  nearer  and  dearer to the  hearts  of  the

people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this motion

before the House which reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   commercial   television   in

Singapore  by the issue of an exclusive  licence

to  a  commercial undertaking without charge  on

public  funds  but  subject to  control  by  the

Government,



<br><br>I  wish to emphasise that this is not strictly a

Government policy and therefore hon. Members are

free to vote according to their convictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore today, by virtue of its strategic

position  in  South-East Asia, is  a  commercial

centre  and  is like a department store.  It  is

therefore  not  unnatural for the management  of

this  great  commercial house  to  decorate  its

frontage to attract customers and to display  as

many   attractive  goods  as  possible  in   the

interior. The management is you, upon whom  lies

the  decision  whether or not to modernise  this

attractive  city by providing, at no expense  at

all   to   Government,  this  modern   form   of

entertainment. Singapore is a modern city and we

must  keep  up with the march of time  in  other

countries where television is already  a  common

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will no doubt have read Sessional

Paper  No.  Cmd. 32 of 1955 in which  all  three

tenders   submitted  to  Government  have   been

published for information. The public have  been

given  two  months within which to submit  their

tenders and only three tenders have so far  been

submitted. From them, several factors are  clear

to  us. Firstly, it needs a large capital to set

up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



station without the slightest prospect of making

a  profit  at the outset. Secondly, the licensee

must have a supply of entertainment material  to

keep   its  programmes  popular.  Thirdly,   the

commercial value of Singapore will be boosted up

and  the  benefits to the public in the form  of

tourist attraction will be immense. As the House

is not asked to approve any particular tender, I

need  not go into the merits or demerits of each

tender  submitted.  It  is  clear,  anyway,   to

Members  of  this  House which  of  the  tenders

reflects seriousness of thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advocating the acceptance in principle of

commercial  television in Singapore,  I  am  not

unaware   of  the  opposition  to  an   entirely

commercialised operation. The main objection  to

such   an   undertaking  is  that  a  commercial

television  firm  will not  be  able  to  resist

attempts by advertisers to advertise their goods

at  programme time when viewers are not  at  all

interested   in  such  advertisements,   thereby

sacrificing programme content to the control  of

commercial  interests  without  regard  to   the

general  benefits  accruing to viewers.  Surely,

the operators are alive to this prospect and  it

is  in  their own interests to ensure  that  the

likes  and  dislikes of the general  public  are

treated with priority instead of their having to

bow to the whims and fancies of advertisers.  On

this  matter,  it may be argued that  the  Press

accept    advertisements   but    they    remain

responsible   for  their  news   and   editorial

columns. Cinemas show advertisements during  the

interval  but their programmes are not sponsored

by  advertisers.  It  has  been  argued  that  a

private  company cannot remain unbiased  in  the

field of politics, but against this there is the

proviso  that  in matters of public  policy  the

Government  has control over them.  The  company

will  not  be  allowed  to  put  forth  its  own

political or religious views to the public as is

done in the United Kingdom. Government will  see

that this policy is strictly adhered to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the objection that with this most

powerful means of mind influencing in the  hands

of  an unscrupulous undertaking, caution will be

thrown  to the winds and we will see only  trash

entertainment,  such as gangster  films,  cowboy

pictures  and  the  like. It is  suggested  that

during   electioneering  campaigns, commercial

undertakings might flash across the T.V. screens

pictures of certain candidates in whom the  T.V.

owners  are  interested. It is because  of  such

possibilities that Government retains control in

matters of public policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another safeguard against this is by way of

legislation  which prohibits such programmes.  I

wish  to  draw the attention of hon. Members  to

the  United  Kingdom  Television  Act  of  1954.

Section 3 of the Act ensures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That nothing is included in the programme

which  offends against good taste or decency  or

is  likely to encourage or incite to crime or to

lead  to  disorder or to be offensive to  public

feeling   or   which  contains   any   offensive

representation  of  or  reference  to  a  living

person."



<br><br>It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the programmes maintain a proper balance

in  their  subject  matter and  a  high  general

standard of quality;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That any news given in the programmes in

whatever form is presented with due accuracy and

impartiality;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the programmes broadcast from any station

or  stations  contain a suitable  proportion  of

matter  calculated to appeal especially  to  the

taste  and  outlook  of persons  served  by  the

station or stations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That due impartiality is preserved on the part

of  the  persons  providing  the  programmes  as

respects  matters  of  political  or  industrial

controversy   or  relating  to  current   public

policy."



<br><br>Sub-section (4) further says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That items designed to give publicity to the

needs   or   objects  of  any   association   or

organisation   conducted   for   charitable   or

benevolent   purposes,  reviews   of   literary,

artistic  or  other publications or  productions

including  current entertainments  will  not  be

treated as an advertisement."



<br><br>Legislation of this nature will make it possible

to   appoint  Advisory  Committees,  to   advise

against  any  offensive  religious  matters,  to

advise     Government    as    to     misleading

advertisements,  and to give advice  as  to  the

principles to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>

followed in connection with the broadcasting  of

suitable  programmes intended for  children  and

young persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom it is the Government

which  supplies all the equipment necessary  for

transmitting television, thus incurring  capital

expenditure, but in Singapore we are only  asked

to  approve in principle an exclusive licence to

a  commercial undertaking which will supply  its

own   equipment  and  bear  all  the   recurrent

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the value of T.V. is the

cultural  and educational side of the programme.

In  this, the Government will certainly make use

of  the  free  time  allotted for  cultural  and

educational programmes. This is a form of visual

aid  to  education  which is entirely  different

from  a  radio broadcast. I do not mean  to  say

that educational programmes are an answer to the

many problems facing us as regards the education

of  our  young  ones but they  are  at  least  a

supplementary to what they are already learning.

Any  visual aid to education conducted on proper

lines  and based on a Malayan background can  be

very   useful  to  youths  to  supplement  their

knowledge. Cultural shows depicting the  several

cultures  of  the Malayan races  that  form  the

population of this country can be systematically

put  across the television screen, thus bringing

to  life  the  various  aspects  of  culture  of

educational  value which cannot be  depicted  by

the radio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television incorporates, I understand, two

systems of transmission, one by sound and one by

signal.  In  times of war, any  message  by  the

signal  system can be flashed across the  screen

without fear of being picked up by the enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the principle in granting a licence to a

commercial undertaking is accepted by the House,

Government  will  assume the  responsibility  of

ensuring  that  the  wishes of  this  House  are

carried  out  by the licensee. It will  then  be

necessary to enact legislation, part of which  I

have read out just now, so that provision can be

made  to  control the nature of the  programmes,

advertisements, etc. Sir, I beg to move

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

that  it  is the Minister for Education  of  the

Labour  Front Coalition Government and  not  the

Minister    for    National    Amusement     and

Entertainment  who is moving this resolution.  I

am glad to be reassured that there are people in

the  Labour Front who understand that television

is   one  of  the  most  powerful  weapons   for

influencing human minds, whether for good or for

evil.  There are times when many of those on  my

side  of  the House have despaired as to whether

there  are  such  people in  the  Labour  Front.

Recently when we heard that a teacher, who is  a

specialist  in  teaching mental defectives,  was

being  employed to reorganise the Labour  Front,

we  thought that things had come to a very sorry

state  indeed. However, we are amused  that  the

Minister  for Education has undertaken the  task

of putting forward to this House the proposition

that  this powerful weapon for the education  of

our young and old should be left to a commercial

undertaking. We have just published an All-Party

Education Committee Report in which all Parties,

fortunately, were able to arrive at a  unanimous

agreement.  The Committee agreed that  education

is  the  most  important  weapon  in  forging  a

Malayan nation and that it cannot be left to the

whims   and  idiosyncrasies  of  any  commercial

tycoon or groups of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister told the House

yesterday  that  seven million televiewers  were

glued  to their television sets whilst the great

statesman from Singapore walked across the world

stage  in  London.  I wonder,  Sir,  whether  he

realised  how  many  of those televiewers  would

have seen him walking across the world stage  if

there    were   not   an   independent   British

corporation which runs television -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And a commercial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And a commercial - we shall

come  to that by and by. The commercial  one  is

not  quite  so successful and I shall  give  the

reasons  for the resignation of one of  the  big

men engaged in the commercial undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am surprised that a Socialist Party

should put forward the proposition that a public

utility - and television is no more no less than a

public utility - should be handed over to private

enterprise.  I  have  always  thought   that   a

Socialist   is  one  who  believes  that   state

planning  and  control  would  bring  about  the

greatest benefit to the community as a whole. If

it  will  be to the benefit of the community  to

have this instrument become the monopoly of some

capitalists,     however     benign,     however

philanthropic, for fifteen whole years with  two

five-year  periods  for renewal,  why  does  the

Government run its own radio station and not let

a commercial tycoon run it? If it were not for a

colonial  power,  we would  have  had  a  public

corporation  by  now, and run it  independently,

instead  of making a mockery of the impartiality

with  which it pretends to manage Radio  Malaya.

But  we  shall  come to that by  and  by,  after

April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind this House that the way

in   which  this  television  scheme  has   been

presented  reminds one of the way in  which  the

Rediffusion  scheme was pushed  through  by  the

colonial  power. Tenders were invited, published

in  the  Press,  and were received.  Wires  were

going over private property before any Bill  was

presented  in  the Legislative Council.  It  was

opposed in the Legislative Chamber, but it  went

through.   Then,   typical   of   the    elected

representatives  of that pre-Rendel  era,  when

Rediffusion  held  its opening  ceremony,  those

"stalwarts" who tried to prevent it from  coming

into  operation, all joined in the felicitations

and the celebrations for the opening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, we have before us

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 32 of 1955 and  in  the

back page is set out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



"TENDER NOTICE T.V. STATION IN SINGAPORE". There

are  three  applicants, but,  as  the  Hon. the

Minister for Education has said, only one tender

was really submitted with seriousness.

One  was by Shaw Brothers. It was very short and

appeared  on  page  2. There  were  no  concrete

programmes and no concrete proposals. The second

was by Rediffusion, on page 3. The third was  by

the Cathay Organisation, on page 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be interesting for the House to know

that  the local Chairman of Rediffusion  is  the

same person as the man who signs himself for the

Cathay  Organisation - Mr Loke Wan  Tho.  Sir,  I

know  Mr  Loke personally, and I hope  he  will

understand  that  what  I  have  to  say  in  my

capacity as a Member of this Assembly in no  way

affects any personal regard I may have for  him.

But I think that it is unfair on the part of the

Minister   for  Education  to  slide  over   the

applications. What he says amounts to - "If it  is

a  matter of detail, you can trust us.  We  will

see  that it is done properly. After all,  there

is only one serious application, and we will see

that  it is given to the right man, and it  will

be done in the proper way."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the qualifications of the applicant are

set out on page 8 under five heads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Experience of commercial broadcasting.



<br><br>There,  Mr Loke sets out his experience as  the

local Chairman of Rediffusion Limited. He is the

only Asian Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Film Production and Distribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Early application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Newspaper Experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Civic Responsibility.



<br><br>Sir,  no  one, I think, would deny that  we  all

admire   civic   responsibility  amongst   those

members  of  the  community  who  are  fortunate

enough   to  have  been  blessed  with   wealthy

parents.  But I find it difficult to  understand

how  it  can  be  advanced as an argument  that,

because the applicant personally is a man of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



some  social  standing, he should  therefore  be

entrusted   with   this   powerful   weapon   of

propaganda - that it is safe - that he  himself,  it

appears,  will personally see to it that  things

are  done  in  a manner which will  benefit  the

people of Singapore. May I just read out two  of

the  qualifications  which  I  think  completely

disqualify the applicant:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(ii) Film Production and Distribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cathay Organisation produces and

distributes   films  in  Malay   and   Chinese

(Mandarin and Cantonese). It operates  a  film

studio  in Singapore and one in Hongkong.  The

Distribution   Department   of   the    Cathay

Organisation   also   handles   product   from

Britain, the U.S.A., France and Italy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that a T.V. station depends

to   a   large   extent  on  films   for   its

programmes,  and the Cathay Organisation  with

its  own film distribution facilities will  be

in  a  splendid  position to provide  for  the

needs  of  the T.V. station; its film  studios

will  also  be  able to provide programmes  in

Malay and Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge which this Organisation

possesses  of  film  production  is  knowledge

which  may  be  applied to the  production  of

live  shows for the T.V. programmes.  Moreover,

we  have the contacts with the artistes  whose

services will be needed for these programmes.



<br><br>Then:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(v) Civic Responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television, apart from being a medium of

entertainment, is also an instrument that  can

be  a  powerful  force in the  influencing  of

public  opinion. Before a licence is  granted,

Government   no  doubt  will  wish   to   take

seriously into consideration the civic  record

of  the  applicant. His record in  this  field

should  not  merely be judged by the  monetary

contributions which he has made to  charitable

objects, but it should also be judged  by  the

amount  of  personal service and of  his  time

which he has given to public work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection we would suggest that the

education  and  background of  the  applicant,

his sense of responsibility, his awareness  of

political,      cultural     and      economic

developments,   his   financial   and    moral

standing,  his  record  as  an  employer,  his

imagination  and  farsightedness,  his  record

with   the  income-tax  department,  are   all

aspects  of  the  applicant's character  which

must be assessed before a licence is granted.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a copy of an application for

a T.V. licence made by a certain Mr Williams on

behalf  of  the  Herald and Weekly  Times  Ltd.,

Melbourne. I think it will show the Government - I

do not know whether it is the Government that is

involved  or  just  the Hon. the  Minister  for

Education - that  this is not a  trifling  matter,

where  one  puts  in  an  advertisement   in   a

newspaper which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government invites schemes from the public

for the construction and adequate operation of a

T.V.  Station  in Singapore. Successful  tenderer

will be given an exclusive operating licence  on

the following general terms subject to contract.

Put in your application.'



<br><br>In  this application in Australia, there  are  a

series  of questions which ask the applicant  to

lay  bare  all  the  possible factors  that  may

influence  his running of a T.V. Station.  There

are  fifteen questions and they occupy the whole

book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) State whether application is made on

behalf  of  an  individual,  partnership,  or

company,  or  company  to  be  formed,  or  a

combination of interests:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If application is made by a company, state

where incorporated. Attach a copy of Memorandum

and  Articles of Association and furnish full

details of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Financial position including

balance  sheet  and copy  of  Profit  and

Loss   Account   and  Profit   and   Loss

Appropriation Account for the  last  five years:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Shareholders including address and

occupation of each...;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Names and occupations of directors

and   names  of  principal  officers   of

company,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Association of the applicant or any

director or principal officer in any way with

any of the following businesses:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Broadcasting, including

production of programmes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Newspaper;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Advertising;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Theatrical management and

production;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Motion pictures, production,

processing,     distribution      and exhibition;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Manufacture or distribution of

radio  and  television  equipment  or

receivers;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Association of any shareholder of

more  than five per cent of the shares  in

the   company   of   any  other   business

specified in paragraph (d)."



<br><br>Even  a  shareholder having more than  five  per

cent  of  the  shares  of the  company,  who  is

connected  with  any of these  businesses,  must

declare it, because it is considered that anyone

who  is  connected with the cinema  industry  or

broadcasting or with any theatrical  performance

is  not  a  person  who can fairly  advance  the

interests of television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, seven million people watched the Hon. the

Chief  Minister in London. I was struck by that,

Mr Speaker, Sir, because it is this old idea of

the  mass man - people by the masses. But I wonder

how many would have been watching the television

screens,  their eyes glued to this little  movie

at  home,  if  there were not the programmes  to

sustain  that  interest. If people are  watching

television  at home, they are not likely  to  be

watching  pictures at the local theatre.  Cinema

attendances  are falling off in  Great  Britain,

and  the  cinematograph world has answered  with

3D, 3D Sound, Vista Vision, and CinemaScope. It

is  a  challenge  to them. Sir,  it  is  in  the

interest  of  cinema  exhibitors  to  drive  the

people from their homes into the cinemas and not

to  attract  them  from the cinemas  into  their

homes, and I should have thought that that alone

completely disqualifies all the three tenderers,

including  Rediffusion which is  connected  with

broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Minister for Education has

said  that  a person who runs this T.V.  Station

would  probably lose money and here  we  have  a

philanthropic organisation that is  prepared  to

lose  money.  I am a charitable man  by  nature,

Sir. I  like to believe that people  do  things

with charitable motives. But there are limits to

human  charity. Nobody runs a T.V. station  for

fifteen  years at a loss after a capital  outlay

estimated by the Hon. the Minister for Education

at some $5 millions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I never said that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it five? I think it is in

the application form - ah, yes, it is $3 millions.

I  am  quite prepared to believe that the Cathay

Organisation   is   a   wealthy   and   powerful

organisation   with  limitless  resources,   but

people do not run T.V. stations for the sake  of

losing  money.  Either they can make  the  thing

work  and it pays money, in which case there  is

no  reason  why  a  Government department  or  a

public corporation should not do it; or if it is

going to lose money, then there must be a reason

why  they  are  prepared to lose that  money.  I

suggest  that  that reason is the protection  of

certain   other  interests - that  it  is  thought

better to lose some money here than to lose more

money  elsewhere if somebody else gets  hold  of

this  T.V. station. And the protection of  those

other interests is inimical to the interests  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Minister for

Education  has  referred to Government  controls

and  he has sought to emphasise that he will see

to  it  that  he  will introduce legislation  to

achieve this. He cannot personally see to  these

things but there will be legislation to see that

the  programmes  are  not of doubtful  standing,

that  they  are appropriate for young  boys  and

girls  and that they should have nothing  to  do

with gangsters. I congratulate the Minister  for

being   alive  to  the  dangers  of  T.V. being

misused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two commercial T.V. stations in

Asia.  The Americans are very proud of it.  They

built  both  of  them - one in Japan  and  one  in

Bangkok. I have the word of a personal friend of

mine who said that he had seen the one in Japan.

"It is unbelievable", said he. "You see trailers

and  you have got to go to a cinema to watch the

whole  of the picture; and you see all kinds  of

absurd  and inconsequential things." Well,  that

is  hearsay. But I do have some document to show

what  they do in Bangkok. It is a pity that  the

Far  Eastern  representative of R.C.A. did  not

pursue his invitation to this Assembly to invite

Members  to view his magnum opus in Bangkok.  He

at  one  time  suggested to the Hon. the  Chief

Minister, and later to the Common-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



wealth Parliamentary Association, that we  might

send an all-Party delegation to Bangkok, all  at

R.C.A. expense,  in  order  to   broaden   our

education. But the R.C.A. representative somehow

felt  that there might be some Members  in  this

Assembly   who  would  think  it   an   improper

suggestion  and so he decided not to pursue  the

matter.  I  have pursued the matter and  I  have

here  what is known as R.C.A. News dated  August

5,  1955, by Leonard S. Skoblin - I think  he  was

the  gentleman who wanted to do us a favour  the

other time and it says here:



<br><br>"R.C.A. NEWS

<br><br>No. 7.



<div align="center">TELEVISION IN THAILAND</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thailand Has Entered The Television Age.'

This  is  how  one of the leading newspapers  in

Bangkok started its editorial on the opening  of

the   country's  first  T-V  Station.  'The  new

medium', it said further, 'seemed to lend itself

well  to the Thai skill in showmanship and  love

of entertainment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first television station in Thailand, and

the first on the mainland of Asia, was opened in

Bangkok  by  the Prime Minister,  Field  Marshal

Phibul, on June 24th, Thailand's National Day."



<br><br>(I  could  imagine  a  similar  ceremony  opened here).



<br><br>"It  is  owned by the government-controlled  and

commercially operated Thai Television Company."



<br><br>Then   there  is  a  lot  of  blurb  about   the

modernistic  trends and beautiful  studios  with

air-conditioning that could be switched  on  and

off   independently.  Finally  we  come  to  the

programmes. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps one may best feel the reaction

through   reading  a  few  abstracts   from   an

editorial   of   another  Journal   in   Bangkok

previously critical towards television. In part,

it said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to extend to the newly arrived

Television  our  welcome and our  wish  for  its

success.   As   we   rapturously   watched   the

Television  Screen for our first  experience  of

Television in this country, we were awed by  the

technical  perfection of the  transmission.  The

figures  shown on the screen came out as  bright

and clear as we could ever wish for. There was a

sense  of magic in the atmosphere, as one always

feels when face to face for the first time  with

the latest development in modern science.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked forward to this first transmission

with  some trepidation. Realizing the importance

of  the  occasion,  we  were  resigned  to  have

staring  at  us  some  well-known  face  of   an

important  personage.  But,  instead,   we   had

smiling at us a young and comely wench,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



who  seems to be a perfect medium for Television

since  she could, without uttering a word, speak

quite fluently with her eyes alone... We were

simply  regaled with a "Hit Parade" of the  more

famous  jazz tunes and an item called  "Venetian

Night"  in  which a young man pleaded  soulfully

with us to "Come Back to Sorrento!" "Laurel  and

Hardy"  made  us chuckle with their  destructive

pranks,   and,   in  the  end,  we   were   held

spellbound  by  the  gripping  life   story   of

Dillinger.'



<br><br>(Mr  Dillinger, Sir, was a very famous American gangster.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Experts may look down their noses at the

programme and call it second rate. We may  agree

with  them on point of technical skill; but  the

spirit  of  the whole show was as mad,  as  non-consequential and as free as the United  Nations

Charter of Human Rights.'"



<br><br>Sir,  that is T.V. come to Bangkok. May  I  read

it? - "owned  by  the  government - controlled  and

commercially operated Thai Television  Company."

God   forbid,  Sir,  that  it  should  come   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know - I think it is general

knowledge - that British T.V. is the pride of  the

world. It is acknowledged that there is no other

T.V, station  in  the  world  which   produces

programmes   of   such  high   quality   without

interruptions  in the middle of a very  dramatic

scene  with  Kolynos Toothpaste, or Pepsi  Cola.

After  that they tried to launch into commercial

television.   There  was  a   long   period   of

investigation  and  survey. A  White  Paper  was

tabled   and  there  were  long  and   strenuous

debates.  I  know  the  Hon. the  Minister  for

Education has got the White Paper, but I do  not

know  if  he  has looked through these  debates.

Finally,  the Bill was passed with a great  deal

of  opposition from the Socialist Members in the

House  of Commons. They opposed it bitterly  and

they  still  oppose  it. Great  safeguards  were

included in the Bill to see that standards  were

maintained.   Recently,  a  man  called   Adrian

Crawley,  who  was in charge  of  the  News  and

Features   Section  of  this   commercial   T.V.

station, resigned and one of the reasons for his

resignation was that he was unable to resist the

pressure  of advertisers, and if he  yielded  to

the  advertisers,  he  could  not  maintain  the

standards laid down for commercial T.V.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all want television to come to

Singapore  but not at that price. We  feel  that

the proper way would be to have a Commission set

up   to   investigate   the   possibilities   of

introducing T.V. in Singapore to be  run  by  an

independent  corporation. Before we  can  debate

the  matter, there should be a report  by  those

qualified   to   make  such  a  report.   Expert

technicians, expert entertainers and  all  kinds

of bodies - political, religious, they are all set

out  here in this Australian application, if the

Hon. the  Minister for Education is interested - must  be consulted before the matter could  even

be  debated. We must acquaint ourselves with the

facts.  I  would  not  go into  the  merits  and

demerits  of it because I feel that we  are  not

properly equipped to argue the case. But  we  do

know  this: that the best thing to do is to send

it  to  some Commission - not to a Commission  of

this  Assembly - but to an independent  Commission

to  be  appointed  by the Government  which  can

include  amongst  its  members  experts  in  the

broadcasting world, in the entertainment  world,

in the news world and in the political world, to

explore  the  whole  field  and  then  make  its

report.  On  the  basis  of  that  report,   the

Government  might  table a White  Paper  stating

Government's    policy - not    any     particular

Minister's idiosyncrasies - and then we could  be

in  a  position, having properly deliberated  on

the  matter in our respective Parties, to  state

our Party view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with this in mind that I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the motion before this House be amended,

first,  by deleting the word "commercial' before

"television", and then by deleting the whole  of

the  phrase following "in Singapore" and  adding

thereto  "and  recommends that a  Commission  be

appointed   to  explore  the  possibilities   of

setting up a public corporation to operate it."



<br><br>The amended motion will then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction  of  television  in  Singapore  and

recommends  that  a Commission be  appointed  to

explore the possibilities of setting up a public

corporation to operate it."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am told

that there are some Socialists on the other side

of the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have just a minute to

consider the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member consider a

different   amendment  which  would   facilitate

debate? This amendment would be to leave out all

words  after  the word "of" in  line  1  and  to

insert  the  words "television in Singapore  and

recommends  that  a Commission be  appointed  to

explore the possibilities of setting up a public

corporation to operate it."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Certainly, Mr Speaker, Sir.

It is another way of putting the same thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would facilitate debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, I am much obliged, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not think that any

Socialist will deny that that is the proper  way

in which to embark on this public project. If we

are  to  avoid sex and gangsterism, then let  us

have  a properly constituted corporation to  run

it,  if  need  be  at  a loss,  for  if  private

enterprise is prepared to run it at a loss, then

it  must be worth the Government's while to  run

it at a loss. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it falls to

me, by ill-luck, to second an amendment which  I

should  otherwise substantially  have  moved.  I

sought to catch your eye but I was unlucky and I

have  to  come  second into  the  field.  I  had

intended   to   move  a  substantially   similar

amendment  to  omit all the words from  "of"  in

line 1 and substitute "a Committee to study



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



the  means of introducing television" but  I  am

happy  to accept the Member for Tanjong  Pagar's

motion in lieu thereof. I agree with a good deal

of  what  he  said, but there are certain  other

points  which I think will further  justify  the

appointment of a Commission or a Committee to go

into this matter and advise us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to point out that in the

original  motion,  we have  the  words  "without

charge  on  public funds". That  is,  no  doubt,

strictly   true  but  it  is  not  an   adequate

statement  of the case. The fact is that  public

funds and private funds are only two aspects  of

national funds, and although the Government,  as

a  Government, appears to give television  free,

the  country does not get it free. It has to pay

for it, just as much as or possibly more than if

it  was  paid  for out of taxation.  A  publicly

operated television station will be financed  by

direct  taxation. A privately operated one  will

be  financed  by  what  is essentially  indirect

taxation, that is, out of the profits which  the

commercial  operators make on their commercial

transactions. From these profits they  find  the

money for the television station. That is as far

as the financing of it goes - no difference in the

cost to the national funds - although the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  no  doubt  is  saved   the

trouble  of keeping accounts, as those are  done

privately.   That   is  the   main   significant

difference, and from that aspect the  Government

does  not have to bother looking after the money

side of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another significant difference

between  private  and public control  which  has

already  been  pointed out,  and  that  is  that

public  ownership  means  public  control  by  a

responsible  government, and  private  ownership

means   private  control  by  less   responsible

private  interests. This brings me to the  point

which  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  made  very

forcefully, and I would like to endorse  it - that

although  the original motion says  "subject  to

control   by   the   Government",   of   course,

everything in the country is subject to  control

by the Government in the last analysis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



But,  in  fact,  it  is  extremely  difficult  to

control  some things unless you have  the  proper

mechanism   for   it,  and  experience   of   the

Independent  Television Authority in England  has

not given any great confidence in the ability  of

a  government  to  devise  means  of  controlling

advertisers  in  their relations with  commercial

television. However, those are by the way; points

which have substantially been made already.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to elaborate on another point which

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar made.  He  pointed

out - what   was  obviously  clear  anyhow - that   a

commercial station operates for profit, and  that

if  they  do  not  make a profit  they  will  not

operate. Where the profit comes from and where it

actually  lies may not be obvious to the  man  in

the  street,  but, ultimately, there  will  be  a

profit; a future profit if not an immediate  one.

If  that  profit does not come about,  then  your

commercial  television will  collapse  underneath

you  and you will be left with some expensive and

idle  equipment  and nothing else.  But  we  will

assume that businessmen are good judges of  their

own  business  and  that a commercial  television

station  does run at a satisfactory profit.  That

profit can only derive from increased sales as  a

result  of  increased advertising, and  increased

sales  means  increased  consumption,  and   that

consumption is not of essential goods.  You  will

not  find  any commercial firm saying,  "Buy  Mr

Blank's  beautiful white rice", or  even  "Buy  a

North  &  Hillard Latin Grammar". What  you  will

find   advertised  are  the  luxury  goods,  soft

drinks,  cigarettes,  or  possibly  hard  drinks,

whisky,  possibly  cinemas, possibly  newspapers - all the things which, no doubt, are very nice  to

have - lipstick   or   nylon   stockings - delightful

things in their way but not essentials. They  are

luxuries. The increased sales largely take  place

in  the  relatively prosperous group,  and  every

luxury  consumption reduces the amount  of  money

available for saving. This is a serious point  as

the  people  in Singapore are not very  adept  in

saving.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They have not got it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would like to stress this because

saving   is  the  essential  basis  of   freedom.

Independence, freedom, Merdeka - all this is  going

to  be  largely dependent on whether this country

can  be  economically independent and if  we  are

going  to  achieve  economic independence,  there

must  be a very great increase in savings by  the

people of this country as a whole. Otherwise  you

are going to have to import your capital and your

imported capital means that you are dependent  on

foreign  control for a considerable part of  your

economy,  so  that  if  we  have  a  successfully

operated commercial station, it must succeed,  as

far as I can judge, at the expense of the savings

which  we  ought to make in order to finance  the

essential development of industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another effect which will follow from

successful  commercial  advertising.  It  is   an

effect   which  is  sometimes  praised   by   the

economists. That is the monopoly effect. A  brand

of  goods, a cigarette or a soft drink which  has

the   largest  allocation  for  advertising   and

employs the best advertising talent, will attract

the largest sale. It will drive off the market or

drive  into the fringe of the market other  goods

which are less well advertised because they  have

less  money available. In other words, the luxury

goods that have the largest capital backing drive

the  weaker  ones  off the  market  and  you  get

something approaching a monopoly situation which,

it   may   be   argued,  does   produce   greater

efficiency.  It  is an argument which  economists

make,   that   a   monopoly  situation   produces

efficiency. Whether we all accept that I  do  not

know,  but there is this point to make - that  in

quite a considerable sector of economy, I imagine

that  the  firms which will secure the market  in

television   advertising   are   likely   to   be

expatriate  firms  where the capital  backing  is

good,  where the technical skills are  good,  and

where,  through television, they can secure  much

larger   sales   for   things   that   are   not

manufactured  in  this country  at  all  but  are

imported.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, as far as I can judge, a commercial

television station is liable to tend to restrict

the  development  of  our economy.  Firstly,  it

strikes at savings which are necessary if we are

going  to develop locally. Secondly, it  strikes

at  the  development of small  local  industries

because  they are pushed off the market  by  the

big  overseas  industries. A further  aspect  of

that   is  also  that  there  may  well   be   a

considerable flow of wealth overseas to overseas

investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of technical points which

also need considering in relation to television,

both  as to the quality of the television  image

which  is projected and also as to the  type  of

programme  which is appropriate and feasible.  I

do not propose to enter into those points at all

except to say that they are very important,  and

do  need study and cannot be studied except with

considerable  labour and a good deal  of  expert

knowledge.  That  is why I am  anxious  that  we

should  have in this Assembly general  agreement

that we should look before we leap, and that the

enormous  accumulation  of  facts  relating   to

television and the enormous volume of  arguments

for  and  against  it should  be  studied  by  a

competent   body   of  independent,   able   and

impartial citizens who can put their findings in

the  form of a report on which we can reasonably

judge as to what is the right thing to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore very happy, Mr Speaker, to

second  the amendment put forward by the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original motion was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   commercial   television   in

Singapore  by the issue of an exclusive  licence

to  a  commercial undertaking without charge  on

public  funds  but  subject to  control  by  the

Government,



<br><br>since  when  an amendment has been  proposed  to

leave  out all the words after the word "of"  in

line   1   and  to  insert  therein  the   words

"television in Singapore and recommends  that  a

Commission   be   appointed   to   explore   the

possibilities of setting up a public corporation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



to   operate  it".  This  would  then  make  the

Question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction  of  television  in  Singapore  and

recommends  that  a Commission be  appointed  to

explore the possibilities of setting up a public

corporation to operate it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question now before the House is, "That

the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, in moving

the  appointment  of this Commission,  indicated

that  we  know nothing of the merits or demerits

of   the  proposal  and  gave  an  extraordinary

exhibition of a long speech

about nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, out of luck - and I think I must take

responsibility  for  the  paper  before  you - the

suggestion  for  television  in  Singapore   was

broached  many  months ago and it  attracted  me

because  it  was  obvious and  it  seems  to  be

generally  accepted  here  now  that  television

could  be an instrument for cultural fusion,  an

instrument  for a matter of which  we  stand  in

considerable  need.  Investigations   disclosed,

however, Sir, that the cost of installation  and

buildings would amount to between two and  three

million  dollars and that it was quite  certain,

however  efficiently run it  was,  that  in  the

first  two to three years there must be a  loss,

but  that if run efficiently it could thereafter

make  a  profit.  Sir, we are in this  position,

that  although  this  is  by  no  means  a  poor

country, we wish at the present moment to direct

all  our  available wealth to certain  immediate

needs  of  a social welfare character.  You  can

appreciate that Government is anxious - I  do  not

suggest that it is not in a position to do so - to

avoid  expenditure where possible,  particularly

expenditure of so large a character and  with  a

continuing  liability of an unspecified  nature,

and  also  having regard to the advice that,  if

undertaken    by    an   organisation    without

entertainment  experience, it  could  in  itself

become a fiasco. In those circumstances, Sir, it

seemed  to  me  that, if it  were  possible  for

private capital with experience in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



that  field  to  do the work subject to  Government

control, we should both have our cake and eat it. I

was   so  surprised  that  that  would  be  utterly

impossible  and fantastic, and that  if  Government

wanted  control it would have to subscribe  capital

and to partake of the liability for annual losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in those circumstances and in order to

ascertain whether the idea was feasible and  in  no

way  an  attempt to jump the gun, as seems to  have

been  suggested  by the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar,

that an advertisement was put in to see whether any

responsible organisation would be prepared to  work

with  Government on that basis. I must confess that

I  was delighted to discover, on the last day, that

there         were         three        responsible

organisations - organisations which  have  experience

in  the  entertainment world and which have  proved

themselves over many years in this country as being

capable of running an efficient enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to make some things clear, Sir,

in  the  matter of this original proposal.  If  the

original  motion is approved, then  it  will  be  a

matter  of  negotiation between a Committee  to  be

appointed  by  the Government and the tenderers  to

finalise the exact conditions under which a licence

would  be  issued. I think hon. Members are  aware,

and  if not I would like to make it clear, that any

such agreement would be submitted in the form of  a

Bill.  This Government is giving no monopoly  under

any  authority except the authority of this  House.

It would be submitted to this House for approval. I

would  like  to  say this, Sir, that  much  of  the

speech of the Member for Tanjong Pagar seemed to be

in  derision of the organisation known, I think, as

the Cathay Organisation. I should like to make this

very, very clear, Sir, that the motion itself  does

not  suggest,  nor is it intended  that  it  should

suggest,  that any of the tenders are  accepted  in

their  present  form. I think the motion  is  quite

clear,  Sir,  in pointing out that  there  will  be

absolute  Government control, and,  secondly,  that

there will be no charge on the public funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is asked why, if there is to be a loss,

these  organisations  should  tender.  Is  it   for

charity?  No,  of course, not. These  organisations

are  allied with entertainment organisations or are

themselves entertainment organisations. They  could

get  a wider field for the entertainment which they

now  present.  Therefore, they  could  get  cheaper

services  which an independent corporation  cannot.

They  can  therefore, Sir, make additional  profits

for  their  existing organisations, or  make  less

onerous  the  loss that would be  suffered  by  the

television   organisation  until   such   time   as

television has caught on. As I say, Sir, one can in

these  matters but estimate, and the  estimate  is

that  it might take about three years before  there

could  be  a sufficient number of viewers  to  make

possible   a   reasonable  income  for   commercial

organisations interested in the venture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that, on socialistic grounds,

there  should be state planning and control.  I  do

ask  hon.  Members to recognise the fact  that,  in

this  instance, there is state control - absolute - and

although the licence is for fifteen years - ten years

renewable or whatever it is - that is merely  in  the

advertisement,  Sir,  and is not  inherent  in  the

motion.  What  I  hope  can be  worked  out  is  an

exclusive  licence  which can  be  re-purchased  by

Government  at  any  time, subject  to  payment  of

capital invested plus a reasonable profit,  and  if

allowed  to continue for a certain period,  let  us

say,  ten or fifteen years, which would enable them

to  recoup  themselves and make a profit,  then  we

purchase  only  at  market value  on  the  date  of

purchase. In those circumstances, Sir, I feel  that

we  can rapidly get together on the issues, present

the Bill to this House, have a Select Committee  on

it  and,  if  passed,  we  may  have  with  luck  a

television station in operation sometime next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reference to a Commission which will hear

the  same  type of objections which have been  made

here is merely an attempt to shelve an issue, as  I

see it, and is one that will cause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



delay  and  is rather a promise of something  on

the  never  never system. I would  like  to  say

this,  Sir, that the suggestion that this  House

should  appoint  a Commission  to  consider  the

implementation  of  its desire  for  television

only  on the basis that it is owned by a  public

corporation is a dangerous one, because  it  may

well  be that the report is of a character which

negatives the practicability of television by  a

public  corporation other than at an  exorbitant

cost which it is quite unreasonable to bear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in life there is never perfection. There

must  be  compromise. The proposal made  in  the

original motion is one where there is compromise

between  public  control  and  private  finance - rather  a  marriage between public control  and

private finance. I say, Sir, that I can  see  no

merit in the amendment and that, in my view,  it

has  serious objections: one, of delay and, two,

of  making  television  probably  impracticable,

because you are tying the Commission down,  Sir,

to  refusing  to  consider  the  possibility  of

commercial   television.  It  is  important   to

recognise that. If you tie that Commission  down

to  just consideration of state television,  you

may find the cost quite beyond our means. But it

is  important, I think, that we should have this

instrument of cultural fusion and it is possible

to  have  substantial control of the policy  and

the  programme of a television station which has

commercial  television. I do  ask  hon.  Members

seriously  to  consider  the  issues  and  I  do

request that they realise that if they accept the

amendment, it may well be that that is  the  end

of television for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir,

the problem which faces us this afternoon is not

an easy problem. It is a very difficult problem.

It  is  a  problem  which has engaged  the  very

serious   and  prolonged  attention   of   other

Governments - New Zealand, Australia, South Africa

and  other  countries - and they have for  a  long

time been wrestling with the issue of the method

by which television should be allowed to operate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



in their countries. It is an issue, Sir, which I

regard  as being of the very greatest importance

for the welfare and the future of the people  of

Singapore,  and I would suggest to hon.  Members

of  this House that it is one on which we should

not  decide  in haste and repent at leisure.  I,

for  one,  will  weep no tears if acceptance  of

this   amendment  delays  the  introduction   of

television into Singapore. If, by the delay of a

few  months, in order to carry out detailed  and

careful  examination of all the issues  involved

and of all the ways in which difficulties can be

overcome,  we  find  an  answer  which  is  more

satisfactory than the present proposal,  then  I

say that the delay will be well in the interests

of the future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, there is one consideration in this

problem which is of over-riding importance,  and

that  is that we must keep constantly before  us

the  power  of this instrument of television  to

influence the minds and the lives of the  people

of  Singapore.  This is a small  community.  The

whole of the community will be within range of a

television service. The television service  goes

into  the  homes  of  the  people, it  has   an

attraction  unrivalled  by  any  other  form  of

entertainment.  It  combines - I  think  this  has

already  been said - the power of the  Press,  the

power   of   the   cinema  and  the   power   of

broadcasting.  Already, it  has  raised  serious

social problems in other countries, such as  the

United    States   and   the   United   Kingdom,

particularly in its effect on children - and half

of  our  population is under 21.  This  Assembly

has,   I   submit,   a  very  clear   and   real

responsibility to ensure, as far as we  possibly

can, that television is an influence to the good

here  and not an influence towards lowering  all

standards - educational, moral and civic - and it is

for this reason alone that I personally have  no

doubt at all that, in the best interests of  the

people, television should be in the hands either

of  the  Broadcasting Department or of a  public

corporation,  charged by statute to  look  after

the interests not of those who sell soap, but of

the men, women and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



children  of  Singapore.  There  is  to   me   a

fundamental  objection to entrusting  television

to  a commercial operator, however worthy may be

the     individuals    connected    with    that

organisation. My objection is this: that  for  a

commercial  operator to cover his costs  and  to

make his profits, he must have advertising,  and

if his programmes are going to be worth while to

the  advertiser, then he must let the advertiser

have  a  say in the content of those programmes.

He  who  pays the piper must be allowed to  call

the  tune,  and  by the very nature  of  things,

whatever  assurances we may have to the contrary

and  with  whatever good intention they  may  be

made,  the  ultimate criterion of the  programme

must  be to sell goods, and for that purpose  it

must  have  an  appeal to the mass to  encourage

sales. We know very well from the experience  of

other  countries that what sells advertising  is

the sensational and the popular - what appeals  to

our  senses and to our appetites rather than  to

our minds and our better nature. You do not sell

soap-flakes by the lasting virtue of good music.

You sell it by what have come to be called "soap-box  operas".  You  do not sell  cigarettes  and

other  articles by the beauty of art.  You  sell

them  by what is called "cheesecake". The result

must  be that, sooner or later, the mass of  the

programme  will be sub-standard by any objective

criterion of art or entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that in the United States 92 per

cent  of  television programmes are made  up  of

films.  Most  of these films are specially  made

for  television  sponsored by  the  advertisers.

They  consist  largely of  the  cheap  sob-stuff

stories of the home, of crime serials and  other

forms  of  trashy entertainment. They pander  to

the  worst and not to the best in popular taste.

What  happens there is that a vast  quantity  of

material is needed hour after hour, day by  day,

to   fill  the  time  of  dozens  of  television

programmes,  and  to  satisfy  that   gargantuan

appetite  the emphasis must be, not on  quality,

but on quantity - putting out a tremendous lot  as

quickly and as cheaply as they can.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I suggest, Sir, if we allow television in

Singapore  to pass into the hands  of  the  film

industry, what will happen will surely  be  that

they  will  turn  to this ready-made  source  of

material  for television in Singapore - bought  by

the  mile from the United States and pushed into

the  minds  of the people of Singapore.  To  me,

there is only one answer to this. The Government

must  discharge its responsibility to  see  that

the minds of the people are not exploited in the

interest  of  big  business selling  goods.  The

answer to me is that television should either be

entrusted   to   a  Government  department,   as

broadcasting is, and surely if we think it right

that   broadcasting  should  be   under   public

control,  so  much the more must we ensure  that

television - a  far  more  insidious  and   potent

instrument - should not be put into the  hands  of

vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see, Sir, how any person or political

Party    claiming   to   adhere   to   Socialist

principles, whether they are Liberal or not, can

hand   over   television,  with  its  tremendous

influence  on  the  people  in  the  future   of

Singapore, to big business. The only reason,  as

my hon. Friend the Chief Minister has explained,

why  we come to think of allowing television  to

be  operated by a commercial operator is because

of   the  problem  of  finance.  The  Government

naturally  is  chary of accepting a  very  heavy

financial  commitment, both in  capital  and  in

running  costs,  when there are  so  many  other

prior  claims  on our resources.  The  estimates

that I have been given are that it will take  at

least  $2  millions of capital and  possibly  as

much  as  $900,000 a year to cover  the  current

costs.  The Cathay Organisation's figures  are - I

think  it  is  $3 millions in capital  and  only

$500,000 to $600,000 in running costs. So we can

take  that  as  the magnitude of the  call  that

would  be  made on public finance if  television

was run wholly by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I should like to take

the  opportunity  of informing the  House,  with

apologies,  that  there  is  an  error  in   the

printing on the Command



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



Paper which is before us in connection with  the

Cathay Organisation tender on page 7. The tender

speaks of the savings which can accrue by  using

the  Cathay Building and land. The total  saving

in  this  direction is printed  as  $70,000.  It

should, of course, be $700, 000, as I hope it is

clear from the context above. I would like, if I

could,  to ask the House to take note  of  that,

for  which  I  apologise. There  are  two  other

comparatively minor errors on the opposite  page

where  the  suggestion about licence fees,  that

the   gross  revenue  should  be  "supplied   to

financing", should be "applied to financing".  I

do  not think the sense is altered really. Lower

down  there,  "The  licence of  a  commercially-operated  television station must  concentrate",

it should, of course, read "licensee".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hard fact of the matter is that if we

were  to  operate  television  by  a  Government

department,  we  should  have  to  face  a  very

considerable  capital  investment  and  a   very

considerable sum for the running costs,  and  we

should  also have to face, what is a  very  real

difficulty  in  these  times,  the  problem   of

finding  staff and so on. So it  is  not  to  me

improper that the Government should hesitate  to

embark on this new venture, but I still say that

we should think very well before we do so, and I

should like to suggest that we ought to give far

more  time  than we have yet to examining  other

alternatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, which I support, suggests that

television  should be handed over  to  a  public

corporation.  I should like to suggest,  at  the

same  time,  that we should consider whether  we

cannot,  with  advantage, ally  television  with

broadcasting. That is what has happened in other

territories. In the United Kingdom,  the  B.B.C.

run  both television and broadcasting and it  is

likely  to be so, I understand, in South Africa.

I  think  that  it  is right in  principle  that

television  and broadcasting should go  together

rather than that television should be split from

broadcasting  and  handed  over  to   the   film

industry.  Now,  it is possible  that  we  could

raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



the finance for television to be run by a public

corporation  by running television on  its  own,

that  is to say, by allowing the corporation  to

obtain  revenue from advertising; but  I  should

like to suggest that we should also examine  the

possibility   of   pooling  the   resources   of

broadcasting  and television, and  I  would  not

rule out the possibility that we should allow  a

degree  of advertising in broadcasting in  order

to increase the revenue. I do not like at all to

introduce advertising into broadcasting. I think

I  possibly  have  a  natural British  prejudice

against  it, but at the same time I  would  very

much prefer to allow advertising to come into  a

Government-run    or   a   Government-controlled

broadcasting  system  than  I  would  hand  over

television to a commercial operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference has been made to what has been done

in   the  United  Kingdom.  There  is  one  very

important  lesson  for us,  I  think,  from  the

United  Kingdom arrangements. What  happened  in

the United Kingdom was, as hon. Members probably

know,  that the British Broadcasting Corporation

was  running  both broadcasting  and  television

completely    divorced   from   all   commercial

influence.   The  Conservative  Government,   in

pursuit  of its general policy to prevent  these

big   public  corporations  becoming  privileged

monopolies,  wished to introduce an  element  of

competition. That element of competition had  to

come, of course, from commercial television, but

they  were  quite insistent that they would  not

surrender  television to the  free  use  of  any

commercial  operator. To that  end,  a  somewhat

complicated  organisation has been set  up,  the

basic features of which are that you have, first

of  all, a public authority the members of which

are  appointed  by  the Minister  known  as  the

Independent  Television  Authority,   and   that

Authority is charged with the responsibility for

providing  television stations and  studios  and

services,  but  it is not charged directly  with

producing  programmes. In fact, the  law,  while

telling  the Authority that it must see  that  a

high  quality is maintained, tells the Authority

that it should not produce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



the  programmes.  The programmes are  produced  by  a

separate organisation known as Programme Contractors.

Those  are  people from the entertainment  world  and

elsewhere  who  pay the Television Authority  to  put

their programmes on the air. Yet another division  is

made  whereby neither the Authority nor the Programme

Contractors are allowed by law to have any connection

at  all with those who are interested in advertising.

So  what the British Government has tried to do is to

ensure that the content of the programme is in no way

influenced  by  the  advertiser. They  have  drawn  a

parallel  with  the  cinema  and  the  Press   where,

although  an advertiser pays to put his advertisement

in a newspaper or have it shown on the cinema screen,

he does not yet, I am thankful to say, write the news

or  the  leading article or produce the film. As  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has pointed out, even then a

very guarded introduction of commercial operation met

with violent opposition in the United Kingdom and  it

is  still  subject to very considerable criticism.  I

think  that  it  is  too early  to  say  whether  the

establishment of the Independent Television Authority

is  going  to  succeed in keeping  the  influence  of

commercial  advertising out of  the  content  of  the

programmes.  The moral for us is that, in introducing

commercial   competition,  a   British   Conservative

Government  took the utmost pains to  try  to  ensure

that  the  minds  of  the  British  people  are   not

exploited by business for advertising purposes. It is

also  significant  that  the  Independent  Television

Authority, while being required to pay its  way,  was

financed initially by advances from the Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has referred to what

our  neighbours the Thai Government have  done.  They

have  done what I think we should do, and that is  to

set up a wholly Government-owned corporation. But  my

information  is  the same as the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar's  and that is that the influence of commercial

operation  in  that Government-controlled  system  in

Thailand has resulted in a very low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



standard of programmes which I hope we shall not  see

here. It is all very well to suggest that if we  give

an exclusive licence to a commercial operator, we can

ensure control. The first objection I have to that is

that  we  are going to set up a vested interest,  and

once we set up a vested interest, ultimately the only

thing  we  can do is to buy it over; and  if  we  are

going  to  buy  it over, it is going to be  extremely

expensive.  I  think we should at least take  further

thought  before we decide to hand television over  to

business   and  create  a  new  vested  interest   in

Singapore  that somebody in the future will  have  to

take over at vast expense.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYAN AIRWAYS AND PUBLIC UTILITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Malayanisation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have taken

advantage  of the right to speak on this  Adjournment

to  raise  the question of Malayanisation of  Malayan

Airways  and  of  other public utilities.  The  other

public  utility I have in mind is the passenger  road

transport  industry. However, there is at the  moment

on  the Table of this House the Report of the Hawkins

Commission on Passenger Transport. I shall  therefore

confine  my remarks to the Malayanisation of our  air

transport industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is often the case that, where

something   essential  to  the   community   is   not

profitable,  the State finally takes over,  like  the

Malayan Railways, but where it is profitable,  as  in

the case of the passenger road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



transport    and    passenger   air    transport

industries,  they  are left  in  private  hands.

There  are  two reasons why we must rapidly  put

our house in order:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We are approaching independence and the

less trouble we have when we take over, the more

efficiently will the industries be run after

independence; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Unless we have a definite policy now, we

may make it almost impossible to take over the

industry immediately after independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Airways operates under Government

franchise which gives them a monopoly. The  Hon.

the  Chief Minister was an advocate against that

monopoly. He pleaded powerfully and persuasively

against   making  Malayan  Airways  a   complete

monopoly  for  Mansfield & Company Limited,  but

that  is not what I am so concerned with  today.

The  franchise of that Airways is  due  for  re-consideration  by the Government very  shortly - I

understand in April. I understand also that this

is  not  a matter which affects Singapore  alone

and  that  the Federation Government is  equally

interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And Borneo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And Borneo. But I have

sought  on this motion to draw attention to  the

fact  that we have to do something about it.  We

cannot  just  renew  the franchise  on  the  old

terms.  If  it  is renewed, it will  be  renewed

probably  for  another seven years  and  I  feel

confident that we will not wait seven years  for

Merdeka.  One  of  the  important  things  about

renewing the franchise is that this is the  time

to  alter those conditions. If a franchise is to

be renewed, this is the time to enter into a new

relationship  with  the present  proprietors  of

Malayan  Airways.  It might be  to  Government's

advantage to take over 51 per cent of the shares

in  order that it can have the controlling voice

in   the   running  and  management  of  Malayan

Airways, but in order that there may be no break

in  managerial continuity, the Company might  be

allowed to retain 49 per cent. But I put that in

as a suggestion regarding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



possibilities of creating a new combination or a

new type of management of Malayan Airways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Airways has been going on for seven

years  and one of the terms in the franchise  is

that  it  should  encourage  the  training   and

employment of local personnel. Every independent

country - Burma,    Indonesia,   Ceylon,    India,

Pakistan - has an airline which flies the national

flag.  It  is  part  of  the  trappings  of   an

independent country. We have Ceylon Airways, Air

India, Garuda, Air Burma. The management is good

in  some  and  bad  in others.  Apart  from  the

international air transport problem,  we  should

start   Malayanising  our   own   internal   air

transport  personnel.  Malayan  Airways,   after

seven  years,  have only trained  three  pilots.

They  have  recruited nine other local  men  who

received  their training as pilots independently

of  Malayan  Airways, in the Chinese Nationalist

Air  Force,  in India, Australia and  elsewhere.

After seven years, all it has been able to  show

on  the balance sheet - and I am reading now  from

the  memorandum  of  the Malayan  Airways  Local

Employees  Union - is that there are twelve  Asian

First   Officers,   thirteen  expatriate   First

Officers  and twenty-five Captains. No  aircraft

can  fly  without a captain and a first officer.

In  other  words, no aircraft in Malaya  can  be

flown  without an expatriate on board.  That  is

not what one could call a healthy situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, and the Hon. the Chief Minister knows

very well, the difficulty of finding men to fill

the  top jobs when there has been a long  period

when men are kept down at the bottom. The reason

for it is not only that Malayan Airways does not

train  them, but actively discriminates  against

their  employment.  For  instance,  before   the

elections  and  before Malayanisation  became  a

real  scare  to all Europeans, they were  paying

their  local pilots less than one-half  of  what

they  were paying their European pilots - job  for

job,  qualification for qualification. They paid

a  European, on  entering at  the  top  of  the

service, $1,450



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



with  $250  marriage  allowance,  $300  housing

allowance, $400 expatriate inducement allowance,

$75   licence   allowance.  They  gave   further

privileges  like  home leave, dental  treatment,

accident  insurance,  and  hospitalisation.  The

local officer got $1,150 - less than half. In  the

case of qualified engineers, a locally qualified

engineer  was  getting  one-third  of  what  his

European  counterpart was getting. When  in  the

course  of  negotiations the European  directors

were  told  that  this is a new era - post-Rendel - and that there is a very "fierce" Chief Minister

who is in favour of Malayanisation and who might

be  influenced by the attitude of the Company on

Malayanisation, only then did they say,  "Right,

we  shall  give them the same basic pay  as  the

European."  That made it go up  to  one-half  of

what  the  European  was  getting  because   the

European  still  has  a  marriage  allowance,  a

housing   allowance,  an  expatriate  inducement

allowance,   a   licence  allowance,   a   leave

allowance, dental treatment, accident  insurance

and hospitalisation which the local man does not

get.  Sir, to give an indication of the enormity

of  the discrimination, may I just say that when

they  increased  the  basic  from  the  1st   of

September   last,  the  local   man   was   paid

$500x25-600. After the 1st of September, he  was

paid $800x25-900. He got, in fact, a 60 per cent

salary rise in the basic alone but he still does

not  get  any  of  these  allowances.  Then  the

Company,  with  the doggedness  typical  of  all

European  businessmen  fighting  a  last   ditch

stand,  said that henceforth they would  have  a

new scale for expatriates and Asians alike. They

reduced  the  scale  from $800  to  $650x25-900.

Then,  with  a  wangle, which  might  have  done

credit to the Establishment Officer of the local

Government,  they said that they would  take  on

new  recruits  at this new point  of  entry - much

lower -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,

it may well be that this company wangles, but  I

do  object very strongly to the suggestion  that

any  officer of the Government wangles. If there

is any such suggestion, Sir, I would like facts.

In  the  meanwhile,  I  ask  leave  that  it  be

withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have said time and again that

my  hands  are tied by Standing Orders  and  the

only time that a Member is out of order is when,

amongst   other  matters,  he  imputes  improper

motives to any other Member. So it seems  to  me

that  if  a  Member  desires  to  say  something

derogatory of an official of the Government,  it

is  up  to a Minister of the Government to reply

to that in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel

that  some of us have perhaps not been following

the  evidence  submitted to  the  Malayanisation

Commission.  Those who have will  know  all  the

instances  that have been cited  ad  nauseam  to

justify  what,  in my opinion, is very  moderate

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I was saying, having had to

concede  because of the change in the  political

situation,   the  Company  then   contrived   to

introduce  a  new plan whereby they could  bring

European  engineers from Australia or  elsewhere

and  put them at a higher point of entry, whilst

the  Asian  would go in at $650. That  could  be

quite   simply  done  with  no  apparent  racial

discrimination  by bringing in the  question  of

previous  experience. For instance,  a  man  has

been  a  corporal  in the Royal  Australian  Air

Force;  although he did not have an  engineering

licence  at that time, the moment he  gets  that

licence,  the Company then says, "Ah, yes,  here

is a man who has had seven years in the R.A.A.F.

and  knows all about Dakotas." So, he  will  get

$650  plus seven increments. Well, that  is  the

sort  of  thing  that  just  poisons  the  whole

relationship between Malayans and Europeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a memorandum of the Malayan

Airways  Local Employees Union - this  is  not  my

language - and this is the way in which they  have

put it themselves:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The expatriate engineer does only supervisory

work   while   the  Malayan  engineer,   holding

identical qualifications, is treated as and made

to feel a glorified mechanic whom the expatriate

engineer  regards not as a colleague  but  as  a

dangerous rival."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business of treating the men differently

goes  to  such an extent that the local  engineer

has  to  find his own way to work. The expatriate

engineer  gets  a Volkswagen to collect  him  and

send  him  home. Now, with Merdeka in sight,  the

Company  has  decided that, in so far  as  it  is

possible, it will divert the Volkswagen to  where

the  local engineers are staying but that if this

is not possible, either because the Volkswagen is

already full up or otherwise, it will pay a small

allowance to the local engineer to find  his  way

to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is happening in a public

monopoly,  which operates under the franchise  of

the Singapore, Federation and Borneo Governments.

All  these matters should be carefully considered

with  a  view  to the taking over  of  the  whole

airline.  We must so arrange things that  in  the

not too distant future we should be in a position

to  take  over  Malayan Airways lock,  stock  and

barrel and run it -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Stop it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Stop it? We shall have bigger

things, better things, better services. We  shall

fly  the flag throughout the world, just  as  all

the other independent countries are doing. We may

even re-design our flag - that is a matter for some

other  time. But for the time being, what we  are

interested in is to see that this private British

company  is  not  allowed  to  continue  with   a

Government monopoly in the way it has.  In  seven

years, it has only trained three local pilots. In

seven  years,  it  has  trained  only  ten  local

engineers. It engaged fifteen boys in 1948.  Five

left  because  they were frustrated  and  because

there were no prospects of training or promotion.

Ten  remained.  Since 1948 there  has  been  no

further  recruitment for training.  That  is  the

kind  of private enterprise which has helped  to

sour  the  whole  of the political  situation  in

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Telecommunications and

Works will be able to give us some information as

to -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Now, where does

Telecommunications come from? Has not  television

been finished with?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Telecommunications? I beg

your  pardon.  Is  it  Communications?  One  gets

confused by all these wordy Ministries.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> After ten months!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What I hope he will do is to

give  us some indications. I well understand that

his  hands  may be tied because he will  have  to

consult  other Governments, but I  hope  he  will

give us some indication of the factors, which  he

is  taking  into consideration when renewing  the

franchise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hardly know

where to begin, but let us begin anywhere. It does

not  matter  much where. Perhaps I can  begin  by

passing  the Malayan Airways agreement across  to

the  hon.  Member. He referred to a statement  in

this memorandum from the Local Employees Union of

Malayan  Airways,  that  the  franchise  included

certain  conditions about the  Company  employing

and  encouraging the training of Malayans. I have

only  a short time before me. If you can find  it

in the agreement, I shall be very interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member just place

that on the Table?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I lay it on the Table and if some

Members are interested -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member addressing me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  However,  that is by  the  way.  I  am  not

concerned  about  arguing the  question  of  what

training  has  been given in  the  past  or  what

should  have been given. But just as a matter  of

record, I think that it is important to note what

actually  is  in the franchise. I have  not  been

able, at a cursory glance, to establish the truth

that they are bound to give training to Malayans.

It may be that they ought to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar was anxious that

we  should  give early consideration, because  on

the 30th April



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



this  year we have to give notice to the Company.

In fact, consideration has been going on for just

precisely two years. The first opening letter  in

this file from the Director of Civil Aviation  in

Singapore  is dated 9th March, 1954, raising  the

question  of the future of Malayan Airways.  Ever

since, the matter has been under discussion and a

very  great range of possible futures  for  civil

aviation  has  been  discussed.  There  are  very

complex  and  technical factors included.  It  is

delightful to think of larger aeroplanes and more

of them and so forth, but that is not necessarily

the  right approach. A large aeroplane introduces

a  number of technical factors - whether it is  the

length  of  the  runway, or  whether  it  is  the

economic  pay-load, which has to  be  considered.

Merely to have a larger aeroplane so that you can

show  the flag on it would not necessarily  be  a

sound economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a number of other points to be

considered. If it is felt that consideration  has

gone  on too long, I must endorse and stress what

the  hon.  Member himself has said, that although

Malayan  Airways is based in Singapore, its  base

is  all  that  it has in Singapore  and  all  its

flying territory lies outside this island. It has

an   agreement  with  the  Governments   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore.  It  also

operates  in Borneo as Malayan Airways and  as  a

subsidiary  as  well. It also has  certain  other

services,  which are not enormously  significant,

and,  of course, it could possibly expand into  a

regional or territorial service and not merely  a

local    airline   service.   These    are    all

possibilities  which have to  be  considered  but

which  are  not  matter for a statement  at  this

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot, I am afraid, go into much detail about

the  points in which the Member for Tanjong Pagar

is  specifically interested - the question  of  the

Malayanisation of the staff, whether it  is  air-crew  or ground engineers of the Malayan Airways,

or  on  negotiations  which have  to  take  place

between   the  Governments  concerned.   I   must

comment,   in   passing,  that  even   the   word

"Malayanisation" is inappropriate.  If  they  are

going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



operate  in  Borneo, then the Borneo  territories

will emphatically demand "Borneonisation", and as

soon    as   we   use   accidentally   the   word

"Malayanisation",  there  will  be  an  immediate

reaction from Borneo, "You cannot do that here!

We  do  not  want Malayanisation!" A  Malayan  in

Singapore is an expatriate in Borneo, or  he  may

be   held   to   be   so,   and,   unfortunately,

Malayanisation is not quite the appropriate  term

for -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Confederalisation!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, we will get the reality and

then  find the name for it, I hope! Now,  on  the

question of Malayanisation, there are one or  two

points  that  I  think I might  profitably  raise

(without anticipating future negotiations) on the

figures supplied to me about six or seven  months

ago.  The Asians or Malayans now employed in  the

Malayan Airways air-crew will have to be expanded

by  about 400 per cent. You multiply them by four

to get enough to provide all the pilots and chief

officers,  captains and whatever the  appropriate

ranks are. For the ground engineers, you have  to

multiply them by three. In other words, you  have

got a lot more expatriates than you have Malayans

at  present,  and  if  you want  to  replace  the

expatriates,  you have to get a great  number  of

Malayans.  It  is  not a matter  of  one  or  two

people.  It is a matter, as I say, of multiplying

your present Malayan staff by three or four times

and  it does take two years to train a pilot  and

three  years to train a ground engineer, so  that

there is necessarily bound to be a lag before you

can  replace  expatriates by  Malayans.  That  is

significant  because  you may  have  to  be  most

anxiously  seeking for Malayans  to  replace  the

expatriates who are likely to go. The information

I  have  received  is  that already  there  is  a

significant  outflow from the  engineering  side,

and  as everyone knows, pilots, engineers and all

technical  people  can  pick  up  excellent  jobs

anywhere  in  the world. And if they  think  that

their future is not secure in this country,  they

will  not  wait for a year or two until they  are

chased  out.  They  will look  around,  read  the

technical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



papers  and find a job that looks permanent  and

profitable. It may be that we should prefer them

to  stay on until we were ready to replace  them

but  they  are  very likely to  say,  "Well,  my

family,  myself, my children, my future  and  my

career  come first, and I cannot afford to  wait

in  a place where I am going to be replaced very

soon.  I had better get off straightaway.  There

is  a  nice opening and I will take it  and  get

myself re-established elsewhere."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going into the rights and wrongs of

this  matter in the least. I am merely  pointing

out  that, as far as I can judge at the  moment,

the  indications appear to be that it is not  so

much that we have no places for the Malayans  as

we have not enough Malayans for the places. I am

not  giving  that as a statement of fact.  I  am

looking  at  it as far as I can guess  from  the

rather limited information available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would stress also that we would have to have

careful  training  and  satisfactory  experience

after   training,  because,  whilst  in  certain

services  you  can perhaps take a  chance  on  a

man's  fitness, whether he is really able to  do

the  job  that he is trained for, when  you  are

flying  through the air with thirty or forty  or

fifty lives depending on one touch of the rudder

or  whether you come down on the right  part  of

the  airport or come down too far or too  short,

you  have  the  possibility of destroying  fifty

people's lives. You have also the possibility of

destroying the repute of your national  airline.

An  airline  which has frequent  accidents  will

very soon cease to have many passengers. Malayan

Airways  have a remarkable record for  accident-free flying, which is an undoubted asset both to

themselves as a company and still more  to  this

territory  as  a  place which  has  satisfactory

aviation communications, where you can get  into

a plane as you will get into a bus and feel that

you  will safely arrive at the other end without

having suffered any serious damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need go into the question of

precisely  how many people Malayan Airways  have

trained.  I wish it was more but I do not  think

that  it  is  quite as small as the hon.  Member

thinks. It remains for me to say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



all  the  factors  which  the  hon.  Member  has

stressed are ones which have been most anxiously

considered  and which are still being considered

and  which  are the subject of negotiations.  It

would  prejudice  negotiations  if  I  were   to

attempt to indicate precisely where we have  got

to  or  precisely what we are attempting to  do.

Moreover,  I could not do so in honesty  without

previous consultation with the other Governments

which  are  also parties to the negotiations.  I

very  much regret to say that I cannot say  very

much  more  beyond assuring the hon. Member  and

all  Members of this House that everything  that

we   feel   it  is  possible  to   do   in   the

circumstances  to ensure that  our  local  civil

aviation is Malayan in its organisation, in  its

staff,  in  its  services, and  in  its  capital

structure, will be done, but precisely what will

be done I cannot say.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like, very  briefly,  to

make  this  statement to supplement that  of  my

colleague and friend, and that is that  any  new

arrangement  which  may be arrived  at,  whether

involving  Malayan  Airways itself  with  a  new

franchise  or not, after the end of the  present

franchise will be submitted to this House.  This

Government  is not issuing any monopolies  under

any   prerogatives  without  the  knowledge  and

consent of the House, and I quite agree that the

question   of  Malayanisation  of  the   Malayan

Airways  staff  will  be a  material  factor  in

consideration of Malayan Airways' application or

interest in any new arrangement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I should like to support, for

the  record,  the remarks made by the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Communications and Works  on  the

standard  of service which has been provided  in

this part of the world by Malayan Airways. I  am

not briefed by Malayan Airways as the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar is briefed by the  Union,  but  I

would  like  to put on record, as  a  matter  of

fact,  that in Malayan Airways we have  in  this

part  of  the  world one of the  most  efficient

local  air  services to be found  anywhere,  bar

none. They have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



an accident-free record which, God willing, they

may long, long keep and they are one of the few

that do not have to be subsidised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How much money have they

made?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. We have reached the

time appointed for the termination of business.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed after Four

o'clock p.m. and the debate having continued for

half  an  hour, Mr Speaker adjourned the  House

without  Question put, pursuant to the  Standing

Order.
