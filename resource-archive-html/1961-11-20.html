<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INTO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Employment of technical men to do administrative work)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether, in the light of the finding of the

Commission   of  Inquiry  into  the  Constructional

Capacity  of  Singapore  that  "the  employment  of

technical  men  to  do  administrative  work  is  a

wasteful use of an extremely scarce resource",  the

Government   would   consider   reorganisation   of

administrative   work  in  all  departments   where

technical    and    professional   men    discharge

administrative functions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission and with the agreement of the Member for

Anson, I propose to table the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of answer handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, the formula would be that

the   Minister  will  publish  the  answer  in  the

Official  Report. He is entitled to  do  that  even

without  asking  for permission of the  Member  who

asked the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the answer:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The quotation in the Interim Report of the

Commission  referred to by the  Honour-able  Member

has   specific   reference  to  the   circumstances

existing  in  the  P.W.D. and the  City  Engineer's

Department. The Commission pointed out the  adverse

effect,  from the point of administration,  on  the

D.P.W. and his Deputy who are too involved with the

daily routine administrative work of the department

which  could  be  equally  well  discharged  by  an

Administrative Officer. In this connection, it  was

recommended  that the former post of  A.O. in  the

P.W.D. which was abolished in January, 1958, should

be   resuscitated.  This  recommendation   of   the

Commission  was accepted and the post of  A.O. was

created in January.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Honourable Member has suggested the

extension  of this finding to the other departments

in   which   technical  and  professional  officers

perform administrative functions. This is not a new

idea and is an important factor to be considered in

any  organisation. The fact of the matter  is  that

the   Head  or  his  Deputy  Head  of  a  technical

department would have to discharge a certain amount

of administrative work which cannot he delegated to

any   one.   Further,   at  the   present   moment,

experienced  administrative  officers  are  scarce,

insufficient   to  man  all  the   posts   in   the

establishments  of  Government, it  is  always   a

problem  of getting on with what you have  and  not

with  what you would want to have. In the  case  of

certain   Ministries,  such  as  the   Health   and

Education  Ministries, which  have  a  preponderant

number of professional officers, some officers  who

show  a flair for administrative work can be posted

for administrative duties.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO CONSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Interim and Final Reports)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  with regard to the Commission of  Inquiry

into  the  Constructional  Capacity  of  Singapore,

whether he would (a) explain why the Interim Report

submitted  by the Commission on 4th October,  1960,

was   only  presented  to  the  Assembly  on   12th

September,  1961; (b) state when is it  anticipated

that  the  final  report  would  be  received   and

presented; and (c) make a statement on the  Interim

Report  indicating, inter alia, Government's policy

as regards the reported acute shortages of staff.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I similarly ask permission

to  have  the  answer  published  in  the  Official

Report?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of answer handed in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the answer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Commission, in their earls deliberations,

realised  the importance of the immediate  problems

relating   to   the  capacity  of  the   Government

departments   concerned   with   the   Government's

construction problem and to those departments whose

functions and work affect construction activity and

the  utilization construction capacity, and decided

to submit an Interim Report on the first 2 items of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



Terms  of  Reference. Briefly these are to  enquire

into  the  capacity  of  the building  industry  in

Singapore and how it can be expanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that an early publication should have

been  given  to the Interim Report but it  was  not

possible  to  get  this done  owing  to  the  other

commitments, which are of a more urgent  nature  in

some  cases, of the Printing Department. But I  may

state  that  the  recommendations  have  not, been

delayed in implementation in any way through  delay

in  printing. Before the publication of the Report,

six of the major recommendations, including the one

relating   to   the  creation  of   the   post   of

Administrative   Officer  in   the   P.W.D.,   were

implemented; due publicity had been given  to  some

of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Final Report of the Commission of inquiry

was submitted to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  on the 16th June. Although the printing  of

the  Report  is in an advanced stage, I  would  not

like  to  say  when  it will be  presented  to  the

Assembly. But it would not be long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The existing shortage of technical officers is

due   largely  to  the  retirement  of  experienced

officers under the Malayanisation Scheme and partly

to  lack  of  fore-sight to fill this vacuum.  This

deficiency   is  accentuated  in  a  way   by   the

development of these technical services. Since  the

Government   took  office,  it  has  realised   the

importance  of  an  interim  measure  of   overseas

recruitment  of  these  technical  officers  on   a

temporary basis to tide over this shortage and  had

carried   out   negotiations  with  a   number   of

governments  who are in a position to  assist.  The

results  have  so  far  been  meagre  as  technical

personnel  are  in demand all over  the  world.  In

addition,   the   number  of   under-graduate   and

postgraduate  scholarships  in  all   branches   of

engineering, medicine, architecture, etc, have been

greatly  increased. It will be many years, however,

before we reap the benefit.

<div align="center"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF IMPORTS AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EXPORTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill  intituled

"An  Ordinance to amend the Control of Imports  and

Exports  Ordinance  (Chapter  214  of  the  Revised

Edition)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir. I lay upon the Table

a  Certificate of Urgency signed by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of the Control of Imports

and Exports (Amendment) Bill, 1961.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed  copies of the Bill available for the use  of

Members?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make the Control of Imports

and  Exports  Ordinance a permanent Ordinance.  The

Ordinance  was  promulgated on 8th December,  1950,

initially for one year. It has since been  extended

for  ten  further periods of a year each  and  will

expire on 7th December, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Ordinance provides that the Assembly

may extend its operation for such period or periods

as  it  may think fit, in practice extensions  have

been   for  periods  of  one  year.  The  Ordinance

empowers the Minister to make orders to regulate or

prohibit the import and export of goods. The reason

why  this Ordinance had such a temporary nature  at

the   time  it  was  introduced  was  due  to   the

opposition  from the trading community  who  feared

that   controls,  if  made  permanent,   would   be

detrimental  to  trade  and Singapore's  free  port

status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past ten years, most import and export

regulations have been removed and those at  present

in  being  are imposed mainly for health,  security

and  exchange  control reasons.  In  present  world

conditions,  the  power  to  exercise  controls  on

imports  and  exports  is  one  maintained  by  all

trading countries as being essential in a lesser or

greater degree to the requirement of their economic

policies  concerning  trade and  industry.  In  the

interest  of the economy of the State of Singapore.

it is necessary that the Government should have the

powers to restrict or direct imports and exports as

might be required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Trade and Commerce Advisory Council, which is

composed of representatives of the four Chambers of

Commerce,  has been consulted and has no  objection

to  the  proposal  that the  Ordinance  be  made  a

permanent  one.  As  matters  now  stand,   it   is

necessary to extend the life of the Ordinance  from

time  to time. It is considered that this procedure

takes up unduly the time of the House and that  the

basic reason for its temporary nature, namely,  the

fear  of  the trading community over controls,  has

now been allayed over these last ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, it is proposed to make the

Ordinance a permanent statute of the State, but  in

so  moving,  I  wish to assure the  House  that  as

before the powers under the Ordinance will only  be

exercised  after careful examination and  with  due

consideration to the needs of Singapore's trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

acknowledge that the powers of this Ordinance  have

been  exercised with moderation and for the welfare

of  the State. I fully appreciate the reasons which

our  Finance  Minister has given for  making  it  a

permanent  Ordinance and I am  fully  with  him  in

every  one of the reasons indicated. What I  cannot

understand,  Sir,  is  that  this  Bill  should  be

brought   under  a  Certificate  of  Urgency.   Our

Standing  Orders  provide  that  a  Certificate  of

Urgency may be utilised, and it has all along  been

envisaged that it could be utilised for matters  of

urgency  which cannot await a lengthy debate  or  a

postponement  of  a month. Here in  this  case  the

Minister  must agree with me that there is,  in  so

far  as  one  can  ascertain,  no  urgency  of  any

character whatsoever. There is no question  of  the

Bill  lapsing in any shape or form. [Interruption].

It is to lapse shortly. Well, I am interested, Sir,

to  be corrected, perhaps not in a quite procedural

manner. In that statement, the Minister did not see

fit  to  tell us that the Bill was about to  lapse;

but if that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



were  so,  would  it not have been  appropriate  to

bring this up at an earlier stage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge the Government - we have had two Bills in

this Session and in both there were Certificates of

Urgency  - that  when it comes to  exercising  the

very  unusual  powers in the Standing Orders,  they

should  not  utilise that power  unless  absolutely

essential.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

Member  for  Anson did not hear the  words  in  the

beginning  of  my speech and I may be permitted  to

repeat that section of it. I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Ordinance was promulgated on 8th December,

1950,  initially for one year. It  has  since  been

extended for ten further periods of a year each and

will expire on 7th December, 1961.'



<br><br>That  is  the  reason why this Bill must  be  taken

through all stages under a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had, of course, originally intended that the

Bill  should he presented to the House some  months

ago  but  events  have been such that  it  was  not

possible to place this Bill before the House  then.

Finally  we are caught very short time and have  to

follow this procedure of urgency. I can assure  the

Member for Anson that there is no intention at  all

to  pull a fast one either over this House or  over

the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not a controversial matter for

reasons  already  stated. We  have  the  assent  of

leaders  of the trading community, and it is  clear

to  both  the Government and leaders of the trading

community that the best course now open to us is to

put this Bill on the permanent Statute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.- [ Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without

amendment read a Third time and passed.

appreciate that in so far as the precincts  of  the

our  invitation and it is right and proper that the

Therefore, we have annually at the opening of  each

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I trust you will not

consider    it   inappropriate   if   I    express

appreciation of the courtesy and quiet  efficiency

with   which  the  police  have  discharged  their

responsibilities in this House. But what I  cannot

understand  and I trust the Leader  of  the  House

will  explain  it,  is why  we  need  to  ask  the

Commissioner  of Police to discharge functions  in

the streets outside the House in respect of which,

in  so  far  as  I am aware, he has ample  powers.

There   are  laws  against  obstructions  in   the

streets.  There  are laws against  processions  of

five  or  more  persons - they require  a  licence.

Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister could inform the

House why that part of the motion is necessary  in

order   to   invite   the   assistance   of    the

Commissioner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the

Member for Anson, formerly Chief Minister in  this

House, had himself on past occasions moved such  a

motion.  I  would have thought that he would  have

understood  the  purpose of that  motion  without

asking me today to explain it to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I am told that, for example, in the

House  of  Commons  there are certain  regulations

governing  the holding of demonstrations  round  a

certain  area within the precincts of  the  House.

And  it is in the light of this tradition that  we

have  also followed this ritual. In fact, it falls

upon me, as Leader of this House, to maintain this

ritual  at every new Session of the Assembly.  But

if the Member for Anson would suggest that such  a

provision   could   be  incorporated   into   some

Ordinance, I would be only too happy to do  so  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Member for Anson and

other  Members in this House that the  last  thing

that  we  wish  to see occurring in Singapore  are

demonstrations similar to what happened in  Tokyo,

when the Zengakuren organised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



demonstrations to prevent Members of the Diet from

passing  a  Bill.  The  police  then  were   quite

helpless and, in fact, an attempt by the  Diet  to

pass  such  a motion was defeated when Members  in

the  Diet  themselves fought against  one  another

over this same motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly orders that the Commissioner

of  Police  do take care that during  the  present

session  of  this House the passages  through  the

streets  leading to this House he  kept  free  and

open,  and  that  no obstruction be  permitted  to

hinder  the  passage of Members to and  from  this

House,  and  that no disorder he  allowed  in  the

passages leading to this House, and that there  he

no  annoyance  therein and thereabouts;  and  that

the  Clerk  of this Assembly do communicate  this

order to the Commissioner aforesaid.

1958, resolves that the salary of the Speaker with

effect from 1st September, 1961, shall be $3,000 a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will remember that when we moved a

motion  fixing  the remuneration  of  the  Speaker

after  he  was  reelected  to  this  Assembly,   I

indicated that adjustments had been made in  order

to   take   into  account  the  loss  of  variable

allowances  for  the  rest of the  civil  service.

These variable allowances having been restored  as

from the 1st of September this year, it falls upon

me  to  move formally that the Speaker shall also,

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to

move  the  motion+ in my name. The  separation  of

Singapore  from the Federation is a  criminal  act

committed by the British colonialists in 1945 when

the  Federated  Malay States and  the  Unfederated

Malay  States with the two Straits Settlements  of

Penang and Malacca were united as a Federation. At

that   time.  Singapore  was  excluded  from   the

Federation. All anti-colonialists did not cease to

fight  against the separation created by  mankind.

Sir,   I   intentionally  used  the  word   "anti-colonialists"  because the  nationalists  and  the

Communists have both opposed colonialism and  have

fought against the separation.



<hr size="2" noshade>

+The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective of all nationalists of

Malaya to achieve the reunification of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya

and to remove the artificial division created by the British by their policy of

"divide and rule", this House affirms and declares that the first objective of all

true patriots of Malaya is to achieve the reunification of these two territories in

a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the last 16 years, one of the

slogans   which  was  constantly   heard   in   the

nationalists' circle, including the Communists, was

merger and the reunification of Singapore with  the

Federation.  Therefore, Sir, it is no  exaggeration

if  I move such a motion asking all Members of this

House to support this merger in principle. We  must

presume   that  all  Members  of  this  House   are

nationalists. If they are not nationalists, then  I

feel   that   they   will  call  themselves   anti-colonialists and non-Communists. Whatever name they

may call themselves, we do not ask them to say what

is  their stand, or whether they are in support  of

or that they oppose the principle of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, only the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis  will be in an embarrassing  position  and

will be in a predicament to support this merger  in

principle,  and  the principle of merger  which  is

asked in this motion. To the members of the public,

they  say  that  they  wish for  merger  more  than

anything  else, anti more than anything  else  that

has  been  fought  for  by the  P.A.P.  Government.

Therefore, it will he strange if they vote  against

this motion. However, we know, anti they also know,

that  in their heart of hearts, merger is a  matter

which  they do not wish, because merger means  that

the question of internal security will be placed in

the   hands  of  the  Central  Government  of   the

Federation  of  Malaya,  and  that  their  hope  to

establish Singapore as an area separate from Malaya

`will disappear. But that is their problem. To  the

public, they  say they want merger more  than  the

type of merger which the P.A.P. is asking for. But,

in  actual fact, they fear merger. We now ask  them

to say in this House whether they support or oppose

this  principle of merger. If they support  merger,

then  we  may be able to discuss the details  which

should  be  placed  in  the hands  of  the  Central

Government  when merger is achieved. Thus,  on  the

one  hand,  they oppose merger, but in public  they

are  forced to support it. Then when we discuss the

details concerning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



their  type  of merger, it will he more  difficult.

There is no doubt, Mr Speaker, that the strong men

in  their Committee have carefully considered  the

position.  What  we want now is  that  each  Member

says,  "agree"  or "not agree". If  they  say  they

agree, then we will proceed to discuss motion No. 7

on  the  Order  Paper  in the  name  of  the  Prime

Minister  today which will ask the House to  accept

the  heads of agreement set out in the White  Paper

agreed to between the Governments of Singapore  and

the  Federation  and  the  working  basis  for  the

reunification of the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is no need to have an unnecessary debate. What is required is to count the people who agree and those who do not agree in

order  to  record  their stand on the  question  of

principle of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move the motion standing in my name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouestion proposed.



<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  in  the  Barisan Sosialis are in full agreement

with  the sentiments conveyed by the words in  this

motion  by the Minister for Labour. In fact,  these

are   the   sentiments  which  we  have  repeatedly

expressed  in  the past. These are  the  sentiments

dear  to  the  hearts of all socialists  since  our

country  was divided by the colonial power.  It  is

not necessary for me to recall to your memory, Sir,

the  People's Constitutional Proposals of 1947  put

forward by the PUTERA and A.M.C.J.A. which strongly

opposed the artificial separation of Singapore from

the mainland. I would like to take this opportunity

to  remind  our  Prime Minister, who  seems  to  he

smiling to himself, that the leaders of the  M.D.U.

whom he had recently smeared as Communists and pro-Communists  were  among the prime movers  of  these

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would have supported 100 per cent this

motion  before  the  House, but  for  the  shameful

record of the Government in the last two years, and

especially in the recent months. [Laughter.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have seen the P.A.P.

exploiting  the people's aspirations for  unity  in

order  to  smuggle in a constitutional  arrangement

which -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I have in item 7 of the

Order Paper a motion which will give the Member for

Queenstown ample scope to take to task every single

paragraph  of  that paper to express his  ire,  his

anguish  and' his rancour. And I hope  we  will  be

spared, Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of relevancy.

a  repetition  of these sentiments on two  separate

occasions.  As I have said, this is purely  one  on

principle. If he agrees, we all count heads and  we

can start disagreeing on item No. 7.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we ought to wait and see how

the Member for Queenstown develops his argument. It

appears  to  me on a casual reading of  the  motion

that  there may be a dispute as to what is  merger;

whether merger is a merger in the dictionary  sense

of the word, or under the heads of agreement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you very much, Sir, I

know they would try tricks like this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

was justified in raising a point of order, and I do

not think that can he named as a trick.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My apologies to you then, Sir.

I  was  saying, Sir, that we have seen  the  P.A.P.

leadership blatantly abusing the word "merger'  and

exploiting  the people's aspirations for  unity  in

order  to  smuggle in a constitutional  arrangement

which can in no way be called merger. It is only an

arrangement  aimed solely at keeping themselves  in

office.  We have seen them twisting the meaning  of

the word "merger" into something entirely different

from what it is normally understood to be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of this motion. Sir, convey high and

noble  sentiments to which none of us can disagree.

But,  Sir,  the record of the Government in  recent

months has clearly shown that their actions do  not

in any way match these high-sounding words. We must

judge  a government by its actions and not  by  its

words. Judging from its actions. Sir, we have every

justification to suspect that the Government is not

sincere  in  what  it says. It is abundantly  clear

that  the  P.A.P. is moving this motion purely  for

propaganda  purposes. It is clear that  the  P.A.P.

hopes that the people will mistake any support  for

the noble principles enunciated in this motion as a

support for the P.A.P.'s type of tipu orang merger. In

other  words. Sir, the aim of the P.A.P. in  moving

this motion is to ask this House to give it a blank

cheque. But. Sir, we are not prepared to give  this

blank cheque and we are not prepared to trust  this

politically bankrupt government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - a blank cheque.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So you are against merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In order that they may clearly

understand the real motives behind this motion,  we

must  review the political events in recent  months

so that we can see things all in clear perspective.

Let me do the review for you and for everybody, and

let us all see how this motion has come about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think all of us can still

remember  that  historic  crisis  sitting  of   the

Assembly on the 20th of July, 1961. At that time 39

Members   were  still  sitting  on  the  Government

benches.  But  what do we see today?  Not  only  is

there  a  complete change in the landscape in  this

Chamber,  hut  there  is also  not  the  same  smug

arrogance  on  the  faces of the  Government  Front

benchers   any  more.  They  try  and  laugh.   You

remember,  Sir,  when the P.A.P. Assemblymen  first

marched  in  1959,  there was not sufficient  elbow

room for all the 43 of them on the Government side.

Within a year -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as you mentioned

to me at the last sitting of the Assembly, that was

last Friday, you told me not to go back to history.

I  am  just  wondering whether what the Member  for

Queenstown has uttered is relevant to the motion on

merger.  I  do  not  think the  landscape  in  this

Chamber  is  comparable to  the  landscape  in  the

Federal Parliament at all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was listening very carefully to

the Member for Queenstown, as indeed I will have to

listen  very  carefully to  all  speeches  in  this

debate,  and  it  appears to me  that  perhaps  the

Member  for Queenstown is going into a little  more

detail  than he ought to in these reminiscences.  I

cannot  see  at  the moment how these reminiscences

have  any  hearing on the motion,  hut  perhaps  he

could  assist the Chair by suggesting how they  are

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I hope, Sir, to quote the

words  of  the  Prime Minister when  he  said  this

sometime back:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If at the end of my speech I fail to bring the

pieces into pattern and if the people and you. Sir,

fail  to  see the pattern, then I will have  wasted

the  time of the Chair as well as that of the House

and that of the people of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, within a year the number

had  dwindled down to 40, which was later  further

reduced  to  39. But that still did not materially

upset  the  strength  of the Government.  With  39

against  12  on the Opposition, they still  had  a

majority  of 27 in this Assembly. By any standards

the  P.A.P.  Government was  still  a  strong  and

stable  Government.  But  today,  it  is  such   a

contrast. It grieves me to see those vacant  seats

on -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am still endeavouring to put

the  pieces together in this jig-saw puzzle, and  I

still  cannot see how this historical precis as  to

what  has happened in the past has anything  to  do

with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is hoping to come back!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg your indulgence, Sir. It

is  to show how from a strong stable Government  it

has gone down to a weak and wobbly Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That may be so in the view of

the  Member  for  Queenstown,  but  has  that  any

hearing  on  the  motion which seeks  agreement  in

principle   to  the  reunification   of   the   two

territories  in  a  merger  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

mentioned to you a little while hack that I  wanted

to show you the real motive behind this motion - that

it  is for propaganda purposes. I want to show  you

how  it  is meant for propaganda purposes.  I  will

enlarge on that a little and I will not digress too

much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a comfortable and overwhelming majority of

27,  it  has  now been reduced to a  miserable  and

uneasy  majority  of only one.  By  no  stretch  of

imagination can this Government be called strong or

stable, in fact, it is so weak and unstable now -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am very sorry to be

interrupting like this, but if the hon. Member goes

into  expressions of opinion like that,  then,  of

course, that opens up a debate on quite a different

aspect  of  the  whole case.  He  is  now  debating

whether or not the Government is now stable; and if

he  goes  into detail, that will open up  a  debate

whereon the Government side will say they are still

stable. So I would suggest that all that the Member

need  do to make this point is to say that, in  his

opinion, the Government is not stable and leave  it

at  that. But if he goes into more details, then  I

am afraid he will become more and more irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will skip some parts of it

then,  Sir  - parts which would be very  interesting

reading, I am sure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, today all those on

the  Government benches know that there is not much

time  left  for  the P.A.P. to be  in  office.  The

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar knows that his  days  as

Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I know who the Member for

Tanjong Pagar is vis-a-vis the Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, I qualified it with "his

days as Prime Minister", Sir, are already numbered.

I  would like to add that the future of the rest is

too grim to be mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What about your days?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, to cut a long

well known to the whole of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of the arrogance and

deviated from its avowed party stand and policy -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Could  I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of  the

great  difficulty the Member for Queenstown has  in

knowing  which parts of his speech to read out  and

which  parts to leave out, he might be given a  few

minutes' adjournment to consult his ghost writer?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

ought to restrain himself and leave points of order

to  the  Chair. The point he has raised, of course,

is  not a point of order, unless he says the Member

for  Queenstown is reading, in which event  I  have

not noticed that he has been referring to his notes

much too much.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have got Lim Hock Siew.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The debate on this particular

topic,  one  should imagine, is one of  gravity  to

Singapore.  I  would  suggest  to  Members  on  the

Government  benches  to try and contain  themselves

and  listen  with patience to what the  Member  for

Queenstown has to say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. They

have always been trying to intimidate people. If

not the Special Branch following around -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member for Queenstown invites

interference or interjections, then, of course, the

Chair is unable to protect him. I would suggest

that he goes on with his speech and ignores what is

happening on the Government benches. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, the P.A.P. has so

deviated  from its party stand and policy of  anti-colonialism  that it is now desperately  trying  to

sell  Singapore down the river. In  their  mood  of

despair,   they  are  making  all-out  efforts   to

transmute  a  personal  and  party  crisis  into  a

national one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destiny of our people now becomes tied to the

foibles  and  weaknesses of a  few  men  in  power.

During the so-called national crisis following  the

crisis  debate, the Prime Minister  and  two  other

Ministers left their posts in the hour of so-called

grave national peril and went back to work in their

Party  headquarters at 62c, South Bridge Road.  The

Prime  Minister  ostensibly went to  ascertain  the

people's  views on problems facing the country  and

affecting the livelihood and welfare of the people.

In   actual  fact,  drawing  his  salary  as  Prime

Minister -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member indicate

how that is relevant to the motion? The motion asks

the  House  to  affirm and declare that  the  first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



achieve the reunification of the two territories in

a merger of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was hoping

that I could lead you down to [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They want to mislead the

people  into believing that there is this so-called

Communist  threat, and because  of  that,  so  many

things have happened. He was drawing his salary  as

Prime Minister and, hiding behind the facilities of

Radio  Singapore, he lashed out his  twelve  talks,

trying to create an artificial tension of fear  and

uncertainty  in the people. The Prime Minister  had

hoped to divert attention from the fact that he was

selling us all out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus for the last three months, since that

fateful  all-night Assembly sitting on  20th  July,

there  have been nothing but Communists,  Communist

cadres,    Communist-front   men,   Communist-front

organisations, pro-Communists and, of  course,  the

P.A.P. brand of merger. Did we not learn from  the

Prime  Minister  that Chinese middle  schools,  old

boys'  associations and cultural organisations  are

hotbeds  of Communist activities? And did  not  the

Prime  Minister  say  that office  workers,  office

girls  and  even  the English school  teachers  are

getting to become pro-Communists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way? The

Member will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if it is a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Will the Member produce the

document  which shows me as saying those things?  I

never said that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is not a point of

order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Tunku said in the special

General Assembly of U.M.N.O. at Kuala Lumpur on 5th

November,  1961,  that  it  was  because  of  those

frightening  stories  of  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore,  which had been poured  into  his  ears,

that finally convinced him to accept merger. Why do

we  not  hear  of this, and how is it we  have  not

heard how he has managed to convince the Tunku?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger between Singapore and the Federation, as

it  is  understood by everyone, had never  been  an

immediate  objective  of  the  P.A.P.  In  all  the

writings,  all  through the years,  of  the  P.A.P.

hierarchy,  merger had always been mentioned  as  a

long-term objective. For example, Sir, in  the  two

booklets  "The Tasks Ahead", there is  no  talk  of

immediate or early merger. On the other hand, there

is  "The  Five-Year  Plan". In this  Plan  are  the

development   of   industries,   agriculture    and

fisheries,  streamlining of  State  administration,

strengthening  education, improving the  health  of

the  people, improving the welfare of the  workers,

and  the emancipation of women - all of which have

now been forgotten by the P.A.P. leadership, as  it

was  proved during Question Time only two days ago.

But  at  no  stage, Sir, is there  mention  of  the

attainment,  or  the possibility  even,  of  merger

within the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, during the First Session of the

Legislative Assembly in 1959, the emphasis was  "On

the road towards a more equal and just society". "A

more  equal and just society" - how inspiring,  Sir,

but  that is now all forgotten. You will note  that

there was no mention of an early merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, during the Second Session in 1960, the

emphasis   was   on   the  year  of   construction.

"Construction" again, how inspiring, Sir, but again

there was no mention of an early merger. There  was

no  progress  even on the common market  which  the

P.A.P. talked so much about. Even now  the  common

market has to wait, as we have learnt only a couple

of  days ago. Yet within the short space of  a  few

months, all of a sudden, as it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



were,  merger  has  become a  matter  of  practical

politics  for the P.A.P. and startling developments

have been pushed with stunning speed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thanks to you!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What then will this be a year

of?  It  has been suggested that the first year  of

the  P.A.P.  Government was the year of excitement.

The  leadership soon blundered the second year into

the  year of confusion, and has made the third year

the  year  of  desperation. But, Sir, it  is  quite

evident that there is more than mere desperation in

this - the third year. It is already the talk of  the

town that this year of the P.A.P Government is  the

year of the sell-out - "the year of the sell-out".

Yes,   "sell-out",  Sir,  because  no  other   word

describes  it.  No other word quite  describes  the

action of the few leaders of the P.A.P. who have so

degenerated with the taste of power that they  have

now  turned against the people in their actions and

policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leap from no-merger and no-common-market

to  merger and to the P.A.P.'s so-called 12th State

of  the  Federation, is something  that  calls  for

explanation, for it may well be a leap in the wrong

direction   and  a  leap  in  the  dark.  Objective

realities do not disappear with a wave of the magic

wand.  The  reasons  previously  advanced  for  the

separation  of  Singapore from the  Federation  are

still present. The very same people who objected to

merger  in  the past are still at the helm  in  the

Federation. There has been no cataclysmic  upheaval

in  the political situation over the Cause, way. In

Singapore, there is still the same peace and quiet.

All of us daily go about our work as usual.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right, and night too!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have not seen anything that

has  caused  us  to miss our meals  or  our  sleep,

though  of  late  we see more dirt, mosquitoes  and

flies  around,  a more inept administration,  water

rationing in the midst of floods and monsoons,  and

greater  inefficiency  all-round.  What  then   has

happened during the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



few months that has caused this so-called merger to

dominate every other issue in Malayan politics?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our duty as an Opposition Party to

explain  the  circumstances that have  led  to  the

P.A.P. deal with the Federation Government.  It  is

also  our  duty to expose the true nature  of  this

deal,  and thereby to draw the urgent attention  of

the people to the dangers pregnant in the so-called

merger proposals of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first preface my remarks by saying that we

in  the  Barisan Sosialis are students of politics.

We  shall  always be so, unlike the Prime  Minister

who  maintains  that  he - and he alone - decides,  and

later  on  condescendingly adding his Committee  as

well.  We in the Barisan Sosialis accept a position

of  humility and shall always learn what the  wants

and  demands of the people are, no matter from what

strata  of  society they may come  from.  We  shall

learn  from  our  own  experiences  and  from   the

experiences  of  others.  We  shall  endeavour   to

explain  issues clearly to the people and we  shall

seek  to  establish  a  government  that  rules  by

consultation  and not by decree. It is  a  position

that  we, when we were in the P.A.P., Sir, had  all

sought  to  establish.  We failed  in  our  efforts

because the Prime Minister suffers from an enormous

personality  problem.  I regret  to  say  that  his

psychological make-up is that of a mandore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Queenstown must realise that what he is saying  now

is  completely irrelevant to the motion. He  should

now come to the point. He can say whether he or his

Party affirms and declares that the first objective

of  all  true patriots of Malaya is to achieve  the

reunification of these two territories in a  merger

of  Singapore  with the Federation of  Malaya.  The

impression  I have had up till now is perhaps  that

there  is a quarrel with the word "merger".  But  I

may be wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am coming to it, Sir. Those

of  us who have followed the papers will know  that

the  Prime Minister of Singapore has been shuttling

back and forth between Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



Kuala  Lumpur,  the  Cameron Highlands  and  Penang

every fortnight or so for the last three months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We meet a very big man.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We see photos of the Prime

Minister carrying golf clubs all over Malaya -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If I allow these

personalities, I do not think we will be able to

get on with the debate. We have three other

motions on the same topic. I must ask that all

personalities be forgotten. Let us come down to

the pith of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Newsmen, both local and

foreign, were kept busy with Press interviews every

time  our  Prime  Minister  left  Kuala  Lumpur  or

arrived  back in Singapore. Meetings of  the  Prime

Ministers  of  the  Federation and  Singapore  were

followed  by joint statements which were issued  at

regular  intervals.  On  the  23rd  of  August,  we

learned  that  agreement  between  the  two   Prime

Ministers had been reached in principle. And on the

14th  of September, agreement had been reached that

a  Working Party should work out details of  merger

with  a  view to bringing about the integration  of

the  two  territories and its peoples in or  before

June 1963. From no-common market, and even a little

coolness and unfriendliness, to integration  in  or

before 1963! All in a couple of months, Sir. Really

fast work! Fast work that can only come out of  the

last gamble of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into the matter a little more

closely,  Sir.  The Federation had all  along  been

against merger. Both inside and outside Malaya, the

Tunku  had  always indicated that he did  not  want

merger. In fact, he had said that he would not even

touch  Singapore with a barge pole. How come  then,

Sir,  that  the Tunku now suddenly wants merger  in

spite of all his fears and prejudices? If there was

high-pressure cooking, who was doing  the  cooking?

Was  it  a piece of fast sales talk on the part  of

the  Prime  Minister  of  Singapore?  And  was  the

country  gentleman impressed by the  City  slicker?

The Tunku, Sir, had previously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



given three reasons for not wanting merger.

He  said that the Federation has a kingship  and  a

sultanate: it has Islam as the State religion,  and

Malay as the national language. He was afraid  that

the  people  of  Singapore were not used  to  these

things, and I will quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`because of the differences in outlook of the

people  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation', with

merger  `differences of the people might clash  and

thus  create  problems which would be difficult  to

resolve.'



<br><br>This  is in the Straits Times of 17th October. Sir,

these are reasons given by a diplomat, reasons that

appear plausible on the surface, but reasons  which

cannot really stand up to critical examination. For

example,  Malay  is also the national  language  of

Singapore.  Then  there is freedom  of  worship  in

Singapore as well as in the Federation. And we have

already indicated that we would accept the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong as our constitutional head, just  as

Queen    Elizabeth   II   is   accepted   as    the

constitutional  head  of the British  Commonwealth.

Therefore,  these reasons given by  the  Federation

Government are not the true reasons; they  are  not

reasons  that can stand up to critical examination.

What  then  are  the  true reasons  that  prevented

merger in the past? Sir, they are reasons which the

Prime  Minister has repeated times out  of  number.

They are reasons which the Prime Minister has often

quoted  in this House in the past. They are reasons

which  are  on  record  in the  Fourth  Anniversary

Souvenir  of the Petir - reasons which the Tunku  had

admitted as such in the Special General Assembly of

the U.M.N.O. in Kuala Lumpur on 5th November, 1961.

The reasons are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore has too many Chinese;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Singapore has too many Leftists.



<br><br>Sir, whether we like it or not, these are the basic

fears  of the present Government of the Federation.

They  had  been  used  by the  Federation  for  not

wanting merger in the past, and they are still  the

reasons  given  for the continued division  of  our

country and our peoples today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. So must our outlook.

"Times have changed so must our outlook", says  the

Tunku. How have the times changed? The number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  in Singapore continue only to increase  by

natural growth. So has the number of Leftists.  Let

us,  therefore, find out how this change of outlook

has come about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this so-called merger issue involves

Singapore and the Federation. First, let us take  a

look   of   things  in  the  Federation.   In   the

Federation,  progressive forces are  daily  gaining

ground,  both in the town and in the country.  More

and  more support is going to the Socialist  Front,

as was demonstrated in the recent elections. Though

the  U.M.N.O. is still firmly in the saddle,  they

cannot  afford to be complacent any further.  There

is  every  indication that the  Tunku  is  becoming

anxious and a little apprehensive. If the socialist

forces -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering whether this

motion  which we are now debating would open  up  a

debate on the policy of the Federation in regard to

this  particular  subject. I am not  quite  certain

whether the hon. Member is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you will allow me, Sir, I

am  going  to  show  you  the different  situations

existing in the Federation and in Singapore. It  is

only by comparison and contrast that you see things

more  clearly. It will be very short. Sir,If  the

socialist forces are allowed to develop and  expand

unimpeded, then there is every possibility that the

present Government may be ousted from office in the

Federation  in the not too distant future.  But  by

and  large, it is unlikely that there will  be  any

major change in the Federation political situation,

at  least  not until the next general elections  in

1964.  And except for occasional news of skirmishes

at the Thai-Malayan border, all is peace and quiet.

The   U.M.N.O. is  still  the  strong  and  stable

Government that can claim to represent the majority

of  the people, and the Prime Minister is still the

respected  Prime  Minister of  the  people  of  the

Federation.  But in Singapore, Sir - now  I  come  to

Singapore - the  picture is entirely different.  Here

we  have  an unstable Government that by no stretch

of  the  imagination  can claim  to  represent  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 298</b></font><br><br>



We   have   a  Prime  Minister  who  is  completely

discredited  in  the  eyes of the  people.  Once  a

strong and robust Government with 43 out of  51  in

this House, it is now weak and wobbly with only  26

seats.  The  original majority of 35  has  dwindled

down to a majority of only one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the Government stays in office only on

sufferance.  There  is  no doubt  in  the  mind  of

everyone,  both inside and outside Singapore,  that

the  present P.A.P. Government is on its last legs.

That  the  leadership  has  had  to  get  all   the

Assemblymen   still  existing  on  the   Government

benches, to sign a pledge to support the leadership

of  the  P.A.P., shows how desperate  they  are  in

their  efforts and in their anxiety  to  remain  in

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the exposure of the true opportunistic

nature of the P.A.P. leadership, a great change has

taken  place  in Singapore in the last few  months.

These changes, Sir, have put the fear of God in the

hearts  of the Prime Minister and his opportunistic

friends.  It is a political situation in which  the

P.A.P.,  after having held the political  stage  of

Singapore for a time, is now on the decline and  on

its  way  out. A new star, Sir, has arisen.  It  is

outshining  the  P.A.P. and it  will  not  be  long

before  the  P.A.P. will be totally eclipsed.  This

new  star, Sir, is the Barisan Sosialis. And it  is

this  new force in Singapore politics, the  Barisan

Sosialis,  that  has caused our Prime  Minister  to

belly-crawl to the Federation for help -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think

I  can  allow that expression of a Member  of  this

Assembly. I myself do not know how to do it. But  I

would  suggest  that  the  word  "belly-crawl"   is

unparliamentary.  Will  the  Member  withdraw  that

word?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw, Sir. May I

substitute kow-tow? Let me, Sir, briefly,, in order

that   we   may  better  understand  the  political

changes,  go back just a little into the background

to  the present Singapore situation. It will be all

very brief, Sir. With the heavy defeat in Hong Lim,

the Prime Minister and his -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The difficulty with the Chair

is  to try and see that motions do not overlap  one

another. It appears to me that what the hon. Member

is  saying may well be said in support of  his  own

motion which appears as item 10 on the Order Paper.

Perhaps it is inevitable that there should be  some

overlapping.  But  if there is to  be  overlapping,

then I would suggest that references should be just

in  passing  and  detailed remarks  be  made  on  a

particular  subject when we come to the  particular

motion to which the remarks apply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I, Sir, just show you how

merger  has been used as a diversion by the  P.A.P.

to  distract the attention of the people  from  the

failings  of the Party leadership? I want  to  show

you  how  this was deliberately taken out and  made

into an issue during the Anson by-election.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I will have to

try  and  draw a line somewhere. May I  remind  the

hon. Member again of the terms of the motion we are

debating,  i.e., the House is asked to  affirm  and

declare  "that  the  first objective  of  all  true

patriots  of Malaya is to achieve the reunification

of  these  two territories in a merger of Singapore

with  the  Federation of Malaya." I understand  the

Member for Queenstown to indicate that perhaps this

is  not an appropriate time for merger. If that  is

so, he will, I have no doubt, move an amendment  on

those  lines. But, of course, that is left entirely

to  him.  But  I cannot see how the  Hong  Lim  by-election,  or  what use was made of merger  in  the

Hong  Lim by-election, has anything to do with  the

motion itself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That was only an aside. Sir.

What  I  intended  to mention  was  the  Anson  by-election. May I inform you also, Sir, that I intend

to  move  an amendment? I will mention that  as  I

come  to the appropriate part of my speech. I  will

try  and  skip some parts of it. The Prime Minister

knew, even before the rise of the Barisan Sosialis,

that he was faced with a situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



that was a challenge to his leadership. He did  not

meet this challenge in a democratic way. Instead he

conjured  up the old trick of the colonial  master - the Communist bogey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history has shown that whenever a despot or

a   dictator   is  confronted  with  an   untenable

political  situation, when the growing unpopularity

of  the dictator brings with it mounting unrest and

instability  inside  the  country,  the   unpopular

dictator  seeks some foreign diversion to  distract

the attention of the people, away from the real and

genuine  grievances. Similarly  in  Singapore.  The

discredited  P.A.P. leadership  has  to  find  some

diversion  for  the people so that their  attention

may be distracted from the failings and blunders of

the P.A.P. That diversion, Sir, is merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always shouted, "independence-through-merger." And since they have been exposed

as  pro-colonial  in spite of all  the  show  about

Lumumba, the Algerian Fund and mock protests  about

the  British bases, this merger issue, in  addition

to   being   a  diversion,  would  also   give   an

opportunity  to the P.A.P. to put up the  time-worn

mask  and smokescreen of the "independence-through-merger"  slogan to refute the charge of being

pro-colonial.  Of  course, this will  not  deceive  the

people.  Though  they are trying  to  suggest  that

their type of merger is a panacea for all the  ills

in  Singapore, the truth is that with  merger,  the

Prime  Minister  hopes to be  able  to  defeat  and

eliminate his political opponents with the help  of

his  Federation friends. He will then  he  able  to

remain in office and live happily ever after.  That

is what the Prime Minister thinks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first let me show how the P.A.P made merger

the  issue  at the Anson by-election. On 2nd  June,

1961, six unionists had come out with their  first

statement  asking  for full and  complete  internal

self-government as the minimum demand in  the  1963

constitutional talks. This included  the  abolition

of the Internal Security Council. The Tunku on 27th

May,  1961, had already come out with the  Malaysia

Plan,  and  the  Prime Minister  of  Singapore  had

responded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



with  full support on the 3rd of June, 1961.  Thus,

to  go  one  better on his critics,  Dr  Toh,  the

Chairman  of the P.A.P., declared that  the  P.A.P.

Government  would  in the June 1963  constitutional

talks seek "complete eradication of colonialism  in

Singapore, asking for complete independence through

merger  with  the  Federation or  within  a  larger

federation."  So  what began as a skirmish  in  the

Hong  Lim  by-election - I will not mention  anything

about  Hong Lim -  had become in Anson a real battle-ground,  for contending Parties and candidates,  on

the  question  of  the  constitutional  future   of

Singapore. The S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance called  for

a  confederation in which there would  be  separate

electoral registers and separate legislatures, with

a   Joint  Consultative  Committee  to  co-ordinate

economic,  financial and other  policies.  External

defence and the like would be under the control  of

the   Federation  Government.  This,  Sir,  is   an

arrangement  which  would not give  the  people  of

Singapore any say in the appointment or removal  of

their  Government. We know how the people of  Anson

had  rejected  this plan. But the P.A.P. went  one

further. It was merger. Merger then, but we know it

is  different now. So you see, Sir, the P.A.P. had

deliberately brought out this question of merger in

Anson,  and had made it clear that a vote  for  the

P.A.P. was  a  vote for the merger policy  of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need, Sir, to quote how the P.A.P. had

made  merger their cardinal issue in Anson. It  had

all  been  done by the Member for Anson during  the

last  so-called crisis debate on the 20th of  July,

1961.  But I would like to quote just one from  the

Straits  Times  of  26th  June,  1961.  The   Prime

Minister was reported to have said, "We must accept

the   Tenku's   Malaysian  proposal.  Confederation

acceptable to states concerned because Malays would

still form the predominant part of the population."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Sir, the P.A.P., thinking they were

going to win, had taken great pains to explain that

Anson is a typically representative constituency in

Singapore. Which means that if the P.A.P. had won



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



they   would  have  claimed  that  the  people   of

Singapore,  as a whole, had given their support  to

the P.A.P. merger plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise the political situation then

existing,  Sir, in the Federation and in  Singapore

in a few words. In the Federation, on the one hand,

there  is a stable U.M.N.O. Government, that though

firmly  in  the saddle, is nevertheless fearful  of

the  slow  but  steady inroads  into  the  U.M.N.O.

spheres  of influence made by progressive socialist

forces   in  the  town  and  in  the  country.   In

Singapore,   on  the  other  hand,   there   is   a

discredited and unstable P.A.P. Government that has

lost  the support of the people: so the leaders  of

the  P.A.P. have to find a scapegoat for their  own

failings. That scapegoat is the Left. Now that  the

Barisan Sosialis has been formed, the P.A.P. has to

face  a  strong, virile Opposition  that  is  daily

growing  stronger and stronger and  that  is  daily

getting more and more support from the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why did you stop your mass

rally?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Both the Federation Government

and  the Singapore P.A.P. Government have a  common

fear of the socialist forces. Both the Governments,

therefore,  have a common interest  in  suppressing

opposing socialist forces. But despite this  common

interest  to  knock out the socialist  forces,  the

Federation  still would not want to dabble  in  the

affairs  of  Singapore. Because of Singapore's  too

many   Chinese  and  too  many  Leftists,  a  bait,

therefore, had to be used. What then was  the  bait

that  was  made  and offered to the Federation?  in

other  words, how did our Prime Minister induce  an

anti-merger  Federation to accept the P.A.P. brand

of merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders have always boasted of

their  skill  and ingenuity in meeting awkward  and

difficult  situations. I have  no  doubt  they  put

their  skill and ingenuity to good use.  Since  the

Tunku  is  unhappy  and fearful  of  the  expanding

influence of the socialist forces, what better line

is there then to increase this fear? Because of the

two fears - too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



many  Chinese and too many Leftists -  the Tunku  has

been led into the belief that, of the two evils, he

has to choose one, whichever is the lesser. And the

Tunku is convinced by these frightening stories  of

the Prime Minister of Singapore. So he now proposes

to  acquire  Singapore, to  take  the  path  where

previously even angels feared to tread.  The  Prime

Minister  may think he can congratulate himself  on

his  success for having persuaded the Tunku to fall

in  with his personal objects and plans. But let me

tell  him  this.  The name Lee  Kuan  Yew  will  be

remembered in history like those of Wang Cheng-wei,

Syngman Rhee. Chiang Kai-shek. That is what he  is,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir, on a point of

information.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is not giving way. Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this motion must

therefore  be  viewed in the light of the  P.A.P.'s

impending  demise. We have seen how  its  desperate

leaders  are clutching at every straw in  order  to

keep themselves in office. The P.A.P. is trying  al

all  costs  to  get Singapore under  the  political

control  of the Federation Government and it  hopes

that  the Federation Government will save  it  from

its inevitable downfall by doing the dirty work -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What dirty work?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of removing its political

opponents from the political field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "merger", instead of symbolising the

noble aim of uniting our peoples, now symbolises  a

manoeuvre  of  the P.A.P. so that it may  safeguard

its  political future. Sir, the meaning of the word

"merger" has been stretched beyond all recognition.

It  is  clear, as you have already indicated,  Sir,

that when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. talks about merger, they do not mean

what you or I and everybody else understands by

merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Member for

Queenstown  must  have  misunderstood  the   Chair,

because  the  Chair never dabbles in politics.  The

Chair  has not enunciated what true merger is.  Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we are dealing with

desperate men struggling for survival. We have seen

how everyday events and personal conversations have

been twisted and misrepresented -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Take action.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - so as to lit in with

their  diabolical  schemes. Sir,  we  cannot  trust

desperate  men with blank cheques. We must,  as  it

were,  fill up the cheque before giving it to them,

and  it  has therefore become necessary for  us  to

state  what  we mean by merger in this  motion.  We

must ensure that the Government does not debase the

word "merger" to mean something entirely different.

Even   the   Tunku  has  said  that   the   present

arrangement is not a merger. I will therefore  move

an  amendment to the motion before the House at the

end  of my speech as follows. Would you like me  to

tell you my amendment now. Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My amendment reads as follows,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "a" in the last line to the

end, and to insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation

of Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation

as the twelfth State and with all its citizens

automatically becoming Federal citizens on Merger

Day".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have a copy of the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated the

difficulty of the Chair in the matters we are faced

with regarding substantive motions on the question

of merger between Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



There is also the motion in respect of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech which also would touch  on

merger.  Therefore,  the difficulty  the  Chair  is

faced with is, how far could procedural barriers be

placed  in  debates on one motion if  there  is  an

overlapping in other motions? It appears to me that

this  amendment might be said to overlap the motion

which the Prime Minister will be moving later on in

connection   with   the   White   Paper   on    the

reunification  of Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya. That portion reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House accepts the heads of agreement

set out in the White Paper -'



<br><br>and  one  of the heads of agreement is "Citizenship

and Nationality". The Member for Queenstown has, in

fact,  consulted me on this amendment. I  have  had

the  opportunity of studying this amendment  rather

carefully,  and  it seems to me that  it  would  be

convenient  for the Assembly to debate this  aspect

of  merger which appears. I suppose, to be  one  of

the  great points of deviation between the  Barisan

Sosialis and the Government. So on that argument, I

propose to allow this amendment. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, to the people of

Singapore - and  I  am sure to the P.A.P. of  bygone

days as well - merger has always meant one thing  and

one  thing  only.  It  is  the  complete  political

integration of Singapore and the Federation, with a

common    electoral   register   and   a    central

administration and legislature. In other words,  it

means  a  true  and  genuine reunification  of  the

territories  and  peoples  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation,  with all the people sharing  a  common

citizenship and a common life and destiny.  To  put

it  in  another way, merger or genuine  integration

means the entry of Singapore into the Federation as

one  of  its constituent States, with all Singapore

citizens becoming Federation citizens, having equal

rights  and  equal  status with  the  rest  of  the

Federation  citizens. Let me explain the importance

of   this  sharing  a  common  political  life  and

destiny.  In  the  Federation  today,  the  Federal

Parliament   is  representative  of   the   Malayan

electorate as a whole. The Federal citizens  living

in  a constituent State, say Johore, may stand  for

election



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Federal Parliament in any constituency  in

any  State - Perak  or  Kedah for  instance - in  the

Federation  and  have the right  to  influence  the

people  throughout the length and breadth of Malaya

on  all  political issues. In turn, the  people  of

Johore,   for   example,   may   elect   as   their

representative,  any  citizen  from  outside  their

State - for  example,  from Perak  or  Selangor - who

seeks to represent them. That is, they in turn  can

be  influenced  by people throughout  Malaya.  This

right  to influence and be influenced, is the right

of  every fellow citizen in the country. It is  all

for  the  common  good. It  is  one  of  the  basic

conditions   for  the  practice  of   parliamentary

democracy. It is a pre-condition for ensuring  that

the  Federal  Parliament  reflects  the  views  and

aspirations  of  the people as a  whole.  It  is  a

condition  which  we  now  have  in  Singapore.   A

Singapore  citizen now has the right  to  influence

and be influenced by his fellow citizens throughout

the   island.  But  what  does  the  constitutional

arrangement  of the P.A.P. amount to? According  to

the  Tunku, "the merger proposals between Singapore

and the Federation amount to an association of such

a  nature  as  would  recognise the  Federation  of

Malaysia   with  Singapore  as  partners   in   one

identity". Note, Sir, the words "the Federation  of

Malaysia" and "partners".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now examine the various aspects of merger.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to deal with

the  very  important citizenship issue in  all  its

aspects.  Then if you will allow me, Sir,  I  shall

discuss   the   word  "national"  and   the   words

"proportional representation".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,In

view of the decision you have made in allowing this

amendment, may I suggest that motion No. 7 be taken

and  debated together with motion No. 5,  otherwise

we  shall  be debating this matter twice over,  Mr

Speaker. I do not want to have to answer the Member

for  Queenstown  and  no doubt  other  speakers  on

citizenship, nationality, a common political  life,

and   people  living  in  Singapore  standing   for

elections  in Trengganu, and so on, and repeat  the

whole business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



again  in motion No. 7. If I may suggest. I  would

say that we put motion No. 5 as it is as the first

limb  of  the  motion, and motion No.  7

as the second  limb  of  the motion.  No.  7  being  then

amended  by  the amendment proposed by the  Member

for Queenstown who will ask for those words to  be

deleted - the one in No. 7 - and to say that  what  he

asks  for in merger is, as he has stated, complete

with   all   reserve  powers  and  with  automatic

conversion    from   Singapore   citizenship    to

Federation citizenship. Then we will have disposed

of  the  whole of the question at the end  of  the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was hoping that that suggestion

could  have  been put to the Speaker before  today

because, as I have indicated, it is difficult  for

the  Chair to draw lines between the three motions

I  have mentioned. The three motions are as  shown

in  item 5, which we are now debating, item 7* and item  10+. If  it  is for the convenience  of  the

Assembly  that  all aspects of the merger  between

Singapore and the Federation should now be touched

on, then the procedure would be that the debate on

which we have now entered would range over item  7

and  item  10; and then after the debate has  been

completed, there will only be a vote, if a vote is

called for on a division, on item 7 and item 10.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Motion (Item) No 7 reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House accepts the heads of agreement set out in the White Paper Cmd.33

of 1961 agreed to between the Government of the State of Singapore and the

Federation of Malaya as a working basis for a reunification of the two territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Item 10 reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly views with grave concern and anxiety the exclusion of the Opposition

Parties in the current "merger" negotiations, and demands that the Government convene

forthwith an All-Party Conference to discuss and to agree on all basic questions on the

constitutional future of Singapore; and failing agreement, demands that the Government

seek without delay a new mandate from the people.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it. We are prepared

for the debate to commence now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that event then, Members will be

permitted  to range over items 7 and 10,  so  that

the  Member  for Queenstown could  now  cover  all

aspects of the suggested merger between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. So we will

have  a  complete picture before  the  House,  and

Members will then be able to know how to vote when

we come to items 7 and 10.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, can you

please  explain once more the voting procedure?  I

am not very clear about that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The parliamentary procedure is

this.  If  there  are several motions  before  the

Assembly  which appear to overlap or, in fact,  do

overlap, then it is permissible, with the  assent

of  hon. Members of course, for the debate on  one

motion  to  range over the aspects  of  the  other

motions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular instance, we are now debating

item  5,  which has the word "merger" in  it,  and

which  the  hon.  Member  for  Queenstown  is  not

satisfied with. And in order to explain why he  is

dissatisfied   with  merger,  he  has   moved   an

amendment which in effect asks permission to range

over  certain  items which have  been  covered  in

Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, the subject matter of  the

motion  standing in the name of the Prime Minister

as  item 7 on the Order Paper. Then again, in item

10,  we  also  have  a motion on  merger  and  the

constitutional  future  of  Singapore - the   motion

standing   in   the  names  of  the  Members   for

Queenstown and Havelock - which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly views with grave concern and

anxiety the exclusion of the Opposition Parties in

the  current  `merger' negotiations,  and  demands

that the Government convene forthwith an All-Party

Conference  to discuss and to agree on  all  basic

questions   on   the  constitutional   future   of

Singapore; and failing agreement, demands that the

Government  seek without delay a new mandate  from

the people.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



That  appears to me also to be an offshoot of  the

whole subject which we are discussing today. And I

think  it  would be convenient if  that  could  be

done,  as  that would, as the Prime  Minister  has

pointed   out,   obviate   any   over-lapping   or

repetition which might become tedious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker, Sir.





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member for Queenstown

addressing the Chair on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only

wondering if you will allow us to adjourn at  this

hour so that we can discuss this properly - just  in

case  we should mistake things. We do not want  to

go wrong.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Marshall, on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Entirely, Sir. I was wondering,

Sir,  whether item No. 10 is purely procedural.  I

rather like the idea of joining items 5 and 7,  if

you  so  feel; then we can cover the  points  with

substance. Item No. 10 merely raises a question of

procedure - the way the Opposition is being  treated

on the question of having an All-Party Conference.

The  speeches are already inordinately lengthy and

can  be expected to be so. Could we keep that  one

apart, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I raise a further point?

My  inclination  is  very  much  in  the  opposite

direction. I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that since you want  to

include item 10 in it, you might as well allow the

speeches to range over that part of item 8* which is covered in the amendment proposed by the Member

for  Queenstown. And then at the end  of  this  no

doubt    lengthy,   exhaustive   and    fruitful - I

hope - debate, we would at least have come  to  some

conclusion and finality on all aspects of  merger,

and  could  then  go on to discuss  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech,  the   Federation   of

Malaysia  on principle, Nepotism, and a Commission

of Inquiry.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*Item 8 reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of Singapore, express our thanks

to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on behalf of

the Government at the opening of the present session of this Assembly.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh (Member for Queenstown):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an amendment, "at end, to add -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but regrets that the Government is pursuing a "merger" policy of unequal

rights contrary to the interests of the people of the two territories, and

urges the Government to re-orientate its policy in confirmity with the ardent

desires of the people for genuine unification'."

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point raised by the Member for

Anson perhaps has been well taken, because it  is,

in  fact, an off-shoot of the whole debate.  I  do

not  know  whether the Prime Minister agrees  that

item  10  perhaps  would bring  in  matters  which

could, in fact, be easily separated from the  main

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my only

intention  is to avoid having to repeat ourselves.

I  know that we are all very interesting to listen

to.  We  have  written speeches or have  memorised

speeches written by us; and, of course,  it  is  a

bit  upsetting if we have to repeat  these  things

too often.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well then, I will allow the debate

to  range over item 7, and I agree with the  Prime

Minister  that  the amendment of  the  Member  for

Queens-town which escaped me, and of which  notice

has been given, and which he wishes to move to the

Address  of  Thanks, also covers the same  subject

matter of merger between the two territories;  and

therefore perhaps the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



could  range over that as well. I also  agree  with

the  Member  for Anson that item No. 10  should  be

kept separate. But it is a major departure from the

procedure we are following now and I do agree  with

the  Member  for Queenstown that he is entitled  to

some  consultation,  and  I  therefore  propose  to

suspend this sitting until 5.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="center"><b>(SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on motion resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position now is that the debate

may range over all aspects of merger as covered  by

item  5, that is, the motion I have just read, item

7,  the  motion standing in the name of  the  Prime

Minister,  on  the White Paper on reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, and on such

aspects  in  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech

which  touch  on  merger, including  the  amendment

which  is  proposed to be moved by the  Member  for

Queenstown as shown in item 8*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, after completing his

speech on all aspects of merger covered by items 5,

7  and  8,  will,  as  he has indicated,  move  his

amendment to the motion set out in item No. 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate will then be confined to this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the amendment has been disposed of, the

debate  will  continue  on all  aspects  of  merger

covered  by  items 5, 7 and 8 of  the  Order  Paper

other than the aspect already disposed of, that is,

the  amendment proposed to be moved by  the  Member

for Queenstown to item 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the debate, a vote will he taken on

item 5 in the first instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When items 7 and 8 are called, no Member will be

permitted  to speak again on the topic  of  merger,

but the Prime Minister in regard to item 7 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



the   Member  for  Queenstown  in  regard  to   his

amendment  as  shown in item  8  may,  if  they  so

desire, propose the motion as shown in item  7  and

the  amendment  as  shown in  item  8  respectively

simpliciter for the purpose of taking a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reduced all that to writing, and I propose

to  pass  copies of that ruling to Members so  that

they  will  have that ruling before them  when  the

debate continues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any matter requires elucidation, perhaps hon.

Members will indicate.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> As indicated by the

hon.  Member  for Queenstown, it is of  a  sweeping

character. I wonder whether you will permit Members

when  speaking - since the Member for  Queenstown  is

going  to  move  the  amendment,  we  will  all  be

speaking  after - to speak on all the items indicated

by  you  and  not limit ourselves to the  issue  of

citizenship.  You  see, the Member  for  Queenstown

does speak of genuine and complete merger. Could we

not  speak  on  items 5, 7 and 8 so  that,  if  the

amendment is lost, there is no question of speaking

again on any of the motions?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think paragraph 2 of the ruling

meets the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Member will move his amendment.

I was referring to paragraph 3, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The position will be as shown

in  paragraph  2. The Member for Queenstown,  after

completing  his  speech on all  aspects  of  merger

covered  by  items  5, 7 and  8  will,  as  he  has

indicated, move his amendment to the motion set out

in item 5. Once that amendment is moved, the debate

will  be  confined to the aspects of that amendment

to  start  off with. But the Member for Queenstown,

of  course,  having  already spoken  to  the  main,

motion and on all aspects covered in items 5, 7 and

8, will not be able to speak again. I trust that is

all clear.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I just seek elucidation on

this point? The debate will be on the amendment  to

be moved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



by the Member for Queenstown to item 5. But will he

then be again making another amendment as stated in

item 8?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Item 8 contains the amendment of

which the Member for Queenstown has given notice in

the  usual  way.  I have indicated that  he  should

speak  on every aspect covered not only by items  5

and 7 but also by his own amendment. Then when item

8  is  called and the motion has been duly proposed

by  the  Prime Minister, the Member for Queenstown,

if  he  so  desires, could just move the  amendment

simpliciter only for the purpose of taking a vote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

one  more  small point. Coming back to paragraph  3

here,  "Debate  will  then  be  confined  to   this

amendment." That means that while I am speaking  on

the amendment of the Member for Queenstown, I would

not be allowed to wander around, say, to item 7  or

item 8?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position is that the Member for

Nee  Soon  then would be entitled to speak  on  the

amendment, as every other Member would be  entitled

to   speak  on  the  amendment,  alone.  After  the

amendment has been disposed of, the Member for  Nee

Soon  not  having  spoken to the main  motion,  can

speak again to the main motion and range over  item

7 and item 8. Dr Lee will continue his speech.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I

wish  to  deal with the very important  citizenship

issue   in  all  aspects.  Then  I  shall   discuss

"national" and proportional representation. Then  I

shall discuss this so-called autonomy on labour and

education,  which is being used as a sop  to  cover

this lack of proportional representation. After all

that, I shall then discuss whether the P.A.P.'s so-called  merger  proposals will help us  attain  the

desirable  objectives which merger is  supposed  to

achieve,  namely, independence, economic prosperity

and national unity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate, Sir, that the Federation is

prepared only to accept Singapore as a partner.  In

fact, the Federation only wants our country but not

our  people.  It  wants our country  only,  if  the

political  influence  of the  people  of  Singapore

could be reduced to the minimum. Thus we find  that

the  P.A.P.'s  brand of merger is an unholy  scheme

whereby  the people of Singapore become politically

castrated   by  being  segregated,  with   separate

citizenship and without proportional representation

in the Federal Parliament. This, Sir, is worse than

second-class   citizenship   to   the   people   of

Singapore. Thus, under the P.A.P. scheme of things,

the  political influence of the people of Singapore

will  be  kept  to  the  minimum  possible  by  two

methods: (1) by segregating the people of Singapore

from  the  people of the Federation under  separate

citizenship  arrangements; (2) by  not  giving  the

people  of  Singapore  the  right  of  proportional

representation in the Federal Parliament. These are

ugly  features which the P.A.P. hopes to  sugarcoat

and  make  acceptable to our people. It is  against

this    background   of   unholy   intrigues    and

machinations that we must view the P.A.P.'s present

propaganda on "merger" (inverted commas),  "merger"

in   general  and  on  the  citizenship  issue   in

particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point let me first

answer the malicious falsehood put up by the P.A.P.

that  we  in  the Barisan Sosialis  are  afraid  of

merger  because we are afraid of internal  security

being  controlled  by the Central Government.  Even

last  night  over Radio Singapore, which  has  now

become  the private organ of the P.A.P., the  Prime

Minister  repeated the same falsehood. He  said  we

are opposing his so-called merger plans because  we

are  afraid that Internal Security will come  under

the  control  of  a strong Central Government.  The

only  truth in this, Sir, is that he has  admitted,

by  implication,  that his own  Government  is  not

strong, and this, the whole lot of people, everyone

of us, already know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already stated in the most

unequivocal  terms  that we are fully  prepared  to

accept  a complete merger, and we will only be  too

glad  to say "yes" if the Tunku says tomorrow  that

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



should have complete merger. As everybody realises,

and  the Prime Minister above all, though he is not

prepared to admit this, internal security will  be,

of   course,  under  the  control  of  the  Central

Government in a complete merger. Where then is  the

truth  of the Prime Minister's statement?  Sir,  we

are  prepared  to  accept a  complete  and  genuine

merger even when we are fully aware that this means

that the internal security of Singapore will, under

such an arrangement, come under the control of  the

Central  Government. We are fully  aware  that  the

socialist  forces in Singapore will after  complete

merger  face  the  probability of  having  to  make

certain  sacrifices - sacrifices which our socialist

comrades  in  the Federation are now  making.  But,

Sir, we are prepared to make these sacrifices.  The

Secretary-General of my Party, Mr Lim Ching Siong,

has  said as much at the inaugural meeting  of  the

Barisan Sosialis on the 17th of September.  Let  me

quote  him - Straits Times, Monday,  18th  September,

1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"As one who has tasted political detention and

repression, I say [this is what Ching Siong said we

are prepared for this sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As socialists we should not allow our personal

security to stand in the way of national unity...".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever one may think of the political

views of Mr Lim Ching Siong, no one can doubt  his

sincerity and dedication. This is more than what we

can  possibly  say of the Prime Minister,  Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member does know the

Standing  Order which says he must not refer  to  a

Member by name.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will repeat then. Sir, that

this is more than what can possibly be said for the

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong has suffered Imprisonment for

his  political convictions, and I have no doubt  he

is   prepared  for  further  sacrifices  if  it  is

necessary to bring about a genuine reunification of

our people. Is our Prime Minister, Sir, prepared to

do  the same? As far as we know, he is not prepared

even  to risk being considered dotty, let alone  go

to prison for the interests of our people -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain

whether I heard the word "dotty" being used.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> "Dorothy" or

something like that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member for Queenstown

indicated  what word he used? Did he  use  "dotty",

meaning a lunatic?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I did say "dotty", Sir. I

merely quoted the Prime Minister himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Huh?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know of no occasion when

the  Prime Minister called himself dotty.  I  think

that  word  with  reference  to  a  Member  of  the

Assembly  is  unparliamentary  and  ought   to   he

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will leave it out, Sir, but

I  can  quote chapter and verse if you like.  I  am

sure you do not think that is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told

that,  in  fact,  our Prime Minister  once  told  a

political  detainee that he would  like  to  go  to

prison in order to glorify his political career -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> At least he is prepared to,

but are you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But then it should be only - you

see,  this is the snag - for a few days, and provided

he would be allowed to stay by the seaside -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> And play golf.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I may add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order. Sir, can a

Member    of   this   Assembly   be   so    grossly

misrepresented  when  he has never  said  any  such

thing to anybody?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is not a point of

order.  It  might perhaps amount  to  an  abuse  of

privilege,  but  I do not see any  privilege  being

abused in this particular instance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, Sir, I may add, as

some  of  the Members over this side of the  House

have  been saying, provided they also build him  a

golf course within the prison grounds -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated earlier on

that I am not going to allow any personalities  to

creep  into  this debate. I think the  Member  for

Queenstown did hear me very clearly and he  should

take cognizance of what the Chair desires.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, we in the

Barisan  Sosialis are prepared to make  sacrifices

for  genuine  reunification. But  no  one  in  his

sanity  will  be  prepared to sacrifice  for  this

phoney  merger which is a treacherous betrayal  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the vital question of

citizenship.  The  Prime  Minister  sometime  back

indicated that he would like to have a debate in a

forum on the citizenship question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why did you decline one?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Now is his chance. In fact,

only  last Friday at about 5.30 p.m. I received  a

very  urgent  letter from the acting Head  of  the

Broadcasting Department. He suggested  we  have  a

forum to discuss the White Paper tabled here  only

a couple of days back, and he wanted us to discuss

that  White  Paper in that forum.  I  think,  Sir,

since   you   have   always  been   ruling   about

anticipation,   this   is   a   gross   case    of

anticipation.  In my reply, I suggested  that  the

civil  servant  concerned should suggest,  to  his

Minister that a live broadcast be allowed for  the

proceedings that are taking place in the  Assembly

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> God forbid!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, the Member for

Queenstown  will  realise  that  that   would   be

completely  out of order and that  I  would  fight

with  all the rhetoric at my command against that.

The  Speaker  is against a live broadcast  of  any

debate in this Chamber.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That was why he invited you

to Radio Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us, Sir, examine how the

P.A.P. hopes to effect the political castration of

the  people of Singapore. Firstly, it appears that

the  Prime  Minister  hopes  to  achieve  this  by

confusing  the people with the use  of  the  magic

word "national". He hopes -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is a word which has

been  used by the Member for Queenstown  which  is

slowly  sinking into my tired brain. That  is  the

word  "castration".  I do  not  think  that  is  a

parliamentary  word to be used in  this  Assembly,

and I think he should avoid using that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Virile.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I suggest the word

"emasculation", Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think even the word

"emasculation"   is  akin  to  "castration"   and,

therefore, I will not allow that word either.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister hopes thus

to mislead the people into believing that there is

no   significant  difference  between   the   word

"citizen"  and the word "national". He would  like

the  people of Singapore to believe that a Federal

National  is  not  materially  different  from   a

Federal Citizen. That is point No. 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Prime Minister hopes to frighten a

large  number  of  the Singapore  electorate  into

believing  that  complete  merger  must  lead   to

automatic disenfranchisement of a large number  of

Singapore citizens. That is point No. 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the third one, the Prime Minister wants to

make the people believe is that it is unreasonable

to  demand  Federal citizenship for all  Singapore

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first brace the various statements made

by  the P.A.P. on the question of citizenship. Let

us  trace  their twists and turns over this  vital

matter  in  their attempt to fool the  people.  On

23rd August, 1961, the Prime Minister gave a Press

conference after the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



joint  statement  by  the two Prime  Ministers  was

issued.   While   the   joint  statement   stressed

Singapore's  autonomy on labour  and  education  as

important  principles to be agreed upon  beforehand

between   the   two   Prime   Ministers,   it   was

significantly  silent  on  the  vital  question  of

citizenship  rights for the Singapore citizen.  The

Prime   Minister,  when  pressed  by   a   reporter

dismissed the citizenship question as also  another

matter  for the Working Committee, to be considered

together  with other mundane things such as  postal

and telegraph communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I think almost everyone smelled a rat. We

had  all  along  suspected that the P.A.P. in  its

desperation was selling out the citizenship  rights

of  the people of Singapore in return for help  and

succour -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who is the sucker?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - from the Right-Wing

Government of the Federation. But as yet it was not

clear  to  the  people. We in the Barisan  Sosialis

immediately pressed for full citizenship rights for

all  Singapore  citizens in the, event  of  merger.

What  did  the P.A.P. Government do? They  threw  a

dirty  smoke bomb to confuse the citizenship  issue

instead. On 21st September, 1961, the Minister  for

Finance  at a radio forum [Interruption] said  that

according to the Federation Constitution -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have read it, have you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me quote from the Straits

Times of Friday, 22nd September, 1961. The Minister

for  Finance  said that it was impossible  for  all

Singapore  citizens to become Federal  citizens  on

complete  merger. That is what you  said,  did  you

not?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I can assure the Member for

Queenstown that I never said those words.  He  must

remember that he is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am sorry, Sir. The Minister

for Finance declared that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



complete    merger   would   mean   the   automatic

disenfranchisement  of about  half  of  Singapore's

citizens  who were not born in Singapore. The  next

day the Barisan Sosialis in a statement pointed out

the  falsehood of the statement of the Minister for

Finance. I will quote, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Do not be so long about it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - from the Straits Times of

23rd September, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Citizenship status after merger: Barisan points

to Federal Constitution'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Article 22.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And they point out that

Article 22 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The magic wand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The thing that kills the

P.A.P.  Article  22  of  the  Federal  Constitution

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any territory is admitted to the Federation

in  pursuance of Article 2, Parliament may  by  law

determine what persons are to be citizens by reason

of  their  connection with that territory  and  the

date  or  dates from which such persons are  to  be

citizens.'



<br><br>I  quote  further from the Straits  Times  of  23rd

September, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Article 2, the Barisan Sosialis statement said,

merely  provided for the admission of other  States

to   the  Federation  and  the  alteration  of  the

boundaries of any State.'



<br><br>Article  22  of the Federal Constitution  therefore

provides the Federal Government with full powers to

decide  on the terms of citizenship for the  people

of  a  new territory joining the Federation. It  is

crystal  clear to all, therefore, that the question

of  citizenship on merger is essentially  a  matter

for  negotiation - remember that - between the parties

concerned.  There  is no such  thing  as  automatic

disenfranchisement except when agreed upon  by  the

two parties concerned. Dr Goh's -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance's

intentional bluff was thus exposed -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

it proper for a Member of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



the Assembly to accuse another Member of bluffing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No bluff.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was under the impression

that  bluffing is a good attribute of a politician!

But  it  the Minister for Finance says that  it  is

offensive,    then,   of   course,    it    becomes

unparliamentary.  Probably on  second  thoughts  he

might  think it is not offensive, because it  might

well be that the Member for Queenstown is bluffing.

Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Although it has been shown

that  the  Minister for Finance has been  bluffing,

this did not stop the Prime Minister from repeating

this  same  falsehood in his many subsequent  Press

conferences. The Prime Minister, like Dr Goebbels.

evidently believes that a lie told often enough may

be taken for the truth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is so difficult for me to

draw the line. I have in the past drawn the line at

"lie"  and  I have allowed the word "falsehood".  I

have   also   allowed  the  words   "terminological

inexactitude".  Now I permit the  word  "falsehood"

but  I  will  never permit the word  "lie".  It  is

unparliamentary to use "lie".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I said

"lie", of course, I was referring to Dr Goebbels.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown

cannot get round my ruling by saying that. He  must

withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word "lie" and

I will substitute the word "falsehood".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon afterwards, the Prime Minister must have

realised that his bluff was not selling well  among

the  people. So he started to shift his ground.  In

graphic language, he tried to show that the  demand

for   automatic   citizenship  for  all   Singapore

citizens  was  unreasonable  because  of  what   he

claimed  to be different residential qualifications

for citizenship in the two territories. He compared

the citizenship demand with a dishonest blackmarket

operation  in currency. Let me quote him,  Sir.  He

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



talking  about citizenship and this is the relevant

portion  from  the Straits Times  of  Monday,  25th

September, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This, Mr Lee said, was like people crossing

frontiers with currency. One could change a  dollar

for  100  rupiahs on the black market and  then  on

returning, ask for conversion at the official  rate

of 30 rupiahs for a dollar.'



<br><br>Perhaps  our Prime Minister is an expert on  black-marketing, as we were told by the Member  for  Hong

Lim  at  the Chua Commission of Inquiry before  the

Hong  Lim  by-election that the Prime Minister  was

once a black marketeer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister further declared that he was

not  prepared  to put forward such an  unreasonable

demand,  as  he  thought  it  would  definitely  be

unacceptable to the Tunku. Our Prime Minister  also

intimated that the Tunku would also think him dotty

if  he brought up such a demand. I will quote  from

the  Straits  Times of Monday, 25th September. The relevant paragraph is this,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean I wouldn't for one moment put forward a

proposition  because the Tunku  may  think  that  I

[i.e., the Prime Minister have already gone dotty,"

the Premier added.'



<br><br>There  you  are,  right there, Sir!  Then  on  25th

October,  1961, again at one of his frequent  Press

conferences, our Prime Minister unabashedly



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Un-what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Unabashedly suggested that-let

me  quote him again. Sir. This is the Straits Times

of Thursday, 26th October, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee suggested that those who demanded

automatic Federation Citizenship should ask  their

friends in the Federation Parliament, such as  Mr

Lim Kean Siew, a Socialist Front leader.' -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A Front leader, not socialist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or Mr D. R. Seenivasagam,

of the People's Progressive Party, to introduce a

resolution supporting automatic conversion from

Singapore to Federation citizenship.'



<br><br>In  effect, our Prime Minister reluctantly admitted

that  it  was constitutionally possible and correct

to  have  automatic Federation citizenship for  all

Singapore  citizens. That is  as  we  have  pointed

out - the question of citizenship rights for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



Singapore citizens on merger is a matter which  the

Federal Parliament has the power to decide. But  at

the  same Press conference, our Prime Minister also

brought  in  another  red herring  to  confuse  the

picture.  He  said  that in a complete  merger  all

those  Singapore  citizens who  were  not  born  in

Singapore  would be required to register again  and

to  pass  a language test in addition to satisfying

the necessary residential qualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, summarise the twists and turns

of  the Prime Minister in his many attempts to find

an  excuse  for not fighting for equal  citizenship

rights   for  the  people  of  Singapore.  It   was

originally    supposed   to   be   constitutionally

"impossible."    Then    it   became    politically

"unreasonable," "dishonest," "black-marketing;" and

finally, it has become a matter of need for further

registration  and  requiring a language  test.  Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  let  me  ask:  why  has  the  Prime

Minister  got  to  twist and turn over  this  vital

question  of citizenship? Why? Why has  he  got  to

reveal information in dribs and drabs?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why must the Prime Minister -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> gesticulated. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose it is time for me

to intervene. Perhaps the Speaker did not intervene

in  view of all the levity that has been created by

a  lone  voice on the back bench of the Opposition!

May I perhaps point out that this is a very serious

subject  which we are discussing, and perhaps  less

levity would be more in keeping with it. The Member

for  Queenstown  also should  realise  that  he  is

endeavouring  to  put forward a  serious  point  of

view, and levity on his part would not advance  his

cause,  in  my opinion, more than he could  without

levity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave your

indulgence. To us in the Barisan Sosialis there  is

never a more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



serious question than this citizenship issue.  This

citizenship issue proves to the people of Singapore

that  the  Front Benchers of the P.A.P are  selling

the  rights  of  Singapore down the  river.  I  was

asking,   Sir,   why  have  they  got   to   reveal

information in dribs and drabs? And I want  to  ask

another  question, Sir. Why must they go on  trying

to strip and tease?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Strip tease.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The answer, Sir, is simple.

The  Prime Minister simply has not been telling the

truth.  He has not got the guts to tell the  people

the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,I

have  been  accused of many a thing.  It  has  been

suggested that parts of my abdomen be removed.  But

to  be  accused of not having guts, I think,  is  a

very serious proposition.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Hon, the  Prime  Minister  is  saying  that  that

expression  is  offensive.  I  have  allowed   that

expression in the past. I do recollect a Member  of

the  Front Bench on the Government side - I  do  not

wish to mention the name - using the same expression

in different circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

referring to the word "guts" literally. I have been

listening  with great admiration to the Member  for

Queenstown,  and  as he himself does  not  take  it

seriously, I wonder if he was using the word "guts"

in  its literal sense - that I do not have sufficient

bowels, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Since the Member for Queenstown is a

medical man, I suppose he should know. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I know more about guts than

the Prime Minister ever knows about anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that the Prime Minister simply

did not have the guts to tell the people the truth.

He  hopes to sell out in bits and pieces, at  times

heavily sugar-coated and at times he threw a  dirty

smoke  bomb  and  a dirty smokescreen.  The  people

might  be  misled.  In fact, the  P.A.P.'s  present

propaganda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



method  may  be  likened to throwing clay  pigeons.

They  throw a clay pigeon and you shoot,  Sir.  And

just  when  you think you have got it,  they  throw

another one for you to aim at.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will have had a lot of

practice then.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The idea being, of course, to

keep  us so busy and confused, shooting dummy  clay

pigeons  that we miss the real thing when  it  does

come  out.  We  know  they  are  quite  capable  of

confusing the people, Sir, for they have the  whole

propaganda  machinery of the State in their  hands,

including what has now become a very, very friendly

English Press. In the debates and arguments in  the

coming months, it will become more and more evident

that  the  P.A.P. cannot be trusted even on  simple

things like constitutional facts. They have shifted

their stand once too often. Only two days ago, Sir,

the Straits Times reported the Tunku as having said

at the Airport - let me quote, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

it  in  order for the hon. Member to have his  back

pointing [Laughter] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I did not hear that.

Will the Minister for Finance repeat it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I ask whether it is in

order  for  the Member to present his back  to  the

other side.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose it is another

protest about the use of a word which refers to the

anatomy of a person. But I would suggest once again

that this unseemly levity be stopped. Let us get on

with  the serious business of this debate. Even  if

levity is considered to be the best form of attack,

I would suggest it is not proper to use that attack

in this Assembly. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is the Straits Times of

Friday,  17th November, 1961. The Tunku was talking

about  merger and citizenship. "He reiterated  that

the present Federal Parliament would not, though it

could - I   stress,   Sir,  though   it   could - grant

automatic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



Federation  citizenship to  Singapore  citizens  on

merger". That clearly shows that the P.A.P. has all

along not been speaking the truth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Is it in order for the Member

for  Queenstown  to  quote  just  half  a  sentence

without  completing the rest of the sentence  which

gives the substance of the statement quoted?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Only extracts are allowed!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Hon. The Minister for

Finance  can point out that the subsequent sentence

or  sentences  are relevant, then, of  course,  the

Member for Queenstown will be asked to -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister please



take  his  seat? There seems to be too  much  of  a

hurry in this matter. If the Minister can assure me

that  the quotation is incomplete, then, of course,

I  will  ask the Member for Queenstown to  continue

with his quotation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

statement  quoted is very fresh in my  memory.  The

Tunku  did  say  that the Federal Parliament  could

grant  all Singapore citizens automatic conversion.

But he also added that they would not do so. And  I

suggest   that   this   omission   is   deliberate,

mischievous and dishonest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To satisfy the Minister for

Finance, I will even quote the following paragraph.

I  quoted  one full paragraph, Sir, a little  while

ago.  I  will  quote the following  paragraph.  The

following paragraph says -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it would be more

satisfactory if both paragraphs are quoted from the

very beginning.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will quote both paragraphs

then,  Sir,It  is  the  Straits  Times  of   17th

November, 1961. The heading is on merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He reiterated that the present Federal

Parliament  would  not,  though  it  could,   grant

automatic   Federation  citizenship  to   Singapore

citizens on merger.'



<br><br>Now  this  is  the  following paragraph  which  the

Minister for Finance is so eager to hear:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was because there had been laxity in awarding

the first citizenships in Singapore he said.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister for

Finance will his recollection of what for

Queenstown said in stance was wrong.

<br><br>Satisfied?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not hear the Member very

accurately,  Mr Speaker, Sir. For some  reason,  a

few words escaped my notice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If the Minister for Finance

did  not hear the Member for Queenstown accurately,

how could he stand up and protest?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Every Member in this Assembly

has a right to get up a point of order, provided it

is a point of order. And that was a point of order,

properly but mistakenly taken.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, he has a right. I

agree  with  you.  But  I would  suggest  that  the

Minister for Finance -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want a debate on my

ruling. Will the Member for Queenstown carry on?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will carry on, Sir. I was

only  going  to  suggest that he might  see  a  ear

specialist.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am getting a little tired

saying  "order". I would suggest that  Members  pay

some heed to the Chair, because the Chair might get

as  tough as the Prime Minister hopes to get in the

near future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will continue, Sir. Let me

first   state   the  Barisan  Sosialis   stand   on

citizenship. The stand of the Barisan Sosialis  has

been  clarified time and time again. I shall repeat

it here once more. Our stand is that every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  citizen should automatically  become  a

Federal citizen on merger. That is, on merger,  all

624,000 Singapore citizens, irrespective of whether

they  were  born  in Singapore,  India,  China,  or

Timbuctoo,   will  automatically   become   624,000

Federal  citizens. No more, no less. To us  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  this is, to use  the  favourite

phrase   of   the   Prime   Minister,   basic   and

fundamental. On this there can be no compromise, no

retreat,  because in the practice of  parliamentary

democracy, only citizens who have the vote will  be

able to elect representatives, or become elected as

representatives,  to  the Legislative  Assembly  or

Parliament.  And since the Legislative Assembly  or

Parliament is the highest seat of authority in  the

country,   it  means  that  only  those  who   have

representatives  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  or

Parliament  will have a say in the running  of  the

country. This is how the one man one vote system of

parliamentary democracy works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship entitles you to the right to vote and

to  stand  for election in any part of the country.

It  means  you  can  determine your  own  political

destiny. It means you can decide what your  society

should  be like. It means you can decide the extent

of  your freedom; the government you want; the  law

you  want  and  do  not want; the type  of  working

conditions you wish to have; the type of  education

you  wish your children to have; the type of health

facilities you would like, and so on and so  forth.

Citizenship  entitles  you to  play  your  part  in

effecting  political changes in your  country  that

will help improve the society you live in. It means

you can share with the rest of your fellow citizens

a common political life and destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the vote, of course, there are a host of

other  rights and privileges which are only enjoyed

by  citizens  and  not enjoyed by non-citizens.  In

Singapore, for example, only citizens get permanent

employment in the Government offices. Children born

in Singapore or are born of Singapore citizens, are

given   preference  over  others  for   places   in

Government schools. Only children born in Singapore

or born of Singapore citizens,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



will be awarded scholarships and bursaries in

schools  and universities. Only citizens get  legal

aid  and  public assistance. Only citizens  can  be

given  land  for  resettlement. Only  citizens  can

apply  for  Housing Board flats. Only Citizens  are

given Singapore passports. Citizens - and this  is  a

very  important point, Sir - cannot be banished  from

the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we see the importance of citizenship, Sir.

It is not something that comes into the life of the

people  only  at  election time. It  is  intimately

connected  with  every facet of our everyday  life.

The  way we live, work, eat, travel, learn,  study,

associate and so on. Sir, if merger is to have  any

meaning,  then the Singapore citizen must become  a

Federation  citizen. Only then will  the  Singapore

citizen  have the opportunity of sharing  a  common

political life and destiny with his brothers across

the  Causeway. If, the Singapore citizen  does  not

become a Federal citizen on merger, then merger has

lost  its  soul. It becomes meaningless. It  is  no

more merger. It is only a sell-out - the P.A.P. sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can realise, therefore, Sir, that citizenship

is  the  lifeblood of the people.  Any  person  who

claims  that he represents the people,  any  person

who  has the interests of the people at heart,  any

person elected by the people, must, therefore, bear

these  basic  interests of the people  in  mind  in

everything he does. He must fight for the  people's

rights, and especially when the person is the Prime

Minister  and  claims to represent  the  people  of

Singapore.  He  must  fight  for  these  basic  and

fundamental rights of the people of Singapore.  But

has the Prime Minister done that? Has he thought of

the  Federal  citizenship rights of the  people  of

Singapore?  No.  Instead  of  fighting  for   these

rights,  he  makes  excuses.  He  throws  up   clay

pigeons.  He  strips and teases. The  Minister  for

Finance first says it is impossible. Then the Prime

Minister  says  it is unreasonable;  and  then  the

Prime Minister says he would be "dotty". Let us now

examine  why our Prime Minister and his friends  do

not  want to fight for the rights of the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with the representation of the

Minister  for  Finance.  He  says  that  under  the

Federal  Constitution  it is impossible - impossible,

he  says -  to  have  automatic Federal  citizenship

rights  for  all Singapore citizens. He  says  that

complete  merger would automatically disenfranchise

about half of Singapore's 630,000 citizens who  are

not  born in Singapore. I have already quoted that,

Sir,  so it is not necessary for me to quote again.

Or  maybe  I did not quote, I think. May  I  quote,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is the Straits Times,

Friday, 22nd September. He says "nearly half of the

total   electorate   would   be   disenfranchised."

Similarly,  on  the  25th of September,  the  Prime

Minister  is reported to have said that  those  who

were  clamouring for complete merger knew  that  it

was  impossible  for Singapore citizens  to  become

Federal citizens automatically on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to say that there is no

such thing as impossible in the matter of advancing

the  interests  of the people. It  all  depends  on

whether  or not you have the will to do  it.  I  am

sure the Minister for Finance knows the saying that

if  there is a will, there is a way. The trouble is

that  the Minister for Finance has not got the will

to  fight for the people's interests any more. I am

sorry he is not here, Sir,I would like him to hear

this. He is now fighting for his personal political

survival which evidently depends on forces  outside

Singapore.  He knows that if he should go  back  to

Kreta  Ayer at the next general elections, he  will

be  very lucky if he does not lose his deposit. He,

therefore, has to consider first, the interests  of

forces outside Singapore, and not the interests  of

Singapore  itself. The interests of the  people  of

Singapore, to him, come second.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws, Sir, are made to serve man, not the other

way round. If a law does not serve the interests of

the people but merely obstructs the advancement  of

the people's interests, then it becomes our duty to

remove  or  modify  this law.  As  politicians  and

statesmen - that  is what the Prime  Minister  claims

himself to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



be -  it  is  our  duty to protect and  advance  the

interests of the people. Law and legal experts come

in  only to give legal expression and effect to the

interests  and  aspirations of our  people.  It  is

sheer  irresponsibility, to say the least, for  any

politician to refuse to fight for the interests  of

the  people, just because he chooses to think  that

certain laws are in the way. He should not  sit  by

and  just  cry "impossible". But since  the  P.A.P.

chooses to harp on constitutional limitations,  let

us  find out whether there is indeed any truth that

there  are laws existing which stand in the way  of

automatic  Federal  citizenship for  all  Singapore

citizens on merger. As I have said earlier  on,  we

in  the  Barisan Sosialis are students of politics.

We shall always be so. I am a medical doctor, not a

lawyer. Neither am I an economist pretending to  he

a  constitutional  expert. But  we  have  consulted

experts  in  our  own way. Sir, and  I  venture  to

suggest  to the Government Front Benchers  that  if

they doubt the Barisan Sosialis' interpretation  of

the  present constitutional position, they  are  at

liberty   to  go  and  consult  the  constitutional

experts,  both  inside and outside Malaya, on  the

matter.  Maybe the Prime Minister does not care  to

consult the experts any more because the Tunku  has

already  said that it is possible to have automatic

Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us see what the Federal Constitution

says  about  citizenship for the people  of  a  new

territory  joining the Federation  of  Malaya.  The

Constitution of the Federation requires  that  when

the  Federation Parliament admits a  new  territory

into  the Federation it must provide by law  as  to

who  from  the new territory are to be citizens  of

the Federation and when. This is known as automatic

citizenship on merger. Let me read it out once more

for  the record, Sir. Article 22 says (this  is  in

the Malayan Constitution Documents):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any new territory is admitted to the

Federation  in  pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament

may  by  law  determine  what  persons  are  to  he

citizens  by reason of their connection  with  that

territory  and  the date or dates from  which  such

persons are to be citizens.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 2 of the Federal Constitution merely

provides for the admission of new territories  into

the  Federation.  It is clear from  this  that  the

Federation  Parliament has complete  discretion  in

this  matter  and, therefore, on  the  question  of

citizenship,  either  in a  complete  or  a  phoney

merger,  it  has in any case to provide  the  exact

terms   of   citizenship.  It  is  crystal   clear,

therefore,  that  the  terms  of  citizenship   are

entirely  a  matter  for  negotiation  between  the

parties  concerned. In this case, the  two  parties

concerned are the representatives of Singapore  and

the  Federation.  The Federal  Parliament  has  the

power  to  say that none of the Singapore  citizens

should  become Federal citizens. It  has  also  the

power  to  say  that all of the Singapore  citizens

should  be  Federal, citizens.  It  is,  therefore,

absolute  nonsense for the Minister for Finance  to

say  that  under  the  Federal Constitution  it  is

impossible  for  all Singapore citizens  to  become

Federal   citizens   on   merger.   It   is    only

impracticable if the Federation Government  refuses

to  agree on this. But that is entirely a different

matter from being "constitutionally impossible", as

he alleges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of October, 1961, the Prime Minister,

in one of his numerous radio talks, alleged that "I

learned" - I will quote, Sir, from the Straits Times,

Tuesday,  10th  October, 196l - "for the  first  time

from the Minister for Finance at a radio forum that

out of (I will quote the figures as mentioned here)

650,000   Singapore  citizens,  only  half - about

325,000 - were born here and would automatically  get

Federal citizenship on complete merger." This, Sir,

is  false and the Prime Minister knows it is false;

for  to  state that "I learned" is to  say  that  I

learned  of the existence of a fact. It is  true  I

heard  the Minister for Finance say this, but  what

he said was not a fact but a falsehood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again there is no such thing as "automatic

disenfranchisement" except as to be provided by the

Federal  law  which will be passed by  the  Federal

Parliament  to admit Singapore into the  Federation

and  to provide for citizenship. Sir, it is of  the

utmost importance that the people of Singapore must

know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



that,  on merger, citizenship depends on an Act  of

the Federation Parliament, which in turn depends on

the  agreement  reached during negotations  between

the  two  Governments. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish  to

challenge  the  P.A.P. Government  to  seek  expert

opinion   on   constitutional  law,  whether   from

Singapore or from outside, to check the correctness

of  my  statement. You will find that I am  telling

you  the  simple  truth. The stand of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  simply this. In the negotiations  for

merger  both  Governments  should  agree  that  all

Singapore  citizens on the date  of  merger  become

Federation  citizens. It is for the Governments  to

agree that all persons who are already citizens  of

Singapore immediately before the merger date  will,

by  operation of law, become Federal citizens. Such

an   agreement  could  be  given  legal  effect  in

pursuance   of   Article   22   of   the    Federal

Constitution.   Whether  or  not   the   Federation

Government   is   agreeable   is   a   matter   for

negotiation.  We  in the Barisan  Sosialis  believe

that  merger  is  a unification  not  only  of  our

territories  but  also of our people.  We  believe

that on merger all Singapore citizens must be given

the  same rights and status as those enjoyed by the

citizens of the Federation. The only way to do that

is  for the Singapore citizen to become the Federal

citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has categorically stated in the recent

Federal  Parliament debate on  merger  that  he  is

prepared  to  give  these equal  rights  and  equal

status  to  the citizens of the Borneo territories.

Does not the Minister for Finance now admit that it

was  silly  and foolish of him to say  that  it  is

constitutionally  not possible  for  all  Singapore

citizens to become Federal citizens on merger, when

the  Tunku himself is prepared to grant citizenship

rights to all citizens of the Borneo territories? I

wonder  what the Minister for Finance was  thinking

about  when he pulled this fast one on the  people.

Yes,  why  did he do it? Does he really think  that

fighting  for  political  power  is  so  much  more

important  than  advancing  the  interests  of  the

people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress once again in this House our views

on  citizenship.  The Barisan Sosialis  regards  as

absolutely fundamental that merger must mean  that,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



all  those  persons who are considered  fit  to  be

citizens of Singapore should also be considered fit

to  be  citizens of the Federation on merger -  that

is, they  must  all  be  made  citizens  of   the

Federation  by  operation of  law;  and  (2)  these

citizenship  rights  once  granted  must   not   be

revocable for political reasons. Anything short  of

this is not merger but a sell-out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, explain why we regard these two

points  as  absolutely fundamental. It is important

that  the  conversion of Singapore  citizenship  to

Federation   citizenship  must   be   effected   by

operation of law, because "registration"  may  mean

that  Federation  politicians  could  deprive   the

citizenship of Singaporeans who do not  agree  with

their politics. For the same reason, to ensure that

citizenship  rights must not be left to  the  whims

and  fancies  of  politicians,  we  believe  it  is

essential  that  these  rights,  once  effected  by

operation of law, must be irrevocable for political

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of constitutional procedure, it is in

fact much more simple to let all Singapore citizens

become Federal citizens by operation of law than to

effect   the   P.A.P.'s   proposals   of   separate

citizenship  and  the establishment  of  a  Federal

nationality,  a  term  that is  not  found  in  the

present  Federal Constitution at all. In fact,  the

P.A.P., by bringing in the Federal national, merely

proves  our  point, that there is nothing  that  is

impossible  under the Constitution. When  it  suits

the P.A.P.'s purpose of camouflaging a sell-out, it

is  possible for them to introduce a whole  set  of

laws  to  frame  an  entirely  new  invention  - the

Federal national - whereas when it does not suit  the

P.A.P., everything becomes impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no constitutional expert but I could suggest

to  them the following. As the Federal Constitution

was  not written to include Singapore, it can  only

be  applied  by  analogy. Words like "Merdeka  Day"

would  have to be read "Merger Day". The provisions

for  automatic  Federal citizenship on  merdeka  is

governed by Article 14 of the Federal Constitution,

Part II, under Citizenship, which reads as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Subject to Clause (2), the following persons

are citizens by operation of law, that is to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every person who, immediately before Merdeka

Day, was a citizen of the Federation by virtue of

any of the provisions of the Federation of Malaya

Agreement, 1948, whether by operation of law or

otherwise;.'



<br><br>The   other   clauses  in  this  Article   of   the

Constitution  do  not concern us  here.  The  above

clause  clearly  provides that all those  who  were

citizens  of  the  Federation  immediately   before

Merdeka Day should automatically become citizens of

the  Federation  of  Malaya on  its  attainment  of

independence. Similarly' it can be easily  provided

by   law  that  all  those  who  were  citizens  of

Singapore  immediately  before  Merger  Day  should

automatically become citizens of the new Federation

of  Malaya  on  merger. Under such a  simple  legal

arrangement,  no  citizen  of  Singapore  will   be

deprived  of  the Singapore citizenship  status  on

Merger, for a Singapore citizenship status will  be

automatically  converted  to  Federal   citizenship

status  by the operation of such a law. Under  such

an arrangement, therefore, those Singapore citizens

who  were  not  born  in  Singapore  and  who  have

obtained    Singapore   citizenship    either    by

registration or by naturalization need not have  to

register  again for Federal citizenship  rights.  I

repeat  "need not have to register again for Federal

citizenship  rights". The question  of  residential

qualification and language test will  therefore  be

irrelevant. This law will apply only to persons who

immediately before Merger Day are already  citizens

of  Singapore; that is, all persons who are already

citizens  of  Singapore immediately  before  merger

will,  by  operation  of  this  law,  automatically

become  Federal  citizens. It is therefore  only  a

transitional provision and is not intended to apply

to  any  other person whatever his connection  with

Singapore after merger. After merger, the  position

of citizenship rights for those persons who are not

Singapore  citizens  before  Merger  Day  will   be

governed  by non-transitional citizenship  laws  as

stated in Part III of the Federal Constitution.  In

other words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



Sir, all persons born in Singapore on or after  the

date  of  merger will automatically become  Federal

citizens  by right of birth, just like  any  person

born  now in the Federation; whereas those  persons

in  Singapore  who  are not citizens  of  Singapore

immediately  before  merger  - and  therefore   not

entitled   to  automatic  Federal  citizenship   by

operation   of   the  above-mentioned  transitional

provision - may subsequently become Federal citizens

either  by registration or by naturalization  under

existing   Federal  citizenship  laws,  which   for

practical  purposes  are the same  as  the  present

citizenship  laws in Singapore. I think  our  legal

luminaries in this Chamber can verify all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have clearly shown that under

the  Constitution of the Federation, it is not only

not  impossible  but, on the contrary,  absolutely

possible - and  in  fact also quite  simple - for  all

Singapore  citizens to become Federal  citizens  on

merger.  The  problem only lies  in  obtaining  the

Federation Government's consent to agreeing on  the

just  and  legitimate aspirations of the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is a matter for negotiation. Our

Prime  Minister has a responsibility to look  after

the  interests of the people of Singapore. Why  has

he  not done so? Has he to depend on Lim Kean  Siew

and  Seenivasagam? If the Federation Government  is

truly  sincere in wanting merger and achieving  the

genuine  unification  of the  peoples  of  the  two

territories,  then  it  must accept  all  Singapore

citizens as citizens of the Federation on merger in

the  same  way  as  it is prepared  to  accept  the

citizens of the Borneo territories on formation  of

the Tunku's Malaysia. This is not a demand that can

be  construed as "Communist-inspired or placing  ob

stacles" - the Prime Minister's words -  in the way  of

merger. It is simply a fair and democratic  way  of

achieving  the political integration of the  people

of  both  territories based on equality,  democracy

and  justice. The Prime Minister said,  "Conditions

must be fair and just." Is it fair and just to  the

Singapore  citizen  when he does not  automatically

become a Federal citizen on merger? If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



there  is  no  merger, why harp on merger  all  the

time?  Why  does the Prime Minister want Federation

Members  of  Parliament  to  fight  the  battle  of

citizenship  on behalf of the people of  Singapore?

Who  is  the Member for Tanjong Pagar? Was  he  not

elected  by the people of Singapore? Is he not  the

Prime  Minister of Singapore? Then why does he  not

fight for the interests of the people of Singapore?

If  our  Prime  Minister wants  to  fight  for  the

interests  of  non-Singaporeans, why  does  he  not

resign and give up the post of Prime Minister? Does

he think that having several classes of citizenship

is  fair and just? [Laughter] They laugh. Dare they

laugh this off in the face of the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Why don't you -

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order, Sir,I

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose that is a point of order.

The  Member for Queenstown should try and  modulate

his voice.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What about mine?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, when one talks of

citizenship,  when one sees how  people  have  been

selling out the interests of the people, one cannot

help becoming angry. They are traitors, treacherous

traitors! If the Prime Minister of Singapore fights

for  the  interests  of  non-Singaporeans  and  for

forces outside Singapore, he is not only a traitor

hut  a  super-traitor. If the P.A.P. Government  is

sincere in guarding the interests of the people  of

Singapore, he must not negotiate for merger with an

attitude of defeatism and submissiveness. Merger is

something that should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



bring  mutual  benefit  to  the  peoples  of   both

territories.   The   people  of   Singapore   must,

therefore, not approach the negotiations on  merger

with an inferiority complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. in its booklet, The Tasks Ahead,

issued   in  1959  before  the  general  elections,

declared - this  is  the  famous  Tasks  Ahead,   the

P.A.P.'s  Five-year  Plan  which  the  P.A.P. has

completely  forgotten - Part I,  page  21  (they  are

talking about the common market):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A P.A.P. government [I will leave out the

irrelevant  parts]  .  . . need  not  approach  the

Federation  government in the role  of  supplicants

for favours.'



<br><br>Now  they are begging on all fours. The P.A.P. was

able to say this at that time because they then had

the support of the people of Singapore, and because

they  then  knew  that all the people  were  behind

them. Now that they have lost the people's support,

it is clear that they are now approaching the Tunku

not only on bended knees but also with outstretched

hands waiting for alms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basis of our negotiations

on merger must be on whether it is to the interests

of  the people of Singapore, and not whether it  is

acceptable  to the Federation Government.  What  is

unacceptable to the Federation Government  may  not

necessarily be bad for the people of Singapore, and

what is acceptable to the Federation Government may

not   necessarily  be  good  for  the   people   of

Singapore. If the interests of our people  have  to

be  looked after, then it is our duty to fight  for

them,  even at `the risk of being considered dotty.

It  is  for us then to convince our friends  across

the  table that we are, in fact, not dotty but  are

merely asking for something that is legitimate  and

reasonable for our people. It may be that our Prime

Minister in his desperation has gone dotty  in  not

having fought for the basic interests of the people

of  Singapore. For the Singapore Prime Minister  to

ask  our  friends in the Federation  Parliament  to

move  a  motion to give Federal citizenship to  all

Singapore     citizens     merely     shows     the

irresponsibility of the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Queenstown has touched on that aspect on  at  least

three  occasions.  There is a  certain  amount  of

repetition  which  might  eventually  be   tedious.

Perhaps  he  should try not to repeat what  he  has

said so often.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely want to emphasise the

irresponsibility  of the Prime  Minister,  Sir.  We

implore  the  Prime  Minister  not  to  shirk   his

responsibility   and  not   to   pass   the   buck.

Incidentally that ridiculous statement by the Prime

Minister only serves further to prove that  he  has

reluctantly accepted the Barisan Sosialis' position

as  being the correct one, namely, that the Federal

Constitution empowers the Federal Parliament  to  a

full  discussion over the terms of  citizenship  on

merger, and that it is up to our Prime Minister  to

negotiate on Singapore's behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We challenge the P.A.P. Government to a general

election on this basic issue of people's

citizenship -

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> By-election.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - for all citizens on

merger. Have they the guts to accept?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, deal with the Prime Minister's

lame  excuse - that  it is unreasonable  to  demand

that  all Singapore citizens should become  Federal

citizens on merger. The P.A.P. line is that on full

and  complete merger it is not reasonable to demand

for   Federal   citizenship  for  those   Singapore

citizens  who  were not born in Singapore, because

(1)  these  Singapore  citizens  do  not  have  the

residential   qualification  required   under   the

present Federal citizenship laws; (2) they have not

passed   a  language  test  as  required   by   the

Federation  law.  In the first  place, as  I  have

pointed  out earlier, Sir, it is possible  for  all

Singapore citizens automatically to become  Federal

citizens by operation of law passed in pursuance of

Article  22 of the Federal Constitution,  in  which

case,  of  course,  all this  talk  of  residential

qualification and language test becomes  completely

irrelevant. They are only red herrings. But let me,

nevertheless, deal with these mischievous arguments

of the P.A.P. just to expose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



their hollowness. Let us examine the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first summarise the requirements of the

Federation Constitution on citizenship.  Under  the

Federation Constitution, Federal citizenship can be

acquired  by one of three procedures. Let me  quote

"Citizenship  by operation of law" as  set  out  in

Article 14. The salient features are that a  person

can  become a Federal citizen `by operation of  law

if  he  was (a) a citizen of the Federation  before

Merdeka  Day, or (b) was born in the Federation  of

Malaya on or after Merdeka Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Citizenship by registration" - I have no wish to

read  this out, Sir, but for the record I think  it

is  useful.  There are three main  categories:  (a)

Citizenship by registration (wives and children  of

citizens)  as  provided in Article 15:  residential

qualification and language test are not required in

these   cases.   (b)  Citizenship  by  registration

(persons born in the Federation before Merdeka Day)

as   provided   for  in  Article   16:   the   main

requirements  here are a residential  qualification

of  at  least  five years during  the  seven  years

immediately preceding the date of application, that

he  is  of  good character, that he  must  have  an

elementary  knowledge of the Malay language.  This

language   requirement   is   waived   where    the

applications  were  made  within  one  year   after

Merdeka  Day - for one year they need  not  have  to

bother  about  the Malay language  test.  And  then

under  (c)  "Citizenship by  registration  (persons

resident  in  the  Federation on Merdeka  Day)"  as

specified  in  Article 17. Here the requirement  is

similar  to  that  in Article 16  except  that  the

residential qualification is 8 out of the 12  years

immediately  preceding  application.  The  language

requirement is also waived during the first year of

Merdeka,  and also for those who have attained  the

age

of 45 on the date of application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes "Citizenship by naturalization". Here

the    main    requirements   are   a   residential

qualification  of  10 years out  of  the  12  years

preceding   application.  He  must   be   of   good

character.  He must have an adequate  knowledge  of

the Malay language. You will note that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister  is playing only  on  the  ten-year

residential qualification and the language  barrier

in the naturalization laws in order to frighten the

citizens of Singapore who were not born here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now briefly, Sir, see how the citizenship

laws    in   Singapore   operate.   The   Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance, 1957, came into force on 1st

November,  1957.  Under this  Ordinance,  Singapore

citizenship   could  be  acquired   by   birth   in

Singapore,  citizenship by descent, citizenship  by

registration,  which has two main  categories - those

born  in  the Federation and those who are citizens

of  the  United  Kingdom and British colonies.  The

residential qualification here was only two  years.

For  those who were born in China and other foreign

countries, the residential qualification  here  was

that  they must have 8 years' residence immediately

preceding  the  date  when  application  for   this

category  of citizenship should be made within  two

years  from 1st November, 1957. Incidentally,  Sir,

citizenship  by naturalization did  not  come  into

force on 1st November, 1957. The Prime Minister has

chosen  to emphasise this residential qualification

of  two years for those born in the Federation  and

the  U.K. and Colonies, and 8 years for those  born

elsewhere, and  argues that it  is  therefore  not

reasonable  for these groups of Singapore  citizens

to  demand Federation citizenship rights in view of

the ten-year residential qualification and language

tests required under the naturalization laws of the

Federation. In support of his argument,  the  Prime

Minister takes on those Singapore citizens who were

not born here. The Prime Minister has conceded that

all Singapore citizens who were born here have the

right  to automatic Federal citizenship on complete

merger   though, and  we  must  note   this   very

carefully, Sir, the P.A.P.'s phoney merger does not

even  give these rights. But I shall deal with that

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of the Prime Minister centres on

those Singapore citizens who were not born here and

is  based  on  two points: (a) an alleged  lack  of

residential qualification of ten years as  required

by the Federation naturalisation law; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



(b)  the fact that these Singapore citizens did not

undergo  a Malay language test as required  by  the

Federation laws. At first the Minister for Finance,

on the 21st of September, 1961, contended that "all

these  300,000-odd citizens" - those were the figures

at   the   moment,  Sir - "not  born  here   would

automatically  lose  their  citizenship  rights  on

complete  merger." But later, on the 27th  October,

1961,  the Prime Minister cut this down to 200,000.

saying  that 100,000 - of course, the figure  now  is

110,000 - of this 300,000 may successfully apply  for

registration  and pass the language  test.  Let  me

first   dismiss  all  this  hullabaloo  about   the

language   qualification.  Under   the   Federation

Constitution, this language requirement was  waived

for  applicants during the first year after Merdeka

Day,  as  I  have already mentioned, and for  those

reaching  45  years of age, it is not necessary  at

all.  Is the Prime Minister saying that this cannot

also  be  done in the case of merger, and that  the

language barrier cannot be waived during the  first

year after merger? Does the Prime Minister want  to

lay down conditions even harsher and more stringent

than  the Federation constitution? Already  as  the

result   of  memoranda  and  representations   from

Assemblymen  and past P.A.P. Branch executives  who

are now with the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh God!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Malay language test in

Singapore is now waived for all those over  thirty.

I   wonder  if  it  has  been  done.  It  has  been

recommended.  We recommended it, and  I  hope  they

have  carried this out. So the Malay language  test

should not be a barrier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then deal with alleged lack of residential

qualification.  Here again the  Prime  Minister  is

trying  to  be  more stringent than the  Federation

Government.   He  must  insist  on   the   ten-year

residential   qualification  required   under   the

naturalization laws, and conveniently forgets  that

the    Federation   Constitution    provides    for

citizenship  by  registration for  those  who  were

resident  in  the  Federation on Merdeka  Day,  the

residential qualification here being only 8  years.

We want to ask: Why cannot this pro-vision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



be  given  to  those who  are  resident  in

Singapore  on  Merger Day? After all, is  not  the

Prime Minister trying to tell us that he is getting

us  Merdeka through merger? But let me argue on the

basis  of his ten-year qualification. The  fact  is

that  most of the people in Singapore who were  not

born  here  have  been residing here  since  1952,

except  for those who come from the Federation  and

who   cannot   be  considered  as  aliens   anyway.

Stringent safeguards were made to guard against the

large influx of aliens after the war, and according

to  immigration reports of post-war years a  policy

of  selective immigration on a severely  restricted

basis   was   introduced.  When   the   Immigration

Ordinance   of   1952  was  passed  providing   for

selective  immigration, control of entry of  aliens

became  even  more  strict. Most of  the  Singapore

citizens   who   obtained  their   citizenship   by

registration  in 1957 did so under the requirements

of 8 years' residential qualification. In fact, the

reason given by the then chief Minister for this 8-year  residential qualification was that it was  to

facilitate  the  registration  procedure,  as   the

identity  card system was introduced in late  1948.

The  registration of these citizens was done mainly

on  the basis of the 1948 identity card. That is to

say,  most  of the Singapore citizens who  obtained

their citizenship by registration in 1957 have,  in

fact, been resident here since -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. The

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a manoeuvre. Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your decision. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Scared!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that most

of   the  Singapore  citizens  who  obtained  their

citizenship by registration in 1957 have, in  fact,

been  resident here since 1948. 1948-1961, 13 years

ago.  That  is  more than the ten-year  residential

qualification   required   under   the   Federation

naturalization law, which only require 10 years out

of  12.  And  by 1963 when "merger" is supposed  to

take  place (inverted commas "merger"), they  will

have 13 plus two, which means 15 years' residence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Where? In Singapore or the

Federation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What more does the Prime

Minister  want? Does he think this is not fair  and

just,  Sir? After 15 years' residence in  Singapore

and still -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> When a speaker asks me a

question, am I not allowed to reply, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Those questions, of course,

are rhetorical and the Prime Minister will have  an

opportunity of replying in due course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I have pointed out, Sir,

this  provision  of the 1957 Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance   allowing  only  8  year's   residential

qualification  was operative only  for  a  two-year

period, that is from 1957 to 1959. Even where those

citizens registered themselves at the end  of  this

two-year  period, that is, in 1959 - let us calculate

arithmetic,  Sir - they still have by now  at  least

ten  years' residential qualification, because when

they  registered two years ago, in 1959, they  must

have  at  that  time at least 8 years residence  in

order  to  qualify. Let us add 2 to 8, that  is  by

1961 - that  gives  you  10,  which  should   already

satisfy the 10-year residential qualification.  And

if  we  should add 2 to 10, that is to say by 1963,

when  this phoney merger is supposed to take place.

they   will  have  already  12  years'  residential

qualification. The fact, therefore,  then  is  that

most of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



the  300,000 Singapore citizens who were  not  born

here  have  by now at least 10 years' residence  in

Singapore,  and  by 1963 it will be  at  least  12

years. The few that do not have 10 years' residence

are those who have obtained citizenship rights with

the  2-year residential qualification provided  for

in  the  1957  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance  for

those either born in the Federation or in the  U.K.

and  Colonies. Most of them in this group were,  in

fact,   born  in  the  Federation  and  cannot   be

considered as aliens to this country at  any  rate.

These  Singapore  citizens born in  the  Federation

could  in  any  case obtain Federal citizenship  by

registration  under Federal citizenship  laws  with

only a 5-year residential qualification and not  10

years - not  10  years. Moreover, in  May  1960,  the

P.A.P. amended the citizenship laws in Singapore. I

have  got it down here as No. 40 of 1960 - I  am  not

going  to  quote  that, Sir - and thereafter  persons

born  in the Federation require an 8-year residence

in  Singapore  before  they  can  become  Singapore

citizens.  So  what is all this  talk  about  black

marketing and currency exchange cheating  and  all

that?  Why all this cheating? Why cannot the P.A.P.

leaders come out with the truth and tell the people

that they have not been doing their duty, that they

have been irresponsible to the people of Singapore,

and  that  they  have not been  looking  after  the

interests of the people? The number of persons born

in   the   U.K. and  Colonies  who  have  obtained

Singapore  citizenship  under  the  1957  Singapore

Citizenship  Ordinance  is  probably  very   small,

perhaps  a few thousand. They comprise, I  believe,

mainly ex-servicemen and expatriates who choose  to

settle  here for one reason or another.  The  Prime

Minister  cannot  escape  responsibility  for  this

awkward provision of the 1957 Singapore Citizenship

Ordinance  as  he  was  a  member  of  the   Select

Committee  which  drew up the Bill.  It  is  clear,

however,  that  the  Prime Minister  is  using  the

existence   of  this  small  number  of   Singapore

citizens born in the U.K. and Colonies -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And India.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - as a feeble excuse to block

genuine merger and to grant second-rate citizenship

status to our people in Singapore. Is it fair  that

just  because of these few citizens all of  us  are

denied an equal citizenship status? This is nothing

but  a lousy camouflage for a treacherous sell-out.

Just  because  of  these  few  Europeans  and

ex-servicemen  who do not have the 10-year residential

qualification, the P.A.P. is trying to bring  about

a  phoney merger under which not a single Singapore

citizen will obtain Federal citizenship rights.  Is

this  fair and just? The P.A.P. alleges that  under

complete  merger  only those 323,000  citizens  who

were  born  here - maybe I will have to  change  that

figure  because of the new development  of  624,000

from  650,000; anyway I will stick to this 323,000,

Sir - that  is,  about  half of  Singapore's  624,000

citizens,    will   automatically    get    Federal

citizenship. But Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is that

under  the P.A.P. phoney merger, even these 323,00

citizens  born in Singapore, or the new  figure  of

284,000, will not get automatic Federal citizenshp

rights. The fact is that under the P.A.P.'s  phone y

merger  not  a single Singapore citizen,  not  even

those   who  were  born  in  Singapore,  will   get

automatic  Federal citizenship rights.  This  is  a

very ugly fact which the Prime Minister has so  far

successfully  concealed  from  the  people  and   I

challenge the Prime Minister to categorically  deny

this -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b> sneezed. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I challenge the Prime Minister -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> sneezed again. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was under the impression

that  the  first  sneeze was  perhaps  due  to  the

dryness  of this atmosphere; but if the Member  for

Tiong  Bahru cannot behave himself, I may  have  to

apply  Standing Orders, which might  mean  that  he

will  have to leave this Assembly Chamber. He  must

not  make noises. He must not, in fact, emulate the

Member for Anson.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying. Sir, I challenge

the  Prime Minister to state categorically in  this

Chamber  if  there is a single group  of  Singapore

citizens   who   will   have   automatic    Federal

citizenship rights under their brand of merger. Let

the people know the truth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is another occasion. I

suppose,  when the Member for Queenstown is  losing

his  temper. He is getting angry. But  I  think  he

should try and modulate his voice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am sorry, Sir. When one

meets with treachery like this, one cannot help but

be angry, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on the 26th of October, 1961, the Straits

Times  attempted  to misrepresent  what  the  Prime

Minister  had said at a Press conference  held  the

previous  day,  trying to mislead the  people  into

believing that under the P.A.P.'s phoney merger all

those    who   were   born   in   Singapore   would

automatically  become  Federal  citizens.  Let   me

quote,  Sir,  the  Straits  Times,  Thursday,  26th



October, under bold headlines -



<br><div align="center">"ALL SINGAPORE BORN - AUTOMATIC CITIZENS".</div>



<br><br>And it says -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. When the Member is fully

aware  that that, in fact, was a misreport  and  he

has  read  the correction, ought he not really  to

have  read  the correction instead of  reading  the

misreport  and  adding  to the  confusion  of  this

House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If, in fact, there was a correction,

I  think the Member for Queenstown should point  it

out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will show the correction,

Sir, in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Sir. My

point  of  order is this. That what the Member  for

Queenstown   proposes  now  to  read  will   create

confusion which requires correction;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



and he is now proposing to add to the confusion by

repeating that mistake.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown is

trying to be historically accurate, but he must

say, of course, before `he reads that statement

that it was subsequently corrected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to be historically

correct, Sir. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee said that after merger, (meaning the

P.A.P. brand  of  merger) Singapore-born  citizens

would automatically become Federation citizens, but

other Singapore citizens would have to satisfy  the

Federation citizenship laws on residence and pass a

language test.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to show the correction, Sir. The next

day  the  Prime Minister quickly issued a statement

which  said  that the Straits Times report  of  his

Press  conference  held the  previous  day  on  the

question  of  citizenship needed clarification  and

correction.  In the statement he was - now  this  is

important - significantly silent on the subject of

automatic  Federal citizenship rights for Singapore

citizens  born  in  Singapore  after  the  P.A.P.'s

phoney  merger. In fact, the only thing he said  of

Singapore  citizens being able  to  obtain  Federal

citizenship  is this. Now, I will quote  him,  Sir.

This is the Straits Timex of 27th October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any Singapore citizen who wishes to live in the

present  Federation and become  a  citizen  of  the

present Federation can apply for citizenship of the

present  Federation under the laws of  the  present

Federation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the time it was present Federation laws.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You said they would all

qualify, so why worry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this innocent-looking statement -



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his .seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Could we have the date on which

the speech or the interview given by the Prime

Minister was published in the Straits Times? Both

of them, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That was given. If the Member was

listening, the date of the paper was given.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I did give the date, Sir. It

was the 26th and now it is the 27th, the day

following.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This innocent-looking statement, Sir, covers a

multitude of sins, it means, in the first place,

that if a Singapore citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



goes  to  the  Federation after  the  P.A.P.'s

phoney  merger, he will become disenfranchised  and

will  not  be  allowed  to vote  or  to  stand  for

election in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.
