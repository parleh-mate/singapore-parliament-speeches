September 11th, 2001 marked the beginning of a new era in which we saw a rapid deterioration of&nbsp;global safety and security. Since that time, we have seen the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the after-shocks&nbsp;of September 11th have </p><p align=left>Column: 2948<p><p>spilled over to the region,&nbsp;and now we have to be constantly on the alert for potential terrorist threats.&nbsp; We are also right now in the middle of a global financial crisis. And history has shown that whenever there are severe economic problems, this is often followed by political problems and instability.&nbsp; Political instability, in turn, often leads to problems&nbsp;in security if a Government loses the ability to lead strongly and firmly.&nbsp; The United States, once regarded as a leader in the unipolar world, is now preoccupied with its own domestic issues. The Obama Administration is focused on the herculean task of pulling the US economy out of its present quagmire.&nbsp; Iran and Afghanistan are still problem areas, and there is tension between India and Pakistan arising out of the recent&nbsp;Mumbai attacks.&nbsp; Europe is preoccupied as well&nbsp;with the global financial crisis.&nbsp; In the midst of all&nbsp;these, we have China which&nbsp;is still,&nbsp;as yet,&nbsp;an unknown factor on the global security scene.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASEAN, meanwhile, remains&nbsp;the foremost regional grouping, but our ASEAN neighbours also have their own domestic issues to attend to as well as the challenges posed by the current credit crunch.&nbsp; So it appears as though the world is very much in a state of flux right now, and it seems as if the tides of change are&nbsp;lapping at our shores.&nbsp; Whenever&nbsp;we have this kind of potential vacuum, we know that nature&nbsp;abhors a vacuum.&nbsp; Vacuums tend to lead to instability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for his assessment of what our current security challenges are in the face of this backdrop of&nbsp;a global economic crisis as well as the potential security challenges that the world faces.&nbsp; It seems as though there are these momentous events that are shaping the world and Singapore, a small little&nbsp;red dot, is right in the middle of it, too small to make a huge impact on the scale of world events&nbsp; but, at the same time, in a position where we will be affected by</p><p align=left>Column: 2949<p><p>whatever happens. We obviously need to be ready. We obviously need to know what our challenges are.&nbsp; We need to know what we can do to protect our own sovereignty and our own security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what he thinks the security architecture is currently, both globally as well as for the region, and to give his assessment on what he thinks Singapore can and should do given this environment.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</B> Sir, the world has not seen a far-reaching economic downward spiral since the Great Depression.

These include United States, China, Japan, the EU and countries in Southeast Asia. As the economic crisis came so suddenly and it started in the United States, the largest consumer market in the world, many countries that depend on the US market for their exports have been adversely affected. Countries all over the world have launched massive economic stimulus packages to help enterprises that have run short of working capital. I believe those organisations that depend on dubious means to make money also face the prospect of shortage of funds.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, China's merchant ships have been attacked by Somalia pirates in the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; China had to dispatch war ships to deal with the pirates together with the country's navy. This is a good example. This is a timely reminder to us that we have to be forever vigilant so that the same incident will not happen in the seas around us.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite concerned about the level of safety in the Straits of Malacca because this is the stretch where ships coming and leaving Singapore must pass through.&nbsp; It is also the Straits where Malaysia and Indonesia sea coasts adjoin each other.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any plans to work with Malaysia and Indonesia collectively to safeguard the safety of the Straits so as to prevent pirates from attacking ships from passing through&nbsp;the Straits. Otherwise, this will only worsen the economic recession we are already in.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3133-3134.<BR></div></P></div>				<p align=left>Column: 2951<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Defence Spending</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, some Members inside and outside this House have asked if defence spending should be cut during this economic recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar questions had been asked in previous years and, each time, the Defence Minister's stock reply&nbsp;was that we should not take a feast-and-famine approach in our defence spending.&nbsp; Sir, I agree that a feast-and-famine approach should be avoided.&nbsp; The principle of steadily building up our defence capabilities with a long-term horizon is a sound one.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; should the Defence Ministry be having a feast while the other Ministries, indeed, the entire&nbsp;economy,&nbsp;suffer from famine?&nbsp; In this Budget, this House has been told that the economic recession is quite extraordinary, so extraordinary that we have to draw on our reserves for the first time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the debate, we have been scrutinising the tight budgets of the other Ministries while&nbsp;their demands have been rising.&nbsp; We need more affordable Eldercare centres and nursing home. We need more funds to&nbsp;beef up our people sector, such as the Family Service Centres. We need more affordable housing for the lower-income, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite their increasing demands, all Ministries, which also need to take a long-term view, are not recession-proof,&nbsp;except for the Defence Ministry.&nbsp; As a policy, it can spend up to 6% of GDP no matter what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that, in practice, defence spending has been kept lower. Nevertheless, it is valid to ask if the principle itself,&nbsp;of making the Defence budget recession-proof,&nbsp;is itself a defensible one.&nbsp; It is worth revisiting, with an open mind, the rationale for the magic number of 6%. Why 6% and not, say, 4%, 7% or 9%? Why give any number at all?</p><p align=left>Column: 2952<p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our situation today, and also the size of our GDP, is different from that&nbsp;in 1965 when we had to build up our defence from scratch and take an aggressive approach in our spending.&nbsp; In this more mature stage of Singapore's development, why should&nbsp;not the Defence budget be decided like that of the other Ministries&nbsp;&ndash; constantly reappraised so as to take into account the needs, expectations, changes in the internal and external realities, while keeping&nbsp;the long-term commitment to steady investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me be clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing that we cut the Defence Budget as a matter of course in a recession.&nbsp; I am asking that we review the basis of our principle of committing 6% of our GDP to the Defence Ministry, regardless of external or internal realities.&nbsp;&nbsp;This review should be beyond the numbers. It should also include a review of our threats and the sort of conflicts and wars that the future will likely bring. The changing security landscape in Asia will have a profound impact on our security. Beijing said its defence spending would rise 17.6% this year to 417.8 billion <I>yuan</I>. That is equivalent to about 1.45% of China's GDP. The US, by contrast, spends 4.6% of its GDP on defence and Britain, 3%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While China's military spending, along with that of Russia and South Korea, is expanding rapidly, that of Japan is declining on a GDP-relative basis. In other words, a <I>de facto</I> balance of military forces is emerging in this region. What will this mean for our SAF?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to look at how we can strengthen our SAF but, at the same time, review our Defence budget to see how we can optimise our spending and make sure that we are more strategic in building up our arsenal and alliances.&nbsp; I would like the&nbsp;Minister's assurance that there is a constant reappraisal of our defence spending needs and that proper scrutiny is being applied.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 2953<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Defence Expenditure</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Arthur Fong:</B> Sir, the financial and economic crises are creating new social and political stresses all around. Economists in our region are in difficulty and the prospect of more job losses seems inevitable.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fall in global consumption&nbsp; appears to be long term.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is likely&nbsp;to be&nbsp;aggravated when businesses react by decreasing or stopping investments in production capacity due to lower expectations of future sales, even if lower interest rates make capital inexpensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the investment climate is usually predicated on optimism. In the current climate where optimism is low or dissipating, I fear the potential flashpoints for terrorism and security challenges that&nbsp;are ever present will be heightened. Any incident between displaced groups or countries teetering on collapse within the current crisis will cast us into a tailspin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States of America is spending US$100 billion annually&nbsp;in their campaign in Iraq. The financial meltdown is making American law-makers queasy about increasing defence spending. This will affect America's role as the protagonist in policing many troubled spots around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our immediate security environment is also severely tested.&nbsp; There may be new flashpoints in the horizon brought on by the threat of terrorism or by the discontent of economically disadvantaged groups. Sir, I note that my colleague, Mdm Ho, in her speech on the Budget had called on the Government to relook at defence spending in these difficult times.&nbsp; But I beg to differ.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that, now more than ever, we must not shy away&nbsp;from investing in our defence force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2954<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are celebrating the 25th year of Total Defence, and we have invested wisely to bring our SAF to where it is today.&nbsp; Defence expenditure is not only to develop but, more importantly, to maintain our defence capabilities.&nbsp; Once lost or diminished, who can say what it will take to recover and rebuild our armed forces in the aftermath of a security crisis?&nbsp; It is like turning on a television 20 years ago when it took a while for&nbsp;us to see a picture&nbsp;on the screen.&nbsp; Nowadays, when&nbsp;we turn on&nbsp;the television, it is solid state, it comes on&nbsp;&ndash; so also&nbsp;must be our defence force.&nbsp; It has to be at the solid state level where operational capabilities need to be on at&nbsp;the flick of a switch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I call on the Defence Minister to assure the House that our SAF's capabilities will not be compromised in any way, even as we are facing this rough patch in this global economic slowdown.&nbsp; I support MINDEF's attempts to maintain and enhance the capability of our SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have a cap of 6% of GDP and I think that should be maintained.&nbsp; The defence expenditure of 28% of the total budget is not only necessary but vital.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower and Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower and Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Sir, a strong defence force is critical for a small nation like Singapore.

So we had to take measures for airport security checks. We had to worry about air defence.&nbsp; In 2002, there was the plot to plant a bomb at the Yishun MRT.&nbsp; So we strengthened measures&nbsp;at the MRT.&nbsp; In 2003, we&nbsp;had the Bali bombings.&nbsp; So we had to take measures at Holland Village as well as at other soft targets, like pubs and nightclubs.&nbsp; Then there were the hotel bombings.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we had to take measures at our hotels as well.&nbsp; And, most recently, last year, there were terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and the ease with which the terrorists took over the hotels was quite dismaying, and it raises the question of whether a similar incident like that could occur here in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, firstly, what is the SAF's preparedness to deal</p><p align=left>Column: 2956<p><p>with unconventional threats like terrorist attacks? Secondly, what are the implications of the Mumbai terrorist attacks for us, and whether there are any lessons for the SAF arising from that particular incident?&nbsp; I noted, for example, there were three security heads in India travelling in the same vehicle.&nbsp; When the terrorists took&nbsp;out that vehicle, there was a loss of command as a result.&nbsp; The Mumbai attacks also emphasised the fact that an urban engagement with terrorists is a very real possibility.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how prepared are we for urban warfare, in terms of training, equipment and facilities?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi --><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer,&nbsp;please take your&nbsp;two cuts together.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, terrorism is a deplorable phenomenon that we in Singapore cannot afford to ignore.&nbsp; We can no longer say that it does not exist here in Singapore nor can we say that Singaporeans are not direct victims of terrorism.&nbsp; Acts of&nbsp;terror occur all around the world everyday.&nbsp; Singapore is part of a globalised economy and more than ever, Singaporeans&nbsp;are travelling abroad for work and for leisure.&nbsp; We cannot delude ourselves that we are removed from the risk of terror attacks.&nbsp; The clearest and more recent reminder of this fact was the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November last year.&nbsp; For the first time, Singapore lost one of our own in a series of brutal terrorist attacks&nbsp;in the heart of&nbsp; India's&nbsp;financial&nbsp;capital.&nbsp; It was also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we all are.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terrorists that launched these attacks came by sea from Karachi&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pakistan.&nbsp; They gained entry into Mumbai via the Arabian&nbsp;Sea&nbsp;in speedboats that had been carried some of the way on trawlers.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;difficult to envisage a similar mode of entry into Singapore.&nbsp; The terrorists had planned their attack and their escape route in great detail.&nbsp; They </p><p align=left>Column: 2957<p><p>spent many months in Mumbai carrying out&nbsp;reconnaissance&nbsp;of the various locations to be attacked, the routes for&nbsp;entry and exit. They blended in with the crowd, as Mumbai is a bustling metropolitan city, again, very much like Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other forms of terrorism as well. In recent months, there have been much media coverage of a string of attacks by pirates off the coast of&nbsp;Somalia. These pirates had attacked both passenger ships as well as cargo ships. They have held the crew hostage and exchanged them for a ransom.&nbsp; Again, the seas off our coastline are not very different.&nbsp; Although pirate attacks are not frequent, pirates are known&nbsp;menace in&nbsp;the waters of our coast and those of our neighbours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At home, we are not immune to the possibility that&nbsp;a terror attack could occur right in our midst if we are not careful, and&nbsp;if we fail to remain constantly alert and vigilant.&nbsp; Over the years,&nbsp;several suspected terrorist&nbsp;cell members have been&nbsp;detained.&nbsp; In fact, plots have been afoot to blow up several strategic locations in Singapore.&nbsp; If not for the fine intelligence&nbsp;gathering and&nbsp;swift&nbsp;action of our security forces,&nbsp;and that extra bit of luck, the outcome could have been disastrous.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What will happen if the next time we are not so lucky? All it takes is one attack to negate all the attempts that have been thwarted.&nbsp; May I therefore ask the Minister: what are the lessons that MINDEF and the SAF have learnt from the terrorist attacks, such&nbsp;as Mumbai? What lessons can we learn from the pirate attacks off the&nbsp;Somali coast?&nbsp; How can Singapore prevent a terrorist attack?

Whilst they are doing NS, they are fine,</p> <p align=left>Column: 2962<p><p>they have to be fit&nbsp;&ndash; no choice.&nbsp; But before they start NS, how fit are they when they come before they start to do Basic Military Training (BMT)? Are they properly pre-conditioned before they start their BMT?&nbsp; Because if they are not fit, then it is not good for them and it is not good for the SAF either.&nbsp; Then, after they have finished their NS, they have to be operationally ready.&nbsp; Here, Sir, I think is the biggest challenge, whether our NSmen are sufficiently fit.&nbsp; They obviously have to contend with the challenges of lifestyle: drinking, smoking, diet.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that all our NSmen drink,&nbsp;smoke and overeat.&nbsp; I am just saying that these are challenges that they have to contend with in working life.&nbsp; I personally understand how difficult it is in order to maintain one's fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Parliament would recall that, last year, MINDEF&nbsp;very kindly allowed me to do IPPT with the SAF. One of the lessons I learnt from that personally is the difficulty of the challenge of maintaining&nbsp;a person's fitness while&nbsp;he also has to perform&nbsp;his own work responsibilities.&nbsp; Last year, before I took the IPPT, I was in the middle of a 30-day trial.&nbsp; I was in court every day.&nbsp; I had to finish cross-examining and after that, I had to get out of court and get onto the track and start training.&nbsp; And it was not&nbsp;easy.&nbsp; If I had&nbsp;to deal with that, I can imagine what our NSmen have to cope with.&nbsp; And it made me realise the importance of&nbsp;our NSmen actually having access to proper facilities to train.&nbsp; I realise that&nbsp;there does seem to be&nbsp;&ndash; lack of facility is not the right word&nbsp;&ndash; but I think that there could be an improvement in access to facilities for training.&nbsp; For example, I know that for training for IPPT, they can go to the gymnasium.&nbsp; But, Sir, I am not a big proponent of training in air-condition.&nbsp; I do not think that we would fight our wars in an&nbsp;air-conditioned environment.&nbsp; Therefore, I think that when our NSmen train to be fit, they should do so in an environment that approximates the reality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2963<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided that I would try an experiment in my own HDB estate. We are doing an R&nbsp;&amp; R. In the R&nbsp;&amp; R, I am going to implement IPPT facilities that would&nbsp;be NAFA compliant - that means the NSmen in my HDB estate can actually do down to the block and use those facilities to train for IPPT.&nbsp; I have asked&nbsp;the Town Council to build a track.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we cannot do the whole 2.4 kilometres,&nbsp;but we have a track which is 400 metres and&nbsp;they could&nbsp;do&nbsp;multiples of that to train and reach&nbsp;the 2.4 kilometres. This is not a MINDEF issue but probably a Town Council or HDB issue, but I would strongly encourage&nbsp;MPs to include IPPT facilities in their constituencies.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Our youth today can avail themselves to more and better sporting facilities to enhance their fitness.&nbsp; This goes a long way to prepare them for National Service.&nbsp; But in spite of better sports amenities and the resources available in our school system, we have seen several young national servicemen dying from their National Service stint.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given our declining population base, every National Serviceman is an important national asset.&nbsp; Every National Serviceman lost, is a national tragedy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Taiwan, there is a degrading term for "softee" youth called the "strawberry generation".&nbsp; They are so-called because like strawberries, the Taiwanese youth are thought to crush easily under pressure, so lacking in ruggedness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2964<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we have the same phenomenon here, in spite of all our physically fit young men having to go through the rigour of National Service?&nbsp; Post-National Service youth are definitely tougher.&nbsp; But the concern is with our pre-enlistment youth and how to add that quality of ruggedness to stand them in a better position to endure the toughness of National Service training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons for the strawberry-like phenomenon, perhaps, could be because of the rise in obesity in our youth.&nbsp; About 10 years ago, the proportion of overweight youth was about 2.8&nbsp;percent points of the total population.&nbsp; But last year, it has gone up to 3.6%.&nbsp; This may be a worrying trend.&nbsp; On the positive note, we do have a fitter younger generation compared to 10 years ago.&nbsp; In 1998, the percentage of youth passing the National Physical Fitness test (NAPFA) was 74% and the percentage has risen to 80% last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defence Minister Teo once said, our youth are "fitter, but less rugged".&nbsp; Perhaps, another reason could be that parents mollycoddle their children or even over indulge in them.&nbsp; A lot has to do with the home environment where domestic help take care of everything from packing the child's bag to clearing up after him.&nbsp; Since there is little we can do to improve his ruggedness at home, I would be interested to hear from MINDEF what can be done to enhance the ruggedness of our young people, especially in relation to their National Service training?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

NS is seen as a rite of passage for male Singaporeans&nbsp;&ndash; being transformed from boys to men.&nbsp; MINDEF's role is to transform them from civilians to</p> <p align=left>Column: 2965<p><p>soldiers.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to raise two issues regarding NS.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the impact of the reduction in the duration of NS.&nbsp; As the SAF graduates into a 3G defence force, the duration of full-time National Service has been reduced to two years.&nbsp; The shortened duration of service, while welcomed by the men, might have&nbsp;effects on the operations of MINDEF, in effectively executing&nbsp;the training programmes and ensuring that the NSmen arrive at the same level of competence as their predecessors.&nbsp; Has MINDEF assessed the impact of the reduction in duration on the quality of training and level of competence of our NSFs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the reduction in duration of service also implies a more hectic training schedule and possibly lead to a lesser sense of commitment on the part of the NSFs.&nbsp; How does MINDEF ensure that NSFs continue to be sufficiently motivated and committed to defence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point, Sir, relates to the scheduling of NS enlistment.&nbsp; Given the flexible nature as a result of the modular system in many of our post-secondary institutions, like the ITEs and polytechnics, the graduation period of NS-liable boys vary significantly.&nbsp; Many have plans to further their studies after NS.&nbsp; However, the dates of NS enlistment sometimes affect their plans significantly, especially if they plan to study overseas.&nbsp; In some cases, it would mean that the boy has to wait almost a year after completing his full-time National Service to start his undergraduate programme.&nbsp; How does MINDEF manage such intake requests (be it early or later) of NSFs affected by such circumstances?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He was the second Singaporean child to win the Marion S Gray Outstanding Musician Award at 11 and&nbsp;had wanted to study piano at the Eastman School of Music in New York.&nbsp; But he was told he had to complete National Service first.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, he moved on from his music.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story reminded me about violin prodigy Ike See, who was rejected twice when he applied to defer NS.&nbsp; He finally got to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music after he opted for a two-year diploma instead of a three-year course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a musician, I know how vital it is to continuously hone one's skills, and I think the Ministry could be more flexible in granting deferments.&nbsp; I am speaking not just for musicians but all rare Singaporean talents.&nbsp; This may seem odd, since I have clearly not done NS before.&nbsp; But I raise this issue because others who have served NS have voiced their support for such Singaporeans.&nbsp; We should encourage this culture of affirmation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has said before that the principles of universality and equity must apply to NS.&nbsp; I agree on universality.&nbsp; This is not a call for NS exemptions.&nbsp; But we should strike a balance on equity.&nbsp; We must not take it too far or we will lose the opportunity to help build a more enlightened society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If equity is all, should not those&nbsp;who had served two and a half years of NS now feel a sense of inequity because youth only serve two years?&nbsp; I am really sure that we are better than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When NS was new and Singapore was young, it was understandable why the Ministry needed to be very strict after deferments.&nbsp; But if our deferment policy cannot be refined, it says a lot of how much progress our policymakers think our nation has made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2967<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I know the Ministry is more flexible.&nbsp; Our national sailors have been granted deferments.&nbsp; I am sure others who have represented Singapore in global competitions have been as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect it is easier to grant deferments in these circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect it is harder when it comes to Singaporeans pursuing rare talents, chasing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we accept appeals by organisations such as Singapore Sailing on behalf of sailors, we can also accept appeals by other national bodies, such as the SSO, on behalf of rare musical talents, for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I do not intend to draft an entire deferment mechanism now.&nbsp; I recall how the Finance Minister said the Singapore system "relies on the trust in the individuals in charge" when it came to our reserves.&nbsp; I am sure the Defence Minister will be no less trustworthy to decide on deferments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other countries have found a way&nbsp;to do it.&nbsp; So can we, probably better.&nbsp; More importantly, how much do we gain as a&nbsp;nation when we read about stories such as Keegan Ng's?&nbsp; How much more could we gain if&nbsp;we are able to read stories that celebrate rare talents who can put us on&nbsp;the world map and see policies that support them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, NSmen play an important role in the defence of Singapore.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are not only required to serve full time for two years (and for some of them, it was&nbsp;two and a half&nbsp;years in the past) but they have to remain operationally-ready until age 40 for Warrant Officers and age 50 for Officers.&nbsp; They are also liable to be called up at short notice, and this means work disruption for them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see this personally in my work life because I have a number of young male lawyers in my team who are liable to be called up for reservist duty.&nbsp; &nbsp;When they are called up, before they go for reservist, they often have to put in additional hours to make sure that their work is cleared before they go for&nbsp;reservist.&nbsp; In some cases, if they are allowed to book out, they come back in the evenings, on weekends, on public holidays, just to ensure that their work is cleared on time to meet the client demands.&nbsp; This is not to say that I am a particularly hard task master.&nbsp; It is just that they are very professional in what they do and the nature of their job is such that it cannot always be delegated to others. So they come back to make sure that they do the job properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just cite this as an example of&nbsp;a situation that I am familiar with.&nbsp; But I have no doubt that there are many other NSmen who have the same wholehearted commitment to both their work and to their NS duty and this entails both dedication and sacrifice on their part.&nbsp; It also impacts on the time that they have available to spend with their families or just simply time for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what efforts have been made to recognise and acknowledge the contributions of our NSmen and also, since the NS duties inevitably impinge on their work responsibilities, having an understanding and supportive employer is important.&nbsp; So,</p><p align=left>Column: 2969<p><p>could the Minister let us know what level of employer support there is for NS generally?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Bullying in Camps</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was concerned when I read in the newspapers last month about an incident when NS recruit was badly beaten up by his camp mates.&nbsp; His camp mates were apparently unhappy about his attitude in carrying out his duties and their solution to this was to confront him and beat him up with&nbsp;wooden poles.&nbsp; He was beaten so badly that he was hospitalised for several weeks.&nbsp; I understand though that the attackers have been formally charged with criminal offences and sentenced, and rightly so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular incident is now closed.&nbsp; But I would like to ask the Minister whether this type of conduct is typical or prevalent in the SAF because our NSmen are drawn from all walks of life with very different educational backgrounds.&nbsp; Some may have been members of youth gangs prior to doing their NS.&nbsp; Their idea of how to settle a dispute is very different from what we might regard as acceptable.&nbsp; So what steps is the SAF taking to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Total Defence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I totally support the concept of Total Defence.&nbsp; My question though is whether this concept has fully permeated to all levels of Singapore's society and whether everyone fully understands that&nbsp;the defence&nbsp;of Singapore is not just the job of the SAF, but of every Singaporean&nbsp;&ndash; man, woman or child&nbsp;&ndash; whether you are working, whether you are a senior citizen, whether you are a school-going youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has done a very good job of promoting its image as a defence force.&nbsp; So much so&nbsp;that many people</p> <p align=left>Column: 2970<p><p>automatically think that defence is purely the job of the SAF.&nbsp; Not everybody understands and recognises that defence is the responsibility of every Singaporean.&nbsp; But not all understand this.&nbsp; Let me just bring up one example which underscores it.&nbsp;&nbsp;People should remember that the first Singapore victim to international terrorism was a woman.&nbsp; She was not an SAF officer.&nbsp; She was not somebody in the security forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a young lawyer, and&nbsp;she was the first victim of international terrorism.&nbsp; So the security challenges that we face come&nbsp;home to us personally.&nbsp; It is our home to defend.&nbsp; It is our responsibility to take, not just the SAF's.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what efforts are being made to promote Total Defence as a concept applicable to all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, we have a good and effective SAF.&nbsp; Singaporeans feel secure and confident that we will be able to defend ourselves against any external threats.&nbsp; We attract many foreigners who decide to make Singapore their home because of this sense of security.&nbsp;

First, it will accelerate global geo-political shifts.&nbsp; Second, during a recession, social stresses may lead to increased instability.&nbsp; Third, the threat of terrorism overlays these first two concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Zainudin Nordin asked how we can ensure peace and stability in our region in these uncertain times.&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about the regional security architecture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the end of the Cold War, the US has been the pre-eminent economic and military power.&nbsp; Other countries such as China and India were emerging, both economically and militarily.&nbsp; The economic crisis has accelerated this process.&nbsp; While the G7 used to shape the global financial and economic framework, it no longer has the means to resolve the economic crisis by itself.&nbsp; Wider concerted action is required, as illustrated by the hasty convening of a G20 meeting last November.&nbsp; This shift in global economic weight, and the rise of other powers, will lead to a faster transition to a multi-polar world where no single power can steer global developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US will remain the world's most powerful nation.&nbsp; Its leadership will be necessary to address key economic and security issues, but it cannot work alone.&nbsp; This shift will also impact regional security, where the interests of the major powers&nbsp;&ndash; energy sources, sea lines of communications, markets&nbsp;&ndash; intersect, and overlay the region's traditional diversity and rivalries.&nbsp; It is not coincidental that tensions abound in the countries bordering the Caspian Sea and in Central Asia, where pipeline politics, energy and historical animosities provide a volatile mix.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our region, it is thus even more important that we continue to build an open, stable and inclusive regional security architecture that will help sustain</p><p align=left>Column: 2974<p><p>peace and stability for the longer term.&nbsp; ASEAN has a key role to play in this.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN facilitates and shapes multilateral fora, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit.&nbsp; The ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting&nbsp;(ADMM), is an important part of this architecture, where ASEAN defence ministers come together to build a more cohesive ASEAN security community that can help shape the wider security architecture of our region.&nbsp; The ADMM has agreed on the principles for the ADMM-Plus, where ASEAN countries can engage our partners in the larger Asia-Pacific to address common security challenges.&nbsp; Other multilateral and bilateral security arrangements also play a useful role.&nbsp; One example is the Five Power Defence Arrangements, which bring together Malaysia and Singapore and anchor its extra-regional partners Australia, New Zealand and the UK in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore is the only forum where defence ministers, senior officials, and academics from the region and beyond gather for an informal and frank exchange of views.&nbsp; This key event, which will be held for the eighth time this year, has played a useful and unique role in sharing security perspectives, promoting confidence and transparency, and evolving new modalities for cooperation and norms of behaviour amongst countries in our region.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the Ministers discussed principles for cooperation, particularly for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief.&nbsp; MINDEF contributes to the building of this regional security architecture in two ways: (1) by contributing ideas and concepts to help crystallise the security architecture; and (2) by having a capable SAF which can engage meaningfully with our ASEAN friends and partner countries, and contribute useful capabilities towards regional cooperative activities.&nbsp; Without either of these, Singapore will play a</p><p align=left>Column: 2975<p><p>much more diminished role and we will not have the same voice at the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our multilateral engagements within the region are supported by a strong network of bilateral defence relations, particularly with Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Brunei.&nbsp; Every year, the SAF takes part in numerous bilateral exercises with each of these neighbours.&nbsp; These interactions also add breadth and depth to our relationships, and contribute to regional stability.&nbsp; Singapore has also been actively engaging key countries from beyond our immediate region because they play&nbsp;a useful and constructive role in our region.&nbsp; We have a strong and longstanding relationship with the US.&nbsp; We welcome a US presence in our region.&nbsp; The sustained US presence is an important stabilising influence in the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp; We have demonstrated our support through the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding, and its 1998 Addendum which allows US ships and aircraft to use Singapore's facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, we concluded the Strategic Framework Agreement and Defence Cooperation Agreement.&nbsp; The high tempo of defence exchanges, benefits both armed forces professionally.&nbsp; In addition to the three existing F-16, Chinook and Apache training detachments in the US, our Air Force will establish a new F-15SG training detachment in Mountain Home, Idaho, this year.&nbsp; With China, the signing of the Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation last year was a milestone in our bilateral defence relationship.&nbsp; We also inaugurated the annual China-Singapore Defence Policy Dialogue, and have continued with high-level defence visits, professional exchanges, cross-attendance of courses and port calls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilateral relations with India have taken significant strides since the signing</p><p align=left>Column: 2976<p><p>of the Defence Cooperation Agreement in 2003, reflecting the wide-ranging and growing Singapore-India bilateral defence relationship.&nbsp; We signed a Bilateral Agreement with India for Joint Army training and exercises last year, and the Bilateral Agreement on Air Force training in 2007.&nbsp; Our relations with Australia and New Zealand remain warm and strong.&nbsp; Through bilateral exercises, exchanges and common deployments previously to East Timor and now to Afghanistan, we have developed a deep understanding with both countries.&nbsp; Singapore also enjoys good defence relations with Japan and Korea, and has good defence cooperation with France, Germany, Sweden and South Africa.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regional stability is crucial, particularly against the backdrop of today's inter-connected world.&nbsp; Nations face a spectrum of multi-faceted, complex and trans-border security challenges.&nbsp; They include terrorism, piracy, sectarianism, competition for resources, natural disasters, pandemics and cross-border movements of people.&nbsp; There are also unexpected threats that we have not yet foreseen&nbsp;&ndash; the unknown unknowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst these emerging challenges, we must not lose sight of the need for small states like Singapore to always be prepared to safeguard our security and sovereignty.&nbsp; Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 is a constant reminder.&nbsp; A country which does not provide for its own defence leaves its future and its fate in the hands of others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just returned from the Munich Security Conference.&nbsp; In Munich,&nbsp;each year,&nbsp;I meet many Defence and Foreign Ministers from countries born out of the break up of the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia&nbsp;&ndash; small countries mostly.&nbsp; They value their independence all the more because it is so recent, and so hard won; and in some cases, so tenuous.&nbsp; They worry about their security.&nbsp; But not all have been able to provide for it&nbsp;&ndash; they either have not had enough time or they</p><p align=left>Column: 2977<p><p>do not have the resources.&nbsp; Just in the past two years, several of these new countries have faced dire security threats ranging from ethnic strife to territorial and energy disputes, which have resulted in armed conflict, loss of life and territory, interruption of energy supplies and cyber attacks.&nbsp; These have caused severe damage and, in some cases, break-up of the countries affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deepening economic crisis will compound existing security challenges, making them more acute.&nbsp; Countries that are seriously affected could face social and possibly political instability and turmoil.&nbsp; In Britain, France and Greece, strikes and demonstrations have already broken out.&nbsp; As the economic slowdown bites, sources of stress and tension will increase.&nbsp; We saw this in our own region in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Indeed, the security challenges we face today come from&nbsp;all directions "360-degrees" and have the potential to undermine our security&nbsp;&ndash; and our region's security.&nbsp; Piracy is one of these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Michael Palmer have asked about piracy in the Malacca Strait and the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; By threatening the freedom of navigation and the safety of international shipping, piracy adversely impacts the global economy and regional security.&nbsp; The Straits of Singapore and Malacca, and the Gulf of Aden, are vital waterways connecting Asia and Europe.&nbsp; In the Malacca Strait, the three littoral states&nbsp;&ndash; Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia&nbsp;&ndash; started the Malacca Strait Patrols in 2004 to combat piracy.&nbsp; The grouping has now expanded to include Thailand.&nbsp; The number of piracy incidents in the Malacca Strait has declined significantly, from a high of 21 in 2004 to&nbsp;six in 2008.&nbsp; These are figures from the&nbsp;Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).&nbsp; But some</p><p align=left>Column: 2978<p><p>analysts have predicted that the economic crisis may cause piracy to rise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, last November, Indonesian Navy spokesman Sagom Tamboem told journalists, and I quote, "we predict that with the global crisis, there will be more pirates and illegal activities taking place in the Malacca Strait."&nbsp; This is a realistic assessment.&nbsp; Therefore, we will have to maintain our efforts in the Malacca Strait.&nbsp; User states can also share information through the ReCAAP, which I mentioned earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Gulf of Aden, there has been a recent upsurge of piracy attacks.&nbsp; In the past year, over 100 ships have been attacked by pirates, who have raked in an estimated ransom of US$120 million dollars.&nbsp; In recent months, NATO, the European Union, the US, as well as countries such as China, India, Malaysia and Russia, have contributed to anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; Other countries, including Japan and Turkey have announced their intention to send naval vessels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will be joining these efforts by deploying a Landing Ship Tank, with two Super Puma helicopters embarked, for a period of three months this year.&nbsp; The ship will work with the newly-formed Combined Task Force 151 to protect shipping in the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; She will deploy once the operational arrangements have been made.&nbsp; Why are we doing this?&nbsp; As a maritime nation, Singapore shares the concerns of the international community regarding piracy, and is committed to supporting international efforts to keep the sea lanes safe and secure.&nbsp; It is not possible for any country,&nbsp;Singapore included, to protect its own shipping on its own in all the key sea lanes of the world.&nbsp; All countries, therefore, have to depend on international cooperation to secure the sea lanes for everyone's use.&nbsp; Littoral states, user states, and the international community all have a role to play.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2979<p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our priority will still be on ensuring the security of the Straits of Singapore and Malacca, but we are also playing our part, through this small but meaningful contribution, as part of a multinational force to protect international shipping in the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; Such international cooperative measures will help all ships, including Singapore ships, which should also take the necessary self-protection measures, such as the appropriate routes, speed and timing for their passage to minimise their likelihood of being attacked.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Michael Palmer asked how we can prevent a terrorist attack.&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Mohamad Maliki, and Mr Michael Palmer asked what lessons the SAF can learn from the attacks in Mumbai.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mumbai attacks are the latest in a string of global attacks.&nbsp; They are a grim reminder that terrorism remains a common and persistent threat to all nations, and that the costs stemming from a failure to be vigilant are great.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore continues to be a target, and we have to remain on our guard.&nbsp; Initial studies of the Mumbai attacks have underscored the critical need for intelligence, early warning and prevention capabilities to discover, detect and deter these threats.&nbsp; Close inter-agency teamwork are essential to counter the threat.&nbsp; The SAF, therefore,&nbsp;works closely with homefront agencies to support our national counter-terrorism strategy of "prevent, protect and respond".&nbsp; Following the August 2007 amendments to the SAF Act passed by this House, SAF troops have been deployed to assist the Singapore Police Force in a number of major security operations last year, and to continue with the protection of&nbsp;key </p><p align=left>Column: 2980<p><p>installations.&nbsp; The Air Force and Navy conduct air and maritime security operations in close coordination with their respective civilian counterparts.&nbsp; The SAF also maintains high-end capabilities, on high readiness, such as the Special Operations Force for intervention and hostage rescue, and units for chemical and biological defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the terrorists entered Mumbai via the sea.&nbsp; The SAF has invested significantly to deter and respond to transnational terrorist threats in the Singapore Straits which is used by more than&nbsp;1,000 vessels each day.&nbsp; Our Navy works closely with the Port Authority and the Coast Guard to improve our radar and electro-optical sensor network.&nbsp; Navy ships conduct round-the-clock patrols and last year alone escorted 1,900 merchant ships carrying sensitive cargo in&nbsp;the Singapore Straits.&nbsp; Accompanying Sea Security Teams, comprising Navy and Coast Guard armed sea marshals last year boarded and accompanied 1,100 selected vessels coming into&nbsp;Singapore&rsquo;s ports.&nbsp; To further strengthen inter-agency collaboration, the SAF annually conducts Exercise APEX, for all maritime agencies to validate and review their operational plans.&nbsp; In fact, Exercise APEX 2009 commenced earlier this week.&nbsp; The SAF has also restructured the Navy&rsquo;s Coastal Command as the Maritime Security Task Force&nbsp;(MSTF), which I will speak on a little later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Singapore&rsquo;s security cannot just be the concern of Government agencies.&nbsp; Security is a national responsibility, as several Members have pointed out, and all of us must offer additional eyes and ears to enhance our vigilance.&nbsp; Every Singaporean must develop strong communal ties and mutual trust with fellow Singaporeans, so that if we are ever hit, our people will remain cohesive and have the resilience to quickly bounce back.&nbsp; Every citizen has a role to play.&nbsp; This is the crux of Total Defence, which is</p><p align=left>Column: 2981<p><p>an important topic&nbsp;which Assoc. Prof. Koo will speak on later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism respects no boundaries, and cannot be resolved by any one nation acting alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer asked about Singapore&rsquo;s contributions to international security operations.&nbsp; Singapore remains committed to doing its part for the multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Since 2001, we have contributed SAF deployments, assistance-in-kind and training courses for Afghan&nbsp;personnel.&nbsp; In 2008, we continued our SAF deployments with the New Zealand Defence Force&rsquo;s Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan&nbsp;that we had started in 2007, by deploying a construction engineering team there for two rotations totalling six months.&nbsp; During their deployment, the teams supervised the construction of a Regional Health Training Centre and a Security Wall around the Bamiyan University Dormitory.&nbsp; We expect to make a similar contribution of a construction engineering team to Bamiyan this year.&nbsp; In addition, since November 2008, the SAF has deployed a 20-man medical team to Oruzgan Province, for two rotations totalling six months, to provide primary healthcare and ward capabilities in support of the Dutch and Australian forces deployed there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also exploring additional operationally useful contributions, within our capabilities and resources, to the UN-mandated, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.&nbsp; We are now working on the details of a three-month deployment of a KC-135 tanker aircraft in the later part of this year to support coalition operations over Afghanistan.&nbsp; We also know that intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities are a priority need in Afghanistan.&nbsp; We are thus exploring the deployment of such assets, eg, an</p><p align=left>Column: 2982<p><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Task Group, to Afghanistan to enhance ISAF&rsquo;s situational awareness and security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer also asked about the risks faced by our soldiers in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Our deployments do involve risks to our servicemen, which can be significant.&nbsp; Attacks from rockets and Improvised Explosive Devices are common in Oruzgan.&nbsp; In Bamiyan, such attacks are less frequent.&nbsp; The SAF has to undertake these missions even though they do entail risks.&nbsp; Where there is important work to be done, there will be risks.&nbsp; To mitigate the risks, we make sure that our servicemen are well equipped and trained, and receive additional training specific to their mission and area of operation.&nbsp; For instance, our medical team in Oruzgan underwent rigorous pre-deployment training which included modules to sharpen their weapon handling skills, identify and mitigate Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threats, as well as react to hostile elements.&nbsp; Our servicemen have to be vigilant at all times to respond to unexpected situations that may arise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our missions in Afghanistan have a direct link to Singapore&rsquo;s security.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that key members of the JI cell in Singapore received training in Afghanistan, including its leader Ibrahim Maidin.&nbsp; The JI had hatched plans to attack various targets in Singapore even before the 11 September 2001 attack in the US, and before coalition forces went into Afghanistan and overthrew the Taliban.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also recall that a copy of a video-tape of the JI reconnaissance of Yishun MRT station was found in the rubble of the house of the Al Qaeda leader Mohd Atef in Kabul in 2001.&nbsp; In February 2007, a 28-year-old self-radicalised Singaporean lawyer&nbsp;was arrested and detained after attempting to pursue militant <I>jihad</I> in Afghanistan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is making these deployments to show our support and assist in a</p><p align=left>Column: 2983<p><p>meaningful way in the stabilisation and reconstruction efforts so as to prevent extremists from using Afghanistan to export terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last Sunday in Munich, I spoke with the Afghan National Security Adviser Dr Zalmai Rassoul, and listened to Afghan President Hamid Karzai speak about his hopes and plans for the future of his country amidst the many challenges that they face.&nbsp; Our servicemen there can also contribute, in a small way, to make a long-term difference to the lives of the Afghan people, while enhancing Singapore&rsquo;s overall security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer also asked whether National Service personnel are&nbsp;deployed for these missions.&nbsp; In the case of Afghanistan, we have only deployed regular servicemen.&nbsp; If suitable Full-time or Operationally-Ready National Servicemen wish to volunteer, they may do so and we will treat their period of service with the mission as regular service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides Afghanistan, Singapore has been contributing to multinational reconstruction efforts in Iraq since 2003.&nbsp; The SAF has made five deployments of Landing Ships Tank, five deployments of KC-135 tanker aircraft and one deployment of C-130 transport aircraft in support of coalition operations in Iraq in the last five years.&nbsp; Significant progress has been made in Iraq after these five years.&nbsp; The Iraqi security forces are now prepared to take over the responsibility of providing security for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; As such, coalition forces are now in a position to begin their phased withdrawals.&nbsp; Singapore's commitments to stabilisation operations in Iraq will therefore also come to an end.&nbsp; I am sure that Members of this House will join me in acknowledging the contributions of our 998 SAF Servicemen, some of whom have served multiple tours, to the</p><p align=left>Column: 2984<p><p>multinational reconstruction efforts in Iraq over the past five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we contribute to international and regional security, the SAF&rsquo;s primary mission is to defend Singapore.&nbsp; Today, Singapore relies on an SAF that possesses a full spectrum of capabilities to deter aggression and respond flexibly from peacetime operations to full-scale combat operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about the&nbsp;third generation SAF.&nbsp; The SAF&rsquo;s transformation is on track.&nbsp; The first of our four Gulfstream 550 Airborne Early Warning aircraft will arrive later this month to replace the E-2C Hawkeye that has served us well for over 20 years.&nbsp; Last November, our first F-15SG fighter plane, which replaces the A4 Skyhawks, rolled off the Boeing factory production line.&nbsp; Both aircraft will add new dimensions to Singapore&rsquo;s air defence capabilities.&nbsp; Last month, the final two of the Navy&rsquo;s six frigates were commissioned, replacing the Missile Gunboats, which have served Singapore well since the 1970s.&nbsp; The frigates are now fully operational and have taken part in highly demanding exercises in the Indian Ocean and off Hawaii.&nbsp; We have inducted the Leopard 2A4 Main Battle Tanks and more crews will be sent for training in Germany next month.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF constantly hones its readiness and validates new fighting concepts through realistic exercises.&nbsp; Last May, I visited the Division Exercise, Lightning Warrior, in South Africa.&nbsp; This exercise validated the Division&rsquo;s ability to integrate the SAF&rsquo;s air and land capabilities to see first and strike first, in order to decisively influence the battle&rsquo;s outcome.&nbsp; The Air-Land Tactical Control Centre was also exercised during Exercise Wallaby in Australia last November.&nbsp; This exercise&nbsp;involved 3,600 full-time National Servicemen and NSmen, and platforms such as F-16s, Pegasus lightweight </p><p align=left>Column: 2985<p><p>artillery howitzers and, for the first time, the Leopard Tanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF is also restructuring to better respond to current and future security challenges.&nbsp; Last year, the Air Force completed its major reorganisation into five mission-oriented functional commands.&nbsp; The Army's 2nd People's Defence Force Headquarters was restructured as the Island Defence Headquarters and has since been working&nbsp;with Home Team agencies to monitor and respond to security threats.&nbsp; This year, the Navy&rsquo;s Coastal Command will be restructured as another SAF-level task force&nbsp;&ndash; the Maritime Security Task Force&nbsp;&ndash; which will work closely with the Police Coast Guard, Maritime Port Authority, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and Singapore Customs to ensure national coordination in maritime security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi Daipi asked if our personnel are ready for the SAF&rsquo;s restructuring, and Ms Indranee Rajah as well.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s recruit is very different from his predecessor.&nbsp; He is better-educated and technologically-savvy.&nbsp; We wish they were a little more physically fit but Dr Ng will speak about that afterwards.&nbsp; The SAF&rsquo;s new training concepts seek to develop innovative and adaptable soldiers.&nbsp; To maximise each soldier&rsquo;s potential, the SAF believes in equipping him well.&nbsp; We have introduced the Advanced Combat Man System (ACMS)&nbsp;&ndash; a computerised system worn by the soldier that comprises communication, image-gathering and navigational technologies.&nbsp; So this third generation transformation&nbsp;is going down to the section and soldier level. ACMS allows the basic infantry section to tap on a wider range of combat resources such as fire support from other units.&nbsp; We are equipping our key training schools and several battalions with the ACMS, and will continue to make improvements and upgrades&nbsp;in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have received a notebook in your little pack with the print of the new pixelised combat </p><p align=left>Column: 2986<p><p>uniform.&nbsp; The new uniform has improved functional design, dissipates heat better, and enhances combat survivability.&nbsp; Dr Ng will&nbsp;elaborate on how our People Development initiatives will bring out the best in our personnel.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Rajah also&nbsp;asked about the preparedness of the SAF for other types of warfare, like&nbsp;urban warfare.&nbsp; The new Murai Urban Training Facility was built to resemble a typical town and offers realistic urban training and validation of new equipment, tactics and doctrines.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF is ready to confront current and future operational challenges because we have embarked on the transformation to the third generation SAF.&nbsp; Such investments have enabled the SAF to restructure and streamline its training and operational requirements, leading to more effective use of our National Servicemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would recall that this transition to the third generation SAF is what has allowed us to reduce the duration of National Service in 2004, while maintaining the operational readiness and fighting edge of the SAF.&nbsp; So&nbsp;our investment in technology and new equipment has allowed us to reduce the period of&nbsp;National Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time NS duration is now&nbsp;two years, down from&nbsp;two and a&nbsp;half&nbsp;years, while the NS In-Camp-Training cycle is reduced from 13 years to 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng, Mr Arthur Fong, Mr Hawazi and Mr Low Thia Khiang&nbsp;earlier during the main Budget debate and Ms Ho Geok Choo asked about our defence expenditure.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s independent and secure Singapore, is made possible by a capable SAF which is the direct product of our steady and prudent investments in defence over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government&rsquo;s policy is to invest steadily on defence&nbsp;&ndash; like an insurance</p><p align=left>Column: 2987<p><p>policy.&nbsp; While the Government is prepared to spend up to 6% of GDP on defence, we have not always used this full amount, and indeed invest only what is needed.&nbsp; So this is the operating principle&nbsp;&ndash; investing only what we need.&nbsp; The long-term defence needs are appraised and the long-term resources to meet these needs are determined.&nbsp; Hence, from 1997 to 2002, defence expenditure was about&nbsp;5.0% to 5.5% of GDP.&nbsp; Since 2002 the defence expenditure has typically been between 4.5% and 5% of GDP.&nbsp; We expect that on average the defence budget will be within this GDP range over the next few years.&nbsp; This is in line with the overall budget and the&nbsp;budgets of the other Ministries.&nbsp; And within this range, the defence budget will move&nbsp;up and down with the GDP and overall&nbsp;Government budget.&nbsp; We do not sharply increase defence&nbsp;spending during an economic upturn just because more money can be made available, and we do not sharply cut spending when the economy slows.&nbsp; So instead of a feast-and-famine approach, we put in consistent investments in defence.&nbsp; This is the prudent approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, security threats do not disappear during an economic downturn.&nbsp; On the contrary, as I have pointed out earlier, social and political frictions increase during difficult economic times or, as&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah said earlier, the world does not appear to be a very safe place.&nbsp; Quite an understatement.&nbsp; Having a credible SAF to defend Singapore&rsquo;s sovereignty and vital interests is even more crucial under these circumstances.&nbsp; A steady defence budget through both good and difficult economic times sends a strong signal of our resolve to defend ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building effective defence capabilities takes many years.&nbsp; It would be too late to start buying weapons and raising capabilities only when an obvious threat </p><p align=left>Column: 2988<p><p>confronts us.&nbsp; Defence programmes have long gestation periods and it is more effective to plan and invest for the long term.&nbsp; Major programmes like the frigate typically take a decade from inception to full operational status.&nbsp; It takes even longer for our people &ndash; SAF servicemen, scientists and engineers &ndash; to master their respective expertise.&nbsp; Sharply reducing the budget during a downturn means that certain capabilities, people and expertise that took many years to build may be lost and&nbsp;these capabilities cannot be easily rebuilt just by short-term spending increases.&nbsp; MINDEF&rsquo;s multi-year plans ensure that the SAF is built up as a coherent and effective fighting force.&nbsp; A stable defence budget allows us to make long-term decisions in order to obtain the best value for our investment, whether it is in building up capability in our people, or in weapon systems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Arthur Fong that this steady approach to defence spending ensures that the SAF is always well-prepared to confront security challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms&nbsp;Irene Ng&nbsp;also asked what do we spend on in defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our defence budget has three main parts.&nbsp; I would describe it only in broad terms.&nbsp; First, through our investment in people, we develop well-trained soldiers, sailors and airmen and also engineers and scientists.&nbsp; Second, through our operating expenditure, we carry out operations both locally and in support of our international commitments, and maintain a high state of operational readiness through rigorous training.&nbsp; Third, through our capital expenditure, we equip our servicemen with the most appropriate equipment so that they can carry out their mission with confidence and success.&nbsp; We are also spending a little more this year on construction in line with the Government&rsquo;s Resilience Package.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a policy, MINDEF only buys what we need, and what is most cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2989<p><p>We extend the life of our equipment by maintaining them well and upgrading, where possible.&nbsp; The 18 year-old Missile Corvettes will embark on a Life Extension Programme so that they can continue to contribute effectively for many more years.&nbsp; When we do need to make a purchase, we do not always buy the latest model.&nbsp; Our AMX-13 tanks were bought second-hand 40 years ago and upgraded to SM-1s 20 years ago.&nbsp; Now that the SM-1s can no longer be further upgraded to meet our needs, we have bought second-hand Leopard tanks to replace them.&nbsp; In fact, quite a number of our major equipment are second-hand although Members may not realise that.&nbsp; Our KC-135 aerial tankers, some of our C130s and indeed our submarines were also bought second-hand, and these&nbsp;are periodically upgraded with modern systems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do&nbsp;buy new equipment&nbsp;when it is&nbsp;necessary and particularly to keep our fighting edge sharp, such as the F-15s, UAVs and frigates, and we also build our own unique systems to meet our requirements when it is more cost-effective to do so, such as the Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier and our Landing Ship Tanks.&nbsp; I would like to inform Ms Indranee Rajah that we are able to do this because MINDEF consistently spends about&nbsp;4% of our defence budget on R&amp;D.&nbsp; Our cost-effective equipment is well-regarded internationally and&nbsp; ST Engineering was recently awarded a contract to supply the Bronco to the UK Armed Forces.&nbsp; Our Landing Ship Tank has also found buyers in other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current economic crisis has altered the security landscape, and compounds this "360 degree" security threats facing Singapore and the region.&nbsp; A strong SAF underpins the peace and stability that will allow Singapore to ride out the economic slowdown, and protect our vital interests.&nbsp; I thank the House and all Singaporeans for your commitment to</p> <p align=left>Column: 2990<p><p>defence and with your strong support, MINDEF and the SAF will continue to ensure a safe and secure Singapore, which gives us the confidence to forge ahead to chart our own future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ultimately, though the security of our nation needs equipment, systems and&nbsp;weapons,&nbsp;it depends on our men and women.&nbsp; The SAF must continue to attract and retain people with the right values, motivation and abilities, and ready them to confront the current and future security challenges.&nbsp; And Singaporeans must have the resolve and determination to defend what is ours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I will now ask Dr Ng to elaborate on our initiatives to bring out the best in our personnel and&nbsp;Prof. Koo&nbsp;will elaborate on Total Defence.<br></p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Sir, permit me to continue on some of the aspects that Minister for Defence has touched on as well as to address questions by Members.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee&nbsp;Rajah asked about the fitness of full-time&nbsp;National Servicemen (NSFs) and how this relates to deaths&nbsp;during training.&nbsp; First, let me clarify that all enlistees must undergo medical screening to determine their Physical Employment Status (PES).&nbsp; This is done by&nbsp;trained doctors and it is only after the screening by doctors&nbsp;based on their PES, that&nbsp;the enlistees&nbsp;are assigned to&nbsp;the type of training and vocations which are suitable for them.&nbsp; As elaborated previously in this House&nbsp;in response to&nbsp;PQs, MINDEF adopts internationally-accepted procedures and standards for medical screening.&nbsp; Indeed, when it comes to routine screening&nbsp;for cardiac conditions, we adopt higher standards than those recommended by the American Heart Association, for example.&nbsp; An independent expert panel of medical experts regularly reviews and updates screening requirements for the SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2991<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, even after having passed the most detailed of screening techniques, there remain a small number of persons who can suffer&nbsp;unexpected deaths.&nbsp; From time to time, we read of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;affect both civilians and military personnel and&nbsp;even amongst athletes and sportsmen who are&nbsp;used to physically demanding conditions.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is&nbsp;not even related to great physical exertion.&nbsp; Sudden deaths have&nbsp;occurred with minimal physical stress or during sleep.&nbsp; These unexpected deaths reveal the limits of detection capabilities for pre-existing diseases even with the best medical technology.&nbsp; Some causes of death simply do not provide any prior warning to allow remedial or preventive measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the SAF, all servicemen are&nbsp;put through training&nbsp;after the&nbsp;medical experts have deemed them suitable for their respective PES.&nbsp; But as Ms Indranee Rajah has alluded to and Mr Arthur Fong also,&nbsp;NSFs can have varying levels of physical performance and endurance.&nbsp; To determine if they are physically well-conditioned for basic military training, we use the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) Silver as the benchmark.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have obtained at least a&nbsp;NAPFA Silver, and this is&nbsp;about 50% of&nbsp;current enlistees, go directly for their&nbsp;Basic Military Training (BMT).&nbsp; The remaining half require help to improve their physical performance and endurance before they join the rest of the cohort for their&nbsp;BMT.&nbsp; So they attend a four-week course called the Physical Training Phase, or PTP.&nbsp; They do it after they are enlisted,&nbsp;upon enlistment and before they go through the&nbsp;BMT.&nbsp; This is for the four-week course and it does improve their physical performance, but we have found&nbsp;that&nbsp;even after four weeks, many still do not reach the same level of fitness when compared to their peers who went directly into BMT.&nbsp; So there is still a lag even after four weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2992<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us know that BMT is physically rigorous and MINDEF and the SAF have been studying how we can better prepare those undergoing this&nbsp;PTP for&nbsp;Basic Military Training, a point which Mr Arthur Fong asked.&nbsp; We have concluded that the current&nbsp;four weeks is too short as it does not bring&nbsp;these recruits to a comparable level of physical conditioning as their direct BMT peers.&nbsp; We have therefore decided to add another four weeks and extend the PTP to eight weeks, instead of the current&nbsp;four weeks.&nbsp; This will enable a more uniform level of fitness amongst the recruits when they start their BMT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should note that the overall duration of a&nbsp;full-time two-year NS remains unchanged.&nbsp; So we are not extending it but upon enlistment, PTP recruits will undergo their eight-week PTP first and then serve out the remaining&nbsp;one year 10 months of full-time NS.&nbsp; This eight-week PTP will be implemented for those enlisted from December 2009 onwards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having announced this extension of the PTP from&nbsp;four to eight weeks,&nbsp;I hope that young male Singaporeans will now not get the wrong idea&nbsp;that they can&nbsp;neglect or reduce their&nbsp;regular exercise and hope for this&nbsp;eight-week course&nbsp;to prepare them for BMT.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think it is always better to do it regularly for your own health and well-being.&nbsp; Of course, for those in poor physical condition, I think even eight weeks of PTP may still be inadequate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Indranee&nbsp;asked about encouraging&nbsp;our NSmen to maintain their fitness in order to pass their IPPT.&nbsp; First, let me thank her for her personal and physical commitment.&nbsp; I think she is a good example, and I thank her for the efforts that she has done in the constituency. &nbsp;And I encourage MPs to do </p><p align=left>Column: 2993<p><p>this as well in support of Total Defence.&nbsp; The SAF introduced various mechanisms to help our NSmen.&nbsp; I take her point that she prefers the natural conditions rather than&nbsp;air-condition.&nbsp; But we are practical&nbsp;&ndash; we want to introduce practical ways to allow our NSmen access.&nbsp; In October 2006, we introduced a specific programme at Bedok and Khatib Fitness and Conditioning Centres (FCC), and at Maju Fitness Conditioning Centre in August 2008. This is a voluntary programme designed to help NSmen prepare for their annual IPPT.&nbsp; I am happy to announce that it has been quite popular.&nbsp; Since its inception, more than 8,000 NSmen have undergone this&nbsp;IPPT.&nbsp; Last year, we introduced another programme where the SAF, also tied up with SAFRA, to offer gym packages to help NSmen improve their IPPT results.&nbsp; So we are finding practical ways to help our NSmen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the management of NSF intakes, a point raised by Dr Mohamad Maliki.&nbsp; He asked whether the reduced NS period to two years has diluted our operational readiness.&nbsp; I would say, "no", and the Minister has talked about that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also asked about how we manage the intakes.&nbsp; Sir, enlistment for full-time NS takes place on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; This is to help the SAF because we have to accommodate more than 20,000 young male Singaporeans each year who would have completed their studies in different institutions here or abroad.&nbsp; As a general rule, we enlist them soon after the academic year.&nbsp; Those from the JC, GCE "A" level cohort are&nbsp;enlisted in&nbsp;December and March&nbsp;while those from polytechnics are&nbsp;enlisted in&nbsp;June and September.&nbsp;&nbsp; ITE graduates are enlisted throughout all four quarters, depending on when they graduate.&nbsp; For students who pursue their studies overseas or in local private institutions, they are enlisted upon</p><p align=left>Column: 2994<p><p>completion, usually&nbsp;six months from the completion of their studies.&nbsp; However, some are enlisted later because they took longer to graduate&nbsp;or had medical conditions which require further review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a rule, they would start their next level of educational institution two years after their female counterparts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, Ms Olsen asked about deferment from full-time NS.&nbsp; As previously articulated in this House, as she has rightly pointed out,&nbsp;there are three fundamental principles that we adhere to.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, NS must be for meeting a critical national need of ensuring our national security and survival.&nbsp; This is the basis for the Enlistment Act where all NS-liable males are enlisted at the earliest opportunity upon turning 18 years of age.&nbsp; The second principle is universality and with this, NS is the duty of every male Singaporean fit to serve.&nbsp; The third is equity where every National Serviceman is to be treated in the same way, regardless of background or status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that NS does involve a sacrifice from all individuals who have to postpone personal pursuits to serve the nation.&nbsp; Not only those who are specially talented, but all Singaporeans who are NS-liable.&nbsp; This is why we must adhere to the three principles&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to preserve the integrity and strength of our NS system.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless, in selected situations, which she has pointed out, MINDEF does exercise flexibility while still upholding these three principles.&nbsp; For example, we do allow students to defer their full-time NS to complete their studies up to GCE "A" levels, polytechnic diploma or an equivalent qualification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very occasionally, MINDEF does defer full-time NS for exceptional talents based on the merits of each case.&nbsp; In the last&nbsp;10 years, deferments for limited periods have</p><p align=left>Column: 2995<p><p>been granted on less than&nbsp;10 occasions.&nbsp; Those granted such deferments included swimmer Sng Ju Wei, sailor Maximilian Soh, violinist Lim Chun and pianist Lim Yan.&nbsp; Like everyone else, these individuals still have to serve NS after their deferment period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi asked if our military personnel are ready for the restructuring that the SAF is undergoing.&nbsp; Mr Chairman, apart from equipping our personnel with the most effective systems and technology, as Minister Teo has mentioned, the SAF also actively develops our people to maximise their potential through professional and academic upgrading.&nbsp; This is in tandem with the increasing needs and complexities of 3G SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing Education is a key initiative.&nbsp; We want to promote life-long learning and help them realise their full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp; In June last year, the SAF signed an MOU with NTU to establish a strategic partnership on Continuing Education for our servicemen.&nbsp; Under this partnership, SAF Officers can pursue an NTU Masters Degree with credits earned from the SAF's Command and Staff Course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from NTU, the SAF will also be establishing a strategic partnership with UniSIM, through the signing of an MOU on Continuing Education later this month.&nbsp; Under this partnership, UniSIM will accredit professional military education courses completed by SAF personnel, and allow them to transfer these credits to the UniSIM undergraduate degrees&nbsp;if they decide to pursue them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Warrant Officers and Specialists (WOSpecs) also benefit from these initiatives through a scheme known as the Continuous Learning Academic Study Scheme Sponsorship (CLASS).&nbsp; Through</p><p align=left>Column: 2996<p><p>CLASS, our WOSpecs can be sponsored to pursue certificate, diploma, advanced diploma and even degree courses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One serviceman who has benefited from CLASS is 1WO Kong Kok Cheon.&nbsp; Presently,&nbsp;Kok Cheon &nbsp;heads the maintenance section for F-16 fighter jet engines.&nbsp; In 2006, 16 years after&nbsp;graduating from Singapore Polytechnic, we offered him a CLASS Award to study for an Advanced Diploma in Aerospace Engineering and Management.&nbsp; He has since graduated and now feels that he is much better equipped to manage the operational and technical challenges at his workplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Ms Indranee also asked about MINDEF&rsquo;s efforts to recognise the contributions of our NSmen.&nbsp; And I thank her for being a good employer.&nbsp; And we do engage employers.&nbsp; We give them awards.&nbsp; But beyond that, I think it is more important that we bring them in to help them understand what their employees go through and we arrange orientation and we show them different parts of SAF so that they can understand what is going on during training of ICT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF regularly reviews the recognition that should be accorded to our NSmen.&nbsp; The RECORD Committee is convened regularly for this purpose and as an important platform that helps us plan and to systematically show ways to recognise our NSmen.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most recent RECORD IV, we added the Operationally Ready National Service Completion Award for NSmen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has decided that it would be timely to convene RECORD V next month.&nbsp; Minister Teo has appointed Prof. Koo to chair RECORD V, which will build on the work done by the first four Committees, and recommend further ways to recognise the contributions of our NSmen.&nbsp; It will start its work once the members have been selected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2997<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Indranee&nbsp;asked about bullying in camps.&nbsp; The SAF has provided channels for servicemen to report any incident of bullying.&nbsp; These channels are made known to all soldiers upon enlistment.&nbsp; We provide the information in the handbook given to each recruit.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;of you&nbsp;will be familiar.&nbsp; Also, this is the handbook that recruits get.&nbsp; There is also one that parents receive.&nbsp; In there, there are particular aspects about how to adjust, who you can turn to for help.&nbsp; Servicemen can report such incidents to their superiors, to the para-counsellors in their units, or to the SAF Counselling Centre through the 24-hour Hotline, the number&nbsp;is well-publicised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has zero tolerance for any form of physical abuse by commanders or soldiers on fellow soldiers.&nbsp; Any such incident of abuse will be thoroughly investigated, and soldiers guilty of misconduct or other offences will be severely dealt with by Summary Trial or General Court Martial.&nbsp; In the recent case which Ms Indranee brought up&nbsp;involving the physical assault of&nbsp;Recruit Jagjeet Singh, the three National Servicemen responsible for the offence were charged and have been convicted by a General Court Martial.&nbsp; One of them was convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt while the other two were convicted of the lesser charge of voluntarily causing hurt.&nbsp; Such cases are uncommon.&nbsp; In the last five years, there were no other similar cases involving voluntarily causing grievous hurt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the people in the SAF are our greatest asset, as Minister Teo has said.&nbsp; It is only with a dynamic and committed group of men and women that the SAF will be ready for the security challenges that may come its way.&nbsp; Let me also reiterate and thank Members and the public for their support for the SAF&nbsp;and MINDEF in its mission to form an effective deterrence and to protect Singapore.</p></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 2998<p>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr&nbsp;Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Maliki and Ms Indranee Rajah for asking questions&nbsp;on&nbsp;Total Defence.&nbsp; Sir, Total Defence has reached a significant milestone.&nbsp; In a few days, we will commemorate 25th anniversary of Total Defence on 15th February.&nbsp;Total Defence is not an occasion just to commemorate.&nbsp; It is a lifestyle.&nbsp; It is a commitment.&nbsp; It is the way to keep our way of living.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee and Dr Maliki asked&nbsp;&nbsp;how Total Defence has helped Singapore cope with security challenges such as the threat of global terrorism.&nbsp; Total Defence began as an effort to rally the nation behind the defence of Singapore.&nbsp; Since the 9-11 attacks in the USA, Total Defence public outreach efforts have increasingly focused on how every Singaporean can play a part in dealing with terrorism.&nbsp; They can help security agencies by being alert for anyone or anything suspicious and by knowing what to do during emergencies.&nbsp; Emergency exercises and other programmes have also been regularly conducted to familiarise the public with contingency measures and to equip them with life-saving skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our efforts over the years have paid off in helping Singaporeans and their employers appreciate their role in Total Defence.&nbsp; For instance, the response rate during mobilisation is usually very high&nbsp;&ndash; very close to 100%&nbsp;&ndash; and we do this many times in a year.&nbsp; This indicates that Singaporeans understand the need for defence and their role through National Service.&nbsp; I will give&nbsp;Members an example.&nbsp; Army Guards officer 2LT Muhammad Faris Sufi bin Zainol is&nbsp;a typical Singaporean.&nbsp; He is a full-time National Serviceman and will be signing on with the Army.&nbsp; Since young, he has had a keen understanding of the role of the military in defence.&nbsp; In his own words, he said this, "This passion drove me to join the National Cadet Corps </p><p align=left>Column: 2999<p><p>(NCC) as a cadet lieutenant and subsequently realising my childhood dream of becoming a commissioned officer in the SAF, in this case, the Army."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers also understand the need for National Service,&nbsp;like my colleague here, Ms Indranee.&nbsp; I thank her very much.&nbsp; Many of them, for instance, make it a point to release their male employees for in-camp-training (ICT) and discourage requests for deferment.&nbsp; I have a very good example here, Sir.&nbsp; MAJ (NS) Danny Lien&nbsp;&ndash; he is the Managing Director of Amos International&nbsp;&ndash; he is an employer and a National Serviceman.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;he plays both roles.&nbsp; He is a&nbsp;firm believer in in-camp training and in the need to maintain national security.&nbsp; He says this,&nbsp;"When an organisation discourages deferments and includes ICT performance as one of the appraisal components of its NSmen employees, it will encourage the NSmen to be more conscientious and diligent in performing their roles during their In-Camp Training."&nbsp; I am happy to note that the number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that have participated in the Total Defence Awards has been increasing over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families also give important support to husbands and sons who do National Service.&nbsp; Ms Evelyn Loh is married to CPT (NS) Louis Tan.&nbsp; They have a beautiful daughter, Faith.&nbsp; Evelyn tells of how they miss him whenever Cpt Tan&nbsp;goes for in-camp training.&nbsp; But she is encouraged by the fact that "Louis and his bosses have always viewed NS positively.&nbsp; As a family, we recognise that the adjustments we make during this period are not just good for the country, but good for Louis and good for&nbsp;our family."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the reduction in NS duration, MINDEF continues to ensure that our servicemen remain committed to defence.&nbsp; There are programmes and</p><p align=left>Column: 3000<p><p>activities for units aimed at imparting a deeper understanding of military history and security policies.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF also recognises the contributions of our NSFs and regularly reviews the recognition provided to them.&nbsp; For example, the rank of Specialist Cadet was created just recently for those undergoing training to become specialists.&nbsp; This rank recognises the increasingly challenging roles and greater responsibilities of our specialists in the third generation SAF.&nbsp; NSFs wearing the new rank will also receive a higher allowance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Maliki asked how MINDEF has engaged young Singaporeans on defence and security issues, while Ms Indranee broached the broader question of whether we have sufficiently engaged the spectrum of Singaporeans to embed Total Defence in the nation's psyche.&nbsp; Sir, let me preface my answer to Dr Maliki by saying that young Singaporeans do not like to be preached to.&nbsp; They like to be consulted.&nbsp; They prefer to discover things for themselves.&nbsp; This is the new generation.&nbsp; MINDEF has thus been moving towards more creative, experiential programmes to engage our young.&nbsp; They provide opportunities for self-expression and discussion as well as a good measure of enjoyment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very good example is the popular N.E.mation competition&nbsp;&ndash; punning on the word: animation&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;which provides a platform for students to express their ideas on Total Defence through animation.&nbsp; N.E.mation is now in its&nbsp;third season, the students blog actively, canvassing for fans online.&nbsp; Remarkably, the number of unique visitors to the N.E.mation website this January has increased 25 times to 25,000 visitors when compared to the same month in last year's competition.&nbsp; Ms Kimberly Ho, a student from CHIJ Toa Payoh, is one such student who</p><p align=left>Column: 3001<p><p>took part in this year's competition, and she came away with a new appreciation of National Education and Total Defence.&nbsp; This is what she said, "This project has helped students think of National Education as a fun subject, through animation rather than speeches and boring lectures" and "I learnt many new things about Total Defence and what I would want to defend."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Total Defence outreach efforts have increasingly taken on a bottom-up grassroots approach.&nbsp; To mark 25 years of Total Defence this year, a multi-platform, multi-channel programme has been rolled out to elicit participation from different sectors of society.&nbsp; Singaporeans are more deeply engaged to reflect on what Total Defence means to them by being asked the question, "What Will You Defend?"&nbsp; We asked the public to tell us what Total Defence means to them.&nbsp; Many people will say, "Total Defence to me is to preserve my lifestyle.&nbsp; It is to protect my family.&nbsp; It is to protect my community."&nbsp; Each person had a different take on Total Defence, depending on his or her age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;also many channels for these young Singaporeans to express their views&nbsp;and share their responses with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can do it through an online video competition, radio call-in contests and even ZoCards, ie, something like postcards that contain certain messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;ZoCards are distributed with the Pioneer magazine.&nbsp; These cards&nbsp;are a vital&nbsp;form of viral marketing&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;popular with young Singaporeans.&nbsp; We have distributed some of these cards to Members and we hope that you will&nbsp;discuss, fill up&nbsp;and send it back to us to tell us what&nbsp;Total Defence means to you as a Member of Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, addressing the question by Dr Maliki on whether youths in Singapore have taken security for granted, I am glad to say that our engagement efforts&nbsp;have&nbsp</p><p align=left>Column: 3002<p><p>paid off handsomely.&nbsp; Surveys conducted show that the younger generation is less complacent, more committed&nbsp;and feel that they have to work hard to make Singapore secure from terrorist attacks.&nbsp; It is also heartening to know that most youth feel that National Service is necessary and that they would continue to defend Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, we even have women suggesting that girls should do National Service too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF will continue to engage all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Whether through traditional or new media, our aim is to enhance the appreciation of security issues so as to engender a personal commitment to the defence of Singapore.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the context of the SAF, given that so much of our weapons and systems are computerised, what steps has the SAF taken to ensure that the protection of our IT systems, and anything that is computer-related, has sufficient protection against cyber attacks and other forms of electronic interference?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One clarification for the Second Minister who talked about fitness.&nbsp; One of the issues that has come up with respect to parents is&nbsp;that their son is fit enough to do National Service but, sometimes, may have&nbsp;a medical problem, eg, heart murmur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not disqualify&nbsp;their son&nbsp;from doing National Service,&nbsp;and they worry about the postings.&nbsp;

For MINDEF, we, of course, go much deeper into our IT resilience. Our&nbsp;critical systems, for example, are decoupled from the outside world.&nbsp; So I have two computers on my desk, one is connected to the outside world and MINDEF, but one is connected only within MINDEF.&nbsp; So, theoretically, it will be much more difficult to penetrate such a system.&nbsp; Of course our pure operational systems are even much more protected than that, so it is an answer&nbsp;at two levels.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> In response to Ms Rajah's question, if I may.&nbsp; This is what I talked about earlier in terms of the physical employment status, Sir.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I agree with the Minister that we should invest in our defence in a steady manner.&nbsp; The Minister likened it to an insurance policy.&nbsp; If I may use the analogy, can I ask the Minister whether he agrees that there are many insurance policies in the market and it is up to us to choose which policy we want commensurate to our needs and risk assessments.&nbsp; We know that in the market, just talking about insurance policies, there are some which are very expensive fetching very high premiums, depending on the needs and insurance forecast and your risk assessments of the person.&nbsp; Similarly, there are the middle-of-the-range ones and very cheap ones.&nbsp; I think our Defence, as in insurance policy, would be considered a premium one.&nbsp; I think we pay quite top dollar for it, and I think there is good reason to defend that policy.&nbsp; But can I ask the Minister to please explain the rationale for wanting to pay top dollar and to make sure that we have bang-for-the-buck, to use a popular term without trying to&nbsp;make it sound like an explosion, but to make sure that there is an assurance to the people that the</p><p align=left>Column: 3005<p><p>money is prudently spent and there is a good reason why we are buying the premium insurance policy for our Defence.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other question is regarding the statement that there are three categories that the Defence Ministry may spend&nbsp;on&nbsp;&ndash; the people, operations and exercises, and lastly, capital expenditure.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister whether there has been an increased emphasis on capital expenditure in terms of acquisitions of hardware, because in the newspapers, we tend to read a lot about how we have acquired F-15s and new naval helicopters, and so on, and whether that has skewed our Defence budget?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> I would say that I would not carry the insurance analogy too far because I am not an insurance salesman, and I am not sure whether Ms Ng has studied the insurance market in great detail.&nbsp; But I would say that what we have is an appropriate policy for ourselves.&nbsp; And it is not unusual for a person who actually values his own life, values his own family and children, particularly, to invest more in insurance.&nbsp; If you are a single person and you do not have very much property, and you do not have very much to lose in life, you may decide that you are not going to take up insurance.&nbsp; But I think that as a country, we have built up many assets and resources.&nbsp; We have our future, our families and children to look after.&nbsp; And I think that many sensible people, when they arrive at a certain age, when they have families, they want to take care of their families and make sure that they are properly insured.&nbsp; That is about as far as I would take the insurance analogy.&nbsp; As the country progresses, as you have more to protect, I think it is not unreasonable that you spend more to protect it and, hence, a linkage with GDP is not an unreasonable one.&nbsp; But as I said, we do not spend all of the 6% of GDP, and we spend on what we need by taking a long-term view of what defence needs we have.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3006<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, many of the countries, after the end of the Cold War, particularly in Europe, in Canada, for example, they decided that peace has broken out, and, therefore, they cut back on their defence expenditure.&nbsp; I do not mean this as a criticism of our friends in Canada, but out of quite sensible analysis on their part, they decided to cut back on their defence expenditure.&nbsp; They decided, for example, they&nbsp;no longer need tanks, and they in fact used their tanks for target practice.&nbsp; And then, suddenly, there was a discontinuity and that discontinuity was September 11th, 2001.&nbsp; The Canadians found their armed forces in Afghanistan and they found that they needed tanks.&nbsp; So the Canadians have now, in a great hurry, gone out to try to buy tanks. They borrowed tanks from Germany, and they have also, in quite a hurry, bought secondhand tanks from the Dutch in order to meet this demand by their soldiers in Afghanistan for tanks as a result of a discontinuity in their security environment, something which they did not expect.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So if we want to spend on defence, so that you can protect yourself and ensure your survival, then I think that we should make it robust and take a long-term view; and have it ride through good times, difficult times, and be able to withstand the kinds of shocks and discontinuities that may arise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investment in our new equipment is a natural process of improvement.&nbsp; We buy F-15s and we are replacing our A4 Skyhawks with the F-15s.&nbsp; If you ask me, I could not in good conscience, send our pilots out into combat in A4 Skyhawks today.&nbsp; The A4 Skyhawk was built in the 1950s and 1960s.&nbsp; We bought them secondhand; they were lying in the desert, we restored them, we upgraded</p><p align=left>Column: 3007<p><p>them in the 1980s.&nbsp; And after that, we used them for another 15 to 20 years.&nbsp; So we have used them for some 30 over years now.&nbsp; And then we finally decided to retire them.&nbsp; The A4 Skyhawk does not even have a radar.&nbsp; So I think it is time to replace it and the replacement is prudent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are some of the equipment purchases that we are making and we consider them very, very carefully before we decide.&nbsp; In fact, I think our procurement process is one which is recognised as robust and very well thought through.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we buy things,&nbsp;we have two submarines or we have 15 or 20 aircraft at a time&nbsp;&ndash; these are not big orders in international terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;India, for example, is buying 126 fighter aircraft.&nbsp; That is a fairly substantial order.&nbsp; We buy 15 or 20.&nbsp; But even so, international companies find it useful and beneficial for them to take part in our tenders.&nbsp; And one of the reasons is because they see an order from Singapore as an endorsement of their product.&nbsp; Because they know that our processes for evaluation are strict, rigorous, so that if we buy something, it is a cost-effective product.&nbsp;

He mentioned earlier that when enlistees come in, about 50% of them reach the silver level of NAFA.&nbsp; Another 50% require the extra four weeks of physical training.&nbsp; And now MINDEF is thinking of extending it to eight weeks within their enlistment period, meaning that&nbsp;it is eight weeks shorter.&nbsp; I am quite concerned because we already have reduced the duration of NS to two years.&nbsp; With a reduction of another four weeks because of physical fitness, I wonder if MINDEF has worked with MOE&nbsp;&ndash; and what is interesting is, Second Minister is also Minister for Education&nbsp;&ndash; to require or to look at the possibility of ensuring more&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3008<p><p>of our boys reaching that silver level requirement, and also ensuring that the fitness level reaches a point before they get enlisted, such that they do not need more than that four weeks extra&nbsp;to attain a certain fitness level required by MINDEF.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think compromising the duration of NS because of fitness&nbsp;is something that we should work out with other Ministries, especially MOE, ensuring that the fitness level can be up even before they reach the enlistment levels.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In other words, if we extend it from four to eight weeks and we still find people unfit, we cannot keep extending it. So we have done our calculations and this does not compromise our ability to forge a strong SAF.&nbsp; But we have extended it from four to eight weeks because, basically, the observation that we saw from our current four-week PTP is that they did not quite reach the physical fitness of their BMT counterparts who went directly into BMT.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will MINDEF work with MOE?&nbsp; Yes, and we have been doing that.&nbsp; As Senior Minister of State RAdm Lui mentioned in this House yesterday, the Polytechnics are looking at this and trying to see how they can increase the fitness of their Polytechnic students.&nbsp; But let us all be very clear.&nbsp; Physical fitness is a personal responsibility.&nbsp; As Minister for Health Khaw Boon Wan said,&nbsp;it is difficult to go out and enforce the discipline to go for a run, but you have to do it.&nbsp; So I think this is something that we have to keep working at, and I think that&nbsp;it will improve, if we can get the message out that it is not only for yourself but for the nation and for SAF.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Land Transport&nbsp;&ndash; Traffic Management</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast):</B> Sir, I beg to move,<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my first cut relates to land transport which concerns many in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; commuters and motorists alike.&nbsp; I will raise various topics to follow up on the land transport masterplan that was unveiled by the Transport Minister last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, LTA's role as master planner and contestability in the bus sector.&nbsp; During last year's COS debate, the Minister had informed the House that over the next year or so, LTA will work closely with consultants to build up its capabilities for bus route planning and the tendering out of bus route parcels, so as to create contestability.&nbsp; This is an important undertaking by LTA which would have a significant impact on bus</p><p align=left>Column: 3010<p><p>commuters both from the quality of service as well as bus fare level standpoints.&nbsp; Could the Minister update the House on how LTA is preparing for its new role as the master route planner, and when will commuters begin to see the benefits of contestability in the bus sector?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point is about transfer penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing a transport system, comprising mostly of direct journeys from origins to destinations, is an extremely costly proposition, and this is not practical for Singapore as the Transport Minister has pointed out.&nbsp; Therefore, a hub-and-spoke system is the inevitable outcome.&nbsp; However, currently, commuters who make a transfer in the hub-and-spoke system face a transfer penalty.&nbsp; The current transfer rebate of&nbsp;40 cents does not fully offset the boarding charge of&nbsp;60 cents for the subsequent leg of a journey involving a transfer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I highlighted previously, these commuters who need to make transfers are already inconvenienced.&nbsp; They take a&nbsp;longer time because they&nbsp;wait at the transfer points, and yet they are being penalised for&nbsp;making a transfer.&nbsp; Steps should be taken to address this problem if we are to attract more Singaporeans to take public transport.&nbsp; Such commuters should be enjoying a full rebate of the boarding charge for any subsequent leg of their journey.&nbsp; Therefore, I would urge the Ministry to quickly remove the remaining 20 cents' transfer penalty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Ministry, a distance-based through-fare system is to be introduced in 2009 to address this particular transfer penalty problem.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if Ministry of Transport has any plans to remove it totally this year and, if so, how and when it will be addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point is about the adequacy of bus and train services.&nbsp; I</p><p align=left>Column: 3011<p><p>would like to touch on the adequacy of the capacity of these two very important public transport modes.&nbsp; In the difficult times that we are anticipating currently, we can expect more people to choose to use the public transport instead of taxis or cars.&nbsp; The next couple of years actually presents a great opportunity for the&nbsp;Ministry of Transport&nbsp;to realise its stated aim of increasing the share of commuters on public transport.&nbsp; The Ministry of Transport will succeed only if we can offer buses and trains that are comfortable, that are not overly crowded, that will meet the service expectations of those who make the switch from private to public transport.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister if he has a view on the extent of ridership increase he expects on the trains as well as the buses over this year and next, and whether there are specific plans to make sure that we seize this opportunity, give commuters who have switched from private to public transport an experience which they like to maintain, so that we can increase the share of public transport commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point is on the progress of MRT lines' construction.&nbsp; I am very glad the Government decided to push forward with the construction of&nbsp;MRT lines despite the economic slowdown.&nbsp; It has announced two new lines to be built&nbsp;&ndash; Thomson Line from CBD to Woodlands, and the Eastern Region Line&nbsp;which will serve the estates running from Tanjong Rhu to Changi.&nbsp; These lines were initially scheduled to be completed by 2018 and 2020 respectively.&nbsp; It was also announced that extensions to the North-South Line to serve Marina Bay and East-West Line into Tuas would be completed by 2015.&nbsp; And these planned lines and extensions are over and above the Government's investments in the Boon Lay Extension.&nbsp; On behalf of my residents, I would like to thank the Ministry for constructing the Pioneer Station, the Circle Line as well as</p><p align=left>Column: 3012<p><p>the Downtown Line.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the progress of the work for these new lines and extensions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next topic is on the COE system.&nbsp; The vehicle quota system was implemented on 1st May 1990 to manage and control long-term vehicle population growth at 3% net rate per year, which means net of scrapping and exports.&nbsp; Under this system, LTA determines the number of new vehicles allowed for registration while the market determines the price of COE through bidding.&nbsp; In determining the number of COEs to issue in a forthcoming year, LTA makes a forecast on the number of vehicles expected to be deregistered, either due to scrapping or exporting.&nbsp; Such forecasts have inherent inaccuracies and the net vehicle growth rate may turn out to be higher or lower than the targeted 3%.&nbsp; Can the Minister comment on the actual net vehicular growth rate last year versus the target growth rate of 3% per year?&nbsp; Also, does the Ministry intend to have more frequent forecasting on the number of deregistered vehicles, say, on a quarterly basis?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry also announced that it intended to halve the allowable annual vehicle growth rate in 2009 from 3% to 1.5% for three years.&nbsp; Has this changed?&nbsp; Could the cut be deeper since the road kilometre growth rate is only 0.5% per annum compared to 1.5% target growth rate over the next 15 years?&nbsp; And given that COE prices are expected to remain low,&nbsp;could a deeper cut be considered?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point concerns off-peak cars.&nbsp; If the various schemes introduced by the Government under the Land Transport Masterplan are successful, then some motorists will switch&nbsp;to public transport during the peak hours.&nbsp; And these motorists may still wish to retain their cars for off-peak use.&nbsp; I have asked the Minister in last year's COS if his </p><p align=left>Column: 3013<p><p>Ministry would allow for more liberal conversion of cars, bearing the normal licence plates, to off-peak cars.&nbsp; And the reply then was that there is presently a carefully calibrated balance of tax concessions which must go hand-in-hand with the usage restrictions of Off-peak Cars (OPCs).</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

On a separate note,&nbsp;the current OPC day licences are&nbsp;outdated.&nbsp; It requires&nbsp;very large paper coupons and it is very prone to tampering.&nbsp; Also, confrontations are&nbsp;often ugly when the traffic police has to stop&nbsp;people accused of tampering.&nbsp; I have many residents who have&nbsp;come to me. Much hardships have been actually&nbsp;caused by this system which is not robust.&nbsp; It is too prone to tampering, too prone to temptation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have gone to&nbsp;jail because of&nbsp;it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hope the Ministry would look at it and see if technology can be used to improve the system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, traffic information with the use of GPS.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Melbourne, for example, there&nbsp;is real-time information that tells us about rubbernecking, traffic, icy roads, accidents, and so forth.&nbsp; They use&nbsp;a technology&nbsp;called Radio Data System&nbsp;which transmits traffic message&nbsp;channel format, or TMC format.&nbsp; These are then fed into the&nbsp;GPS system in the car&nbsp;so that&nbsp;motorists, on&nbsp;a real-time life basis, can adjust their journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this&nbsp;has a lot of benefits and I want to ask if LTA intends to explore such technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, no transport discussion&nbsp;at COS would be complete without discussing Singapore's favourite past-time, the ERP.&nbsp; Under the Land Transport Master Plan, the LTA refined the method of measuring traffic speeds&nbsp;&ndash; they changed the average&nbsp;mean speed to 85th percentile.&nbsp; I just</p><p align=left>Column: 3014<p><p>would like&nbsp;an update from the Minister to see if he finds the ERP changes effective and what are his views on any new initiatives or adjustments that may come about from this&nbsp;experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the ERP&nbsp;rates are&nbsp;revised currently every three months.&nbsp; Can the Minister comment on whether there is a need to change the frequency of such rate changes so that they will better reflect the traffic conditions on the roads?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Back in 2005, our Prime Minister in his National Day Rally Speech envisaged a new downtown at Marina Bay as, our Prime Minister put it, I quote, "the centerpiece of our redevelopment of our city".&nbsp; This latest jewel to adorn our city,&nbsp;Marina Bay, will indeed require much infrastructure spending&nbsp;to make it an&nbsp;exciting place for people to explore, exchange&nbsp;and entertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Transport:&nbsp; what can we expect of the transport infrastructure for that area?&nbsp; Will we see any new innovative or different ways for people to travel from place to place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, it will seem that the solution to manage congestion is road widening.&nbsp; Just take a look at Shenton Way, South Bridge Road, Robinson Road and the new Marina Boulevard next to the NTUC Centre, which are all four-five lanes wide.&nbsp; While increasing the number of lanes eases vehicular traffic, we must also explore other means to make crowded areas so pedestrian-friendly that people would want to leave home without their cars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3015<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our city would be much more livable if in&nbsp;heavy human traffic&nbsp;areas, vehicles can be segregated from the pedestrians, so that these areas become more pedestrian-friendly.&nbsp; If both vehicles and pedestrians have to be at ground level, segregation can be achieved by&nbsp;constructing ring roads at-grade, going around the area.&nbsp; If they can be at different levels, either the roads can be underground and people on the surface, or vehicles at ground level and people below ground or above ground with elevated sky&nbsp;terraces, hanging gardens and walkways.&nbsp; These different levels are all&nbsp;relative.&nbsp;We can have roads at ground level with people above or underground or, alternatively,&nbsp;have people at ground level with roads at&nbsp;a level below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, at the site of the future Gardens by the Bay, I see huge excavation activities&nbsp;going on to build a massive network of underground shops and corridors.&nbsp; When this underground complex is completed, the Gardens will be built on top of it.&nbsp; But at the ground level, this future idyllic Gardens will be ringed by roads such as Marina Boulevard which are four, five lanes wide.&nbsp; I wonder, for the same amount of digging,&nbsp;why the roads cannot be underground instead and the space above ground be made&nbsp;more pleasant for&nbsp;walking, dining and other leisure activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the various&nbsp;agencies to pay particular attention to the public transport connectivity linking Marina Bay, Raffles Place and Suntec&nbsp;City.&nbsp; Currently, there is no convenient public transport link.&nbsp; If&nbsp;a person who&nbsp;works at Raffles Place wishes to meet another for lunch at Marina Centre, there is no alternative,&nbsp;in the&nbsp;light of time constraint,&nbsp;but to drive or take a taxi there and back.

ERP charges, which is a function of the traffic density and flows on the roads, should accordingly remain static.&nbsp; In fact, logically, ERP charges may even come down.

To begin with, buses are still not keeping to schedules especially during&nbsp;peak hours.&nbsp; During off-peak hours, the infrequency of buses is common.&nbsp; The LTA has provided some assistance by installing Real-Time Bus Arrival Information Panels to help commuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will&nbsp;these panels&nbsp;be extended beyond the CBD area?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no quality benchmark here for, say, at the midpoint of a journey for buses to keep on schedule.&nbsp;

We know the Circle Line is being brought forward with the opening of four stations.&nbsp; Can we have an update on the earlier opening of the rest of the lines and stations?&nbsp; Are there further MRT lines being planned?&nbsp; MRT trains&nbsp;still suffer from an overcrowding problem during peak hours.&nbsp;Despite the increases in carriage frequency,&nbsp;commuters still find themselves unable to board.&nbsp; Could this be an infrastructure issue where&nbsp;the old MRT lines are a single track system and not able to allow more carriages on the track?&nbsp; Has LTA reviewed the capacity of&nbsp;existing MRT lines and any possibility to add&nbsp;more tracks&nbsp;on the existing lines which are now overcrowded and has reached its maximum capacity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transport operators' explanation&nbsp;that to give our polytechnic students&nbsp;cheaper fare would mean higher charges for public fare is not acceptable.&nbsp; There is no need for this direct relationship.&nbsp; It is an</p><p align=left>Column: 3021<p><p>expense item, but there are also many forms of revenue as well.&nbsp; URA and LTA over&nbsp;last few&nbsp;years&nbsp;have allowed more and more retail space in the MRT stations, and this space provides&nbsp;added revenue.&nbsp;

In Singapore, basic bus operators get away with inconsistent arrival times.&nbsp; Moreover, the operators display bus service frequencies that can range from more than 10 to 20 minutes during&nbsp;afternoon off-peak periods, for example, or six to 15 minutes during&nbsp;morning peak periods.&nbsp; This makes public transport unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The range, in terms of frequency and time period, is too wide and too broad.&nbsp; Even then, buses can take longer to arrive.&nbsp; A friend of mine said this has been his experience with Service No. 97, which has become less frequent in recent years.&nbsp; He started taking taxis.&nbsp; And this is precisely what we should avoid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more bus lanes being introduced and vehicles having to give way to buses exiting bus bays, for example, can we expect higher standards from the operators so that services are more regular as well as more frequent?&nbsp; With better headways during peak periods from August this year, I hope MOT can start by looking at off-peak periods, where less traffic should make it easier to have more regular arrival times. Basically, a commuter should not go to a bus stop and find that the bus arrives, for example, at 8.05 pm on the first day, 8.10 pm on the second day, 8.15 pm on the third day, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does PTC require timetables to be provided only for bus services with headways of 20 minutes or more?&nbsp; In any case, the PTC's website does not say if PTC even measures whether the timetable is adhered to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry has set about to raise bus service standards.&nbsp; This should include timetables, and ensuring that operators adhere to them.&nbsp; One way to start is to require operators to provide timetables for more services, or to require operators to </p><p align=left>Column: 3023<p><p>ensure that buses leave the interchange at a fixed schedule, and not just a scheduled headway.&nbsp;

This has caused great inconvenience and much unhappiness amongst the residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question often posed to me was that bus service should be a public amenity and it should not be left to the bus operators to determine whether to operate a route based solely on the reason whether the bus route is profitable.&nbsp;

First, consult the grassroots organisations before finalising the route, as they have a better idea as to where the demand is.&nbsp; Next, where the bus service is not profitable, consider running the service at a longer but more regular headway, for example, if it is not profitable to run a service every 10 or 15 minutes, the transport operators may instead apply to run the service at headways of 30 minutes or one hour but make sure the buses operate on time so that the residents know exactly what time to reach the bus stop and how long they must wait.&nbsp; Next, please balance the interest of the commuters when deciding on a bus service.&nbsp; It does not mean that when a bus service is not profitable, that bus service must be terminated.&nbsp; LTA should also consider the convenience to the commuting public which should be paramount unless there is very low demand for the service.&nbsp;

Mr Chairman, presently, there are on the average some 1.8 million passenger trips per day on the MRT, up 5% from last year, and the ridership will continue to grow because:<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) rising population in Singapore;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) LTA and the public transport operators are actively promoting the use of public transport; and</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) the economic downturn has caused the public to turn to public transport.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the operators have been increasing the number of trips in order to solve the problem of over-congestion.&nbsp; However, just by increasing the trips will not solve this problem.&nbsp; They should consider a more long-term and effective solution.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I suggest that they increase the number of carriages from six to eight.&nbsp; In Japan, I have seen some trains with 12 carriages in Tokyo. And in China, the Shanghai Metro has decided to increase the number of carriages from six to eight on their Metro Line 1.&nbsp; This would also increase their takings from ticketing and, in fact, they are expecting an annual increase of 15% from $82 million to $94 million in ticket sales.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, an average carriage can carry about 50 passengers.&nbsp; With two carriages, it would carry about 100 passengers.&nbsp; So at three minutes a trip and 20 trips in an hour, in one hour's time, it </p><p align=left>Column: 3026<p><p>will increase the passengers loading capacity by 1,200.&nbsp; This will also give the operators more income and reduce the long-term operating costs.&nbsp; Of course, if platforms need to be lengthened, this will call for platform construction works, thereby stimulating the building industry.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told that the operators will have to spend about $50 million to $60 million to purchase new carriages this year.&nbsp; But I believe that these estimates were calculated last year when the economy was doing better. This year, with the present economic situation, they should be able to get it at lower prices.&nbsp; At the same time, they should also step up the maintenance work on the carriages so as to extend the lives of the trains.&nbsp; These savings would be passed down to the passengers and that would lighten the burden of our commuters.&nbsp; I think transport operators should not only think of increasing the fares. They should also think of how to operate more efficiently for the benefit of the passengers.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3135-3136.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Even other countries come to study our innovations like the Area Licensing Scheme before and, now, our Electronic Road Pricing.&nbsp; But, lately, some cracks are appearing and more complaints are being raised by how crowded our MRT trains are, how slowly our buses move on congested roads, how new or sparsely populated areas are poorly covered.&nbsp; I am sure my colleagues in the House would have had their share of feedback from their residents.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's way has been to reject the idea of a nationalised public transport operator and to rely on market forces to</p><p align=left>Column: 3027<p><p>drive the efficiency and economies of our bus and rail providers, as private companies.&nbsp; I agree with this approach.&nbsp; One need only look at the disastrous experiences of other countries with the nationalised transport system to see how that breeds inefficiency and waste and, ultimately, serves the public&nbsp;the poorer.&nbsp; But I do question the viability of having two private companies as transport operators in a small market like Singapore.&nbsp; After all, it is not as if they are competing head-to-head in every place for the users from the same area. &nbsp;Rather the MRT lines and bus routes are allocated between them, and instead of one larger monopoly, we have two smaller ones.&nbsp; Of course, we want competition.&nbsp; But having two separate operators, each with a monopoly over different segments of the transport network, is not, in my view, effective competition.&nbsp; And the smaller size of each operator means they do not&nbsp;even enjoy the benefits of scale that a single monopoly would have.&nbsp; So, how is the consumer better off?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen in a different context how a well-meaning attempt at competition can turn out badly.&nbsp; I am referring to the media industry where SPH was allowed for a&nbsp;time to offer its own TV channels, while MediaCorp set up its own newspaper.&nbsp; In the limited domestic market, both companies suffered such substantial losses that the experiment was called off after a few years.&nbsp; I do hope our Transport Ministry will review the long-term viability of our present setup and consider whether, given the limitations of the domestic market, Singapore's interest would be better served by having a single public transport operator.&nbsp; Such a company would still operate as a private entity and be required to account to its shareholders for its performance.&nbsp; But it would enjoy greater economies of scale and being a single entity would have every incentive to</p><p align=left>Column: 3028<p><p>enhance the interfacing of bus and rail services, which is another bugbear of our consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even market forces have to be tempered where&nbsp;public service is required.&nbsp; So, for instance, in areas which are newly developed or not so heavily populated, there does need to be some regulatory intervention to ensure that the profit motive does not mean that those residents are under-served.&nbsp; It should be a condition of the licence to offer transport services that all areas should receive acceptable levels of service, even if it means some routes are less profitable for the operators or even money-losing.&nbsp; That is why I was happy when one of the conclusions of the review of our transport system released last year was that LTA would take over the centralised planning of bus routes, rather than to simply leave it to the bus operators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In these areas, we&nbsp;should target to systematically enhance the commuter and pedestrian experience by making it conducive for drivers to park their cars further away and enter the areas by public transport or even by way of comfortable air-conditioned walkways.&nbsp; The transition from car parking to taking public transport or walking to these areas should be made easy and time-efficient.&nbsp; Within the areas, there should be convenient and seamless links for the masses so that people can move around effortlessly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to accommodate large numbers of pedestrians without feeling overcrowded, footpaths should be widened, buildings should be connected with pedestrian walkways at three levels&nbsp;&ndash; underground, street level and above ground.&nbsp; As Singapore is prone to heat, humidity and sudden downpours,&nbsp;it will be a boon to pedestrians to be able to enjoy weatherproof access between buildings.&nbsp; I am certain that if we take care of the walking experience, we will also take care of the road experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the introduction of tougher penalties for fare evaders in July 2008, it has been reported that there has been a </p><p align=left>Column: 3031<p><p>large drop in the number of fare evaders caught between July and October 2008.&nbsp; An average of 15 people a day was caught, down from 400 a day.&nbsp; However, during the economic downturn, I fear that more people may be tempted to evade fares.&nbsp; Honest commuters who pay their fares are effectively subsidising the fare-evaders' rides.&nbsp; This is not right.&nbsp; The more enforcement action is taken, the higher the number of fare evaders will&nbsp;be caught.&nbsp; I would like to ask:&nbsp; how many man hours does TransitLink devote to catching fare evaders? Are the enforcement officers effectively deployed? What additional steps may operators take to ensure that all commuters duly pay their fares so that the burden of operations is fairly shared?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Progress in the Road Sector</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP)&nbsp;was launched last year.&nbsp; One key goal of the Plan is to shift preference to public transport.&nbsp; Commuters would only be persuaded to do so, if they are satisfied with an aggregate of several factors.&nbsp; As such, the LTMP would need to tackle the factors of convenience, connectivity, speed, service levels, comfort, cost and safety.&nbsp; Can the Ministry update us on the progress made on these factors and what measures are being taken to further enhance our public transportation?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point on transportation is the facilitation of cycling.&nbsp; I certainly&nbsp;believe that pedestrians, bicyclists and motor vehicles can coexist.&nbsp; In Singapore, where cycling as a serious mode of transport is gaining strength, should there be more education and rules on the proper cycling etiquette?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of my residents have raised concerns of errant bicyclists.&nbsp; Many </p><p align=left>Column: 3032<p><p>bicyclists use walkways, void decks and garden pathways at will.&nbsp;&nbsp; As our estates become more barrier-free and accessible, this problem could worsen.&nbsp;&nbsp;With many young children and elderly in the estates, residents' concerns will only increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before any major tragic incident happen, could the Ministry work with other agencies to strike a good balance between the convenience for cyclists and the safety of pedestrians?<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>ERP Matters and Provision of Traffic Information</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the vehicle population growth rate previously stood at 3% and this has been revised downwards to&nbsp;1.5% from 2009&nbsp;for the next three years.&nbsp; If the roads in Singapore also grow at the same pace, there will be no problem of severe traffic congestion.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the last&nbsp;10 years, our road system grew only at 1% per year, and it is expected to grow at half this pace in the next&nbsp;10 to&nbsp;15 years.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This mis-match has contributed to the traffic congestion we see each day.&nbsp; Given that only 12% of Singapore's compact land is being used for the construction of roads, the possibility of building more roads to help ease the traffic congestion is not possible.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what is the long-term strategy in the management of road traffic congestion in Singapore, and whether&nbsp;other viable measures&nbsp;are being considered other than erecting more ERP gantries and raising ERP rates?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan:</B> Sir, last year I spoke up during the Budget debate in favour of ERP as a means of managing road congestion.&nbsp; It is a fair way to manage the use of our roads as the motorist pays&nbsp;for using the road&nbsp;during peak hours,&nbsp;and for adding to the congestion.&nbsp; However, I notice that LTA</p><p align=left>Column: 3033<p><p>has implemented ERP on&nbsp;roads which are not congested&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an example would be the Nicoll Highway on Saturday afternoons; another example would&nbsp;be the ERP gantries at Upper Boon Keng Road and Geylang Bahru Road.&nbsp; Could LTA provide an explanation as to why is there such a need for ERP gantries&nbsp;when these roads are not congested?&nbsp; Would this not run against&nbsp;LTA's principle that LTA manages road congestion by charging motorists for adding to the congestion?&nbsp; In this case, since these roads are not congested in the first place, what is the rationale for having&nbsp;such ERP gantries?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I wish to ask the Minister whether he is able to introduce a dedicated radio station to broadcast traffic news during peak hours. Timely information about traffic conditions allows the motorists to plan properly for their travel routes and, hence, they will not&nbsp;add to traffic congestion, especially where there is an accident or road works.&nbsp; I understand that currently there is&nbsp;LTA traffic broadcast&nbsp;providing information about traffic on the radio.&nbsp; However, the information is only conveyed every&nbsp;15 minutes or so. Singapore is a small country.&nbsp; By the&nbsp;time the&nbsp;Traffic Watch is broadcast, the motorist is already caught in the traffic jam.&nbsp; Surely, it makes more sense for traffic information to be given and repeated with regular updates throughout the&nbsp;peak periods&nbsp;so that the&nbsp;motorist can be made aware of the&nbsp;traffic congestion along his route.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common complaint which I have received is that a motorist drives into a congested expressway such as the CTE and then&nbsp;he is stuck&nbsp;in the traffic for an hour or so, and still has to pay ERP charges.&nbsp; With prompt news available on the radio, the motorist can plan his route&nbsp;better and choose to avoid the&nbsp;congestion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> .Mr Chairman, Sir, I thank Members for their comments and suggestions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early last year, we completed an extensive review of our land transport system and launched the Land Transport Masterplan (LTMP).&nbsp; The LTMP guides the overall development of our land transport system over the next 10-15 years.&nbsp; To pursue the overarching goal of "ensuring a liveable city", the LTMP sets out&nbsp;three strategic thrusts.&nbsp; First, to make public transport a choice mode.&nbsp; Second, to manage road usage.&nbsp; Third, to meet the diverse needs of our people.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo and other Members have asked for an update on the implementation of the LTMP.&nbsp; Let me highlight the key measures&nbsp;&ndash; first, in public transport and then managing road use.&nbsp; My colleagues, Senior Minister of State Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Senior&nbsp;Parliamentary Secretary Mr Teo Ser Luck will cover other topics later on.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LTMP calls for very significant changes to the public transport landscape.&nbsp; In 2008, the Land Transport Authority </p><p align=left>Column: 3035<p><p>(LTA) focused on the improvements that we can make quickly, whilst laying the groundwork and making progress in those areas which require more time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan asked about our progress in improving public transport.&nbsp; Members including Ms Tan, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Ms Eunice Olsen have asked for higher-quality public transport with better connectivity, especially for bus services.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; Buses are a key part of our hub-and-spoke public transport network.&nbsp; The measures we have taken to improve our bus services are: (1) increase bus frequencies; (2) increase travel speed and reliability; (3) offer more choices; and (4) provide better public transport information.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, increase bus frequencies.&nbsp; Last year, the Public Transport Council (PTC) introduced new standards for feeder bus services, so that at least 85%, or more than&nbsp;four out of five, feeder services during peak hours must run at headways of 10 minutes or less from August 2008.&nbsp; This will be further tightened to 90%, or&nbsp;nine in 10 services from August 2009.&nbsp; LTA also worked with SBST and SMRT to improve headways of trunk buses on ERP affected corridors, to make sure that all of them have headways of less than 12 minutes.&nbsp; This will be further tightened to 10 minutes for all buses&nbsp;from August 2009 instead of 15 minutes previously.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, SBST and SMRT have together added more than 100 additional bus trips during the morning and evening peak periods to improve services.&nbsp; The services that have been improved are running more frequently, with headways shorter by 17%.&nbsp; This means that commuters do not have to wait as long at the bus stop, because the bus arrives sooner.&nbsp; It also means more capacity and, hence, it is easier to get onto a bus during the peak periods.</p><p align=left>Column: 3036<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this is possible because SMRT and SBST have been buying more buses and hiring more drivers, and they will have to continue to do so to provide a higher quality of service.&nbsp; This year, they are putting another 470 new Euro V buses on the road, and stepping up their recruitment drives.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong asked whether we can increase the frequency of bus services on Sundays, when there are more foreigners using public transport.&nbsp; The PTC&rsquo;s regulations already require 85%, or more than&nbsp;four in&nbsp;five public buses, to run at headways of not more than 20 minutes during off-peak hours, including Sundays.&nbsp; The operators in fact often do better than this.&nbsp; For bus services in the Geylang and Serangoon areas, the weekend and public holidays' load is now about 60% to 80%, so it is still below capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the issue is whether there is sufficient demand to warrant higher frequencies.&nbsp; But, nonetheless, PTC will look into this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have worked on improving bus travel time and reliability.&nbsp; To achieve this, LTA has extended the network of normal bus lanes from 120 km to 155 km, and tripled full-day bus lanes from 7 km to 23 km.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus speeds have increased by up to 8% for normal bus lanes and 13% for full-day bus lanes.&nbsp; Traffic speeds in the other lanes have remained above the optimal speed threshold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commuters have benefited from these new bus lanes.&nbsp; Mr Ho Kok Khun wrote to the <I>Straits Times&nbsp;Forum</I> on 4th December.&nbsp; He said that with the bus lanes implemented in Yishun and Ang Mo Kio, bus commuters now enjoy a smoother, faster ride, saving 10 to 15 minutes when they travel to town.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Eunice Olsen would like buses to be better at arriving on time.&nbsp; I share her </p><p align=left>Column: 3037<p><p>desire.&nbsp; The PTC&rsquo;s regulations ensure that buses usually start their journeys on time.&nbsp; But whether the bus arrives at individual bus stops as scheduled depends on the traffic.&nbsp; Our buses share the roads with other vehicles, and as every motorist knows, traffic conditions can be unpredictable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is difficult to guarantee bus arrival times.&nbsp; But we can improve their accuracy and reliability.&nbsp; The extension of our bus lanes has helped to make the bus journey more reliable, by allowing buses to travel unimpeded by other traffic.&nbsp; The&nbsp;two public transport operators have also invested in operational control systems to guide buses in real-time, to minimise bunching and help keep bus arrivals regular.&nbsp; These efforts have not gone unnoticed.&nbsp; A bus commuter, Mr Mark Ivan Lee, wrote to the <I>Straits Times</I> online <I>Forum</I> &nbsp;last month with his observations of the efforts bus captains and service leaders have put in to keep to their schedule and to please their customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have also offered commuters more bus choices since the liberalisation of the Premium Bus Service (PBS) scheme two years ago&nbsp;&ndash; from 10 to over 70 today.&nbsp; Commuter feedback has been positive.&nbsp; More importantly, commuters have voted with their feet&nbsp;&ndash; total ridership on PBS has increased by almost 60% in the period from November 2007 to the end of last year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, to make it more convenient to take a bus, we have sought to let commuters know when their bus is arriving, so they can adjust their travel plans.&nbsp; If you are an SBST commuter, you can already use the IRIS system with your mobile phone.&nbsp; Before you leave the house for the bus stop, just SMS IRIS to find out when the next bus will arrive.&nbsp; My children are a big fan of this.&nbsp; As they always seem pressed for time, this helps them decide whether they can walk to the bus stop or sprint for it.&nbsp; LTA is now building upon this system, conducting a six-month trial to</p><p align=left>Column: 3038<p><p>put in an integrated SMS system that can include all public buses and not just SBST&rsquo;s.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are now more of such tools to help commuters make better decisions and choose the best ways to get to their destinations.&nbsp; In July last year, TransitLink introduced a public transport journey planner that is integrated across modes and operators.&nbsp; The planner works out a few route options for you to get to your destinations.&nbsp; It tells you which bus or train to take, where to transfer, how long is the journey and how much it will cost.&nbsp; In October, LTA set up a Public Transport portal that provides all public transport information from a single website.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying&nbsp;all these initiatives is our vision that our public transport system should be a seamless and unified system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cedric&nbsp;Foo and Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about the crowding situation in our trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, public transport ridership grew by 7.4%, the fastest rate in many years.&nbsp; However, if&nbsp;we look closer at the numbers, we see that since the onset of the financial crisis in September 2008, ridership growth has been decelerating. &nbsp;It was 9.4% year-on-year in September; in October, it went down to 6.4%; in December, it was 4.9%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimate in January 2009 was that public transport ridership had dipped by 3.1% year-on-year.&nbsp; The reason could be because of the lunar new year holidays falling in January this year.&nbsp; Last year, it was in February. &nbsp;But it could also be that the economic slowdown has led to cutbacks on discretionary trips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether these trends persist will depend on the contrary factor of people switching from cars to public transport if the economy weakens.&nbsp; However, what is critical for us for the long term, from the strategic point of view, is to ensure that there is adequate public transport capacity going ahead.&nbsp; This is critical if we want to </p><p align=left>Column: 3039<p><p>persuade Singaporeans to shift from cars to public transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immediate step that we have taken is to increase the frequency of train trips during the rush hours.&nbsp; There are now 12% more train trips during the morning and evening peak period.&nbsp; Since the beginning of 2008, SMRT and SBS Transit have added some 900 additional train trips a week. &nbsp;The trains are now running at intervals of about two to four minutes during rush hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if a commuter cannot immediately board the first train that arrives, he knows that it will only be a few more minutes before another train comes along which he can board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been other initiatives to improve train services. The train operators have introduced service ambassadors to encourage passengers to move to the centre of train cabins, and to the ends of station platforms.&nbsp; All 66 first-generation trains on the North South/East West (NSEW) Lines have been refurbished.&nbsp; There is now more space in each train.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for comfort, LTA&rsquo;s Operating Performance Standards (OPS) is 1,600 passengers per train, or five passengers per square metre.&nbsp; This is the level that operators are not allowed to breach, based on the actual response of commuters in the local context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trains have not yet hit this level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at the most crowded stretches in the morning peak of peak, say at Toa Payoh southbound, the trains are carrying an average of 1,300 to 1,450 passengers.&nbsp; This is about&nbsp;four passengers per square metre, comparable with Hong Kong, and better than London&rsquo;s five, Tokyo&rsquo;s&nbsp;seven and Shanghai&rsquo;s eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, more can and will be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3040<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current train frequencies are about the best that the system can do under current constraints. To improve, we need to do two things.&nbsp; First, we need to upgrade the MRT infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we try to&nbsp;improve headways without doing so, the trains will start bunching up at certain chokepoints, one of which is the Jurong East MRT station.&nbsp; Besides being an interchange station, it is also the terminating station for the trains from Bukit Batok to turn around.&nbsp; However, Jurong East station currently has only&nbsp;one track for the trains coming from Bukit Batok to turn around.&nbsp; They cannot do so quickly enough.&nbsp; This slows down the entire line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will also need to buy more trains.&nbsp; Over the years, we have gradually added more trains to the NSEW Lines. We started with 66, now there are more than 100.&nbsp; But we need to add even more if we are to increase train frequencies further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why LTA announced in July last year that it will carry out the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP).&nbsp; The JEMP will relieve the current infrastructural bottleneck by creating an additional train track and platform at Jurong East station to turn trains around faster.&nbsp; This will allow trains to run more frequently.&nbsp; To take advantage of this improvement, we are purchasing an additional 22 trains concurrently for the NSEW Lines.&nbsp; This answers Mdm Phua&rsquo;s question on whether there are any other infrastructural improvements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also accelerate the JEMP by one year, and will now aim to complete it by 2011 instead of 2012.&nbsp; With the JEMP, the headway during peak periods can drop to about two minutes along the busiest stretches of the NSEW Lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents an increase in capacity of about 15%.&nbsp; So commuters will be able to enjoy more frequent train arrivals and a more comfortable ride.&nbsp; This improvement will cost us about $800 million, and</p> <p align=left>Column: 3041<p><p>enable the NSEW Lines to meet projected demand all the way till 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond 2020, LTA will study whether to embark on other projects to further increase the capacity of our existing lines.&nbsp; For example, we can upgrade the signalling system, buy more trains and expand our depots.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost can be massive and implementation likely to take a long time &ndash; about eight to 10 years. So I have asked LTA to examine this very carefully, together with other agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance, to decide how best to proceed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that we add more cars to each train, to bring the current six cars per train to eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have indeed looked into this, but decided that it would not be feasible. Our train depots, track turnarounds, and MRT station platforms are all sized for six-car trains.&nbsp; To accommodate a longer train, we would have to lengthen all these, which would be very costly and disruptive, taking several years to complete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point worth emphasising here is that besides raising the capacity of our present rail lines, a major thrust of the LTMP is to build new rail lines&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Circle Line, Downtown Line, Thomson Line, Eastern Region Line as well as various extensions to the current lines.&nbsp; This new infrastructure will double the size of our MRT system by 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Foo asked for an update on our new rail lines.&nbsp; We will try to bring forward the completion schedule as much as possible, where technical constraints allow and where it is cost-effective to do so. LTA has worked with its contractors to review the timelines, and I am pleased to announce that the completion of the North-South Line Extension (NSLe) will be brought forward from 2015 to 2014.&nbsp; This extension will provide better connectivity and accessibility to future developments in the Marina South area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3042<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we keep to the announced schedule, we will open new extensions or stages of new lines every other year from now until 2020.&nbsp; In&nbsp;two weeks, on 28th February 2009, the Boon Lay Extension (BLE) on the western edge of our MRT network will start running.&nbsp; And I am pleased to announce that on the 30th May 2009, Circle Line Stage 3 (CCL3), from Bartley to Marymount, will be opened for passenger service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCL3, together with the rest of the Circle Line which will open from 2010 onwards, will add more capacity to our MRT system.&nbsp; The Circle Line will help commuters save travel time, by reducing the need to make detours into the city centre in order to transfer across MRT lines.&nbsp; LTA expects that about 10 to 15% of commuter trips that are currently made on some of the most heavily-loaded sections of the existing MRT lines&nbsp;will move over to the full Circle Line once it is opened, reducing the crowding levels that&nbsp;we experience today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this, Stage 1 of the Downtown Line will open from 2013, giving commuters in the city the direct rail link between Raffles Place, Marina Bay and Suntec City, that Mr Ong Kian Min asked for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA and LTA have worked closely on the planning for Marina Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans will include some of the things Mr Ong asked for&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;seamless connectivity by public transport and better pedestrian facilities.&nbsp; By 2018, the Marina Bay area will be served by four MRT lines&nbsp;&ndash; the existing North-South Line, the Circle Line, the Downtown Line and the Thomson Line. &nbsp;Most commuters will have access to an MRT station within a walking distance of no more than 400 metres on average.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the plans for the Marina Bay area, we are working on having our MRT stations seamlessly integrated with an extensive pedestrian network, includ-</p><p align=left>Column: 3043<p><p>ing underground, street-level and upper-level walkways.&nbsp; Where feasible, we would also have air-conditioned underground pedestrian cum shopping malls, similar to City Link Mall, to connect developments and transport nodes.&nbsp; In future, the public will be able to walk underground and in air-conditioned comfort all the way from Raffles Place MRT station to the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, via the Marina Bay Financial Centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these plans are always being improved.&nbsp; Our city is constantly being renewed.&nbsp; So let me reassure Mr Ong that LTA will continue to work with other agencies, such as URA, to review the plans for our city and study the suggestions Mr Ong has raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, LTA will be carrying out the more complex initiatives in the LTMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key initiative for public transport will be centralised bus network planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, even though bus routes are approved by the PTC, the bus network is planned by the bus operators.&nbsp; LTA will take over the role of the central bus network planner from this year onwards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lam Pin Min asked how this would benefit commuters.&nbsp; When LTA takes over bus network planning, a single agency would be able to plan the entire transport network&nbsp;&ndash; bus, rail and roads&nbsp;&ndash; holistically as one integrated system, from the commuter&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; Centralised planning will allow us to make the entire public transport journey, from the start to the end, as integrated and as seamless as possible, so that travel is faster and more convenient.&nbsp; For example, feeder bus routes will be reviewed to provide more direct and faster connections to the bus interchanges and MRT stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cedric Foo, Dr Lam Pin Min&nbsp;and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have asked for an update</p><p align=left>Column: 3044<p></p>on central bus network planning. LTA is now drafting a blueprint for the future network, with the objectives of improving journey quality, increasing integration across public transport modes and services, streamlining the hub-and-spoke design of our network, while ensuring the overall financial viability of the bus network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial viability is an important discipline that bears highlighting. &nbsp;Public transport is the most efficient means of carrying people, but this presumes that there are enough passengers on the bus. &nbsp;If the system is not financially sustainable, the impact may not be felt immediately.&nbsp; But over time, it will pull down the quality of the whole system, as the network will not be able to generate enough revenue for the operator to invest and upkeep the quality of bus services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim asked LTA not to automatically shut down bus routes that are not profitable on their own and to try other ways such as reducing bus frequencies.&nbsp; We will consider his suggestions.&nbsp; In fact, let me reassure him that LTA&rsquo;s approach will be to consider the overall viability of the bus network, rather than insist that every bus route on its own must make a profit.&nbsp; But this does not mean that we can add economically unviable services to the network in an indiscriminate manner.&nbsp; Otherwise, sooner or later, the whole network would suffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue Dr Lam has raised of whether we can allow bus services to duplicate routes that are also served by the rail system, LTA will have to decide on such instances judiciously, based on the best way to use the available resources.&nbsp; On stretches of rail corridors that are already congested, bus services are allowed today to run in parallel with trains, but there are also many other instances where such duplication will not make sense.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 					<p align=left>Column: 3045<p>				<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of the balance between competing requirements that will need to be struck.&nbsp; LTA will look for the best way to benefit as many people as possible while maintaining the overall viability of the bus network. &nbsp;LTA will consult industry experts, transport operators and grassroots representatives on the planning principles and strategies to adopt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our guiding principles is to avoid making any radical, 'Big Bang'-type changes to bus services. Commuters make more than&nbsp;three million trips on buses every day, and we are conscious that any change must be gradual.&nbsp; Otherwise, there will be mass confusion.&nbsp; Our approach instead is to identify any gaps in connectivity, try to plug them, and see where bus services can be streamlined to improve efficiency of the network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I should highlight is that even after LTA has taken over route planning, painful trade-offs will still be necessary. &nbsp;Take, for example, a feeder bus service which has quite a circuitous route.&nbsp; I am sure Members are familiar with complaints from some residents that their feeder service makes "one big round" before it reaches the MRT station.&nbsp; One option for LTA is to 'straighten out' the feeder route, so that it is faster.&nbsp; But this means that some residents who used to go, say, to the market that is along that "one big round" would now lose their direct service and may need to take a transfer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help identify and resolve these sorts of trade-offs, and to answer Mr Lim, LTA will hold a series of dialogues in each Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Single Member Constituency (SMC), to consult local grassroots leaders whose residents are affected by the changes.&nbsp; The consultations will start in the second</p><p align=left>Column: 3046<p><p>half of 2009. &nbsp;LTA will present the design of the existing bus network in the constituency, explain the proposed changes and invite comments.&nbsp; We will also take suggestions, highlight the trade-offs involved and the choices that the community can help to make.&nbsp; Members of the public will be able to channel their feedback through their local grassroots leaders and constituency representatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the new bus network has been implemented, LTA will then look at how best to package the bus routes for competitive tendering.&nbsp; Mr Alvin Yeo raised the issue of industry competition. We are not looking at competition 'in' the market where operators compete head-to-head for market share. Experience elsewhere has shown that in the public transport sector, this type of competition will destroy integration and lead to wasteful duplication.&nbsp; Instead, we are looking at competition 'for' the market where the operators compete to provide a package of bus services or run a rail line.&nbsp; By introducing greater contestability to the public transport sector, commuters will benefit as the operators would be incentivised to improve efficiency, service quality and innovation.&nbsp; Thus the public interest is best served not by simply having a single public transport operator, as Mr Yeo suggested, but by ensuring there is the threat of competition to keep these dominant market players on their toes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and some Members in last week's Budget Debate have asked&nbsp;that polytechnic students&rsquo; concession fares be lowered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operators decide on concessions.&nbsp; However, I would encourage them to see how best they can help in these difficult times.&nbsp; As for the Government, our approach has always been to provide targeted help to those most in need.&nbsp; Polytechnic students are a large and diverse group&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;there are students from wealthy families and students from less well-off families. We</p><p align=left>Column: 3047<p><p>should not ask taxpayers to subsidise the fares of polytechnic students who can well afford it.&nbsp; For less well-off households, there are various Government measures to help them such as the Workfare Income Supplement, GST Credits and if more help is needed through the CCC ComCare Fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in tough economic times. &nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about the fare formula.&nbsp; The fare adjustment formula is not a cost-plus formula. &nbsp;It pegs fare increases to macro-economic factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)&nbsp;and the Wage Index, rather than the operators&rsquo; specific costs.&nbsp; This ensures that the operators have to be efficient if they want to be profitable, as they cannot pass their costs on directly to commuters.&nbsp; So as Mdm Phua pointed out, the formula is not directly linked to fuel prices but has an indirect link through the CPI.&nbsp; However, based on the fare formula, the maximum fare adjustment this year would have been close to&nbsp;five per cent.&nbsp; This is why I am pleased that the PTOs have announced that they would work with the PTC to reduce fares this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Ong, I hope the PTC and the PTOs will find ways to lower transport costs in addition to passing on&nbsp;the savings from the Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Foo and Mr Lim asked that distance-based through-fares be effected as soon as possible.&nbsp; I agree that this is an important initiative to enhance the attractiveness of our public transport system.&nbsp; However, the PTC will have to decide whether, in the current bad economic conditions, it is better to go ahead and implement it this year, or is it better to phase it in so as to minimise the burden of adjustment on both commuters and the PTOs.&nbsp; The PTC will make its decision together with the fare revision by the end of this month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3048<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now cover the second key thrust in the LTMP&nbsp;&ndash; managing road usage.&nbsp; Dr Lam asked about the long-term strategies for managing road usage.&nbsp; To keep traffic flowing smoothly on our roads, we have to adopt a holistic package of measures as no single measure can achieve this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have to continue to increase and optimise our road capacity where we can.&nbsp; We will continue to build roads, and leverage on technology to maximise their capacity. &nbsp;To answer Mr Foo, we are studying how best to use GPS technology to further optimise road capacity.&nbsp; However, there is a limit to how many more roads we can build or widen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to control the demand for our roads.&nbsp; Congestion is a function of both vehicle usage and vehicle population.&nbsp; Hence, we will need to continue to control our vehicle population as well as their usage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we need to put in place viable and more efficient alternatives to the car in order to ensure we have a sustainable transport system.&nbsp; That is why we continue to invest heavily to improve our public transport system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our strategies to keep congestion in check will revolve broadly around these three strategies, circumstances and behaviour will change over time.&nbsp; We will thus need to continually review the balance between them to ensure that the right balance continues to be struck.&nbsp; We will also need to fine-tune existing measures and explore new ways of achieving these three objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we launched the LTMP in early 2008, we announced that we would enhance the efficacy of the ERP system by using a new set of criteria to determine ERP rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a phased approach by first implementing the changes in the city area in July 2008, before extending it</p><p align=left>Column: 3049<p><p>outwards progressively.&nbsp; We were hopeful that by introducing the changes to the ERP system in such a phased approach, we can allow improvements from early phases to flow through the whole road network so that we end up having to do less later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that this is indeed what happened and by November last year, traffic conditions had improved significantly. &nbsp;Of the six new gantries planned for November, we did not have to install four of them. We also deferred the gantry at Serangoon Road, and in the end, only had to implement the gantry on the PIE near Eunos.&nbsp; The changes to the existing gantries were also not as extensive as we had earlier thought necessary.&nbsp; This answers Mr Foo&rsquo;s question on how effective has the ERP changes been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that ERP is to manage congestion and not a revenue measure, and that the Government will be happy to collect less if drivers drove less.&nbsp; So if economic conditions lead to changes in travel patterns and less road usage as Mr Seah said, LTA will take them into account and will adjust the ERP rates accordingly.&nbsp; This was what happened in the latest quarterly rate review in February 2009, when LTA lowered ERP rates at 15 gantries.&nbsp; In fact, based on what we have seen so far, if demand for driving continues to fall, the additional ERP revenue collected per year will be about $50 million, and not the $70 million we had earlier estimated.&nbsp; But rest assured that we will not reduce the $110 million in road tax reductions and $200 million in ARF reductions that we have already announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Foo asked if ERP rates should be reviewed more frequently so that it is more responsive to changes in traffic conditions.&nbsp; Let me explain why LTA reviews ERP rates on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; </p><p align=left>Column: 3050<p><p>LTA has found empirically that traffic conditions take some time to stabilise each time ERP rates are adjusted. Drivers may change their behaviour several times after a rate change before they settle into a steady pattern.&nbsp; The change in traffic impact is not just at gantries that have had their rates changed but also on adjacent gantries and time slots.&nbsp; So if we review the rates more frequently, we will be making decisions prematurely.&nbsp; Overall, this would reduce the effectiveness of the ERP system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why ERP is levied on some roads even when there appears to be no congestion, the reasons vary.&nbsp; Mr Lim has cited Nicoll Highway and Upper Boon Keng Road as examples.&nbsp; The rates for ERP gantries around the cordons in the city are determined based on the speeds of different baskets of key roads.&nbsp; Cordon ERP is meant to deal with congestion in a specific area comprising a network of roads rather than to deal with congestion on a specific road.&nbsp; Nicoll Highway is one in a basket of roads in a cordon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the basket, some roads are more free-flowing than others, and if we can fine-tune the system to take this into account, we will.&nbsp; For instance, the whole city used to be&nbsp;one large cordon.&nbsp; But LTA has now divided it up into three separate cordons: the Orchard Cordon, the Bugis-Marina Centre Cordon and the Shenton Way-Chinatown Cordon.&nbsp; Breaking this up has allowed us to better fine-tune the ERP rates.&nbsp; For example, the Orchard Cordon does not start operation until 12 noon on weekdays, while there is no ERP for the Shenton Way-Chinatown Cordon on Saturdays.&nbsp; However, if we were to lower the ERP rate for just one road in a cordon compared to adjacent roads, say the ERP gantry at Nicoll Highway, motorists will simply decant over to Nicoll Highway and jam it up.&nbsp; This is why gantries in the same cordon have the same ERP rate, and it is determined by a basket of roads within the cordon. &nbsp;While I am all for further reducing ERP rates, it has to be</p><p align=left>Column: 3051<p><p>predicated on traffic conditions not worsening as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Upper Boon Keng Road, we implemented ERP there in April 2008 because speeds along that stretch of road had fallen below 20 kph.&nbsp; Today, traffic is flowing smoothly within the range for optimal flow. &nbsp;I think the important point to make here is that we have to use an objective way to determine when ERP rates should go up and down, which is what LTA has done.&nbsp; So when the traffic speeds along Upper Boon Keng Road go above the optimum speed range, which so far has not happened, LTA will certainly reduce the ERP rates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving motorists more traffic information will also help them make better choices on the routes to take and help LTA to manage traffic congestion better.&nbsp; For those who listen in on the radio in the morning and evening peak hours, you may have heard regular capsules called "LTA Traffic News".&nbsp; LTA has, since October 2008, procured airtime on four MediaCorp radio stations to disseminate traffic news.&nbsp; Mr Lim would be pleased to know that the stations broadcast traffic updates up to&nbsp;five times more frequently during the morning and evening peak hours than in the past.&nbsp; The updates can be heard at about once every eight minutes during the peak periods.&nbsp; Feedback from listeners have been positive.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LTA did a poll last month. More than 80% of the respondents have found the service useful in helping them to plan their routes. Mr Lim asked if LTA would consider a dedicated radio station to disseminate traffic news.&nbsp; LTA is currently studying the feasibility of such an idea.</p><p><br>4.00 pm</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, congestion is a function of both vehicle usage and vehicle population. Since the introduction of the</p>   <p align=left>Column: 3052<p>   <p>Certificate of Entitlement (COE) system in 1990, we have kept the vehicle population growth rate at&nbsp;3% per annum. Last year, we announced in the LTMP that we would lower it to 1.5% from Quota Year 2009 (QY09) onwards.&nbsp; At 1.5%, it is still higher than our road growth going ahead, which is about 0.5% per annum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min asked if it is sustainable for vehicle growth to surpass road growth.&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked if LTA would consider a lower growth rate of 1% from QY09 as the economy has worsened and COE prices have fallen.&nbsp; Mr Seah asked me the same thing last year. I think the point I made last year remains valid. In the longer term, I agree that we may have to reduce the vehicle growth rate further. However, it is also important, when making changes, to do so gradually so that people have sufficient time to adjust. We have implemented quite significant changes to improve our public transport system and to manage road use, and we are not finished yet. It will take time for the impact of these changes to take effect and for people to adjust. As we have already taken the step to halve the vehicle population growth rate to 1.5% for the next&nbsp;three years, we should only do a review after some time to see if a further reduction is required.&nbsp; On Mr Seah&rsquo;s suggestion that the severity of the economic downturn is another reason to review the growth rate now, my view is that the vehicle population growth rate should not be dependent on prevailing economic conditions which are volatile and unconnected to long-term factors like the pace of road construction, public transport improvements and progress in road management technology. These fundamental factors are critical in determining the sustainable vehicle population growth rate.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when we do the next review, we will&nbsp;consider all the suggestions from Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3053<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, for the QY09 which begins in May 2009, LTA will be issuing a total COE quota of 83,789. This is about 24% less than in&nbsp;QY08.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Part of this quota is to allow the vehicle population to grow by 1.5%. The bulk is to replace vehicles that LTA anticipates will be deregistered this year. Some have pointed out that our vehicle growth rate in the last few years has exceeded the 3% annual growth rate. The reason why this has happened is because the number of vehicles deregistered actually turned out quite differently from the numbers projected when we worked out the COE quotas for the respective years.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to say that the COE system does not work. It does, because any errors in projection are always corrected in the current or subsequent years. Since the COE system was introduced in 1990, our vehicle population has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 3%&nbsp;as intended. The COE system has therefore been effective in keeping the growth of the vehicle population within the prescribed growth rate on a long-term basis.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think that there is scope to review how we project COEs to replace vehicles that are deregistered, as suggested by Mr&nbsp;Foo, to see if the methodology can be improved to more closely match the COE quotas released for the year with the actual number of vehicle de-registrations. It will improve the responsiveness of the system, but there will, however, be trade-offs, such as more uncertainty over the quota released. Hence, LTA will consult the motor vehicle industry as part of its review.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Foo asked if the Government will consider making Off-Peak-Cars (OPCs) more attractive to motorists.&nbsp; I think he also made the same point to me&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; He has since spoken to me and he is a</p><p align=left>Column: 3054<p><p>persuasive man. So this year, I shall not disappoint him.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPCs have been with us since 1994.&nbsp; In fact, we started off with the Weekend Car Scheme in 1991.&nbsp; In the last few years, the OPC scheme has been gaining popularity.&nbsp; At the end of 2005, there were only about 5,000 OPCs.&nbsp; Today, we have about 42,000 OPCs, an eight-fold increase over a three-year period. They currently make up about 7.7% of the car population.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OPC scheme is something we should encourage.&nbsp; It provides an alternative and a lower-cost means for people to own cars, and as its name suggests, helps to alleviate peak hour congestion on our roads.&nbsp; Those who own OPCs will tell you that they do not use their cars on a daily basis to commute to work during the restricted hours. They either make use of public transport or they plan their schedule to avoid the restricted hours. This fits into our overall objectives to better manage traffic congestion on our roads, particularly during the peak periods, and help to moderate ERP charges.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we will study how we can make the OPC scheme more attractive and convenient to motorists, to encourage more car owners to opt into the scheme.&nbsp; We have received numerous feedback from OPC owners, such as the limited outlets where the OPC day licences can be purchased; the cost and risk of holding a large stack of OPC day licences, the problem of paper licences running out; allowing OPCs to be used freely on Saturdays; and the feedback from normal car owners that it is not attractive to convert their cars to OPCs because one has to wait until the car is deregistered before the full OPC benefits can be realised.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for a start, we have identified three areas to look into. First, LTA will </p><p align=left>Column: 3055<p><p>review how to make it more convenient for motorists to purchase the OPC day licences. LTA is studying how to implement an electronic licence scheme to replace the current paper licences. LTA will be holding focus group discussions with&nbsp;OPC owners to seek their views on this. Second, we will study the feasibility of giving cash rebates for those who convert their existing cars to OPCs, which will be more attractive than the conversion scheme today where the cash is only paid out when the car is deregistered. Lastly, we will relook into the restricted hours for OPCs, in particular, the Saturday restrictions, with some corresponding adjustments to the tax concessions of the OPC scheme.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman Sir, let me conclude by saying that this is a time of significant change&nbsp;in our&nbsp;land transport system. We aim to keep our city "liveable", by improving public transport and managing excessive road usage.&nbsp; I have touched on the many initiatives we have implemented or will carry out to achieve this overarching goal.&nbsp; But whether we succeed or fail is not determined by Government policies alone.&nbsp; It is ultimately determined by the decision of each and every Singaporean, every time he or she steps out of the house. Every day, millions of Singaporeans ask the same question when making a particular trip: "Should I hop onto a bus or train, or should I drive the car?"&nbsp; If out of every&nbsp;five car trips,&nbsp;one is taken on public transport, then indeed we are on the way to success.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am encouraged by letters such as this one, written by Mdm Doris Chan.&nbsp; Mdm Chan lives in the Shunfu area, and used to commute by car to her office in Beach Road.&nbsp; But since the middle of last year, she has switched to public transport.&nbsp; She wrote to LTA recently,</p><p align=left>Column: 3056<p><p>noting the improvements to public transport which is faster now and, with the higher transfer rebate, more attractive.&nbsp; She also says,&nbsp;"I don&rsquo;t have to worry about traffic jams, steering the car or avoiding other vehicles which is stressful. I don&rsquo;t need to worry about how to 'escape' ERP gantries, or what amount to pay.&nbsp; On the bus, I can just relax, look out the window and enjoy the scenery.&nbsp; I now get to see things in my neighbourhood that I used to miss before &ndash; new buildings, friends walking along the road.&nbsp; And best of all, walking to the bus stop and MRT station is good exercise, and reduces my weight!"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that there will be more people like Mdm Chan.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Taxi Service</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</B> &nbsp;(<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090212/20090212VS_150050.pdf"">Appendix A</a></I>*.]Mr Chairman, the figures released by LTA in January this year showed that in the first 11 months last year, taxi drivers received as many as 1,800 summonses with demerit points; three times more than the 407 cases in the year before.&nbsp; Among these summonses, 70% were for violation of taxi-stop rules in the CBD.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my MPS, there are quite a number of taxi drivers living in the Hougang area&nbsp; who came and sought my help after receiving such summonses.&nbsp; They told me that on some occasions, they were booked under circumstances beyond their control, for example, passengers alighting&nbsp;on their whims and fancies but the taxi drivers were fined.&nbsp; Although the passengers are aware of the regulations imposed by LTA on alighting within CBD, they often insist on alighting wherever they want.&nbsp; As the taxi-stand could be too far away from their destination, some even just drop the taxi fare, open the door and get down at the traffic light. The Police then summoned the taxi driver.&nbsp;</p>   <p align=left>Column: 3057<p>  <p>Under such circumstances, it is really beyond their control.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem is that there are not enough waiting lots for taxis at popular taxi stands.&nbsp; When the lots are taken up, the taxi drivers have only two choices: first, is to risk being summoned by the Police; or secondly, to ply their empty taxis in the CBD looking for another taxi stand. This adds on to their burden and it is not environmentally-friendly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these busy taxi stands allow only taxis to let the passengers alight and not to wait for passengers. In this present market downturn, it will make life more difficult for the taxi drivers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that LTA will provide more waiting lots along the curb near the popular taxi stands, so that it will benefit all taxi drivers, and the passengers will also be able to catch the taxi within a shorter waiting time.

This allows both passengers and taxis to queue up in an orderly manner, without blocking the traffic lane.&nbsp; However, where traffic is heavy and due to space constraints, there are no lay-bys and no space for taxis to wait or queue without obstructing traffic, taxi stops would be assigned instead.&nbsp; Taxi stops are, therefore, intended only for the picking up and dropping off of passengers.&nbsp; Thereafter, taxis must move off from the taxi stop immediately.&nbsp; If there are no passengers wishing to board immediately, taxis should not wait at the taxi stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers who are booked for waiting at taxi stops or queuing beyond the allocated number of lots at the taxi stands will be given a composition fine of $50.&nbsp; There are no demerit points for the offences and repeat offenders will be issued with the same amount of fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards&nbsp;the increase in the number of taxis drivers caught, I would like to inform the House that arising from the greater awareness,&nbsp;the number of taxi drivers caught stopping indiscriminately along the main roads in the CBD area has actually declined by more than 80% since March 2008, from the high of 566 at the point of implementation to about 76 as&nbsp;at January 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just recap for the House again why we have this CBD taxi rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the CBD where demand for taxis and traffic volume is high, some measure of control is necessary to prevent disruption of traffic, which may be caused by taxis stopping suddenly or changing lanes along</p><p align=left>Column: 3061<p><p>public roads in the CBD to pick up or to alight passengers.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;largely a safety issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, a trend which could have contributed to the supply and demand issue and which has exacerbated the situation.&nbsp; The increase in the number of offences can also be attributed to the drop in taxi ridership in 2008, due to the revision of taxi fares that took effect from December 2007, as well as difficult economic conditions in the later part of 2008.&nbsp; So with the supply of taxis exceeding demand, especially during the off-peak periods, there were longer queues of taxis at taxi stands, particularly in the CBD area.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is despite LTA increasing the number of taxi waiting lots in the CBD by about two times, from 101 to 296.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, LTA has to balance the convenience of taxi commuters and taxi drivers against the safety and needs of other road users.&nbsp; Taxis that wait for passengers at taxi stops obstruct the flow of traffic and cause danger to other road users, just like taxis that queue beyond the allocated lots at taxi stands.&nbsp; This is why they are not allowed to do so.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if there are taxi stands where Mr Low feels more taxi lots are needed, I welcome Mr Low to let LTA know where these are, and LTA will be happy to look into his suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to Mr Chiam&rsquo;s&nbsp;comments on better warning for road works.&nbsp; To ensure that contractors carrying out road works make necessary provisions for traffic warnings,&nbsp;LTA requires them to comply with a Code of Practice for Traffic Control at Work Zones (COP).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Code, contractors must provide sufficient and early warning to motorists approaching the work zone.&nbsp; The minimum sizes and distances for warning signs vary with the speed limit of the road.&nbsp; For example, a road with a 40</p><p align=left>Column: 3062<p><p>kph speed limit would require warning signs with a minimum size of 90 cm by 90 cm.&nbsp; The first warning sign is typically placed 120 metres upstream from where the lane begins to taper off.&nbsp; The signs for an expressway have to be at least 120 cm by 120 cm, and placed 480 metres away. Additional warning signs should also be placed closer to the work zone provided that there are not too many close to each other such that they end up confusing drivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractors have to apply these guidelines according to the ground situation.&nbsp; The priority is to ensure that the signs are visible and motorists have sufficient time to digest the information and react accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guidelines were developed after extensive reviews of the standards and practices of other developed countries.&nbsp; Giving information too far ahead of a work site will unwittingly cause traffic to slow down too early and increase the inconvenience to drivers.&nbsp; In order to minimise the disruption, it is necessary to place the warning signs at an optimum distance from the work site.&nbsp;&nbsp;For expressways and other roads with speed limits of 70 kph and above, we would also require the deployment of truck-mounted attenuators to help absorb the impact in the event that vehicles miss all the advance notices and crash into the work site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the comprehensiveness of the Code of Practice, there could still be instances where contractors do not follow LTA&rsquo;s requirements strictly.&nbsp; Motorists can call LTA&rsquo;s hotline if they spot any unsafe practices at road works and LTA will look into them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the issues that Er Lee Bee Wah has raised.&nbsp; Let me first of all commend her for her persistence in raising these issues to serve her residents&rsquo; needs.&nbsp; I would like to assure her that we listen to feedback and suggestions, even if at times we are unable to accede to</p><p align=left>Column: 3063<p><p>them immediately.&nbsp; One of the realities that my Ministry faces is that we have limited resources.&nbsp; We, therefore, have to prioritise as there are trade-offs involved in how we allocate funds and resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we recognise that our population is ageing and we want to build a more inclusive society.&nbsp; Members would recall that one of the three strategic thrusts of the LTMP launched last year is meeting people&rsquo;s diverse needs.&nbsp; This is why my Ministry has been spending more so as to ensure that our public transport system is accessible to the less mobile, not just in the Member&rsquo;s constituency but for all Singaporeans islandwide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All existing MRT stations already have at least one station entrance fitted with a lift and a barrier-free route.&nbsp; LTA is currently installing additional lifts to 16 existing stations.&nbsp; LTA is also building ramps so that 70% of existing stations have at least two barrier-free routes by 2011.&nbsp; By 2010, 40% of our public buses will be wheelchair accessible, and we intend that by 2020, the entire fleet will be so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be spending $60&nbsp;million to ensure that road facilities islandwide are accessible for all pedestrians, including the less mobile by 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is our priority at this time,&nbsp;to make sure that our less mobile residents can reach the station first, before seeing how we can shorten the walk.&nbsp; But we have taken onboard her feedback.&nbsp; LTA&nbsp;will study the viability of installing and maintaining lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges near MRT stations where there is sufficient usage to justify it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same goes for providing covered linkways.&nbsp; This is again a popular request with Members.&nbsp; The principle here is to target our limited resources at places </p><p align=left>Column: 3064<p><p>where it will make the most difference to residents.&nbsp; LTA&rsquo;s main focus is on connectivity from transport nodes and transport facilities (ie, bus stops or taxi stands) to amenities like schools and polyclinics.&nbsp; But LTA will always consult the advisors when deciding where to erect such covered linkways, and there have been several occasions where LTA has adjusted their plans to take in the feedback.&nbsp; Beyond this, Town Councils can make use of their CIPC funds to further improve the connectivity within their estates if they choose to.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

There is an increasing number of cyclists on the road;&nbsp;also a rising number of accidents involving cyclists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most alarming are the collisions between a bus and a bicycle.&nbsp; In such accidents, the cyclist has&nbsp;almost no&nbsp;chance of survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is especially acute on bus lanes, where the bus driver believes he is king of the road.&nbsp; He does not&nbsp;feel a need to&nbsp;look out for bicycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that, already, cyclists are allowed to share bus lanes.&nbsp; But going by the behaviour of some bus drivers and motorists, I am not sure if they are aware of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3065<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not uncommon for a bus to tightly sandwich a cyclist between itself and the kerb, leaving little room for the cyclist to move, or to try to intimidate the cyclist off the road by bearing down close to the cyclist.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;reports of road rage, with the bus driver shouting and gesticulating&nbsp;at the cyclist on bus lanes.&nbsp; But it is even more dangerous for the cyclist to move to the middle lane, and be squeezed between the bus and the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would leave the cyclist with nowhere to go except to the hospital bed or the mortuary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have to think of ways to make the roads, especially our bus lanes, safer for our cyclists.&nbsp;&nbsp;One way is to turn bus lanes into shared bike-bus lanes and clearly designate this on signs and on the road with painted legends on both bus and bicycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of calling it a bus lane, call it a bike-bus lane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bike-bus lanes are actually quite widely&nbsp;used and common in&nbsp;French and German cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The German Federal Ministry of Transportation reported that cyclists&nbsp;are safer using bus lanes, and bus operations are not negatively affected by this arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp;For safe sharing of bike-bus lanes, bus drivers must be professionally trained to coexist with cyclists and cyclists be given guidelines on sharing the bus-lanes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An increasing number of city planners recognise the merit of such lanes.&nbsp; Early last year, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley announced that the city would provide training&nbsp;to all bus drivers prior to rolling out bus-bike lanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other cities employing shared bike-bus lanes include Toronto, Vancouver and Philadelphia.&nbsp; <I>London Telegraph</I> reported recently that on lanes where bicycles share bus lanes, bicycle&nbsp;crashes were reduced 44%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge LTA to work with Traffic Police to educate both motorists and cyclists on safe sharing of roads,&nbsp;especially when sharing bus lanes and on</p><p align=left>Column: 3066<p><p>observing traffic regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such designated shared lanes will also help change the mindset of motorists towards the place of the bicycle on our roads.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The facility for cycling in the estates:&nbsp; we need cycling lanes especially when cycling becomes an essential mode of transport.&nbsp; Many foreign workers are cycling to their nearby workplaces and when they go to look for food around the HDB estates.&nbsp; I have also noticed that&nbsp;parents are sending their children to schools on bicycles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To emphasise the importance of having proper cycling lanes, let me share a report written for the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and Transport which pointed out that, and I quote, "City&nbsp;regions that have large cycle lane&nbsp;networks in&nbsp;proportion to the size of the&nbsp;urban road network were also found to display the highest levels of cycling modal&nbsp;share."&nbsp; It added, "People are more likely to cycle responsibly where they are provided with the facilities that enable them to cycle safely and quickly."&nbsp; The co-use of the pedestrian pavement for cycling is heading for a collision course.&nbsp; I sincerely wish that similar tragedy of cyclists and motocyclists on the roads would not happen to our pedestrians on our pedestrian pavements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3067<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For responsible cycling, the onus lies on the cyclists.&nbsp; If public education fails,&nbsp;then enforcement on the cyclists has to be done.&nbsp; There are many issues here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there acts that&nbsp;govern the responsibility of cycling on pedestrian pavement?&nbsp; LTA should clarify if pedestrian walkways are governed&nbsp;by the Road Traffic Act as they are not public roads.&nbsp; Who is the authority that oversees the behaviour of cyclists on pavement?&nbsp; Without any identification&nbsp;for cyclists, how&nbsp;do we&nbsp;enforce responsible cycling?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed by our grassroots leaders&nbsp;that they tried to stop and advise&nbsp;irresponsible cyclists.&nbsp; However, the cyclists do not stop and zoom past.&nbsp; Even if the cyclists are to stop, the enforcement is rather confrontational.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way is to define the responsibility of cyclists under the relevant law and put the onus on cyclists when there is an accident.&nbsp; This means that the cyclists are deemed responsible for the accident on the pedestrian walkway when the accident happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other additional responsibility is that cyclists are to wear bright clothes, luminous stripes at the back, ensuring that there are&nbsp;basic front and back lights, and loud ringer&nbsp;installed on the bicycles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask that we act now to protect the interests of all parties, especially our pedestrians, and&nbsp;that the Ministry takes preventive steps and not wait until an accident happens before reviewing the Road Traffic Act.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, school children cycle to school and workers cycle to work.&nbsp; Cycling not only helps to alleviate traffic congestion, it is also an excellent form of exercise.&nbsp; More and more residents are cycling in the HDB estates, </p><p align=left>Column: 3068<p><p>particularly the foreign workers.&nbsp; Cycling is the main mode of transport for them.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But some residents complain to me that there are frequent incidents of collision on the track shared by cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; The residents said that some cyclists simply pushed and shoved their way through; knocked over pedestrians and just rode away.&nbsp; Even the Police could do nothing about it.&nbsp; The reason being that the bicycles are not licensed, and thus cannot be identified.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, for the safety of both the cyclists and the pedestrians, I would suggest, firstly, that we should broaden the tracks that are shared between the cyclists and the pedestrians to at least 3.5 metres in width, and this is the width of the track in Gombak that is built by National Parks Board.&nbsp; So far nobody has any complaints with this type of wide track.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, there should be licence plates on the bicycles.&nbsp; In the old days, the bicycles had number plates, as reported in the newspapers.&nbsp; But now the new bicycles are not registered and there are no number plates.&nbsp; I think LTA should allow all the cyclists to have a licence plate number.&nbsp; These numbers could be personalised numbers like AMS888, for Ang Mong Seng, or OAH889 for Ong Ah Heng. This will also prevent people stealing your bicycle.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thirdly, for safety's sake, they should have lights in front and at the back and there should also be a bicycle bell.&nbsp; These would be safety features for the bicycles&nbsp;&ndash; safety not only for the cyclists but also for the pedestrians.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would suggest that LTA provide more bicycle parking lots near the MRT stations.&nbsp; We can see that there are so many bicycles that are parked near the MRT and&nbsp;even on the pedestrian walkway.&nbsp; It is very unsightly.&nbsp; So I hope </p><p align=left>Column: 3069<p><p>that we would provide more parking lots for the bicycles.&nbsp; This is not only for the convenience of the cyclists but it would also create a better image in the public area.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3139-3140.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Teo Ser Luck)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I thank Ms Irene Ng, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Wee Siew Kim for their support&nbsp;and suggestions on cycling.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last year&rsquo;s Committee of Supply debate, before I joined MOT, I&nbsp;advocated&nbsp;a lot on cycling,&nbsp;as I am&nbsp;an avid cyclist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am&nbsp;on the other side of the fence trying to answer all the questions on cycling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Land Transport Masterplan (LTMP)&nbsp;that was released last year, we said that cycling was a transport option that can link commuters to major transport nodes such as MRT stations and&nbsp;bus interchanges.&nbsp;It also described how LTA intended to facilitate cycling.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key dilemma in facilitating cycling is about space&nbsp;&ndash; how do we share space amongst competing users in such a way </p><p align=left>Column: 3070<p><p>that will&nbsp;make better&nbsp;use of our very limited land, as well as&nbsp;ensuring the&nbsp;safety of pedestrians,&nbsp;cyclists&nbsp;and&nbsp;motorists?&nbsp; The challenge is developing acceptance and consideration between the different groups.&nbsp; This is going to take time.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, from my own personal experience, I can see that there is now better awareness&nbsp;among the drivers but I think there are still some gaps to close.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have taken a very careful and deliberate approach to finding that balance between the various stakeholders.&nbsp; Even before the LTMP was released, there were already several grassroots cycling initiatives in a number of towns where there was support from the residents.&nbsp; There were also groups promoting safe cycling.&nbsp; The programmes&nbsp;that LTA&nbsp;is rolling out to facilitate cycling as a mode of transport&nbsp;are to build on the&nbsp;foundations laid by these early adopters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassroots organisations in Tampines, working with LTA and the Traffic Police (TP),&nbsp;are running&nbsp;a trial to assess if cyclists and pedestrians can safely share a common footpath.&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the trial, LTA has widened 1.2 km of footpaths as well as key pedestrian crossings and they have put up 'cyclist dismount' signs at major junctions.&nbsp; So when you reach the sign, dismount, you have to take a walk and push the bicycle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, LTA launched a pilot project in October last year to provide cyclists in Pasir Ris, Tampines and Yishun with more and better-designed bicycle parking facilities near MRT stations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional bicycle racks will facilitate cyclists who want to ride to the MRT station, park their bicycles and then hop onto a train. This is the inter-modal transport process that we are promoting.&nbsp; And this&nbsp;pilot will also allow LTA to gather feedback on the design and placement of the racks in order to better understand the&nbsp;users' needs, before we actually extend these facilities to other MRT stations and bus interchanges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3071<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the national front, LTA has also worked with&nbsp;two public bus operators to complete a six-month trial to allow foldable bicycles on board buses and trains during less crowded off-peak hours.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyclists in the pilot towns have generally welcomed these new facilities while others in some other estates have also asked for similar type of facilities.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we have also received some&nbsp;divergent&nbsp;feedback from other groups.&nbsp; Some bus passengers worry about foldable bicycles taking up scarce space on board.&nbsp; Similarly, some pedestrians also did not like sharing footpaths with cyclists, for fear that they could be knocked over with little warning, as&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim has&nbsp;pointed&nbsp;out.&nbsp; That is why I said this really takes time but we can see that there is progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though&nbsp;there are diverse views, we can see that at least there are groups ready to support cycling as part of the whole transport system.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia&nbsp;Phua and Mr Wee Siew Kim have also asked about public education and enforcement.&nbsp; The Traffic Police will continue with their ongoing public education efforts.&nbsp; This is extremely important because this creates awareness and&nbsp;allows people, especially non-cyclists,&nbsp;to better understand about cyclists, about sharing paths and being&nbsp;accommodating.&nbsp; It also creates awareness&nbsp;amongst cyclists to understand their own responsibility to ensure their own safety as well as the people around them, ie, the pedestrians, and even how to keep themselves safe from errant drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Traffic Police will continue with this&nbsp;ongoing public education effort. In fact, in 2008, a total of 273 Road Safety talks were conducted at Road Safety Community Park.&nbsp; Another 25 road safety exhibitions providing safety tips for</p><p align=left>Column: 3072<p><p>cyclists were also held at HDB neighbourhoods, primary and secondary schools, and workplaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police will also continue to take enforcement action. It is the responsibility&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Police to take enforcement action&nbsp;against cyclists who ride in a disorderly manner or endanger the safety of others. But these are punitive measures. &nbsp;Acceptance and&nbsp;consideration between cyclists and pedestrians is still the best way to protect our residents. However, it will take time to develop this. So, we have to&nbsp;continue to move forward at a measured pace that the public and the local communities would be comfortable with, and all the while actively consulting and engaging the various groups to see the acceptance level before pushing it even further.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, since last year&rsquo;s trial to allow foldable bicycles on board buses and trains, LTA has sought feedback from cyclists, bus captains, service leaders, train officers, public transport commuters and other relevant stakeholders. The&nbsp;general consensus is that such a scheme can work. So, we have&nbsp;decided to continue with the scheme from 15th March onwards.&nbsp;But there will be&nbsp;some slight adjustments to the scheme as we have to take into account the range of stakeholder feedback that LTA has already&nbsp;received.&nbsp; Foldable bicycles will still be allowed on board only during weekend and off-peak hours, but further&nbsp;details will be announced&nbsp;later by LTA.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng suggests allowing cyclists to use our bus lanes. She has mentioned that we are&nbsp;already doing so. And&nbsp;I am doing so. I have been cycling on bus lanes all the time. SBST&rsquo;s bus captains and SMRT&rsquo;s service leaders have been trained to keep a lookout for and to maintain a safety distance from cyclists. However,&nbsp;I think cyclists&nbsp;do have&nbsp;a&nbsp;part to play.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have to be responsible and should&nbsp;obey traffic rules and traffic lights, and also</p>  <p align=left>Column: 3073<p>   <p>know how to avoid an oncoming bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;a cyclist, I would say that if you go in a group, ride in a single file and&nbsp;keep to the extreme left of the lane. I understand that some cyclists ride in the middle of the lane and&nbsp;try to overtake other vehicles. I&nbsp;do not think you can be a hero in this sense&nbsp;&ndash; you have to keep yourself safe.&nbsp; It is also important to&nbsp;make it easier for the bus to overtake the cyclist. So, it is both the responsibility of&nbsp;the bus driver&nbsp;and also the cyclist.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether we should clearly indicate that cyclists can cycle in bus lanes on signs and on the road with painted legends, I think the issue&nbsp;is that today, you would see that there are already many lines on our roads as well as signs. We already have&nbsp;safety cycling signs&nbsp;on lamp-posts&nbsp;&ndash; that was a joint project between LTA and the&nbsp;Safe Cycling Task Force. I think we have to try to avoid putting up&nbsp;too many signs, as it would&nbsp;become very confusing.&nbsp; But it is important that&nbsp;we should continue to publicise this fact, which Ms Ng has&nbsp;brought up,&nbsp;continue with&nbsp;public education that&nbsp;cyclists are allowed to cycle in bus lanes, and also educate the bus drivers as well as cyclists about safety.&nbsp;I believe that we can achieve this same objective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng urged us to build wider paths with clear dividing lines between cyclists and pedestrians. I am pleased to say that we will do so. LTA, in partnership with community stakeholders, will roll out a $43 million&nbsp;programme to design and construct dedicated cycling tracks next to pedestrian footpaths in HDB estates. The programme will complement existing efforts in the respective towns to develop cycling infrastructure. Where there is enough space, these tracks will be physically separate from the footpaths, allowing cyclists to have a truly dedicated path. In more restricted areas, the tracks will be joined to the existing pedestrian footpath,</p><p align=left>Column: 3074<p><p>but they&nbsp;will have painted markings, clearly defining and identifying them for cyclists, like what you see&nbsp;in our Park Connectors.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first phase of the programme will cover&nbsp;five towns.&nbsp; We will start with Tampines, to build on the work that has already been done to facilitate cycling there.&nbsp; LTA will start building 6.9 km of cycling tracks from the second half of this year onwards. It costs an estimated&nbsp;$4.7 million. These dedicated cycling tracks will be up to&nbsp;two metres&nbsp;wide where there is enough space, and&nbsp;will bring cyclists to the MRT station and bus interchange. In doing so, these tracks&nbsp;will also run near to all&nbsp;local amenities.&nbsp;So, for recreational cyclists&nbsp;who want to run errands, do their grocery shopping, or go to different&nbsp;shops,&nbsp;they can have a safer and&nbsp;shorter cycling&nbsp;trip.&nbsp;Cycling can become a mode of transport for residents to do what they need to do.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next town will be Yishun, where LTA will work with HDB to extend its existing cycle tracks. 7.5 km of cycling tracks will be constructed from 2010 onwards.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;at a cost of $6.3 million.&nbsp; The Town Councils of Sembawang, Pasir Ris and Taman Jurong are also in the process of working with LTA to design similar cycling tracks. In the case of Sembawang and Pasir Ris, we will be building on and complementing the&nbsp;existing cycling tracks that they already have.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selected these five towns for the first phase of the programme,&nbsp;to develop this infrastructure so that they can become&nbsp;cycling towns.&nbsp;All&nbsp;have favourable local characteristics&nbsp;&ndash; their residents must support cycling, and the pedestrians and&nbsp;cyclists there must be able to accommodate one another.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope to add more towns in the future, but as we have learnt from the</p>   <p align=left>Column: 3075<p>   <p>Tampines trial, grassroots support is important.&nbsp; They had several dialogues and engagement sessions with the residents and grassroots,&nbsp;to refine plans to promote cycling as a mode of transport.&nbsp; There were many concerns raised and&nbsp;diverse views expressed by the grassroots leaders, residents as well as&nbsp;cyclists. We have to also address the concern raised by&nbsp;Mr Wee on&nbsp;errant cyclists and&nbsp;proper cycling etiquette.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to be able to move into the next phase in about&nbsp;three to five&nbsp;years&rsquo; time by engaging the&nbsp;Town Councils for&nbsp;such&nbsp;programmes then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether LTA can make registration of bicycles compulsory. They hope that it will help enforce against reckless cycling behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the concerns over reckless cycling&nbsp;&ndash; it endangers not only the pedestrians but also the cyclist himself. However, we need to ask whether this proposal is practical or&nbsp;feasible.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are to register bicycles, the&nbsp;task of compelling every existing bicycle owner to step forward and register all his bicycles&nbsp;is quite&nbsp;burdensome.&nbsp; Personally, I have four bicycles at home. So, I would have to register all my&nbsp;bicycles &ndash; maybe TSL 1111 to 4444.&nbsp;If everybody has several different bicycles, it can be burdensome and maybe&nbsp;extremely difficult to enforce. When you register, you also need to consider&nbsp;deregistering them. So, you have to deregister the bicycle, to transfer the ownership if you sell or give away the bicycle.&nbsp; It is therefore not surprising that even some of the cities that we study&nbsp;&ndash; "bicycle-friendly" cities&nbsp;like Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;do not have compulsory registration schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe what we should do is to focus on improving cyclist and pedestrian behaviour. This is&nbsp;the crux of the matter. This is why we can only move at a pace</p> <p align=left>Column: 3076<p><p>that people are reasonably comfortable with.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the while, we have to continue to&nbsp;engage&nbsp;and consult them&nbsp;before we take the next step.&nbsp;I know that the people and&nbsp;volunteer sectors, like&nbsp;the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association (SACA),&nbsp;where I believe&nbsp;Ms Ng is the advisor,&nbsp;are working&nbsp;with&nbsp;the Traffic Police&nbsp;on public education and outreach efforts. These efforts will have to continue.&nbsp;We cannot give up hope so quickly.&nbsp; Let us make sure that&nbsp;public education can work and it is effective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other safety measures that Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested are already in place. For example, the current Road Traffic Rules require that bicycles on our roads, when ridden after dark,&nbsp;be equipped with a white light in front and a red light at the back.&nbsp;I think, most importantly, it is not the white or&nbsp;red colour of&nbsp; the lights, but lights that are prominent and&nbsp;bright enough to be spotted at night.&nbsp; Any violation of the rule carries with it a composition fine of $20. This is&nbsp;a matter of personal responsibility.&nbsp; So, if you&nbsp;put on all these lights and&nbsp;the bell, they are&nbsp;for your personal safety.&nbsp; In fact, one of my bicycles has&nbsp;a&nbsp;"<I>garang guni</I>"  horn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Traffic Police does not have any plans to make the installation of, say,&nbsp;bells compulsory, I would&nbsp;urge all cyclists to do so, and to use them appropriately.&nbsp; It is important to have a bell because when you are near or&nbsp;at the back of&nbsp;a pedestrian, it is important to signal instead of&nbsp;just shouting out, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;not very polite.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very important to have helmets, as brought up by&nbsp;Mr Low.&nbsp;&nbsp;Helmets are very important when you are on your bicycle, whether during the day or&nbsp;night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, last year, I said that I looked forward to the day when our citizens could consider cycling as a mode of transport. I see this is beginning to happen. I agree with Members that we still have some way to go, but I am happy to say that we are progressing and we are</p><p align=left>Column: 3077<p><p>getting there. We need to support all stakeholders to make Singapore not just as a cycling town but also&nbsp;a cycling city.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, we should note that there was a drop in passenger traffic in September, November and December 2008.&nbsp; On the air freight side, for 2008, the total movement was 1.86 million tonnes, a drop of 2% year-on-year; and&nbsp;for the month of December 2008 alone, a drop of up to 21.4%.&nbsp; All these are, of course, attributable to the global difficulties facing the aviation industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if he would&nbsp;share with us his views on the expected passenger and cargo performances for Changi Airport this year, and what measures the Ministry is contemplating to ameliorate the expected fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in August 2007, the Minister announced plans to corporatise Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS),&nbsp;with its&nbsp;regulatory functions being vested in a new regulatory body, and its commercial functions corporatised.&nbsp; This plan was to enable Changi Airport to compete more effectively and to enhance Changi Airport's position as a&nbsp; premier air hub.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consultants were to have been </p><p align=left>Column: 3078<p><p>appointed to advise the Government on this corporatisation plan.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to update us on how the corporatisation would impact airlines, ground services companies, tenants like duty-free shops and staff of CAAS?&nbsp; Also, would this lead to landing charges and rentals for DFS shops&nbsp;going up?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are concerns that the proposed CAS, which is the commercial part of the present CAAS, will be narrowly focused on just short-term profits.&nbsp; If this were the case and if it were not regulated properly, the risk is that the externalities,&nbsp;that of&nbsp;an&nbsp;efficient and cost-effective airport operation&nbsp;will&nbsp;bring to Singapore as a whole, will be lost.&nbsp; Could the Minister assure us&nbsp;and explain&nbsp;how the regulations for CAS&nbsp;would be promulgated?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also discussions on what the next steps would be following the corporatisation of CAAS.&nbsp; Does it mean that privatisation would be a logical next step?&nbsp; Would CAAS&nbsp;or any of its assets such as Changi or&nbsp;Seletar airports be privatised?&nbsp; And if so, when are such steps expected and what considerations will&nbsp;MOT have to take into account before making such a big move, as&nbsp;clearly there are many risks associated with a complete privatisation of CAAS.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

If yes, is this a setback in Changi Airport's drive to nurture competition at the airport?&nbsp; I guess incumbents&nbsp;at the Airport and business slowdown would have&nbsp;made the operating environment very difficult for Swissport.&nbsp; But other than these reasons, has any act of commission&nbsp;or omission on the part of the authorities also exacerbated the cost structure? &nbsp;Could there have been changes to the way Changi Airport manages and extracts value from service providers at the Airport that also worsened the issues?&nbsp; Are there learning lessons from this departure?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is timely to have an objective review of the entire situation at the Airport.&nbsp; I think it could possibly result in learning lessons and benefit all stakeholders, airlines, MRO&nbsp;providers, warehouse, retailers, the authorities and, of course, the passengers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2008 has been a tough year for the global aviation industry.&nbsp; First, the airlines were hit by a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak of US$146 per barrel in July 2008.&nbsp; Then, the global financial crisis broke in September, triggering a severe global recession that the industry has not seen in quite a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are already witnessing the impact on Changi Airport.&nbsp; Passenger traffic dipped from a growth of 1.8% in October to a 3.2% decline in November 2008 and a decline of 0.6% in December 2008.&nbsp; Air cargo fared even worse. &nbsp;The 8% decline in October deteriorated further to a 14.2% drop in November and 21.4% drop&nbsp;in December.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;Mr Ong has observed, as Changi did well in the first three quarters of the year, it managed to end the year 2.7% up for passenger traffic, serving some 37.7 million passengers while suffering a drop of 2% in air cargo, moving 1.85 million tonnes of cargo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, as Members have noted,&nbsp;the full impact of the global downturn can be expected to be felt in 2009.&nbsp; We expect Changi to welcome 8.5% fewer passengers or some 34.7 million for 2009.&nbsp; And consistent with the weaker trade flows and economic conditions, Changi is expected to move only 1.77 million tonnes of cargo or a drop of 5.1%.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the face of this slackening demand, how do we protect the competitiveness and dynamism of our air hub? To do so, we will need to do three things:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3083<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;First, to help the aviation industry to reduce and contain costs;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Second, to push for greater liberalisation in the regional air travel market; and</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Third, to continue with infrastructure upgrading and expansion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with airlines cutting back flight services to rationalise their networks, it is our aim to keep Changi Airport as high up the list of destinations airlines must retain as possible.&nbsp; To do so, Changi must continue to offer the best value for money even though it cannot be the lowest-cost airport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards achieving this objective, we have set aside for 2009 a further $130 million under the Air Hub Development Fund to finance programmes such as an increase of landing fee rebates from 15% to 25%, a Growth Incentive Scheme and a Route Development Incentive Scheme to help airlines grow their traffic out of Singapore.&nbsp; These measures are targeted at helping airlines in hard times, and to entrench them in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the drop in passenger traffic numbers, the shops at Changi Airport are also feeling the pinch. CAAS has set aside more than $60 million in the form of a rental relief package for retail, food &amp; beverage, and services concessionaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lower the concessionaires&rsquo; rental cost and help them remain viable through this period of lower sales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to our continuing efforts to liberalise the air travel market which goes beyond addressing the short-term&nbsp;dip in travel pattern. With airlines' bottomlines severely affected by the current downturn, there is a possibility of national governments becoming more</p><p align=left>Column: 3084<p><p>protectionist so&nbsp;to shield their struggling national carriers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has and will continue to work towards air rights liberalisation on a bilateral basis with other countries.&nbsp; The pursuit of liberalisation is critical to Changi as a hub because the starting point to an air hub&rsquo;s connectivity is the rights for the airlines to operate.&nbsp; The benefits of liberalisation can be seen in the opening up of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur sector in 2008.&nbsp; Rights for two additional daily flights were added in February, and full liberalisation implemented on 1st December.&nbsp; The results speak for themselves. In 2008, passenger movements for the sector grew by 11% to 1.89 million passengers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This impressive growth demonstrates that there is potential in the Southeast Asia market yet to be tapped, due to the limits imposed on the market.&nbsp; That is why we will continue to push for liberalisation within ASEAN under the Roadmap for Integration of Air Travel Sector (RIATS) and beyond.&nbsp; This will benefit not only our economy, but also that of our ASEAN partners as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking outside the region, ASEAN is working towards air services liberalisation based on the RIATS, with key Dialogue Partners such as China and India.&nbsp; It would set the stage for new vistas of air traffic expansion in and beyond the region, enabling ASEAN to participate in the robust economic growth of Asia's foremost economic powerhouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me touch on the upgrading and expansion of our airport infrastructure.&nbsp; Two key projects are currently underway&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the upgrading of Terminal&nbsp;1 and the expansion of the Budget Terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;These will not only help the economy, but also position Changi for more growth and widen its lead when the economic crisis is over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3085<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work on Terminal&nbsp;1 started in May 2008 and will be completed by end 2011.&nbsp; At a total estimated cost of $500 million, the upgrading will improve operational efficiency and provide users with a more integrated and appealing environment for travel, shopping, dining and entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the work is finished, the upgraded Terminal&nbsp;1 would virtually be a new terminal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of Budget Terminal is scheduled for completion in April this year. &nbsp;This will increase its passenger handling capacity from 2.7 million to seven million passengers per annum.&nbsp; This expansion is necessary to facilitate the growth of the Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) sector.&nbsp; In 2008, almost all (93%) of Changi&rsquo;s growth came from the LCCs, compared to around half in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address Mr Wee Siew Kim&rsquo;s question on the pullout of the third ground handler, Swissport, from Changi Airport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After operating for&nbsp;four years, Swissport made the decision to exit Changi in January 2009 as it was unable to gain sufficient market share to ensure commercial viability.&nbsp; Let me assure this House that Swissport&rsquo;s pull-out does not lessen our commitment to uphold competition in the ground handling market at Changi.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we decided to award a licence to a third ground handler back in 2005, our objective was to allow for greater competition into what was then a duopolistic market structure.&nbsp; Following Swissport&rsquo;s entry, there was a general lowering of ground handling rates to the airlines by around 15%.&nbsp; Further, the increased competition led to new products and initiatives being introduced by the incumbents, such as the new CIAS lounge in Terminal&nbsp;1 and a new business model to cater to LCCs by SATS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3086<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should not intervene in the market just to ensure the survival of a third player&nbsp;or a certain number of players. Once the industry structure is in place, it is up to the companies to compete with each other for market share, grow the business and remain viable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate term following Swissport&rsquo;s exit, ground handling costs are unlikely to rise as the ground handlers are still bound by existing contracts.&nbsp; Sir, going forward, we are committed to maintaining contestability in the ground handling market, and are prepared to issue another ground handling licence should a suitable bid be made.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr&nbsp;Foo and Dr Lam asked for an update on the progress of the corporatisation of CAAS for reassurances on the management of the airport&rsquo;s staff during the transition, and also on whether the current crisis would have any impact on the exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, we informed this House that the government will restructure the existing Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) into two entities, namely a new company to run Changi Airport and a new Civil Aviation Authority for the regulatory and strategic functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS currently manages Changi Airport, provides air traffic services, plans and implements future airport expansion, regulates aviation matters and advances Singapore&rsquo;s strategic interests in the international aviation arena.&nbsp; Corporatisation will separate its regulator and business functions so that each entity can focus on its respective roles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporatisation will give Changi Airport the flexibility to respond to changes in the aviation industry and the global business environment, and to stay ahead of the competition. &nbsp;As a corporate entity,</p><p align=left>Column: 3087<p><p>it will be better able to attract and retain global talents.&nbsp; It will also be able to pursue overseas business ventures and investment opportunities more aggressively. &nbsp;This will ensure that Changi will continue to offer the best value-for-money&nbsp;to its customers and thus ensure Singapore&rsquo;s position as a global aviation hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic downturn has not diminished the rationale for corporatisation.&nbsp; As part of the corporatisation exercise, the Ministry of Transport and CAAS have made study visits to important and busy airports around the world. &nbsp;These include Australia&rsquo;s Sydney Airport, Holland&rsquo;s Schipol Airport, Germany&rsquo;s Frankfurt Airport, and the United States&rsquo; JFK Airport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Important lessons, especially on regulation and competitiveness, were learnt which have been incorporated into the corporatisation design for Changi Airport. &nbsp;Sir, we are mindful that Changi Airport brings positive externalities, not all of which accrue to the airport operating company.&nbsp; Hence, we set out to design a regulatory regime that will balance Singapore&rsquo;s interest in strengthening Changi as an air hub, vis-&agrave;-vis the need for the airport to deliver sustainable economic value and be innovative in its services.&nbsp; The regulatory system will have sufficient levers on the company to ensure competitive prices, service excellence, and timely investments in airport infrastructure.&nbsp; Let me add that there are currently no plans to privatise the corporatised entity, which is in itself a separate and distinct decision that has not been taken at this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the two entities and the regulatory framework has been completed and the implementation is now in full swing. To ensure a smooth transition, CAAS has held a series of engagement</p><p align=left>Column: 3088<p><p>sessions with staff to update them on the corporatisation exercise, to seek their views, and to address any concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is understandable that some of the CAAS staff might be apprehensive about the exercise. &nbsp;Let me assure them, and Members, that this corporatisation is not a cost-cutting exercise, i.e. saving money by cutting jobs. &nbsp;In fact, because we have to create a new regulatory interface and split corporate functions like human resource, finance and legal between the two new entities, more jobs will be created. &nbsp;No retrenchment of staff is thus expected in this exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as Changi Airport is a critical infrastructure, the legislative model of corporatisation will be adopted to ensure the least disruption to Changi&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp; My Ministry will hence be introducing a Bill in this House soon, to effect the corporatisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key consideration in the assignment of staff will be the roles that they are assigned to the new entities.&nbsp; For example, airport management staff will likely be transferred to the new airport company.&nbsp; Others who are involved in strategic or regulatory roles will most likely be designated to the new Civil Aviation Authority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those performing corporate functions common to both organisations, such as the ones I mentioned&nbsp;&ndash; human resource, finance and corporate services&nbsp;&ndash; postings will be based on organisational needs, and ensuring an equitable talent spread and critical mass in the two entities.&nbsp; This arrangement will ensure that officers are deployed to where they can best contribute to the organisation, based on their experience and expertise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, all staff will join the new company and the new Civil Aviation Authority on 'no worse-off' terms at the point of transfer. &nbsp;They will be able to </p><p align=left>Column: 3089<p><p>carry out their pre-corporatisation salaries and benefits&nbsp;&ndash; such as leave and medical benefits&nbsp;&ndash; to the new entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, on 1st April this year, CAAS will be separated operationally into the two new entities. &nbsp;This will allow staff in the entities time to get used to the new environment, to test out the operating systems and to iron out any teething problems.&nbsp; The legal separation is scheduled to take place formally on 1st July.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, allow me to conclude by noting that while the economic crisis we are facing now is unprecedented, the strength of our aviation industry, in particular of Changi Airport, has put us in a good position to weather the storm. &nbsp;Not only will we survive the current downturn, but also will we emerge from it stronger. &nbsp;It is this kind of unexpected and sudden crisis that necessitates the greater flexibility that corporatisation will give to Changi Airport. With the corporatisation of Changi Airport, we will be better prepared not just for the recovery but also for the long-haul.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Maritime Hub</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, my final cut is on sea transport.&nbsp; Let me first declare my interest.&nbsp; I work for a shipping company.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the maritime sector has served Singapore well for many, many years and shipping will continue to be a principal mode of cargo transport for many more years to come.&nbsp; Yes, the financial turmoil, sharp drop in consumer demand have affected trade flows and therefore shipping, ports and related businesses are all undergoing a very difficult period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to predict how long and how deep the recession will be but the storms however perfect must subside at </p><p align=left>Column: 3090<p><p>some point.&nbsp; It is therefore of great importance that Singapore&nbsp;is able to see beyond the economic fog and continues to invest in its maritime cluster.&nbsp; This sector comprising ship financing banks, shipping lines, marine insurers, classification societies, shipbrokers, bunkering operators, ship agents, shipping lawyers, arbitrators and so forth, can potentially contribute much to our economy.&nbsp; To this end, it is encouraging to note that there&nbsp;has been&nbsp;some success brought about by MOT's initiatives.&nbsp; For example, I was told that four international group Protection and Indemnity clubs, P&amp;I clubs for short, are now represented in Singapore and the market talk is that two more clubs will be setting up office here this year and some of the European banks have also set up dedicated shipping desks in their Singapore office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Minister update the House on what steps are being taken to enhance Singapore's position as a maritime hub?&nbsp; For example, what is the progress of plans to construct more container berths at Pasir Panjang?&nbsp; Would we let up because of the current slowdown?&nbsp; Would we press on?&nbsp; How are we promoting more P&amp;I clubs to set up offices here and better still to have their corporate headquarters relocated to Singapore?&nbsp; These are difficult times for the clubs and they are looking to fundamentally reduce their cost of operations.&nbsp; Singapore, with its low tax base made one percentage point lower through the Budget&nbsp;this year, and&nbsp;its excellent infrastructure, can be a very attractive option for these P&amp;I clubs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;in order to achieve the aim of enhancing Singapore's position as a maritime hub, we will also have to take steps to continue to develop a pool of skilled personnel to support these activities&nbsp;such as marine insurance, marine arbitration and so forth.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister also to update the House on whether there are specific manpower development initiatives to help</p><p align=left>Column: 3091<p><p>enhance Singapore's position in this very aspect?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, with the current economic slowdown, it is inevitable that the stakeholders in this industry will also feel the brunt of it.&nbsp; One recent example is that&nbsp;of an international mutual&nbsp;club, this is an insurance club, which has recently transferred its entire underwriting and claims servicing activities for Southeast Asia region from Singapore to its Hong Kong office.&nbsp; Another more recent example is the collapse of Armada Shipping which was granted approved international shipping (AIS)&nbsp;in 2006 in Singapore but it is now seeking protection from the Singapore court under a scheme of arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the Government intends to grant a 20% concession in port dues for all harbour craft engaged in commercial activities and about 2,000 such craft will benefit from it.&nbsp; I fully support this move but at the same time I wonder if it is sufficient to help the stakeholders who are undergoing a very difficult period.&nbsp; I would like to ask the&nbsp;Minister to update&nbsp;the House on whether there are other initiatives and if the difficulties in the sector deepens, is the Ministry preparing more initiatives to help this particular sector.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It naturally raises concerns on the competitiveness of our port.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it would be easy to attribute the current situation to a demand drop-off, we cannot just wait for demand to return.&nbsp;

Can the Ministry provide an update on measures to be taken to enhance the competitiveness of our port?&nbsp; How do we stack up against what we know our competitors are doing?&nbsp; And how much more do we need to do?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> Sir, I thank the Members who have raised the questions on the maritime industry.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first provide an update of the performance of the maritime sector.&nbsp; For 2008 as a whole, the maritime sector has done well.&nbsp; Singapore remained the world&rsquo;s busiest port, and the tonnage of</p><p align=left>Column: 3093<p><p>vessel arrivals grew by 11.1% to reach 1.6 billion gross tons.&nbsp; We also continued to be the busiest container port, with throughput growing by 7.1% to 29.9 million TEUs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts to become an international centre of maritime business also made good progress, with more shipping companies and maritime service providers expanding and setting up operations in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of companies under our Approved International Shipping Enterprise (AIS)&nbsp;Scheme grew to around 110, from below 100 the previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets managed by companies under our Maritime Finance Incentive Scheme have also grown to almost $2 billion, and it is up from $1.2 billion in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While full-year figures are positive, it is clear that the maritime sector has been adversely affected by the current global downturn, in tandem with other industries and that is&nbsp;not surprising because the sector is at the forefront of&nbsp;cargo movements and&nbsp;trade has dipped.&nbsp; So international freight rates had also been affected.&nbsp; Ship charter rates, port throughput volumes have all fallen sharply in the last few months.&nbsp; In the first half of last year, our container throughput grew 12% year-on-year.&nbsp; But the growth slowed to 9% in the third quarter of 2008, and then it turned negative, to minus 3%, by the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The drop in December was very steep.&nbsp; It was at minus 13%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact is similar in other ports as well across the world.&nbsp; For example, Hong Kong&rsquo;s container throughput fell by 12% in the fourth quarter of 2008, and in&nbsp;December it fell by 24%.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

In other words, though we continue to be competitive, the entire market is down, and we are affected.&nbsp; But we continue to be&nbsp;attractive as a maritime centre, and there will be some opportunities to tap in this downturn.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;as maritime businesses consolidate their offices internationally, we can work with them to consolidate their operations in Singapore.&nbsp; There are also opportunities in maritime arbitration, as the level of activity has picked up with the downturn.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Foo that there should be no let up in our efforts to promote maritime ancillary services in Singapore, and we should continue to seek&nbsp;out such opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we hope for the best, we must be prepared for a challenging year ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Resilience Package announced by the Minister for Finance has measures&nbsp;such as the Jobs Credit Scheme, Special Risk-sharing Initiative, and corporate tax cut that&nbsp;will benefit the maritime sector.&nbsp; Mr Foo and Mr Ong can be assured that a key priority for the Ministry in 2009 is to help the industry ride through this current downturn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area where we will focus on will be to lower&nbsp;the business cost.&nbsp; We have already introduced several relief measures&nbsp;over the&nbsp;last couple of months.&nbsp; For example, we have extended the waiver of withholding tax on overseas interest payments to finance the purchase of Singapore flag vessels under the Block Transfer Scheme (BTS).&nbsp; We have also expanded this&nbsp;scheme so that more shipowners can benefit.&nbsp; These measures can help reduce the costs of financing at&nbsp;this time when credit is tight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also announced two new measures in this year's Budget.&nbsp; First, we will be injecting an additional $45 million into the Maritime Cluster Fund (MCF) to support new business developments.&nbsp; This is a new component of the MCF.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3095<p><p>New maritime businesses planning to set up in Singapore, or existing maritime businesses planning to expand into new lines of businesses, can tap into this fund to defray their start-up costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, a ship broker expanding into offshore broking activities may apply for co-funding under the new component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is a 20% port dues concession for harbour craft engaged in commercial activities.&nbsp; This concession lowers the business cost of our port service providers such as bunker suppliers, ship chandlers, tug boat operators, and domestic ferry operators.&nbsp; Many small and medium sized businesses will also benefit from this concession. This will come into effect on 1st April 2009 for&nbsp;one year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides harbour craft which ply within our port limits, we will also extend concessions to ocean-going vessels such as containerships, tankers and bulk carriers.&nbsp; I am happy to announce today that the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) will also grant an additional 10% concession in port dues to ocean-going vessels with a port stay of not more than 10 days.&nbsp; This concession will be given over and above existing port dues concession already enjoyed by the industry, such as the 20% port dues concession for container ships.&nbsp; The concession will also come into effect on 1st April 2009 for a period of one year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides reducing business costs, protecting jobs will be another key priority.&nbsp; The Ministry is encouraging maritime companies to hold back on retrenchments, and to take advantage of this downturn to send their workers for training instead.&nbsp; We are working with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) through their Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR).&nbsp; Already, the Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) has maritime</p> <p align=left>Column: 3096<p><p>courses under SPUR.&nbsp; We will continue to work&nbsp;with WDA to expand the breadth of maritime courses, such as the maritime courses offered by the tertiary institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MCF also has a manpower development component which complements SPUR.&nbsp; Training programmes that do not come under SPUR can be funded by the MCF.&nbsp; It can be used to co-fund the development of maritime training programmes, course fees, scholarship and internship programmes, among others.&nbsp; In 2007, the MPA topped up the manpower development component of the MCF by $21 million, bringing it to a total of $50 million.&nbsp; Since then, companies and training organisations have tapped on the fund to the tune of $7 million.&nbsp; I strongly encourage more maritime companies to leverage on SPUR and MCF to upgrade the skills of employees.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to invest for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Foo asked about enhancing Singapore's position as a maritime hub.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed important that, even as we focus on alleviating short-term difficulties, we should&nbsp;not overlook positioning ourselves for the future so that we are ready for the growth that comes up.&nbsp; Singapore remains a compelling location for maritime business because&nbsp;we are strategically located as a port.&nbsp; We have a comprehensive and vibrant maritime cluster comprising the full range of activities and services.&nbsp; We are still the maritime centre of Asia, and I am confident we will continue to grow in the longer term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must&nbsp;continue to invest in the future.&nbsp; One key area is scalability for the port infrastructure.&nbsp; Our port continues to compete well.&nbsp; Over the last 10 years, our container throughput has doubled.&nbsp; Over the last&nbsp;five years, it has expanded at a little over 10% per annum, slightly higher than both Port Tanjung Pelepas and Port Klang, despite our port's higher base.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3097<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Foo asked if our plans to develop the port will be affected by the current downturn. The Government remains committed to making timely investment in our port infrastructure.&nbsp; The development of Pasir Panjang Terminal Phases 3 and 4 is well underway and will proceed without delay.&nbsp; This is because we will still need additional capacity when the first berths come into operation in 2012.&nbsp; To prepare for the even busier port of the future, plans are also afoot to develop a new Port Operations Control Centre at Changi by 2010 and to dredge and deepen the main approaches to our port.&nbsp; Our port operators are also making their own investments to ensure that we continue to be well-placed to compete as a hub port going forward.&nbsp; For example, PSA is also taking advantage of the slowdown to refit their port equipment to raise fuel efficiency and to cross-train their port workers to raise operational flexibility and nimbleness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides hard infrastructure, investment in our people must also continue.&nbsp; There&nbsp;were many excellent jobs in the maritime industry over the last few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, each of the 57 students in the pioneer batch of the Bachelor of Science in Maritime Studies at NTU found jobs in the maritime sector upon graduation.&nbsp;&nbsp;When growth in the sector resumes, we must be ready with the pipeline of talent to fill these vacancies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPA will&nbsp;continue to work with industry and our tertiary institutions to develop more maritime training programmes and to attract Singaporeans into maritime careers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;through good times and bad times, the maritime industry is an important bedrock of the Singapore economy.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;committed to working in partnership with the industry to steer through this downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we trim our sails and batten down our hatches, we must remember to continue charting our future course.&nbsp; Singapore's fundamental strengths in the maritime industry remain strong.&nbsp; I am</p><p align=left>Column: 3098<p><p>confident that the industry will grow again when this downturn is over.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some time left for clarification.&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, first, I would like to thank the Minister for making me very pleased and not disappointed about the off-peak car scheme. For&nbsp;my colleagues, it is good for them to note that if you press on, sometimes you get what you ask for.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are many other colleagues that&nbsp;have asked for&nbsp;one particular point and have&nbsp;made this particular appeal, and that is, the&nbsp;polytechnic student concession&nbsp;fares.&nbsp; So&nbsp;he will please many of them to avoid disappointing many of them.&nbsp; In the last count, up to 10 MPs have spoken on this subject. &nbsp;The Minister's response was that there are, amongst the polytechnic students,&nbsp;some who come from wealthy families and some from less wealthy families, and so we should not allow them to enjoy this same concessionary rate as other JC students.&nbsp; But I think that argument fails to recognise that even among the JC students, some of them are from wealthy families and some from poorer families.&nbsp; Even among the senior citizens, some are very wealthy and some are less wealthy. I think the cut-off point is: are they full-time students?&nbsp; Indeed, JC students are full-time students; ITE students are full-time students, and so are polytechnic students.&nbsp; I recognise that any concession we give to a particular group means a cross subsidy from all the rest of them who are not enjoying the concession. &nbsp;But I think we have come to a point where the public supports it. &nbsp;That is my belief, and I hope the Minister will state his stand. &nbsp;Although it is beyond him to make those adjustments&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it is up to the Public Transport Operators (PTOs)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think, with his statement, it will help a long way&nbsp;when the PTOs are reviewing this subject.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 3099<p>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Can I ask Members not to make new speeches but just&nbsp;clarifications?&nbsp; Mr Raymond Lim.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> I really do not know whether what I say would&nbsp;go a long way with the PTOs.&nbsp; I just want to manage&nbsp;Members' expectations. &nbsp;Let me clarify what I said which&nbsp;I thought I had made&nbsp;quite clear.&nbsp; There are actually two parts to this polytechnic student concession issue.&nbsp; One is that, as the Member correctly said, this is a decision for the public transport operators; they decide on concessions.&nbsp; He is again right that there is&nbsp;a cross-subsidy element between those who are paying full fares and those who are on concessions, and the public transport operators would have to weigh this. &nbsp;But in this current difficult economic climate, I would&nbsp;encourage them to see how&nbsp;best they can help to lower transport costs for polytechnic students.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, on the part of the Government, the approach that we have taken is&nbsp;to provide targeted help for families who need it the&nbsp;most.&nbsp;For the Government to come in and provide the subsidy for polytechnic students,&nbsp;it would be an across-the-board subsidy and not a targeted approach.&nbsp; Therefore, it would benefit polytechnic students from wealthy households and those from poor households.&nbsp; But this is not our approach.&nbsp; We prefer to&nbsp;use a targeted approach and&nbsp;we have various schemes to help them&nbsp;&ndash; the Workfare Income Supplement and GST&nbsp;Credits. &nbsp;And if they need more help, there is the&nbsp;CCC ComCare Fund.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, in my speech, I requested LTA to look into the feasibility of modifying the roadside&nbsp;kerb near the taxi stand to form&nbsp;a taxi bay or holding area&nbsp;if there is site constraint at the taxi stand for more taxi parking lots.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Senior Minister of State, in her reply, asked me for suggestions on a particular taxi stand.&nbsp; But, Sir, I am not a taxi-driver although I know one or two taxi stands.&nbsp; I</p><p align=left>Column: 3100<p><p>would suggest that LTA&nbsp;do a survey with taxi-drivers&nbsp;or work with&nbsp;taxi-drivers or the Taxi Drivers' Association to look into&nbsp;particular taxi stands where there is a high demand to provide such facilities.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second clarification:&nbsp; I wonder whether LTA, in the name of road safety, has conveniently ignored the plight of taxi-drivers. &nbsp;Has the LTA considered the impact on the taxi-drivers&nbsp;when implementing new measures&nbsp;regulating where the taxis that can stop in town and changing some of the taxi stands to taxi-stops, while some taxi-drivers obviously may not be informed of that.&nbsp; I wonder whether, in Mandarin, it is&nbsp; "<I>na de shi si ji lai kai dao</I> ".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Teo Ser Luck, wants to&nbsp;promote Singapore as a cycling nation.

Amongst other reasons, he stated&nbsp;we need to give the public sufficient time to adjust to this new policy.&nbsp; To that, I would say&nbsp;I think that existing motorists and aspiring motorists have already spoken in terms of bidding for COEs.&nbsp;

I think the question to ask is really, is 1.5% too much&nbsp;in this current climate.&nbsp; 1.5% to review it after three years is adding 36,000 cars on the road.&nbsp; My suggestion of putting it to 1%, if it's done now, over three years would mean 12,000&nbsp;fewer cars in these three years.&nbsp;

If you create regulatory uncertainty in policy-making, people who depend on it will lose confidence.&nbsp; So unless there are compelling reasons, you do not change.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when we work out what is sustainable for the vehicle population growth rate, we look at the long-term&nbsp;fundamental factors&nbsp;&ndash; what is the road growth going ahead, what sort of public transport improvements we are putting in, what sort of road management technologies will come on stream,&nbsp;and then we make the decision.&nbsp; As I mentioned last year, when we make this decision, we do not lock it in permanently.&nbsp; We said, "Let's do it for&nbsp;three years."&nbsp; We have not even started.&nbsp; So if we change this decision even before we&nbsp;start, it will create uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic conditions change rapidly so if we were to do what Mr Seah suggests, to just peg it to prevailing economic conditions, we are going to end up with what people call "up and down economics".&nbsp; If you look back to August 2008, how many people predicted the Lehman collapse in September?&nbsp; Also ask yourself, how often&nbsp;have we revised our GDP growth forecast?&nbsp; It is really changing rapidly.&nbsp; So we are going to implement a vehicle population growth rate&nbsp;in terms of what should our sustainable rate be into the future.&nbsp; If the long-term factors change, then we would adjust the vehicle population growth rate.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But my speech is more on&nbsp; making&nbsp;the bus lanes as bike-bus lanes, to designate it as such with clear legends and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said that doing so might confuse people with too many legends.&nbsp; I wanted to flash a picture but I was advised that it is not that easy so I will do&nbsp;an "Ang Mong</p><p align=left>Column: 3103<p><p>Seng" and show a picture of a bike-bus lane in Paris which I took when I was there&nbsp;and I do not think it will confuse anybody to have a bike-bus lane.&nbsp; In fact it makes it clearer that the bicycle can share the lane and then the&nbsp;drivers will be trained to look out for bicycles because I think it will be quite clear that the bicycles have a right to be on the lanes.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the second point is, I&nbsp;just want to clarify a point by hon. Member Cynthia Phua, my good friend.&nbsp; I share her concern that pedestrians and cyclists must share footway safety and the education and enforcement&nbsp;must be a part of it.&nbsp; But I just want to clarify that in the Tampines trial, the reason we started it was because&nbsp;cyclists were already using pedestrian walkways.&nbsp; Cyclists and pedestrians were already having conflicts on the walkways.&nbsp; It is not that because we started it in Tampines and therefore cyclists are&nbsp;starting to use the pedestrian walkways in other parts of Singapore.&nbsp; All along, cyclists have been using the footways and our trial has been to&nbsp;try and&nbsp;see how we can make&nbsp;it safe for both sides and we have done a lot of work on the ground.&nbsp; The grassroots leaders have worked very closely with LTA.&nbsp; I want to thank LTA for the cooperation given, especially in producing education brochures that give cyclists&nbsp;clear indications of the etiquette&nbsp;&ndash; how to ring the bell and&nbsp;how to give the right of way to pedestrians at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And if I could beg your indulgence, Sir, I think&nbsp;Mr Seah asked something else.&nbsp; There are two parts to it.&nbsp; If I could also answer the first part, he says well, people have already adjusted so what else,&nbsp;what other adjustment is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ.&nbsp; Because people have adjusted to the 3% vehicle population growth rate and we have announced in this House that we are going&nbsp;with 1.5% going ahead so they would have factored that in.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;I say because the economy&nbsp;has slid&nbsp;in the last few months, I shift the growth rate further down to 1% or 0%, I would have&nbsp;undermined the expectations of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an impact on people's lives&nbsp;if we cut the COE quota. &nbsp;What do you think will happen to the COE prices&nbsp;if I tightened&nbsp;and&nbsp;squeezed it?&nbsp;

My answer is yes, if we can do it, we would.&nbsp; Let me explain where we are now.&nbsp; I think in&nbsp;her speech&nbsp;she mentioned that in first world cities they have timetables.&nbsp; I visited London, I visited Australia and I asked the same question,&nbsp; "Where do you draw the line?"&nbsp; They draw the line in the same way, like us.&nbsp; They draw the line that they will give timetables at the bus stops when the bus arrival is not frequent.&nbsp; So you have to define a&nbsp;cut off&nbsp;&ndash; what do you mean by "not frequent".&nbsp; In Singapore we do it at 20 minutes, in London, it is about 12 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport for London cuts it at 12 minutes.&nbsp; Anything below 12 minutes, the timetable is the same like ours, they give the frequency range.&nbsp; So if you go to any of our bus stop today&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and mind you previously we did not have bus information panels at all our bus stops&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;now we have&nbsp;4,500 of them.&nbsp; If you go and have a look at it, there is a frequency range.&nbsp; So it tells you that the first bus is 6.24 am in the morning, for instance&nbsp;and in the morning peak periods, 6.30 to 8.30 am, the frequency would be from 10 to 12 minutes.&nbsp; So that is how they do it.&nbsp; When&nbsp;it is&nbsp;a frequent service, they give a frequency range.&nbsp; No difference from London.&nbsp; Now beyond that, when the headway is longer than 20 minutes, you then can give actual timing because when it is longer, the bus can adjust to be sure that they arrive, say, at 11.20 pm.&nbsp; That you can do.&nbsp; But when it is frequent, you cannot because if there is a traffic jam somewhere, you will miss that.&nbsp; So you tell people how frequent it is.&nbsp; Should we work towards tightening this further from 20 minutes?&nbsp; This is something that we will definitely&nbsp;look at.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> There is another concern on cycling and pedestrian walkway and cycling lanes that&nbsp;are introduced in the estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;when there is an accident between a pedestrian</p> <p align=left>Column: 3107<p><p>and a cyclist,&nbsp;where does the responsibility lie?&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the insurance coverage, how do you cover them?&nbsp;

This problem is further aggravated by the limited capacities of local law schools to train more lawyers. Facing a shortage of lawyers and increasing workload, the legal profession is experiencing work fatigue. This may ultimately have an adverse impact on the quality and professionalism of legal services. Sir, this situation is unhealthy, and calls for urgent action to increase the supply of lawyers to serve our community, economy, and the global market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans who are keen to study law have few opportunities to do so due to the limited number of places offered by NUS and SMU law schools. As a result, many have to go overseas to pursue their law degrees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to be a legal education hub, Singapore must offer quality and attractive law degree courses for both Singaporeans and overseas students. We should position our law degree courses to</p><p align=left>Column: 3112<p><p>be equal or if not,&nbsp;better than the top law schools in the world. Today, the&nbsp;four-year law degree courses of both NUS and SMU are not attractive in encouraging more students to join the legal profession as compared to law degrees offered elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NUS and SMU have&nbsp;embarked on a modular teaching system. Therefore, we should consider reviewing our local law degree courses to be a&nbsp;three-year law&nbsp;course comparable to the UK's Cambridge or Oxford law degrees. I wish to ask the Law Minister whether there are plans to review the law degree courses in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the last four decades, Singapore has developed a unique system of governance and public administration which has been regarded by many developing countries as role model. As such, there are lots of potential to develop Singapore into a legal education hub for budding lawyers and public administrators of these countries. In this regard, I would urge the Ministry to consider expanding the capacities of our local law schools or provide more opportunities for established foreign law schools to offer law degree courses in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I received feedback that the one-year compulsory diploma course in Singapore Law for returning overseas law graduates is a waste of time and resources. This requirement seems to be an "equal misery" arrangement to ensure that both local and overseas law graduates of the same cohort are called to the bar at the same time. The compulsory diploma course is inflexible, and serves as a barrier in encouraging more overseas law graduates to practise in Singapore.

Allow me to explain why.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November last year, the Chief Justice&nbsp;and Justice V K Rajah flew to London to visit Singaporean law students studying in the UK. The trip was organised by the Legal Service Commission Secretariat and its purpose was to reach out to and&nbsp;meet and inform the law students of law-related job opportunities here in Singapore. Private sector firms were invited to accompany the Chief Justice. I was the representative of Lee &amp; Lee. Various other firms also sent representatives. We had the opportunity to meet with close to 80 Singaporean students and 50 working professionals. They were candid about wanting to return to Singapore, fully intending to return&nbsp;but equally candid about how the&nbsp;one-year full time DipSing course was a major deterrent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I had&nbsp;spoken at the last COS, would&nbsp;MinLaw be open to removing the DipSing requirement for returning law students? Instead, returning law students could undergo training more relevant to practice, along the lines of a training contract. By&nbsp;fusing the DipSing and the current Practical Law Course into a one-year training contract, the returning law student&nbsp;receives his first pay cheque sooner,&nbsp;has greater incentive to return to Singapore and be a resource in our growing legal hub and&nbsp;studies areas of law relevant to practice, rather than repeating basic subjects he would have already covered at university&nbsp;even in his first year.&nbsp; This will also assist in meeting the increasing demand for more lawyers who have been called to the Singapore Bar.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 3114<p>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Legal Services</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Sir, as reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 5th April 2008, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong remarked,&nbsp;and I quote, "Singapore&rsquo;s lower courts may have been placed high in international rankings, but what matters is the quality of justice people here receive." CJ has called for greater access to justice, and emphasised that justice must be accessible to everyone. This is indeed a timely call for the legal profession to make justice accessible to all at affordable cost.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the majority of practising lawyers are involved in corporate services work, thus resulting in a shortage of lawyers in litigation work especially for criminal cases.

In the case of liberalisation of the legal profession, the situation&nbsp;still needs to be monitored carefully and fine-tune as appropriate to preserve the strength of the local bar and to ensure our home-grown law firms do not get hollowed out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, as regards to&nbsp;legal education.&nbsp; The present regime for local graduates, four years in university, six months of the vocational course and six months of pupilage should be revamped. The issue here is one of balance. The United Kingdom, long renowned for the excellence of its legal education, subject budding lawyers to a three-year degree course and then a one-year practice course and&nbsp;for those who inspire to be barristers or court lawyers, this is then followed by a one-year of pupilage in chambers. For would-be solicitors, they</p><p align=left>Column: 3116<p><p>do a two-year traineeship at the law firm.&nbsp; In other words, there&nbsp;is less purely academic study and a better to on-the-job practical training.&nbsp;In the United States, probably the most heavily lawyered nation in the world, law is a postgraduate qualification which means lawyers spend several years in the pursuit of non-legal studies and are thus considered to be more well-rounded and matured before they embark on the specialised calling of the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which system would work best for Singapore?&nbsp; I believe the British model has much to commend it.&nbsp; The cutting age transactions in mergers and acquisitions, dead oil, equity&nbsp;capital markets are lugged far more quickly and far more thoroughly in a real life setting rather than in academia where almost by definition, the study of such matters lags a few years behind.&nbsp; At the same time, the shorter three-year degree course will make it more accessible to those who wish to benefit it from the analytical training required through the study of law but who do not wish themselves to practise as lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning now to the liberalisation of legal practice, the issuance of six QFLP licences was ground-breaking. This would&nbsp;enable those licensed foreign firms to practise Singapore law. This in turn would help to widen the availability of&nbsp;top-notch legal services here and broaden the use&nbsp;and appeal of Singapore law.&nbsp; As a member of the committee chaired by the Justice of Appeal V K Rajah that proposed this&nbsp;measure which has been accepted by the&nbsp;Government, I do believe that&nbsp;it is the right step&nbsp;for the country.&nbsp; However, care must still be exercised and progress monitored to avoid the situation where our local law firms are stripped bare of the cream of&nbsp;Singapore legal talent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign law firms with their greater size and financial resources have the ability to cherry-pick&nbsp;up&nbsp;young lawyers</p><p align=left>Column: 3117<p><p>out of the local firms, the legal service and even right out of university.&nbsp; Yes, we need talent to devise the corporate deals that drive Singapore's financial sector.&nbsp; But we also need talent to become the next generation's judges, Attorney-Generals, Public Prosecutors and Ministers of Law. Such persons would not only possess the requisite legal acumen, but they would also be steep in&nbsp;our Singapore values and culture to act as a future guardian&nbsp;of our society.&nbsp; If all our top talent was hired away by foreign firms, subject to direction from New York, London or Hong Kong, perhaps even residing there, would we have the judicial system that is ranked at the top in most surveys of international competitiveness and is the envy of others?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to strengthen our local firms' ability to compete by offering financial and other incentives to upgrade themselves so that they can stand toe-to-toe with the best international firms. We need local companies including TLCs to give local firms a chance to compete.&nbsp; I emphasise that local firms must still prove themselves.&nbsp; Of course, we cannot simply have a "by Singaporean" edict.&nbsp; And if we need to, we should not be afraid to temper the pace of liberalisation.&nbsp;There is no turning back in terms of liberalising the legal profession in Singapore.&nbsp; But as with other policies of this Government, we should steer our own course at our own speed to achieve the best outcomes for Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Recognising Crime Victims' Rights</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, many countries now recognise that the&nbsp;criminal justice system focuses too much on the offender and how he should be punished.&nbsp; By contrast, the victim is a pawn&nbsp;in the process.&nbsp; He is to cooperate with the State to participate in Police investigations and later to give evidence in court.&nbsp; He often gets no </p><p align=left>Column: 3118<p><p>compensation for losses, pays for his own medical treatment and suffers inconvenience during case processing.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address this, the United Nations, in 1985, adopted the declaration of basic principles of justice for victims of crimes and use of power. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, amongst others, have since changed their domestic laws in line with this declaration. There has also been growth in victim studies and victimology movements, not only in the western world, but also in Asian countries like Japan. The focus of these efforts is towards giving the victim more voice in the case process and some redress for the wrongs suffered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crime victims in Singapore suffer similarly.&nbsp; I believe it is timely to consider how we can ensure that the victims' concerns and rights are systematically addressed. One suggestion is for the Police to routinely ask crime victims if he or she wishes to make a victim personal statement (VPS) which is practised in countries like the United Kingdom. This is not the same as the witness statement where the victim states how the crime took place.&nbsp; Rather, the VPS focuses on the victim, how the crime has affected the victim's life, what safety concerns he or she now has, whether physical or emotional support is needed or whether he or she wishes to be kept informed of the process and important decisions made in the case. Such a statement would then be kept on the file and at the relevant stages of the case, the victim's views can be presented. For example, the victim's fear of the offender causing harm can be surfaced at the bail hearing.&nbsp; Key decisions by prosecution such as reduction of charges should be informed and explained to the victim.&nbsp; As the case proceeds, the sentencing judge can also refer to the statement to assess the seriousness of the offence by looking at the harm suffered by the victim.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3119<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently victims often do not get compensation. The Chief Justice recently called for the courts to re-activate the compensation order provisions to ensure that victims can benefit. To increase the likelihood of such orders being made, the VPS can document exactly what losses have been caused by the offender with some supporting evidence. Their statement can then be easily referred to by the judge to calculate an appropriate sum for an order of compensation from the accused person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has used victim impact statements for several years but only in a small minority of cases usually where the prosecutors instruct the Police to record them.&nbsp; This is very limited as it does not address victim's concerns early in the case. We should look at how the system can be improved to systematically recognise victims' rights rather than take ad-hoc approaches. I hope the Ministry can seriously study the progress made by other countries in giving victims a better deal under the criminal justice system.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Legal Status of the Right to Vote and Entrenchment</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, we live in unquiet times and need a sense of rootedness to steady us as we navigate the choppy waters ahead.&nbsp;In a crisis, do we respond with flight or fight?

Only the most important rights or interests are constitutionalised and receive maximum legal protection as part of the supreme law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to vote is not an ancillary or new-fangled right; it is fundamental and long-established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In discussing fundamental rights, the 1966 Constitutional Commission specifically highlighted the right to vote: as one deserving to be cherished as an inalienable right.&nbsp;&nbsp;An inalienable right is not a boon from the state; instead, it inheres in the individual and the state is bound to secure it, to enable its realisation.&nbsp; The</p> <p align=left>Column: 3121<p><p>right to vote inheres in individuals living in a democratic state. Our courts have affirmed that fundamental liberties are recognised as inalienable rights "to the extent that the Constitution is supreme".<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in Singapore's salad days, the Constitutional Commission considered it "necessary and wise" to constitutionally entrench the right to vote, and to provide that this could only be removed by a two-thirds vote at a national referendum. This was to make it difficult to change.&nbsp; What is fundamental is not frequently amended.&nbsp;When something is given constitutional status, this has an educative effect as this status underscores the importance of the right or interest entrenched. It communicates fundamental values to the polity. Unfortunately, the Constitutional Commission's recommendation to entrench the right to vote apparently was not given explicit form.&nbsp;Expressly entrenching our right to vote would accentuate our responsibilities as citizens in choosing good governors.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal status of the right to vote is unclear for two main reasons.&nbsp;First, the High Court made an odd, fairly disturbing obiter statement in Taw Cheng Kong v PP [1998] 1 SLR 943 at 965. In contrasting fundamental liberties against carrot and stick privileges which the legislature may confer or withhold as a matter of political will, the judge seemed to indicate that these privileges included "subsidies or the right to vote." The term 'privilege' connotes a lesser interest which warrants less legal protection than a 'right'. This is alarming as one might interpret this as reading down the right to vote to a statutory interest, which any ordinary Act can repeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, our right to vote cannot depend upon legislative will?&nbsp; This would place something so basic on too tenuous a footing, for what Parliament gives, Parliament can take away.<br> <I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as the Constitution contains no express right to vote, some might</p> <p align=left>Column: 3122<p><p>argue this right is contained in the Parliamentary Elections Act. If so, the right to vote is merely statutory, which does not afford it much protection. If so, the remedy would be to accord the right to vote constitutional status, to affirm its primary importance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I understand the Parliamentary Elections Act as not being a source of voting rights; this statute does not constitute or create the right to vote. Rather, it facilitates elections by identifying who the People are for voting purposes, in maintaining a register of electors, and by regulating the conduct of elections. It does not create an entitlement to vote, merely secures it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we argue that the Constitutional text is not exhaustive, that rights may be implied from it? Certainly, our courts have found and declared unwritten constitutional principles, such as the separation of powers and rule of law.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courts in jurisdictions with Westminster based Constitutions have found implied basic rights to political communication, these were considered embedded in the Constitution which established government based on representative democracy.&nbsp; Our own local jurisprudence provides some support for the idea of unenumerated or implied rights. One could argue there is an implicit right to a judicial remedy embedded in Article 93, the judicial power clause. The courts have affirmed their role in declaring unconstitutional exercises of government power invalid.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might argue that implied voting rights may be derived from the system of parliamentary democracy the Constitution establishes, that this was a historical "given" in such political systems; further, that representative democracy remains a normatively desirable form of accountable government, compared to dictatorships and juntas.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> <p align=left>Column: 3123<p>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the Attorney-General appeared to hold this opinion. When this House debated whether voting was a right or duty in May 2001, the AG's opinion was that the right to vote for elections was "implied within the structure of our Constitution". &nbsp;This frames our "parliamentary form of government". In providing for regular general elections, the Constitution established "representative democracy in Singapore", to which the right to vote was considered "fundamental". &nbsp;The Parliamentary Elections Act gave effect to this implied right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, this indicates that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right, implemented by Statute. It was implied, of necessity, from Article 66 which requires the relevant actors to ensure General Elections are held within&nbsp;three months after Parliament is dissolved.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 66 embodies a constitutional commitment to representative democracy and obliges the Government to ensure that elections are held within the stipulated time-frame; from this, the citizen's right to vote is inferred. &nbsp;Article 66 is not formulated as an individual voting right. &nbsp;There is a difference between a state obligation and a fundamental liberty.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Attorney-General's opinion is authoritative, it is not determinative under our system of separation of powers.&nbsp; The final say belongs to the courts.&nbsp; In the interests of clarity, would the Minister consider invoking the Article 100 process which allows for constitutional questions to be put to a tribunal to obtain an advisory opinion?&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better still, to affirm and underscore the workings of our system of </p><p align=left>Column: 3124<p><p>representative democracy, would the Minister consider taking the desirable step to amend the Constitution to expressly entrench the right to vote in the Fundamental Liberties Chapter?&nbsp; This would put its legal status beyond the shadow of a doubt and underscore who the right-holder is&nbsp;&ndash; we, the Citizens of Singapore. &nbsp;In addition, while the Constitution provides for regular elections, it does not guarantee direct elections, secret voting or universal equal suffrage. Such details are basic and should be succinctly expressed in a constitutional voting clause, not left to Statute.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a clause could be accompanied by an associated duty to vote responsibly by exerting sober reason and conscience. Would the Minister consider amending the Constitution to include this important political right?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some might consider this issue merely symbolic, a luxury we can ill-afford because of the&nbsp;current economic exigencies. However, I would argue that this is basic, foundational, fundamental to our political order; it is a necessity, not a luxury.&nbsp; Ever conscious of the dominant pragmatic mindset, my plea is that in an Age of Democracy, this is the one issue where symbols ought to count.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutionally entrenching the right to vote as a citizen's right will more fully vindicate the ideal and reality of representative democracy. It will strongly indicate to Singaporeans that we are stakeholders in this nation, with all the responsibilities of ownership and upkeep, serving the common good.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expressly constitutionalising the right to vote has both symbolic and practical significance.&nbsp; We need to be very sure our fundamentals, whether economic, social or political in dimension, are sound. It is always good to shore up the foundations of the House, before the hurricane strikes.<br><p align=left>Column: 3125<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I trust the right to vote is considered fundamental. It is democracy's most potent symbol; it gives concrete, tangible expression to the democratic spirit upon which our constitutional order rests. In a democracy, the people are King or sovereign. Every citizen has a voice and her choice for governor is articulated through the vote as an empowering tool. This tool must be protected as a fundamental constitutional right.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the hardware of providing for a fundamental right affects the heartware of the right-holder. As we approach our Jubilee in 2015, let us, the descendents of lion-hearted pioneers, move ahead as one united sovereign people, each carrying our little slice of sovereignty, our right to vote,&nbsp;the badge of our citizenship.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Sir, affirming the constitutional status of this right or otherwise taking steps to ensure it, will not cost very much.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Professional Qualifications</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Sir, at present, holders of Second Lower Honours or equivalent law degrees from scheduled Universities who were full-time internal candidates must fulfil a two-year legal work requirement in order to qualify to practise law in Singapore.&nbsp; I ask that this two-year requirement be abolished.&nbsp; These students should only be required to meet the same conditions that apply to overseas law students who have obtained First Class or&nbsp;Second Class Upper Honours.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because we should let the market forces recognise talent.&nbsp; I have practised law in the Legal Service and in the private sector with lawyers who obtained Second Lower Honours.&nbsp; I have found their work&nbsp;exceptional, deserving of recognition and promotion.

I spoke about it last year.&nbsp; The regulations have since been amended to allow foreign firms to enter the marketplace and practise Singapore law in certain areas.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But since then, the world economy has taken a turn and lawyers in the United States, United Kingdom and other countries are losing their jobs by the thousands.&nbsp; So under-supply of lawyers in Singapore may not be a problem in the short or medium-term.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, there is still reason to fine-tune our admission criteria to make it more rational and responsive to the circumstances. &nbsp;The rationale for identifying and limiting qualified universities was to a large extent, to ensure quality control.&nbsp; But we are, in fact, placing quality control in the hands of foreign universities who determine what class of honours to confer and therefore who gets to practise law in Singapore, either immediately or after a two-year stint.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I repeat my call last year to do away with these incremental changes to our admission criteria. To use a person's academic results to determine his ability to qualify is at best a blunt and, sometimes, unfair instrument.&nbsp; There are many good lawyers in practice who may not be qualified or qualified immediately under the current criteria. If the quality of education is an issue, we should control standards ourselves and simplify the whole process.&nbsp; In this regard, I agree that we should get rid of the DipSing programme.&nbsp; What we should do is to have a common practice law course and examination for all graduates, local or </p><p align=left>Column: 3127<p><p>foreign, and the standard of the examination will ensure the quality.&nbsp; And those who have the right quality should have no concern passing this examination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the same time, we should also ensure a level-playing field for local and foreign graduates.&nbsp; Many foreign law schools have three-year law degrees while our local law school is a four-year law degree. The system we implement should not enable a foreign graduate to be admitted quicker than a local graduate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the issue of reciprocity and fairness.&nbsp; Many legal systems are closed to foreigners and foreign graduates, including Singaporeans. While we open up our country and our legal market to foreigners, it must be on the basis that their home countries are similarly open to us. I therefore hope that the Minister will ensure a level-playing field in any scheme to allow foreign lawyers to practise law in Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;Ms Ellen Lee, you may take your two cuts together.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Legal Aid</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Sir, when the monthly income ceiling was last raised in 2007, more people qualified for legal aid.&nbsp; Some legally-aided litigants in matrimonial proceedings have actually abused the policy of not having party-and-party cost ordered against them, to insist on contentious proceedings to improve their stakes in claiming&nbsp;custody and care/control of children, maintenance for the wife and children and the division of matrimonial flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;By refusing to settle at appropriate junctures, although it is their prerogative to insist on a trial,&nbsp;doing so would inflict cost injuries for their spouses as well as their own assigned lawyers whose fees are fixed, especially when the final judgment was not in their favour.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3128<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the Ministry consider:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;allowing recovery of party-and-party cost from such Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) applicants;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; allowing LAB or its assigned lawyers to recover from such applicants an extra fee commensurate with the time taken in the proceedings;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; having fixed periodical reviews of the means of qualified applicants whose fortunes may have changed for the better in the course of or after the court proceedings are over.&nbsp; This will result in better management for public resources and litigants' expectations; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; in&nbsp;intestacy cases&nbsp;where there are minor beneficiaries, to lift the requirement that a co-administrator must also satisfy the means testing when the co-administrator is often not a beneficiary but was just being helpful.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Community Mediation</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Mediation Centres (CMCs) have been in existence and in operation since January 1998.&nbsp; CMCs have been useful in settling disputes which would otherwise have to go the normal litigation route.&nbsp; However, increasingly, my residents are complaining that their disputes cannot be resolved because their neighbours refuse to go for mediation, especially&nbsp; in cases involving noise, dirty laundry, high-rise litter and the encroachment of space.

With this increase in the jurisdictional limits, I am concerned whether the Small Claims Tribunal is able to cope with the likely increase in workload. Does the Ministry of Law allocate enough resources to the Small Claims Tribunal by supplying them with more mediators, referees and other support staff? Would there be a slowdown in the level of services to be provided to the consumers if there are inadequate resources?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me declare my interest in speaking as a practising advocator and solicitor.&nbsp; I understand that last year, the Subordinate Courts handled more than</p><p align=left>Column: 3130<p><p>86,150 civil cases and 249,540 criminal cases. I also notice that there are occasions where more than 60 cases are placed before a Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp; For example, last Sunday, when I checked last Monday's list of cases for hearings, the ADCR, at 2.30 pm on Monday, showed 93 cases before one Deputy Registrar and 84 cases before another Deputy Registrar on Wednesday at 2.30 pm. If at one minute per case, it will still take 1.5 hours for the last case to be cleared.&nbsp; Any practising lawyer in Chambers will tell you that it takes at least three minutes to even seek a simple by consent adjournment. This has resulted in long waits by lawyers waiting to see the Deputy Registrar.&nbsp; I understand that it is not uncommon for lawyers to wait up to one hour or more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the Government has pledged to provide service excellence to members of the public, may I know whether the Ministry could allocate more resources to the courts so that the courts can endeavour to reduce waiting time for lawyers as well?&nbsp; It will certainly alleviate the work fatigue for lawyers which the hon.
