<div align="center"><b>TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I elaborate on the provisions of this

Bill,   may  I  give  a  brief  summary   of   the

background?    Prior   to   April,    1972,    the

Telecommunications  Department  was  a  Government

department  providing  external  telecommunication

services while the Singapore Telephone Board was a

Statutory    organisation    providing    domestic

telephone services. With very high rates of growth

and fast changing technology in communications, it

was clear that radical changes in the organisation

and  management  were required to  cope  with  the

developments and challenges in the years ahead. An

expert  from  the International Telecommunications

Union was therefore invited to advise the Ministry

on the reorganisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



of   the   telecommunication  services   and   his

recommendation  was  that  the  Telecommunications

Department  should be converted into  a  statutory

organisation. This recommendation was accepted and

implemented   on   1st  April,  1972,   with   the

Telecommunications Department becoming a statutory

body  known as the Telecommunication Authority  of

Singapore (TAS).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to provide for the second stage

of  reorganisation,  namely,  the  merger  of  the

Singapore     Telephone     Board     with     the

Telecommunication Authority of  Singapore  into  a

single   organisation   to   be   known   as   the

Telecommunication  Authority  of  Singapore   (new

TAS),    i.e, both   domestic   and    external

telecommunications are to work as one and  not  as

two separate entities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the main features of this

Bill.   The   Bill   essentially   re-enacts   the

provisions  of the Singapore Telephone  Board  Act

and  the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore

Act, 1972, both of which will be repealed. The new

TAS shall consist of a Chairman, a General Manager

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



not  less than five and not more than seven  other

members  all  of  whom shall be appointed  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS shall have the exclusive privilege of

operating   telecommunication  services   in   the

Republic and, in addition to the functions of  the

existing  TAS, the new TAS will also  perform  the

functions  of the STB. There are pro, visions  for

the appointment of staff and the appointment of  a

General  Manager.  The General Manager  is  to  be

appointed  by  the TAS with the  approval  of  the

Minister  and  will  be  chief  executive  of  the

organisation.  The persons presently  employed  by

the STB or TAS shall be transferred to the service

of the new TAS on the same terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS will be empowered to raise funds by

the  issue  of stocks or loans from banks  and  to

levy  charges, rates and fees. The  new  TAS  will

acquire the existing assets and liabilities of the

STB and TAS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS has power to acquire land and to

enter   upon   land  for  the   purpose   of   its

installations, and compensation is payable for the

exercise of such powers. The accounts of  the  new

TAS shall he audited by the Auditor-General or  by

an   auditor   appointed  by   the   Minister   in

consultation with the Auditor-General. The audited

accounts  as  well as the annual report  shall  be

presented to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS will be commanding substantial

manpower   of  over  5,000  staff  and   financial

resources  exceeding $150 million in annual  gross

revenue.  With  such resources and  an  integrated

organisation,   we   can  expect   more   vigorous

development,  increase  in efficiency  and  higher

quality  of telecommunication services. To  ensure

that  our  Republic will continue to be a  leading

communication centre, the new TAS will continually

keep  abreast of latest technological  innovations

and  developments. Hon. Members may wish  to  note

that  a  five-year  development programme  costing

more  than $560 million has already been  prepared

for implementation by the new TAS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to add

that all necessary steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



have  been  taken to ensure that the  merger  will

proceed  as smoothly as possible, and an extensive

internal reorganisation has already been put  into

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there are instances where occupants of offices and

commercial   buildings   which   are   ready   for

occupation  have  to  wait  for  months  for   the

provision of telephone services. Clause 6  of  the

Bill  says that it shall be the function and  duty

of  the Authority to provide, operate and maintain

a  good  and sufficient telecommunication service,

and  also  to promote the economic development  of

the  telecommunication service in accordance  with

public  demand. I also note that clause 6 (1)  (f)

provides   for   the   further   advancement    of

telecommunication technology and  the  development

of  telecommunication in Singapore in co-operation

with the broadcasting and television authority and

tertiary technical institutions. I would  like  to

see closer co-ordination and also streamlining  of

the  administrative structure of the Authority  to

ensure  that this long wait for telephone services

is  avoided.  As we know, in the past the  reasons

usually given to applicants for the long wait  are

either there are no spare lines available or there

is  a  shortage  of  equipment. Because  of  this,

commercial  premises  without  telephone  services

are, therefore, in many cases left unoccupied  for

months  because they are unsuitable  for  business

operations  although they are  certified  fit  for

occupation  in  every  respect.  I  am  sure   the

Minister will agree that this state of affairs  is

obviously undesirable because it means a waste  of

usable  facilities  and  also  a  restriction   of

commercial activities. I would, therefore, like to

see  this  part  of  the administrative  structure

streamlined in the new Authority.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the

hon. Member for Kim Keat that all efforts will  be

exerted  towards closer co-ordination between  the

various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



parties concerned to ensure speedy installation of

the necessary telephone services. But I would like

the Member to note that the increase in the number

of  telephones  installed has  been  averaging  at

about  14 per cent per annum. This is a very  high

rate of growth compared with the world average  of

about 8 per cent. So it is sometimes difficult  to

meet   immediate  demands  and   some   delay   is

unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - (Dr Ang Kok Peng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee: reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is now

responsible  for  administering the  Environmental

Public Health Act (Cap. 155). Prior to the setting

up  of this Ministry, the Act was administered  by

the  Ministry  of Health, and the Commissioner  of

Public    Health   was   responsible    for    its

administration subject to the supervision  of  the

Public  Health Authority established under section

3   of   the  Act.  The  Public  Health  Authority

comprises the Director of Medical Services and the

Deputy  Director of Medical Services of the Public

Health  Division, Ministry of Health.  Both  these

offices are no longer directly concerned with  the

administration  of  the  Act.  It  is,  therefore,

necessary  to  delete  all  references   to   "the

Authority" in the Act and for the Commissioner  of

Public   Health   to   be  responsible   for   the

administration   of  the  Act   subject   to   the

directions of the Minister for the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to make other

amendments to the Act which have become necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to resite street hawkers into

premises  including  eating  establishments.   The

powers  of the Commissioner should be extended  to

the    control    of    hawkers    within    these

establishments, i.e, hawkers and stalls in  coffee

shops  including  those in  HDB  estates  will  he

licensed  directly. Provision  is  also  made  for

ticketing  of unlicensed stallholders and  seizure

of  stalls,  appliances  and  goods  belonging  to

unlicensed    stall-holders    in    the    eating

establishments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present definition of "premises" in the Act

requires   amendment  to  enable  prosecution   of

unlicensed  hawkers of any goods,  including  food

and  drinks,  who  operate in public  places  like

parks and car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for more effective control of food

handlers  in  food  establishments  and  at   food

stalls,  the  Act  requires  amendment  to  permit

ticketing of offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadequate capacity, inept operation, poor

maintenance  and  consequent  breakdown  of   air-conditioning  plants in places frequented  by  the

public  such as hotels, cinemas, offices, shopping

complexes  and  restaurants pose a  public  health

problem. The Commissioner of Public Health should,

therefore,   be   empowered  to  require   owners,

occupiers or licensees of such buildings  to  take

necessary  measures  to  ensure  that   the   air-conditioning system is functioning properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "public health auxiliary"

requires    amendment   consequential    to    the

redesignation   of  the  post  of  Public   Health

Assistants  which  is now titled Assistant  Public

Health Inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to delete repetitions of the

definition  of "public health officer" in  several

sections  of  the  Act  and  to  insert  a  single

definition  in  section 2 of the  Act  which  will

apply throughout the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>NEWSPAPER AND PRINTING PRESSES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Printing Presses Act was originally enacted

in   1920.  Various  amendments,  as  were   found

necessary have, since then, been made to the  Act,

the  last  one  being  in  1970.  Experience  has,

however, shown that the provisions of the Act  are

still inadequate, particularly in relation to  the

sections concerning the publication of newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a permit is still required for the

printing  or  publication of a  newspaper,  recent

events  have shown that it is possible for foreign

elements  to  gain control of our newspapers,  and

use  them  for their own ends against our national

interest.  There  is, therefore, need  to  further

amend  and  update  this Act to  meet  present-day

requirements. Under the provisions of the existing

Act,  as it stands today, foreign interests  could

obtain  control  of  any  newspaper  printed   and

published  in  Singapore.  This  is  obviously  an

unhealthy situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, 1971, for example, the "Eastern Sun", an

English    language    newspaper    closed    down

voluntarily, following exposure by the  Government

of  its  having received subventions amounting  to

nearly  HK$8 million from a Communist intelligence

agency   in  Hong-kong.  The  "Singapore  Herald",

another English language newspaper, which was also

financed   with   funds  from   foreign   sources,

conducted a campaign to mis-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



lead the  people  of  Singapore  especially   the

English-educated. The Government  had,  therefore,

in 1971, to withdraw its publication permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be failing in our duty and

responsibility to the people of Singapore,  if  we

do not protect our citizens from the manipulations

of   subversive  or  hostile  elements,  operating

through  our  newspapers. Although newspapers  are

commercial  organisations,  they  have  a  special

responsibility to the society they cater for. They

have  a  duty to always bear in mind their  social

and political obligations because, as a medium  of

communication,  their influence  can  be  crucial.

Singapore, therefore, cannot allow foreign control

of  any  of its newspapers, that is to say,  those

overseas  who may seek to manipulate or  influence

public  opinion  through  this  media.  We  cannot

afford  to have "black operations" mounted against

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Bill before us is,

therefore,  to  make a substantial change  of  the

Printing Presses Act to ensure that newspapers are

not  used as instruments of subversion. Precaution

must  be taken to prevent the newspaper from being

used  to  poison  the  minds  of  its  readers  by

reporting  news  in a biased way or  to  reproduce

propaganda  material  "lifted"  or  cut  out  from

newspapers controlled by foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, while it is necessary to ensure that control

of  our  newspapers remain in  the  hands  of  our

citizens,  the Government also does  not  wish  to

upset   the  commercial  operations  of  newspaper

companies,  or  intervene  in  the  market  forces

determining   the  value  of  their   shares.   We

certainly do not want to get involved in the  day-to-day  running of newspapers. Management will  be

free  to  operate  the  newspapers  as  commercial

enterprises, provided they ensure that there is no

manipulation  by  foreign  elements  and  that  no

attempt is made by them, or through their proxies,

to     glorify    undesirable    viewpoints    and

philosophies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is against this backdrop that

I  have  introduced  the  Newspaper  and  Printing

Presses Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

The  Bill  seeks  to re-enact, with  additions  or

amendments,  certain provisions  of  the  Printing

Presses  Act  (Chapter 258). I do not  propose  to

take the House through the entire Bill, clause  by

clause,   as  many  of  the  provisions  are   re-enactments  of  the existing Act.  I  would  like,

however, to touch on some of the salient points of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permits will still be required for the printing

and  publication of newspapers, but all  newspaper

companies will have to go public, unless there  is

some  special  difficulty, perhaps on  account  of

size  in going public. In such cases, the Minister

will be empowered to grant special exemptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All newspapers will have to be locally managed;

the  members of the Board of Management will  have

to be Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newspaper company, there will be two

classes  of shares, namely, management shares  and

ordinary shares. There is, no restriction  to  the

ownership  of ordinary shares; however, the  issue

and  transfer of management shares must  have  the

approval  of the Minister, and such approval  will

only be given to citizens of Singapore, or to such

corporations which have been granted  approval  by

the Minister. This arrangement is necessary, since

the  total voting rights of the management  shares

is greater than that of the ordinary shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreign investments injected into the

newspaper  must have the approval of the Minister;

this  is to ensure that the Government is not kept

in  the  dark  as  regards the real  ownership  of

capital  of  newspapers. In this way, we  will  be

able   to  ensure  that  the  management  of   the

newspapers  will  always be in the  hands  of  our

citizens, and the policies also determined by  our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be appreciated that ample notice has been

given   to  the  newspapers  of  the  Government's

intention to make major Singapore newspapers to go

public  -  in fact, that indication was  given  as

early  as January last year. However, in order  to

ensure that there will be adequate opportunity for

all interested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

parties   to  air  their  views  and   make   such

representation  as they might deem necessary,  the

Government  has  decided to send this  Bill  to  a

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, it is not the intention

of  Government to interfere unduly in the  affairs

of the Press. The sole purpose is to safeguard our

national  interest  and  the  well-being  of   our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the main provisions of the

Bill  to  make it law that all Singapore  citizens

can  have  a  right to fashion the policy  of  the

newspaper. This is in line with the argument  that

if  one's survival depends on keeping the boat  on

an   even  keel  as  it  charts  its  way  through

unpredictable seas, then it is in the interest  of

that   person  not  to  provoke  any  kind  of   a

disequilibrium of the boat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore context, Sir, a responsible

newspaper  is a critical factor in the  well-being

of  the nation. The newspaper provides information

upon  which members of our society conduct intense

communication among themselves, between themselves

and  the  Government, form impressions,  construct

convictions  and make decisions. It is imperative,

therefore,  as far as is reasonably  possible  and

democratically feasible, that news and information

offered  by  the  newspaper are  responsible  news

resulting  from  the responsible policies  of  the

management  comprising  responsible  citizens   of

Singapore, whose stakes are in this country and in

this  country  only. In a world of  super  powers,

super   nationalisms  and  monolithic   commercial

organisations, Sir, which contend  for  power  and

profit,  Singapore  is  a consideration  in  their

strategy of operations, and in my view the  sooner

we  rise up to this fact, the sooner will we begin

to ensure our own national security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support, Sir, the committal of this Bill

to Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the whole intention of this Bill may

be  summed up in one sentence, that is, in  future

newspapers  in  Singapore  will  only  be  run  by

Singapore  citizens  with the  permission  of  the

Minister in charge. As the Bill stands, the  whole

spirit  of the Bill lies in Part III, which  gives

the  Minister  very extensive powers, particularly

in clause 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of directors on the board must be

approved  by the Minister. But the Bill  does  not

provide  how  any  citizen  of  Singapore  can  be

approved  by  the  Minister  to  be  a  holder  of

management  shares.  It  does  not  say   how   an

application is to be made, whether it should be on

a specified form or whether it is to be by letter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of funds, of course, we can

prevent  a local newspaper from obtaining  foreign

sources  of  finance. But we  cannot  control  the

content  of the newspapers, and therefore  we  may

not prevent incidents similar to what had happened

before, and certain undesirable events may  happen

again.  We have seen incidents in Sri Lanka  which

were  mainly  due  to newspaper  influences.  Now,

there  are embassies and consulates in our  midst,

and   they   can   pay  substantial   amounts   on

advertisements to publicise through the newspapers

any  article of a political content, such  as  how

great a certain political machinery or thought is,

what  it  has produced, and what a great personage

the ruler is, etc. This is very dangerous. Once we

have  diplomatic  relations with  more  countries,

more  embassies and consulates will be set  up  in

Singapore,  and every one of them  can  by  paying

advertisement  charges  publicise  in  our   local

newspapers  as  to  how  great  are  their   great

political  leaders, how good are  their  political

systems, and so on. Under such circumstances, with

a multi-racial setup as ours, would it be good for

Singapore?  They can carry across  their  messages

through such advertisements and publicity  in  our

newspapers.    Even   underground   agencies    or

undesirable  elements can also  make  use  of  the

newspapers  to convey their message if  they  want

to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister has said in his speech that

the  intention  of  the Bill  is  to  ensure  that

newspapers  in Singapore will in future  be  under

the  control  of Singapore citizens, but  it  also

does  not  wish to upset the commercial operations

of   newspaper   companies.   But   a   commercial

establishment  does  not usually  care  very  much

about  politics, social conscience  or  any  other

thing except profits. So a newspaper can publicise

articles to suit some people with ulterior motive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now refer to clause 11 of Part III. This

applies   only  to  any  newspaper  published   at

intervals not exceeding one week. In other  words,

if a newspaper is published less than once a week,

say,  every  eight days, once a month  or  longer,

such   a  newspaper  can  be  exempted  from   the

provisions of this Part. If that is the case, then

the  purpose  of this Bill may be defeated.  So  I

hope   this  aspect  of  the  Bill  will  be  well

considered by the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the management shares being in the hands of

our  citizens,  as  I  have pointed  out,  certain

publicity can still go through the newspaper,  and

they  may  not effectively exercise their  control

through  the means as provided. Now there  is  the

suggestion  of establishing a Press  Council,  and

the  Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken about

it.  Perhaps  this Press Council can provide  some

guidance  for  the newspapers. However,  with  all

these  provisions, anybody, including a journalist

or  a  citizen, if he wants to, can still exercise

subversive influence through the newspaper.  So  I

hope the Select Committee can look into this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support, in principle, the introduction of

this  Bill. I think it is unquestionable that  the

spirit and intention of the Bill is good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would just like to add my own comments

on what I feel are the important points. There are

provisions in this Bill for reference to  be  made

to  the  Minister, and giving the Minister certain

powers  to  decide. This is, I  am  sure,  a  good

point.  But  what I would caution  as  a  possible

reaction is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



a decision of the Minister might be interpreted as

partial  or  biased at times. I  do  not  wish  to

question the Minister on this point, but I am just

suggesting  that  the  number  of  references   or

provisions allowing reference to the Minister  may

by  itself create a problem and misinterpretation.

I  think it is important for us to realise that in

Singapore today we have a great desire and a  need

for a constructive and responsible press. This  is

one laudable objective. The second is that we have

to  ensure  and provide for adequate  measures  to

prevent  subversive activities  or  subversion  in

Singapore  through the mass media.  To  meet  this

end, this Bill is appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that there is a

possible  side effect of this Bill. But it  is  my

hope  that the measures contained in the Bill will

not lead to a curbing of genuine public expression

to  the  extent  of stifling a healthy  debate  on

issues  of  national  and  international  interest

through the mass media. I think this point has  to

be  taken  very seriously and I am sure  that  the

Hon.  Minister  has this point  in  mind  when  he

decided to commit this Bill to a public hearing. I

give him my whole-hearted support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and reservation, I wish to

express  once  again my support for the  Newspaper

and Printing Presses Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I fully support this  Bill.  In  my

view,  this Bill is one way to deal with the entry

of  "devils" and "demons" from foreign  countries,

as our cultural ballast is too weak at the moment.

We  can  still see newspapers glorifying the  fads

and    fetishes    of   the   West,    emphasising

individualism.  While some girls wear  mini-skirts

to  show  off  their thighs without any  sense  of

shame, others wear the maxis which are long enough

to  drag  along  the road, without realising  that

their  skirts will be dirtied. All these fads  and

fetishes  and  fashions have been  played  up  and

glorified through the medium of the newspapers. On

the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



hand,  we  can also see the relics of conservatism

and  feudalistic colours from the East. I  do  not

know why the newspapers should always publish full-page  advertisements in glorification of the  dead

in  the  oriental  tradition. I do  not  know  the

actual  meaning behind all this. If this state  of

affairs is allowed to continue, it will perpetuate

the    contradictions,    anomalies    and    even

anachronisms  in Singapore. All these anachronisms

and   contradictions  can  be  made  use  of   and

exploited  by  ambitious  elements  from   foreign

sources,  as pointed out by the Minister  when  he

said that there was an attempt at exploitation  of

newspapers through black operations. But  for  the

timely   decision  taken  to  deal  with  such   a

situation, I am afraid the stability of Singapore,

and even this House, would have changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a country like Singapore, which is

subject  to foreign influences, we must  build  up

our  own  culture  through  a  selection  of  good

foreign  cultural influences. Of course,  this  is

easier said than done. It is, therefore, necessary

to  institute measures such as those  provided  in

this  Bill, introduced by the Minister.  In  other

words, this Bill seeks to transfer the control  of

the  newspapers from some private hands  into  the

hands  of  Singapore citizens. By these  means  we

would  be able to resist the interference by  some

ambitious foreign elements. Furthermore, I  should

also  point  out  that  when a  private  newspaper

enterprise  is  controlled by  a  small  group  of

people,  the  journalists  are  already  known  to

suffer  badly. Newspaper business is a  profitable

one.  The leading Chinese newspapers make millions

of  dollars' profit per annum, but the journalists

in  such newspaper establishments, i.e, those  who

have  to  crack their heads and rack their brains,

have not been properly remunerated. They have also

not been allowed to have a share in the profits of

the  business. As the Member for Delta has pointed

out,  we  should be able to improve the conditions

of service of the journalists in Singapore through

the  establishment of a Press Council or any  such

body.  Only then will journalists in Singapore  be

able  to  do  a  better job  in  the  service  and

interest of our nation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



and   also   to  enrich  our  cultural   heritage.

Therefore,  in view of this, I fully support  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to

propose  to  the  Government that apart  from  the

negative  approach to control by  getting  rid  of

undesirable influences, we should also  adopt  the

positive  approach  for support  of  our  cultural

development. For example, the Ministry of  Culture

is  now publishing the Mirror and also a radio and

television magazine. However, I do not think  this

is  adequate.  Therefore, apart  from  the  annual

reports,  which  are inadequate, other  Government

Ministries   and  statutory  bodies  should   also

publish magazines containing materials of cultural

value,  including biographies.  I  would  like  to

quote  one  example. Today I read a short  article

which  reminds  me of a certain reputable  person,

the  late  Mr  Lee Kong Chian. He  was  a  man  of

praiseworthy ambition and exemplary conduct. He is

an  example of a national asset. Although I cannot

hope  to do what he had done, I can at least  look

up  to  the ideals of his achievements. Therefore,

we  must try to record his words and deeds in some

kind of publication so that Singapore citizens can

learn  from  him.  This is  what  I  mean  by  the

adoption  of a positive approach as distinct  from

the negative approach to control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that we must also adopt the

positive  approach  by  giving  support   to   the

encouragement    of   a   constructive    cultural

development in our nation building. In this way we

will  be  able  to strengthen and consolidate  our

cultural  front  in the task of  nation  building.

Then  it will not be so easy for our people to  be

influenced by foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would reiterate my support for

this   Bill  and  its  committal  to  the   Select

Committee for further consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Culture has just

introduced the Second Reading of the Newspaper and

Printing  Presses  Bill, and I fully  support  him

from the bottom of my heart. Sir, the introduction

of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



Bill  is  the very natural reflection  of  certain

aspects  of  life  in Singapore. Some  people  may

associate this Bill with some kind of interference

or  control  of  the  freedom  of  the  press.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in a country like Singapore  which

practises democracy, the freedom of the press  is,

of  course,  a  matter of tradition.  But  if  the

people are to assume that the freedom of the press

is  something separate from the national interest,

then  it  is  not a healthy belief. No matter  how

sincere  the  directors or managers of  newspapers

may be and although they are without any political

blots, it does not mean that their newspapers will

be  free from outside influence or unblemished  as

the directors and management personnel themselves.

We  have  experienced attempts at black operations

in  the  past. Black operations have  come  to  be

associated with the publication of news.  We  can,

therefore,  learn  a lesson from this  experience.

And  that  is, in any country, newspapers  of  any

type   -whether  it  is  a  political,   cultural,

financial  or movie newspaper - can be controlled,

influenced or infiltrated by undesirable  elements

because   the  newspaper  is  a  good   means   of

disseminating  propaganda.  Once  a  newspaper  is

published,  it is read by thousands and  thousands

of  people in the home, in the office, or even  in

the  toilet.  It  is because of the  inherent  and

formidable  influence of the newspaper that  there

is  always  the  temptation for ambitious  foreign

elements to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our midst we have a lot of

journalists, who are now Ministers. I can  mention

the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for

Culture,  the  Parliamentary Secretary,  and  even

some  Backbenchers. For example,  the  Member  for

Henderson  is  the  editor of the  Petir  (Chinese

edition) and another Member is also the editor  of

the  Jurong  Newspaper. I myself  was  the  former

editor  of the Petir (Chinese edition). So in  our

midst  we  have a number of journalists, and  this

instance   is   enough  to  indicate   the   close

connection between politics and journalism. In the

light of these facts and realities, there are some

people  who  even dream dreams of freedom  of  the

press. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



are  obsessed  with  the  freedom  of  the  press.

However, these facts are enough to serve as an eye-opener to such dreamers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in this House seeks to ensure that the

control  of newspapers will always remain  in  the

hands  of  our  citizens and not in the  hands  of

foreigners. This is, in fact, the very  spirit  of

this  Bill, as indicated by the Member for  Delta.

Whether  this Bill is adequate to ensure  what  we

want  to  achieve is something we  have  to  think

about.  For  example, under the  Bill,  shares  of

newspaper companies are to be classified into  two

categories, management shares and ordinary shares.

Management  shares  can  only  be  transferred  to

citizens approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party has

gone  through  many  years of political  struggle.

Through  all  our experiences in the  struggle  we

have  come to a situation where we have two  types

of membership in the PAP, the cadre membership and

the ordinary membership. With these two classes of

membership, we are able to ensure that control  of

a  very influential political party like ours does

not   fall  into  the  wrong  hands.  And  if  the

management  of  newspapers  can  use   a   similar

provision   in  the  Bill  wisely  and   with   an

enlightened view, they will be able to promote the

interest  of the country. Then only will the  Bill

be able to achieve what it seeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out some of my

misgivings.  I  am afraid that some newspaper  men

may  misunderstand and think that the introduction

of this Bill is just to control the press. This is

not  the  case.  As a matter of  fact,  bona  fide

newspaper  men  can, with the provisions  of  this

Bill,  do  their job more efficiently and  without

fear.  This  Bill seeks to exercise some  kind  of

check  to  ensure  that the right  people  are  in

control   of  management  shares  and  to  prevent

undesirable elements from owning management shares

and  thus gain control of the newspapers. In  this

way, bona fide newspaper men will be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



to carry out their duties with peace of mind. When

the Bill is passed, I hope such newspaper men will

carry   out  their  duties  more  positively   and

efficiently,  particularly those who are  thinking

of publishing academic magazines or newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have said, Sir, we still

have  some newspapers of good standing. Newspapers

which  do  good  deeds will receive good  rewards.

However,   there  are  newspapers  which   publish

undesirable  news items, articles  or  reports  in

order  to attract a wider readership. I hope  that

after  the  final  passage of this  Bill,  such  a

newspaper will be able to develop from a  mosquito

newspaper into a medium-sized newspaper and from a

medium-sized newspaper into a large newspaper. The

small  or  mosquito newspapers actually depend  on

crime  reports or even sex stories to boost  their

sales.  Such mosquito newspapers seem to  paint  a

chaotic  state  of  the  world  because  the  more

chaotic  the  world  is the  more  news  they  can

publish, and the more sensationalism they can whip

up  the greater the boost to their sales. It is my

hope  that  after the passage of this Bill,  these

newspapers   will   develop  along   a   healthier

direction in the interest of the people. With this

hope I reiterate my full support for this Bill.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the air of light-heartedness

will  not  diminish the gravity of this Bill.  Two

years  ago,  when I was still in the  Ministry  of

Culture, I dwelt on this same topic in this  House

-  perhaps,  the newspapers at that time  did  not

give a fair description of my views then. But this

is a trivial matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have expressed their views on the

influence  of  newspapers  on  culture,  the  very

freedom  of the press itself and foreign influence

making  inroads into Singapore. They also  rightly

commented  on certain activities of the newspapers

that  were  irrelevant as far as our  people  were

concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that our main consideration for the

passage of this Bill is based on national interest

and security. We have to explain to the people the

measures  we now take lest they may feel that  the

introduction  of this Bill is merely  to  exercise

control  over  the  English,  Chinese  and   other

newspapers. It must be made clear and  the  people

must  realise  that what we are doing  is  in  the

interest of our country. What is important is that

if  a newspaper is in the hands of foreigners - as

we  all  know  the newspaper is a  very  effective

public  medium - and acts against the interest  of

our  country,  we  must be vigilant  against  this

manoeuvre and must necessarily nip it in the bud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain foreigners had publicised their own

thoughts   and   ideas  through  our   newspapers.

Articles were written on what was labelled as "one-party   monopoly"   and   on   the   question   of

parliamentary  democracy in  Singapore,  lamenting

the   fact   that  there  was  no  opposition   in

Parliament. What they advocated was the simplistic

view  that  since  there  was  no  opposition   in

Parliament,  there  was no  democracy.  All  these

talks  were  nonsensical utterances.  They  viewed

Singapore  with a foreign standpoint  and  through

tinted  glasses. The result, of course,  was  that

events  were  distorted and consequently  confused

the views of the people. These foreign journalists

judged   local  events  according  to  their   own

philosophies,  standards  and  their  own   mental

makeup.  What may be acceptable to them,  perhaps,

would  be a situation obtained in line with  their

own liking. What they failed to understand, and we

are  very  conscious, is that  our  way  of  life,

philosophy  and  attitude towards life  are  quite

different from their own and since they do not see

any   similarity  between  Singapore   and   their

country, they simply equate the situation  as  the

non-existence of democracy and that ours is a "one-party  monopoly" - or other evil things like that.

Of   course,  not  all  foreign  journalists   are

ignorant  of the facts of life in Singapore,  some

were  even appreciative of the situation here  but

there were others, awareness of the facts not-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



withstanding, deliberately behaved in a manner  as

dictated by their "behind-the curtain masters". It

is   not   my  intention  to  place  all   foreign

journalists in this category but even  they  would

accept  that  there were a few black  sheep  among

them.    It   is   understandable   that   foreign

journalists have to make a living by selling their

articles and news reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were articles specially written to

criticize     the    method    of     governmental

administration,  implying high-handedness  on  the

part  of  the  Government in exerting pressure  on

certain  newspapers and the journalistic  circles.

All these were calculated to create a confusion of

mind and subvert the country's peace and order. It

must  be emphasized that when the chips are  down,

it  was  Singapore  that would be  responsible  to

ensure  peace  and order in our society.  None  of

those  who  branded Singapore with  all  sorts  of

mischievous names could state in black  and  white

that  they,  and they alone, could guarantee  that

peace and order in Singapore would not break down.

What  happened in the event of a chaotic situation

that  they helped bring about? Far from being able

to  assist, they would just make quick  exit  from

the country and then retire into their bedroom  to

write  articles on the situation and  continue  to

earn  their fees. Is that the kind of contribution

they could make to Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Australia there was a time when members

of the public were stirred when they learnt that a

foreign  newspaper tycoon was attempting  to  take

over a certain local newspaper there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, there are those who view us in

a   different  light  and  through  their   tinted

glasses.   Whatever  we  do,   they   react   with

scepticism. They seem to have strange imaginations

about everything that we are trying to do for  the

good  of our people. What we desire is a situation

where the wishes and thinking of the people can be

expressed truly through the newspapers, in  short,

the  press  should  reflect  the  aspirations   of

Singaporeans and not foreigners. There  were  some

newspapers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



supported  the  views of other  countries  against

their  own viewpoints. This, perhaps, was intended

to  net in a wider readership. The question of the

Straits  of Malacca was a good example  in  point.

This  showed that we do have parasites even  among

our  own  journalists who are prepared  to  repeat

what  others say and echo them without considering

the  effects or consequences as a result of  their

toeing the policies of other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A journalist is just like anybody else. Everyone

has his own character and personality. Likewise, a

journalist   should  have  his  own   professional

integrity, personality and character. It is a pity

that  there are people who are only interested  in

fees and circulation and therefore seek to publish

news    or   views   that   will   cause    public

sensationalism. I had the opportunity  to  discuss

this  matter  with one of them who  remarked  that

"Whilst  in  business,  let's  talk  business."  I

bluntly told him that if what he really wanted was

mere   business,  then  he  should  find  it  more

profitable  to  launch into  some  other  kind  of

enterprises  and  certainly  not  the   newspapers

because  a newspaper should not be only  a  money-making proposition. I further added that there are

many   other   ways  to  make  money  other   than

irresponsible writing in the newspapers. In  fact,

writing is a very hard way to make a living and if

money  is  what  one is after, then certainly  the

newspaper is the wrong place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson commented on certain

reports  which  my  colleague,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Home Affairs,  did

not seem to agree to. I will give just one example

to  illustrate  what effects the  choice  of  news

reports  can  make  in  the community.  There  was

quoted in a certain newspaper a robbery case in  a

foreign country. A clipping of that newspaper  was

sent to Singapore for publication. At the risk  of

being accused of creating an uproar in this House,

let  me briefly describe the contents of this news

report as I think it is a very serious matter. The

report said that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



gang  of  robbers  entered into  a  house  and  on

failing  to  find anything valuable,  they  became

furious  and castrated a child whom they found  in

the  house. This news item of atrocious  brutality

was  a  sensational news item in that country  and

every full stop and comma of this news report  was

reproduced  in  one of our local newspapers.  What

was  it  they  hoped to achieve  by  quoting  this

article?  Was it meant to reflect the  comparative

security of Singapore or was it meant to introduce

or  give  ideas to our local criminals? Therefore,

there must be certain principles which the editors

must  adopt in the choice and publication of  news

items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main objective of this Bill

is  to  ensure that newspapers should reflect  the

views  and aspirations of our citizens. It  cannot

be   denied   that  the  newspaper  is   also   an

educational medium for the public and it has  also

a  duty  to  educate and enlighten the  community.

Through its circulation, it can positively help in

our   efforts  in  nation  building  and  in   the

maintenance  of  law  and  order.  In  short,  the

newspaper must work in the interest of the country

and the people rather than for the sheer profit to

fill the pockets of a small group of individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support this Bill in toto. Although what I

wanted to say has already been said, there is just

one point I wish to mention. I feel that there  is

one  clause  in  the Bill which is  a  little  too

preponderant. In Part III, clause 9 (2) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No newspaper company shall refuse to issue

management  shares  to any  person  who  has  been

granted  the  written approval of the Minister  to

purchase such shares.'



I  feel that this is a little too drastic, and  I

hope  to present certain views on this point  when

this Bill is sent to Select Committee.

promise to be very brief. Clause 10 prohibits  the

receipt of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



funds  from  a  foreign source. The  intention  is

quite  clear.  But on reading it, I  am  a  little

concerned that the clause, if implemented  in  its

present  form,  may also be used  as  a  means  of

subversion  against  us. For example,  if  someone

dislikes  a  particular pressman,  it  can  be  so

easily arranged for a certain sum of money  to  be

deposited into a bank account in that individual's

name. Having done so, an anonymous report can then

be  made  to  the Minister and, if the  consequent

investigations  are  not  objective  and  thorough

enough, miscarriage of justice could arise.  I  am

not  a  lawyer.  I  do  not know  what  the  legal

implications are, but I am just wondering  whether

there are adequate safeguards for our pressmen.  I

hope  this point will be looked into by the Select

Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  an important Bill, one that is bound  to

provoke   controversy  both  within  and   outside

Singapore.  It brings to the fore once  again  the

peculiar  problems  faced by  small  strategically

located developing States that are endeavouring to

transform their socio-economic structures  without

compromising their independence internationally on

the  basis of democratic institutions. Sad to say,

the  Bill  also demonstrates the fragile  base  on

which educated opinion in Singapore moves. It is a

pity  too that despite the phenomenal strides that

we  have made in education over the last 20 years,

no  newspaper  has  emerged  in  Singapore  as   a

national    institution   serving   the   national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still possible only a few years ago for a

combination  of  foreign interests  to  mount  the

Singapore  Herald to confuse and  divide  educated

opinion  on  issues that were vital to the  social

peace and security of Singapore. There were no in-built   checks   and  balances  to   contain   the

operation. The State had to step in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular political thinking defines democratic

politics  in terms of a few fundamental  freedoms,

of which freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



of  the  press  is  one.  But,  unlike  the  other

fundamental freedoms, the freedom of the press has

become  over  the  last hundred years  or  so  the

handmaiden  of  vast economic  interests.  In  the

context  of Singapore these interests have  always

been  international  in character.  In  the  final

analysis the press in South-east Asian states  has

to-date  been  controlled by foreign  rather  than

national interests. It is this situation  that  we

have  to  meet  in  the course  of  our  political

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, one wonders if the Bill

has  not  gone  too  far  than  was  necessary  in

regulating   the   problem.  The  provision   that

management shares could only be held by  Singapore

citizens with the approval of the Minister appears

to  be too drastic, on the face of it. It would be

preferable to leave the management shares  in  the

hands   of   Singapore  citizens   regardless   of

Ministerial   approval  but  with   the   negative

stipulation  that no management  shares  shall  be

refused to persons who have been approved  by  the

Minister.  The provisions of clause  10  are  more

than  sufficient  and adequate to  deal  with  the

problems  posed  by foreign financial  control  of

national  press. The experiment is an  interesting

one.   Time  only  will  tell  if  the  aims   and

objectives  of  the  Bill are  achieved  and  also

whether in the process we have stifled free, frank

and  fearless  discussion of issues  that  vitally

concern the nation.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, in fact, I do

not  want  to  speak on this Bill,  but  since  Mr

Speaker  has  called  me  I  might  as  well   say

something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill. But we

must  not  be  too strict in our  control  of  the

newspapers, for if we do they cannot be published.

That is very bad. The newspaper must be given some

freedom,  otherwise people will  say  that  it  is

controlled  by  the  Government.  Therefore,   the

Minister must consider giving some freedom to  the

newspaper. However, I fully support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill. Since this Bill is going to the  Select

Committee,  most  probably  we  will  get   public

opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, first of all, I must

thank  Members for their enthusiastic support  for

this  Bill. Many of them have been very articulate

and,  in fact, they have made longer speeches than

I expected. I must take this opportunity to assure

Members  of  the  House and also  members  of  the

public  that  it  is  not  the  intention  of  the

Government to go into the newspaper business.  Our

intention  is to see that newspapers are  properly

managed  and  that they cannot be  taken  over  by

undesirable  elements which may then direct  their

policies against the interests of our nation. That

is the sole purpose of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng and the Member for Kuo

Chuan have to a certain extent mentioned the  fear

that the Bill might be delegating undue powers  to

the  Minister or the Government for control of the

press.  Those  fears exist in the  minds  of  many

people.  I think it should be sufficient to  allay

the  fears of these people when I say that  it  is

not  the intention of the Government to take  over

the  newspapers but to see that a  free  press  is

allowed  to  be  conducted  in  Singapore.  It  is

certainly  not our intention to curb  the  genuine

expression of public opinion. In fact,  it  is  to

our interest that those opinions should be allowed

to  be  expressed.  Let the flowers  bloom.  In  a

situation like ours it is quite important that the

man-in-the-street should be given the  opportunity

to express his opinion, whether it is about buses,

the  Ministry of Culture's TV programmes or  other

matters.  He  should be given the  opportunity  to

express his opinion publicly and there is no other

medium better than the press. We would like to see

this   sort  of  freedom  existing  in  Singapore.

However, many very important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



views have been expressed by Members, and  I

am  sure  that these views will be taken  care  of

when   the  Bill  is  considered  by  the   Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some minor points which I should touch

on  briefly.  The  Member for Delta  has  queried:

since the management shares are so important  that

their voting rights are greater than those of  the

ordinary  shares,  what type of citizens  will  be

allowed  to own these management shares?  We  have

not  come  to  that stage yet; let  us  cross  the

bridge  when we come to it. I am sure the Minister

for  Home Affairs will be able to advise me as  to

which  type  of  citizens will be allowed  to  own

those shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, in fact, considered a Press Council for

a  very  long time, but we found that  it  is  not

practicable under our present conditions. First of

all,  who  is  to be the Chairman? Who  gives  the

order? Who lays down policies? These are all  very

complicated  matters, and  I  think  it  would  be

better   that  the  press  be  allowed  to  manage

themselves.  Therefore, we have  introduced  these

management  shares to ensure that only  the  right

people  are  allowed  to exercise  the  powers  of

management  of newspapers. The Members  for  Bukit

Merah   and   Henderson  and   the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Labour  have  also

offered   very   good  advice  to  the   newspaper

directors as to how they should run the newspapers

and  what  sort of articles should be  put  in  to

attract  more  readers, and  so  on.  I  hope  the

newspapers  concerned  will  take  note  of  their

advice  and  make improvements to the contents  of

their newspapers. Apart from those comments,  Sir,

I have nothing more to add.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Newspaper and Printing Presses Bill be

committed to a Select Committee consisting  of  Mr

Speaker  as  Chairman  and  seven  Members  to  be

nominated  by the Committee of Selection."  -  [Mr Jek Yeun Thong].

<div align="center"><b>MUTUAL BENEFIT ORGANISATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce several

amendments to the Mutual Benefit Organisations Act

(Chapter  254  of the Revised Edition)  which  are

found  necessary in the light of experience gained

in administering the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments seek to strengthen the

hands of the Registrar in administering the Mutual

Benefit  Organisations Act which provides for  the

registration  and  control of all  mutual  benefit

organisations  in the Republic. At present,  there

are 427 such organisations with a total membership

of   191,367.   Many   of  the  long   established

organisations have accumulated large surplus funds

over the years. As the majority of the members  of

mutual  benefit organisations are from the  lower-income  group and often illiterate, there must  be

adequate  legislation to ensure that these  mutual

benefit  organisations are  properly  managed  and

their activities consistent with the objectives of

their organisations for the welfare and benefit of

the  subscribers. It is, therefore, necessary that

the  interests  of the members be  safeguarded  by

appropriate    law    against   exploitation    by

unscrupulous persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience over the years has shown that the

existing   provisions  in   the   Mutual   Benefit

Organisations  Act  relating to  registration  and

cancellation  of mutual benefit organisations  are

inadequate and restrictive. There is no  provision

at  present  empowering the  Registrar  to  refuse

registration of newly formed organisations  if  he

has reason to believe that such organisations have

been   formed  for  the  personal  gain   of   the

organisers.  Nor has the Registrar  the  power  to

prevent mutual benefit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



organisations  from being managed  by  persons  of

dubious character or used for any purpose contrary

to the public interest. To remedy this, sections 5

and  6  of  the Act will be repealed and  two  new

sections re-enacted to provide the Registrar  with

wider powers in considering an application for the

registration of a mutual benefit organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing section 7, a person aggrieved

by  the  refusal of the Registrar to  register  an

organisation  may  appeal  at  any  time  to   the

Minister.  It  is desirable to stipulate  a  fixed

period  in which an appeal may be made. Section  7

of the Act is, therefore, being amended so that an

appeal against the decision of a Registrar must be

made   within   one  month  from   the   date   of

notification of such a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a new section 1lA is being

introduced  for  the  purpose of  prohibiting  any

person  who  has  been  convicted  of  an  offence

involving  dishonesty or moral turpitude,  or  who

has  been sentenced to imprisonment for a term  of

not  less  than one year or to a fine of not  less

than  $2,000  and  who  has not  received  a  free

pardon,  from  acting as an officer  of  a  mutual

benefit Organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 27 will be deleted and

a  new subsection re-enacted to give the Registrar

wider  powers  to cancel the registration  of  any

mutual benefit organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to introduce a new

subsection under section 45 to enable the Minister

to  exempt  any organisation, person or  class  of

persons, from any or all of the provisions of  the

Act.  The  purpose  of this new subsection  is  to

allow  some flexibility in administering  the  Act

under special circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Chan Chee Sengl.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urban Redevelopment Authority Act (No. 65 of

1973),  which was passed by this House in November

last  year  and  assented to by the  President  in

January  this year, will be put into operation  on

the  1st  of April this year. Under the provisions

of  the Act, the Car Parks Division of my Ministry

will  be  integrated with the Urban  Redevelopment

Authority. However, matters presently administered

by  the  Car  Parks Division will continue  to  be

governed by the Parking Places Act (Cap. 19,  1970

Edition). The Bill now before the House  seeks  to

repeal  and re-enact, with amendments, the Parking

Places Act, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw Members' attention to only some of

the  more  significant features, namely, clause  3

which  empowers  the Minister to provide  suitable

parking  places for vehicles. Clause  4  prohibits

persons  from maintaining or operating any private

parking  places unless he is a holder of  a  valid

licence,  and  empowers the Minister to  prescribe

the  manner  in  which a licensed private  parking

place  is  to be maintained or operated. Clause  6

provides  for  the appointment of a Superintendent

of  Car  Parks. Clause 8 empowers the Minister  to

make  rules  to  regulate the use  of  public  and

private parking places. Clause 16 provides for the

payment  of  all charges collected and  all  fines

imposed  into the funds of the Urban Redevelopment

Authority.

<div align="center"><b>MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the Government has adopted a laissez-faire policy towards martial arts organisations in

Singapore.  This  is  because these  organisations

like  the  Chinese  pugilistic organisations,  the

bersilat  and  judo  clubs,  etc.,  have  been  in

existence for many years and have become  part  of

the  cultural  life of our population.  Hence  any

exponent of these arts is free to practise  or  to

impart  his  skill to whoever wants to  learn  the

art.  The Government considers that the discipline

and  the training provided in acquiring the  skill

will develop a "healthy mind and healthy body" and

thus  help  to  build  a  rugged  society  in  our

Republic.  These  organisations  were,  therefore,

allowed to function without impediment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years there has been a proliferation of

martial  arts organisations in Singapore.  At  the

end   of   1973,  there  were  128  martial   arts

organisations registered in Singapore compared  to

only 32 in 1963. It is difficult to estimate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



number of trainees learning martial arts, although

this has been placed between 13,000 to 18,000. New

arts  like  karate and taekwondo have  emerged  in

Singapore,  and  variations  of  these  arts  like

akido,  kendo, jiu-jitsu, as well as the different

Chinese  pugilistic arts have been developed.  The

rapid  growth  of  these  organisations  and   the

increasing  number of trainees learning  different

martial arts can be traced to their popularisation

by  Chinese  films  especially from  Hongkong  and

Taiwan  in the late 60's which glorify the use  of

martial arts. These films which emphasise violence

and bloodshed were one of the contributory factors

resulting in an increase in the crime rate  and  a

rise  in violence in the commission of crimes.  It

is  noted  that between 1967 and 1969  when  these

films  were  widely  shown in  the  Republic,  the

number  of  new  pugilistic  organisations   which

applied   to   the  Government  for   registration

increased  at  the  rate of 11  to  15  each  year

compared to very few in the 50's and in the  early

60's.  Although the Government has imposed  strict

censorship on these films last year, the number of

martial   arts  organisations  applying   to   the

Government for registration has not abated. Up  to

March this year, there were 133 registered martial

arts  organisations with 11 new applications under

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing interest amongst our population in

martial  art  training  has  made  many  of  these

organisations  become  commercial  concerns.  Some

pseudo martial arts organisations have also sprung

up to exploit the market. Since there is little or

no   control   over   these   organisations,   any

instructor  who professes sufficient knowledge  of

any martial art can organise a class and apply for

registration to the Registrar of Societies or  the

Registrar of Business Names by payment of a  small

fee. Both the Registrars have no means of checking

whether  such an instructor is qualified to  teach

this  skill  or  to  whom  he  should  impart  his

knowledge.  Similarly,  instructors  will  readily

accept any trainee as a student with scant concern

about his background, his purpose in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



acquiring  the  art and whether he  would  benefit

from it, so long as he is prepared to meet the fee

required  for receiving such training.  There  is,

therefore,  little control as to who is  qualified

to teach or who can learn the art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the laxity in admission and the

general   availability  of  these   martial   arts

organisations  to  the  public,  many   of   these

organisations  have  been  penetrated  by   secret

society  members  and  the criminal  elements  who

learn martial art to further their own ends. These

secret society members use the art in gang clashes

to glorify the triad which they belong and also to

cow  innocent victims from whom they extort money.

In   a   recent  study  on  some  115   pugilistic

organisations in Singapore, it was found  that  33

of  these  have been penetrated by secret  society

elements and 10 of them have elements with adverse

security records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not the intention of Government to

deter anyone who requires martial art training  to

build  up a healthy body and for self-defence,  it

is   recognised  that  organisations  which  teach

martial  art, be it a Chinese pugilistic  art,  or

karate  or  taekwondo  or  judo  or  bersilat,  in

effect,  equip  their  members  with  a  potential

weapon   which,  if  abused,  can   have   serious

consequences   for  their  victims   and   serious

implications for the maintenance of law and order.

As  such,  in the interest of society,  Government

has   found  it  necessary  to  institute   proper

controls  to  regulate  the  activities  of   such

organisations and to ensure that those  whom  they

teach  are  not likely to abuse the art that  they

have  acquired. In other words, the knowledge  and

skill  of martial arts in the hands of disciplined

and  law-abiding persons can be of benefit to both

the  exponent  and society. But if such  knowledge

and  skill  were  allowed to fall into  the  wrong

hands it can be very dangerous and detrimental  to

society. Hence, the Martial Arts Instruction  Bill

before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martial arts, as defined in the Bill, include

karate,  taekwondo, judo, akido, kendo,  bersilat,

kung-fu, jiu-jitsu, or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



combination thereof. However, in view of the  fact

that  new  forms of martial arts or variations  of

existing forms of martial arts are introduced into

Singapore  from time to time, this  definition  of

"martial  art"  cannot be comprehensive.  However,

the  Minister  is  empowered by clause  2  (2)  to

declare  any  other  art  of  pugilism,  fighting,

boxing  or  self-defence to be a martial  art  for

purposes of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Act will be in the

hands  of  a Controller of Martial Arts. Assistant

Controllers will also be able to exercise all  the

powers  conferred  on the Controller,  subject  to

such limitations as he may impose (clause 3).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill requires all martial art

associations  to  be  registered.  The  Controller

shall  refuse  registration in  the  circumstances

stipulated   in  clause  4  (3)  and  may   refuse

registration   in   certain  other   circumstances

stipulated   in  clause  4  (4).  An  unregistered

martial  art  association, which is  organised  in

Singapore and whose officers, employees or members

provide instruction in any form of martial art  in

Singapore, will be deemed to be unlawful. It  will

be  an  offence  for  a person to  pursue  certain

activities in connection with unlawful martial art

associations (clauses 5, 15, 16, 17 and 18).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Controller to order any

registered martial art association to furnish  him

with such information as he may require concerning

the  provision  of  instruction  in  any  form  of

martial art at a place of instruction provided  by

the  association or with any document, account  or

book of the association relating thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to disallow any person from

holding   office  in  a  registered  martial   art

association  if he has been declared, in  writing,

by the Controller to be unfit to act as an officer

of  a martial art association. The Controller  may

make  such  declaration upon any  of  the  grounds

stipulated  in clause 19. Any person who  acts  in

contravention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



of this clause will be liable, on conviction, to a

maximum  fine  of  $500 or to a  maximum  term  of

imprisonment  of six months or to both  such  fine

and imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it appears to the Minister that any

officer,   employee  or  member  of  a  registered

martial  art  association provides instruction  in

any  form of martial art at a place of instruction

provided by the association in an unlawful  manner

or   for   unlawful  purposes  or   for   purposes

prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order

in   Singapore,   the  Minister  may   order   the

cancellation   of   the   registration   of    the

association. A similar power is conferred upon the

Minister where the association has contravened any

provision  of  the  Act  or any  regulations  made

thereunder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person except an instructor who is in

possession  of an instructor's certificate  issued

under the Act may instruct any person in any  form

of martial art (clause 21). The Controller will be

responsible      for     granting     instructor's

certificates. Clause 25 (3) stipulates the grounds

on  which  the Controller may refuse to  grant  an

instructor's  certificate. Clause 26 empowers  the

Controller   to  revoke,  cancel  or  suspend   an

instructor's  certificate for any of  the  reasons

stipulated in that clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person may receive instruction in any form of

martial  art  from  an  instructor  unless  he  is

registered as a trainee under the Act (clause 22).

The   Controller  will  be  responsible  for   the

registration of trainees. Clause 22 stipulates the

grounds  on  which the Controller  may  refuse  to

register  any  person  as  a  trainee.  Clause  24

empowers  the  Controller  to  revoke,  cancel  or

suspend the registration of a trainee for  any  of

the reasons stipulated in that clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 provides the Controller and Police

officers  with  the  powers of entry,  search  and

arrest, in circumstances where there is reason  to

believe  that an offence has been committed  under

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 empowers the Minister to exempt any

organisation, person or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



class of persons from any or all of the provisions

of the Act. The Minister may also make regulations

generally  for  carrying  out  the  purposes   and

provisions of the Act (clause 39).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are transitional provisions in the Bill to

cater for those martial art associations which are

in   existence  and  for  those  instructors   and

trainees    who   are   providing   or   receiving

instruction  in any form of martial  art,  as  the

case  may  be before the commencement of  the  Act

(clauses 40 and 41).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  support the Martial Arts  Instruction

Bill.  I  would like to inquire from the  Minister

for  Health  and  Home Affairs  whether  he  would

consider  encouraging members of the Police  force

to  undergo training in all the various  forms  of

martial  arts because in Singapore at the  present

time  a  lot  of bad hats have some experience  in

various forms of martial art. Members of the Armed

Forces  too have a duty to enforce law and  order.

Therefore, it would be advantageous and necessary,

if  it  is possible, for all members of the  Armed

Forces to be trained in the martial arts. If there

are   sufficient  instructors,  members   of   the

Vigilante  Corps  should  also  be  encouraged  to

undergo this kind of training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.  In

recent  years  the various forms of martial  arts,

such   as  the  Chinese  pugilistic  art,  Western

boxing, wrestling, taekwondo, judo and many others

have  been  found  to  be very  popular  with  the

younger  generation.  More  and  more  people  are

learning  some  form  of  martial  art.  The  Bill

introduced  by the Minister, therefore,  seeks  to

exercise certain control over the instruction  and

training of the various forms of martial  art,  so

as   to   ensure   their   proper   guidance   and

development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese pugilistic arts have a very long

history,  whereas the development of martial  arts

in  Singapore has been very active only in  recent

years.  I remember a few years ago after a Chinese

martial   art   organisation  was   formed,   much

assistance  was given to its various members.  Its

members have contributed to many items of activity

for   our  National  Day  celebrations  and  other

festivals. I refer to the Singapore Federation  of

Pugilistic    Association.   Their   contributions

include the lion dance, the dragon dance and other

performances   for   our   various   celebrations,

particularly on National Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires instructors and members of any

martial  art  organisation to  be  registered  and

perhaps  screened  so  that there  can  be  proper

control  over  them.  This  is  very  good  indeed

because  those people who learn the  martial  arts

comprise  all  kinds of people, including  dubious

elements. So if by legislation we can ensure  that

the   members  of  these  organisations  are   all

disciplined and law-abiding people, then it  is  a

law that will indeed do good for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several suggestions to make to the

Minister. The Bill provides for the appointment of

a  Controller  of Martial Arts who  will  have  to

exercise administrative control over martial arts.

However, I would like to know whether he  will  be

someone well versed in the martial arts. I suppose

he  is expected to be conversant with all forms of

martial  arts.  If  not, he  should  at  least  be

conversant with certain forms of martial arts,  so

that  he  will  be capable of exercising  judgment

when reviewing applications. Secondly, with regard

to   the  registration  of  private  martial   art

organisations, or institutes as they call them,  I

understand   some   of  these  organisations   are

recruiting  trainees in kung-fu or  some  kind  of

pugilistic art. I would like to ask whether  these

martial art institutes have to be registered under

the Bill before they can carry out their enrolment

exercise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, following the call by the Government

to  all  citizens to be strong and  healthy,  many

martial art organisations have sprung up, and more

and  more  people are joining these institutes  to

take  up  martial  arts.  But  these  people  have

different  motives. Some learn it  as  a  form  of

exercise  to  improve their health;  while  others

have ulterior motives. So the introduction of this

Bill is very timely and also very useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are several points which I would

like   the   Minister  to  clarify.   First,   the

definition of martial arts. For instance, the  so-called  kung-fu, as I understand it, is a  Chinese

form  of  pugilistic art. However, its connotation

is  very  wide.  There should be a more  clear-cut

definition  of kung-fu. Another instance  is  tai-chi.  It should be made clear whether or not  tai-chi,  or shadow boxing, is to be classified  under

this   definition.  There  are  many   old   folks

performing  the  tai-chi in the  parks  and  other

places. They even include old crones, grandmothers

and  grandfathers,  and they  go  to  the  Botanic

Gardens  as  well. Therefore, there  should  be  a

proper  definition of martial  arts  so  that  the

Director  of Botanic Gardens will not mistake  the

exercises   of  these  old  people  for  something

unlawful.  Secondly,  with regard  to  instructors

which  the  Member for Sembawang has also  touched

upon, they have to apply to the Controller for  an

instructor's certificate. Before the Controller of

Martial Arts issues such certificates, he  has  to

be  satisfied  with the applicant's character  and

morals.  But, in addition to this, the  Controller

should  also make sure that the applicant is  well

qualified in the particular martial art  in  which

he wishes to instruct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about registration of

trainees.  The  Minister  has  given  a   detailed

explanation on this point. The idea is to exercise

some  control over these people so that  they  may

not  utilise  their  skill for criminal  purposes.

Therefore,  the registration of trainees  is  very

important. I remember that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



the  past, when one wished to be enrolled for  the

boxing  or  weight-lifting  classes  run  by   the

community  centres, one's name would be  sent  for

screening.  But such practice has  ceased  now.  I

think it is necessary to revive such practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is that if a community centre

wants  to provide instruction in certain forms  of

martial art, the centre concerned must first  take

its  environment into consideration whether or not

such  form  of  martial art is  worthwhile  to  be

introduced  to the people around. For illustration

purposes, I would like to quote one example of the

community centres in my constituency. Martial  art

classes, such as karate, etc, are conducted in the

Tiong Bahru Community Centre, and many people have

been  taking  part in these classes. A  number  of

people  who  live  around the Kim  Tian  Community

Centre have also requested for such classes to  be

conducted  there.  But  I opposed  the  suggestion

because we frequently read in the newspapers about

gang  fights  among secret society members  around

that  area.  So  I feel that martial  art  classes

should not be allowed in certain areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank  the  hon. Members who  have  spoken  in

strong support of the Bill. There is nothing  more

for me to add except to answer a few queries which

Members  have brought up. The first  is  from  the

Member  for  Bukit Ho Swee. He asked whether  some

form  of  martial art training is being  given  to

Police  officers.  In fact,  in  the  training  of

Police  officers, they are given training on  what

is  called unarmed combat. With regard to the VCs,

particularly  those  who are now  engaged  in  the

community security force policing, they  are  also

being  taught or given training in unarmed  combat

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the queries brought up by the

Member  for  Sembawang, who  I  understand  is  an

honorary  adviser to a pugilistic association,  he

asked whether the Controller of Martial Arts  will

be a person well versed in martial arts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



May  I say that he would have knowledge of martial

arts but he need not necessarily be an exponent of

martial arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether all martial arts

associations  must  be registered.  If  they  come

within  the  definition of "martial arts"  as  has

been  defined in the Bill, they will  have  to  be

registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Tiong

Bahru  is with regard to the definition of martial

arts. I have in my speech given the definition  as

provided by the Bill. "Martial art" is defined  to

include  taekwondo, judo, akido, kendo,  bersilat,

kung-fu,  jiu-jitsu or a combination or  variation

thereof.  However,  as  I have  also  stated,  the

definition cannot be exhaustive because it  has  a

very wide meaning, and therefore the Minister  has

been  given  powers to declare any  other  art  of

pugilism, fighting, boxing or self-defence to be a

martial  art  for  the purposes of  the  Act.  The

purpose  of  the Act is to control the people  who

have acquired the skill so that they would not use

it  for  their  own  ends,  in  other  words,  for

criminal purposes. That is the wide basis on which

the definition is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member brought up the specific example of tai-chi, or shadow boxing. I do not know very much

about tai-chi. From what I can gather, tai-chi  is

actually a form of exercise and not necessarily  a

form of self-defence where one can cause injury to

another person. If it is brought to my notice that

it  can  cause  injury, then I  will  exercise  my

powers under the Bill and classify it as a martial

art.  If it is just a form of exercise and  cannot

cause  injury, then I will not consider  it  as  a

form  of  martial  art. The word  "martial"  means

"pertaining  to  warfare".  So  it  must   be   an

aggressive art, although used in self-defence. But

I  think an exponent of martial arts will be  able

to  advise me whether tai-chi should or should not

be  considered  a martial art. I do  not  want  to

decide on the matter right now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member

for  Tiong  Bahru about what sort  of  instructors

will  be  issued  with  certificates,  of  course,

firstly, they will be screened and if they have  a

criminal record, then they will not be issued with

instructors'   certificates.  Secondly,   on   the

question  of what sort of skill they should  have,

unless we have a board of examiners, we are unable

to  judge the skill of an instructor. But so  long

as  an  applicant has genuine skills and is not  a

pseudo, he may be certified as an instructor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-registration exercise for persons born

between 6th May, 1949, and 5th May, 1955, and  who

obtained their identity cards before attaining the

age  of  17  years ended on 29th September,  1973.

However,  in spite of the wide publicity given  to

this exercise and the provision of facilities  for

re-registration in practically all  the  community

centres,  about 19,000 persons Out of the  252,000

persons  required to register under Regulation  15

of the National Registration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>

Regulations,  1966, have not re-registered.  These

persons  are  liable on conviction to imprisonment

for  a  term up to five years or to a fine  up  to

$1,000 or to both imprisonment and a fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce further the number of persons

who   have  not  registered,  the  Government  has

decided  to  extend the closing date  of  the  re-registration  exercise to the end of  this  month.

However, it is envisaged that there will still  be

some  who  will still not re-register by this  new

dead-line.  This  number may be further  increased

with future re-registration exercises. It would be

impractical to bring every case to court.  Besides

the  presence  of large numbers of offenders  will

increase congestion in our courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, proposed that the National

Registration  Act be amended to  provide  for  the

composition  of  offences  prescribed  under   the

National    Registration    Regulations,     1966.

Consequent  upon  this  amendment,  the   National

Registration Regulations, 1966, will  empower  the

Commissioner of National Registration to  compound

offences  relating  to  late  re-registration   of

persons who have attained the age of 17 years,  by

a fine not exceeding $100.

<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time,"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to impose with effect from 1st

January, 1974, a surcharge of 10 per cent  on  the

annual   values   of  real  estate,   other   than

industrial and commercial properties, not owned by

citizens of Singapore or permanent residents.  The

Bill has arisen from Government's concern with the

speculation on residential properties  and  vacant

land   and  the  consequent  escalation  in  their

prices.  The  steep rise in prices is attributable

to,   among  other  factors,  purchases  by   non-residents.   Those  of  our  local  citizens   and

permanent residents who do not qualify for Housing

Board   flats,  therefore,  find  their  hope   of

purchasing  their own homes from  private  housing

estates frustrated by prices beyond their means to

pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the objective of the Government to realise

a scheme for widespread home ownership amongst its

citizens  and permanent residents. To  ensure  the

success of such a scheme, Government announced  in

September  last year that only Singapore  citizens

would   be   eligible   to  purchase   residential

properties  and  vacant  land  with  effect   from

September, 1973. Permanent residents, non-citizens

and  others may be allowed to purchase residential

properties or vacant lands only with the  approval

of  the  Government. The imposition of a  property

tax  surcharge, equal to 10 per cent of the annual

values  of properties and land, was also announced

as  a  further measure aimed at curbing  excessive

speculation in real estate and stabilising  prices

of  residential properties and vacant  land.  Both

these  measures  are designed to assist  the  many

young  executives, professionals, etc, among  its

citizens  ineligible for Housing  Board  units  to

purchase their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is, therefore, to give effect to

the  second  of  these  measures  in  Government's

stated policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 enables rules to be published in the

Gazette  to  exempt certain classes of persons  or

categories   from   payment  of   the   surcharge.

Exemption of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



surcharge   will  be  granted  to  the   following

categories of properties:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Properties owned by a Singapore citizen

or a permanent resident of Singapore including

all  owner-occupied  HDB fiats  and  temporary

structures;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Properties owned by a company registered in

Singapore and carrying on business in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Properties owned by an association, club,

society  or  an  approved body  registered  in

Singapore; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Industrial and commercial built-up

properties irrespective of ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 vests in the President the power to vary

the rate of surcharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides for the situation where a

residential property is jointly owned by either  a

Singapore  citizen or a permanent resident  and  a

non-citizen.  In  such cases, the  Comptroller  is

given  discretionary power to remit wholly  or  in

part the property tax surcharge payable, if he  is

satisfied  that  the property is occupied  by  the

joint  owners  and that payment of  the  surcharge

will result in hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 9 and 11 make provisions for the

Comptroller  of  Property Tax to seek  information

and  prescribe  forms  or  returns  for  effective

enforcement and collection of the surcharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that if an offence is

committed  to evade the surcharge, any  person  on

conviction  is  liable  to a  fine  not  exceeding

$1,000.  When fraud is involved, the penalty  will

be  five  times  the  surcharge  not  including  a

further  fine  of $5,000 or a term of imprisonment

not   exceeding  six  months  or  both  fine   and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this Bill in its spirit. I think it  is  a

laudable  Bill in that the intentions as expressed

in  September last year were to have a stabilising

effect upon the rising cost of land and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



private  property. What I would like to know  from

the  Minister,  however, is:  what  has  been  the

actual  effect of this Bill on the state of things

today, whether the announcement in September  last

year  has  produced  any  decline  or  stabilising

effect  on the prices of land and private property

in this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has quite rightly pointed out the

plight of the middle income wage earners. As it is

today,  I  think  even with  a  knowledge  of  the

present  inflationary trend, private property  and

land  are  well  beyond the reach  of  the  middle

income  wage  earner. To my mind, the  proposition

that  the Government has made and the measures  it

has  taken  to  build  more  flats  and  also  the

intention  to  build condominium type  of  terrace

houses  for this middle income group is  something

worth pursuing. What I feel is that the Government

should step up the construction of these flats and

houses. This will probably contribute more towards

the  welfare of the middle income wage earner than

the  Bill  as such, although in principle  and  in

spirit, it has laudable objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Hon. Minister if he could explain

to  this House whether this Bill has or will  have

any  real  effect upon the state of  property  and

land values today?



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, I share the

sentiments expressed by the Member for  Kim  Seng.

The  Minister has said just now that the intention

of  this Bill is to help the young executives  who

do  not qualify for Housing and Development  Board

fiats. I wonder whether these young executives are

in  a  position to purchase flats built by private

developers. Sir, I saw an advertisement only about

a  week  ago on the sale of flats in the Cairnhill

Plaza. The price of each flat ranges from $200,000

to  $300,500.  If  someone takes  a  housing  loan

amounting to 80 per cent of the price of the flat,

payable  in  15  years, he would  have  to  pay  a

monthly  instalment  of  over  $1,000.  I   wonder

whether  a young executive or a young professional

person, like a doctor, who earns



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



about  $1,200 a month can afford to buy that  sort

of a house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my suggestion is this: with the increasing

cost  of  building  materials,  cement  and  other

things,   perhaps  the  Government   could   allow

development of certain places at a higher  density

than  the  present. This will help  to  lower  the

prices  of  land, and at the same time since  more

flats  could  be built this will naturally  reduce

the  price of houses. I think this is much  better

than depending only on the Housing and Development

Board  flats. Even the HDB project in  Ulu  Pandan

has  to  be stopped for the time being because  of

price increases in building materials. I wonder if

this  project is going to materialise and  whether

these  young  executives will be able to  purchase

those flats.



<br><br>5.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, on the questions which have

been  raised, it is possible to give answers on  a

very  general  basis. My Ministry of  Finance  has

monitored  the prices of houses since we announced

the  Government policy on this matter. We  notice,

first  of  all,  a tendency for prices  to  remain

relatively stable. In the few cases that  we  have

monitored  in different housing estates,  we  have

noticed  a  fall in prices of 10-20 per  cent.  In

other  cases, of course, we have seen  that  there

was  a  sort  of  stabilisation in the  price.  In

certain cases, however, some flats have even  gone

up  in  price,  hut  this may be  due  perhaps  to

furniture  and furnishings, air-conditioning,  and

so  on, which we do not know very much about.  The

data  I have are not sufficiently detailed for  an

analysis  to  be  made, but I am quite  sure  that

there  has  been some effect upon the announcement

of Government's policy since last September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng was quite right in saying

that   we   should  also  build  more   flats   in

condominium  type  units  for  the  middle  income

group.  We  certainly  are going  to  do  this.  I

believe my colleague here has announced that  even

the Housing and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



Board is going to build some flats for people  who

do  not  qualify now as they are above the  $1,500

per month household income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that we should build these units, I

think  we  must tackle the problem  from  as  many

fronts as possible, and the Bill which I am taking

through  all  its stages here today will  help  to

reduce  or stabilise prices of the kind of housing

which  the  middle income groups may  be  able  to

purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Changi that when it

comes  to  flats  costing $200,000  and  over,  or

detached  houses  of the same value,  it  is  very

unlikely that an executive drawing $1,500 a  month

will  be able to afford the instalments, which  he

will  be  required to pay for the flat. But  there

are  other  types  of housing,  like  the  terrace

houses,  semi-detached houses and flats which  are

not in the $200,000 class. I think there are flats

costing around $100,000 or even less.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Even then they have to pay an

instalment of about $900 per month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> That depends also on the interest

rate  which is charged, and I think many employers

and  certainly  the Government and  the  statutory

boards  have given housing loans at lower interest

rates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir,I am sure the Hon. Minister is aware that the

credit  squeeze has resulted in very high interest

rates and difficulty in getting loans. Even if  we

work  on the basis of a $100,000 flat, payable  in

10  years  at 10 per cent interest per  annum,  we

have  got to pay $200,000 in 10 years, which means

$20,000  per year or about $2,000 a month.  Can  a

wage  earner earning $1,500 to $2,000 afford  this

kind  of housing? If my figures are correct,  then

it  is  not  possible for him to purchase  such  a

flat.  I  think  there is a strong  case  for  the

Government  to step up its building programme  for

the  middle  income  wage  earners.  Priority,  of

course,  must  be  given to  those  in  the  civil

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have already said that I

fully agree there is a need for more housing to be

constructed,   whether  by  the   Housing   Board,

statutory boards, JTC, or by firms. I am sure  the

executive housing in Jurong is within the means of

the  junior  executives in Jurong. If any  of  our

Members  of  Parliament wish to buy  the  kind  of

executive flats that are being put up in Jurong, I

think  we  can easily build quite a  lot  more  in

addition to what my colleague has been building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the credit squeeze, I think that

is  generally applicable to purchases  of  luxury-type  apartments  and  housing,  and  it  is   not

intended  for  the kind of loans  which  companies

make  to their employees. If, in fact, the  credit

squeeze  is  being operated in  a  way  which  has

prevented  this,  I am sure my  Ministry  and  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore will be  prepared

to  consider a relaxation of this kind  of  credit

control to the benefit of the middle income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I had no intention of joining in

this debate. I am sure my colleague can look after

himself very well. But there was a point raised by

the Member for Changi that if population densities

were  higher, plot ratios increase and on a  given

plot of, say, one acre, if a building goes higher,

then  the total cost will be cheaper. I agree with

that.  In  fact,  it has been the practice  of  my

Ministry  to  relax  and  increase  plot   ratios,

especially in the heart of the City. That  is  why

we  see the high buildings that are being erected,

some  of  which have been completed. But obviously

there  is a limit beyond which we cannot  go,  and

the density aspect, of course, is just one part of

the  cost.  Costs  have gone up  because  building

materials have gone up, and I have spelt  out  the

details earlier on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I should clarify to the Member on this

point which has not been answered by my colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, neither

did I intend to take part in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



this  debate. But I think the density ratio  plays

an important part. I have some experience in this.

Perhaps there has been some relaxation within  the

City  area.  But  in the periphery,  the  Building

Control  Division, or the approving authority,  is

still  very  strict on allowing  a  relaxation  of

density in certain areas. This applies not only to

developments  of private developers  but  also  to

statutory boards wanting to build houses for their

employees.   In   the   Minister's   constituency,

Tanglin,  certainly nobody can put up houses  more

than  4-storeys high. Sir, I know of  a  statutory

board  which planned to build blocks of houses  8-storeys high. There was a tremendous response from

the  employees.  But  planning  approval  was  not

given,  and  modifications had to be  made,  after

which the cost of each unit went up by about 25-30

per cent, making it beyond the means of the junior

executive to purchase. Perhaps what the Member for

Changi said has more value than it really appears.

I  think  the  Building Control Division  and  the

Planning   Office   could   also   assist   junior

executives  to purchase flats and bring  down  the

cost by relaxing the density ratio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think that point deserves a

reply.  Firstly, I think the hon. Member does  not

know  exactly  the boundaries of  my  constituency

when  he said that housing development is confined

to 4-storey flats. To give him an example, he will

find  that flats opposite the Botanic Gardens have

gone far, far beyond the 4-storey height which  he

has referred to. And that is not the only place in

Tanglin.  Tanglin stretches from Lido  Theatre  to

the MacRitchie Reservoir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding densities, we have been allowing

developers to build higher and higher.  But  if  a

developer had bought a piece of land knowing  that

the  plot ratio is 3:1, and then having bought  it

expect to get a plot ratio of 10:1, it means he is

going  to  make a lot of money, and the prices  of

land  will  still go much higher. But  there  have

been   many  cases  where  the  ratios  have  been

relaxed, especially in town where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



plot  ratio  is  now 10:1. It  used  to  be  3:1

before.  That is why there are buildings going  up

to  50  storeys. There is one developer who wanted

to  go  up  to  100. Every developer in  Singapore

wants to go higher and higher. He builds 36, I  go

37.  Someone else goes 50. They all want to go the

highest. So there must be some planning control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the particular statutory board that

the  Member has referred to, but statutory  boards

are   given  special  attention  by  my  Ministry.

Obviously  we cannot favour statutory  boards  and

give  them high plot ratios when perhaps next door

we  have confined a private developer to a certain

plot  ratio.  But  I agree with Members  that  the

price of land bears an important part to the total

price.  Hence  Government's measures  to  try  and

bring  down the price of land, and this Bill helps

to  further stabilise the price of land.  We  have

succeeded  to  some extent, as  my  colleague  has

pointed  out, in bringing down the prices of  land

by  about  20 per cent in some cases. We  hope  it

will  stay  that way, and does not rocket  to  the

skies again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for introducing this Bill are the

same  as  those  I  mentioned in  introducing  the

amending  Acts of 1971 and 1973, namely,  to  give

effect to recommendations by the U.K. Jenkins



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



Committee   Report   on   Company   Law    Reform,

particularly   insofar  as  these  recommendations

affect  the  principle  of greater  disclosure  of

information  by  companies as a safeguard  against

malpractices   and  the  powers  and   duties   of

directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure of information is an essential part of

the  working  of a free and fair economic  system,

subject  to  certain  limitations  to  allow   for

competitive     situations.     Under     existing

legislation, substantial powers already  exist  to

require  disclosure by directors in their accounts

or  in relation to contracts in which they have an

interest,  or  in any dealings they  may  have  in

their  company shares (including insider dealings)

and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill extends the disclosure principle by

requiring  that  the interests  of  members  of  a

director's  family in contracts with  the  company

shall be treated as an interest of a director  and

will  need  to  be  disclosed to fellow  directors

(clause  14),  and  by requiring  a  director  who

acquires  or  disposes of shares  in  his  company

which  are listed on a Stock Exchange to notify  a

Stock  Exchange which may publish the  information

(clause 17), and by providing that there should be

clear  and specific disclosure in general  meeting

of any alteration in directors' emoluments (clause

18).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a previous occasion in this House, I have made

the  point that there is nothing inherently  wrong

in the practice of holding shares through nominees

and  there  are many circumstances  in  which  the

practice   is   both  normal  and  convenient   on

commercial  and  personal grounds. However,  there

are  circumstances  in  which  concealment  of   a

beneficial  interest  in  a  shareholding  can  be

undesirable. I refer particularly to the situation

known  as  "warehousing", in  which  a  number  of

parties act in undisclosed concert in such  a  way

as not to bring their interest within the existing

provisions  dealing with substantial shareholders.

These  provisions  require  that  those  with   an

interest in the equity of a company of 10 per cent

or  more  have to disclose their interest. Persons

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



evade  the  provisions by acting  in  concert  and

acquiring shareholdings amounting to, for example,

9.5 per cent. This enables such persons to acquire

by  stealth  a  dominant position  in  a  company,

particularly in a take-over situation.  Government

considers  that the risk of abuse of  the  nominee

system  in  this regard will be minimised  if  the

notification  percentage is reduced  from  10  per

cent  to  5 per cent, and if the notification,  in

which   changes  or  cessation  of  a  substantial

shareholding  are to be given to the  company,  is

reduced from 14 days to seven days (clause  9).  A

further provision is inserted which will enable  a

company  to  know  if  a  warehouse  situation  is

developing  or if it is a target for  a  take-over

bid.  This  provision confers  the  right  upon  a

company  to  ascertain the real  identity  of  the

owners of its shares (clause 12).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major amendments proposed in the Bill are

concerned with the powers and duties of directors.

Clause 15 lays down in a new section 132B that the

matter  in  which  directors  of  a  company   are

entitled  to have regard are the interest  of  its

employees  as well as its members. This  provision

serves to emphasise the duty that a company has to

its  employees and may be compared with  clause  4

which includes amongst the powers of a company  to

make  provision for the benefit of  employees  and

former   employees  upon  the  cessation  of   the

business of a company or any subsidiary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause introduces two new provisions which

are important. In section 132D it is provided that

approval  of  a  company  in  general  meeting  is

required  before  directors  of  a  company  issue

shares. The unfettered discretion of directors  to

issue   shares  (once  authorised)  has  sometimes

worked  to  the  detriment  of  shareholders,  for

example,  by  diluting  shareholders'  capital  in

certain  circumstances.  The  imposition  of   the

proposed  form of control will apply to the  issue

of shares for cash or for other consideration. Its

effect   will   be   to  give  more   control   to

shareholders without interfering unduly  with  the

directors' business of managing the company.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in section l32C is a restatement

of the law as at present appears in section 35 (3)

of  the  Act. Power is given to the court  on  the

application of a member of the company to  prevent

directors from carrying into effect proposals  for

disposing of the whole or substantially the  whole

of  the company's undertaking or property; but  if

directors contravene this requirement that such  a

disposal  should  be approved by  the  company  in

general meeting the transaction will not affect  a

purchaser  for  consideration  who  acquires   the

property    without   actual   notice    of    the

contravention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 introduces a new section 133A which

prohibits in subsection (1) thereof a company from

making a loan to another company or to provide any

security   for  a  loan  to  another  company   if

directors  have an interest in the shares  of  the

other  company equal to one-fifth or more  of  the

nominal  value  of its equity share  capital;  and

also prohibits loans to persons who are members of

the  family  of any of its directors.  There  are,

however, certain specific exclusions in subsection

(3)  of  this section which should be  noted.  The

interest  of  a member of a director's  family  is

treated  as  an interest of the director  for  the

purposes  of subsection (1). The purpose  of  this

amendment is to close a loophole which at  present

exists   under  section  133  of  the  Act   which

prohibits  a  company  from making  loans  to  its

directors.  This  section can be  circumvented  by

making  loans to a company in which a director  of

the lending company has effective control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining major amendment to which I would

wish  to  comment upon appears in clause 19  which

amends  section  179 dealing with take-overs.  The

purpose of this amendment is to clarify the status

of  the  Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers.

The  Code  is  not  a statutory  code  but  it  is

intended that it should have statutory backing and

should  have  a  locus standi in relation  to  the

Government.  For  this  reason  it  is   expressly

recognised   by  statute  as  is  the   Securities

Industry  Council which administers  it.  Although

the Code is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



modelled  on  the  City  Code  on  Take-overs  and

Mergers, that Code has not been recognised in  any

legislation in the United Kingdom - it is regarded

purely as a measure for voluntary self-regulation.

The Government takes the view that for the Code to

be  really effective something more than  this  is

needed  although we still adhere to our conviction

that,  in the highly technical field of take-overs

and  mergers, a non-statutory code is a better way

of  dealing  with  this subject  than  by  Act  of

Parliament. The new subsection makes it clear that

breach of the Code is not a criminal offence.  The

Code  may  be  revised from time to time  and  the

public  will  be  advised  of  such  revision   by

notification   in  the  Gazette.  The   Securities

Industry  Council  may from  time  to  time  issue

rulings on the interpretation of the Code and  lay

down  rules  of practice. It is not intended  that

these  rulings should be challenged in the  courts

or  that  the  Code  will be subject  to  judicial

interpretation  for  the Code  is  concerned  with

standards  of conduct to be followed in take-overs

and mergers. Members will also note that in clause

15  a  provision  is inserted in relation  to  the

rulings  of  the Securities Industry  Council  and

lays  down that directors in the exercise of their

powers  are  entitled  to  have  regard  to  these

rulings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement refers to the remaining

amendments  proposed in the Bill and  I  need  not

elaborate upon them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this Bill would appear to introduce a

large number of amendments to the Act, the bulk of

them  are  merely  consequential  amendments  that

arise  as a result of three major amendments  that

are proposed. These amendments appear in clause  2

(dealing  with dealer's licences),  in  clause  19

(repealing Part VIII of the Act which provides for

investment of stockbroker's funds) and  in  clause

23   which  makes  new  provision  for  the  Stock

Exchange fidelity fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal with these three topics in numerical

order.  At  the  time the Act was drafted  persons

could   carry  on  the  business  of  dealing   in

securities  as  a  sole trader, as  partner  in  a

member  firm  or as director of a member  company.

This  is  no  longer the position. Under  the  new

Stock   Exchange  rules  only  persons   who   are

directors of a member company can now be  admitted

as members of the Stock Exchange. The intention of

clause 2 is, therefore, to reflect the position as

it  exists on the Stock Exchange by providing that

a  dealer's  licence shall be granted  only  to  a

corporation.  The great merit in  this  conceptual

change   is   that  corporations  that   deal   in

securities  will be subject not only  to  the  Act

itself but also to the detailed provisions of  the

Companies  Act  (Cap. 185). This will  undoubtedly

operate  to the advantage of the investing  public

because of the greater measure of control that can

be  exercised through the Companies Act. Under the

existing  provisions stockbrokers are required  to

take  out an individual dealer's licence but under

the  new  proposals they will be  required  to  be

licensed as dealers' representatives, that  is  to

say,  as  representatives of the corporation  that

employs   them   or  with  which  they   have   an

arrangement   as   directors.  The   position   of

remisiers will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



remain unchanged in this regard for they also will

be  required  to  take  out licences  as  dealers'

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 14 will have the

additional advantage of streamlining the licensing

provisions  and  make  the administration  of  the

licensing provisions and the regulations  so  much

the easier. Accordingly, all references in the Act

to  dealers  who are partners in a  firm  or  sole

dealers  have been deleted, and the Act  has  been

further amended in various respects to give effect

to the new concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Act which deals with investment

of  stockbroker's  funds is repealed  though  this

will  not  affect the obligation of  a  dealer  to

maintain a trust account under other provisions of

the  Act.  Experience has shown that the  existing

Part  VIII presents serious practical difficulties

to  the  Stock Exchange if it is to be implemented

effectively.  As required by the existing  section

54,  the member company must deposit with a  stock

exchange  an  amount that is  not  less  than  the

prescribed  part  of  the lowest  balance  in  the

company's trust account during the relevant period

(i.e.  12  months). This formula is  difficult  to

implement  since it is not possible for the  Stock

Exchange  to  know  the lowest  balance  unless  a

member  company submits daily bank  statements  or

cash  books  -  this  would place  an  unnecessary

burden upon member companies and lead to all kinds

of   practical   difficulties.  Furthermore,   the

requirement  in this Part that the Stock  Exchange

has to place its deposits from member companies in

interest  bearing  accounts  with  banks   creates

further problems since money so deposited with the

Stock  Exchange are repayable upon  demand.  There

is,  in  any event, no need, having regard to  the

new  provision inserted in this Part  of  the  Act

dealing  with fidelity funds, for interest derived

from  investment  of  deposits  received  by   the

Exchange to be credited to a fidelity fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fidelity fund provisions

themselves, some significant changes are proposed.

At the present time the Fidelity Fund of the Stock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



Exchange  of Singapore stands at over  $2  million

though  section 68 of the Act envisages an  amount

of  $1 million. This large amount of fund money is

derived mainly from the transfer from the fidelity

fund  that  was held jointly by the Singapore  and

Malaysian    Stock   Exchange   and    not    from

contributions   to   the   fund   by    individual

stockbrokers.  Having regard to the present  state

of  fidelity  fund  as well as the  proposals  for

increasing the fund by annual transfers  from  the

Stock  Exchange General Fund, Government considers

that   the   requirement  in   section   67   that

stockbrokers should make an annual contribution of

$1,000  -  which is, in any event, a comparatively

small  amount bearing in mind the total membership

of the Exchange - to the fund, is not necessary as

regards the existing Stock Exchange and inadequate

if  another stock exchange is created; for  annual

contributions  are not likely to be sufficient  to

meet  any liabilities that might arise due to  the

failure  of  even  one  member  company.   It   is

essential  that  a  substantial  amount  of  money

should  already  be  in  a fidelity  fund  on  its

establishment. Under the new sections 67 and 68  a

fidelity  fund will consist of an amount  that  is

not  less than $2 million or such other sum as the

Minister  may  by order determine.  This  fidelity

fund  will be increased annually by payments  into

it  of a sum that is equal to 10 per cent or  more

of  the  net  income  of a stock  exchange.  If  a

fidelity fund falls below $2 million or such other

sum  as  the Minister may determine, the Committee

of  a stock exchange shall take such steps to make

up  the  deficiency as are provided for in section

68.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any time a fidelity fund is not sufficient

to  meet  liabilities, the Committee may impose  a

levy  of such amount as it thinks fit on a  member

company but this levy must not exceed $100,000  in

the aggregate (clause 24).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other amendments that call for special

mention  appear in clause 33 which amends  section

95 of the Act and in clause 3 which amends section

7.  The  amendment  to  section  95  empowers  the

Registrar  to  compound the less serious  offences

which are punishable only by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



a   fine  whether  under  the  Act  or  under  the

Regulations. This provision is a standard one  and

is to be found in many of our Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed in clause 3 is designed to

facilitate  the  administration  of  the  Act   in

relation  to the Minister's approval of amendments

proposed  to  Stock Exchange Rules.  The  existing

provision   in   section  7  has  proved   to   be

inappropriate  and inconvenient for  it  does  not

allow sufficient time for the Minister to consider

the   matter,  particularly  where  as   in   most

instances the Securities Industry Council is asked

to make its recommendations to the Minister on the

proposed amendments. The time element referred  to

in  the  existing  provision has accordingly  been

deleted.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270),

approves the construction by Government of a jetty within the foreshore at Kranji

Industrial Estate as shown coloured red on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE PLAN NO. 2/74",

which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recall that in June, 1965,

this  House approved the reclamation of about  213

acres  of the swamp land in Kranji for development

by  the  Jurong Town Corporation as an  industrial

estate  for  sawmilling.  On  completion  of   the

reclamation, the reclaimed land was proclaimed  as

State  land on 13th August, 1971, and subsequently

alienated  to the Jurong Town Corporation  for  99

years to enable the Corporation, in turn, to  sub-lease the land to the various sawmilling operators

on 30-year leases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land shown edged in red on the plan marked as

"LAND  OFFICE PLAN NO. 2/74", a copy of  which  is

displayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the

information  of Members, is one of the  lots  sub-leased  by  the Corporation to Kwang  Maw  Sawmill

Limited.  The  Corporation  has  now  applied  for

approval to construct a jetty measuring about  430

feet by 25 feet terminating in a platform about 50

feet by 50 feet as shown coloured red on the plan,

to  be used in conjunction with the sawmilling and

woodworking   operations  of  Kwang  Maw   Sawmill
