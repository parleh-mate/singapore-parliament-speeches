&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Member has, under the provisions of

subsection (2) (g) of section 42 of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, obtained

from the Speaker, permission to be or to remain

<div align="center"><b>MESSAGE FROM THE YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Assents to Bills passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received a message from His

Excellency  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  dated  the

17th   November,  1959,  informing  me   that,   in

accordance with the provisions of section 55 (1) of

the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in  Council,

1958,  His Excellency had that day assented to  the

following Bills:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Bill;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Transfer of Powers Bill;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Transfer of Powers (No. 2) Bill.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PASIR PANJANG POWER STATION FLATS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Reserved for occupation by Parliamentary Secretaries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he is aware that all the flats on the first

two floors of the Pasir Panjang Power Station Flats

belonging  to the City Council, with the  exception

of  two,  have  been  reserved  for  occupation  by

Parliamentary Secretaries to the various Ministers,

and  whether he will state the terms of letting  of

these flats and the rents to be charged therefor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No flats in the Pasir Panjang

Power  Station Flats belonging to the City  Council

have   been   reserved  for   occupation   by   any

Parliamentary  Secretary. The question  presupposes

that  the facts were true; they are not. The Member

for  Farrer  Park could do well in not wasting  the

time  of  this  House by first  ensuring  that  the

malicious questions he put are not based  on  false

premises.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime

Minister is in order in alleging that anything said

by  Members in this House is malicious. I  ask  the

Prime Minister to withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Perhaps   the  word  "tendentious"  may   be   less

objectionable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what the

Prime  Minister  had said in reply  to  a  previous

question  of  mine in this Assembly, I see  nothing

tendentious in this question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Honourable Members must

understand that at Question time only supplementary

questions after the main question can be permitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>WATER CONSUMPTION AND MAINTENANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister what

is  the present average daily consumption of water;

the  present safe capacity of the water supply  and

the  annual rate of increase in the consumption  of

water; and what steps the City Council is taking or

proposes  to take to ensure the maintenance  of  an

adequate supply of water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The present average daily

consumption  of water is 62.5 million gallons.  The

average  safe  capacity  for  water  supply  is  65

million  gallons per day under favourable  climatic

conditions  as  at  present.  The  annual  rate  of

increase is 3.5 million gallons per day. There  are

immediate  plans  to increase the output  from  the

Tebrau  Waterworks which would  take  care  of  the

additional  water  demands until the  Johore  River

scheme is completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could the Prime Minister give an

indication  to  the  House when  the  Johore  River

scheme will be commenced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I require notice for that

question, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>BUS SHELTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Numbers erected and repaired)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister to

state  how  many bus shelters have been erected  by

the  City Council from 5th December, 1957, to  31st

October,  1959; how many of such shelters have  had

to  be  repaired or require repair  due  to  faulty

construction; and the cost of such repairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The number of bus shelters

erected  by the City Council from the 5th December,

1957,  to  the  31st October, 1959, is  222.  Three

shelters  have  had to be repaired  due  to  faulty

construction at a cost of $5,720, and  22  shelters

have  had  to  be  strengthened as a  precautionary

measure at a cost of

$7,700.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If there is negligence which is

responsible for the additional cost, will the Prime

Minister  see  to it that the necessary  action  is

taken to have the City Council reimbursed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am sure that, if proof can be

found  for  negligence, the proper  legal  remedies

will be set afoot.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>NICOLL HIGHWAY PROMENADE DEVELOPMENT COSTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for

National Development what is the total cost of  the

Nicoll Highway Promenade Development; what are  the

cost  of materials used in the development and  the

cost  of  labour employed in connection  therewith;

and whether the cost of the development has been or

is  being  charged  to a City  Council  vote  or  a

Government vote, or to both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the total cost of

Nicoll  Highway Promenade is estimated at $192,088.

comprising:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials: broadly classified, - nearly one and a

half  miles  of  concrete  rails  and  assemblying,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost, Mr Speaker, is being charged to

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Can the Minister say whether any part

of  the  cost for labour cited by him went  to  the

payment  of any member of the National Construction

Corps?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. The National

Construction Corps was paid an allowance  of  $3  a

day for their expenses. I have not got full details

of  the  number  of days they have  worked  on  the

Promenade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>OLD KALLANG AIRPORT PARK DEVELOPMENT COSTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for

National Development what is the total cost of  the

Old  Kallang Airport Park Development; what are the

cost  of the materials used in the development  and

the   cost   of   labour  employed  in   connection

therewith;  and whether the cost of the development

has been or is being charged to a City Council vote

or a Government vote, or to both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the total cost of

the  Kallang Park project is estimated at $503,903.

- comprising:



<pre>

                                         $       c.

            Materials                 347,275    29

            Transport                  15,372    78

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 50 items of materials, but I

have classified them under a few broad categories:



<pre>

                                         $       c.

        Purchase of bricks,            86,850    12

                                         $        c.

        Payment to contractors        144,329     84

            for laying sub-mains,

            construction of bathing

            pools, railings, public

            conveniences, turfing,

            etc.



            Sundries, like hire of      3,510     33

            portable latrines from

            City Council, repairs

            to machinery, etc.



            Street lamps               77,585     00

            Outstanding bills for      35,000     00

            materials estimated



        Labour is classified into two categories:



            City Council and P.W.D.   135,306     37

            labour which is

            transferred to this

            Kallang project



            Outside labour              5,949     02



        Transport:-



            City Council lorries,      11,068     56

            which is a transfer item

            to this Vote



            Outside lorries             4,304     22

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the total cost is being charged to City Council votes. The expenditure of nearly half

a  million  dollars,  out  of  which  $150,000  are

transfer items, which is not the real cost, leaving

a   total   expenditure   of   $350,000,   compares

favourably  with  the $3 million estimated  by  the

previous  City Council for the development  of  the

former  Kallang  Airport into  a  public  park  and

recreational space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project had been discussed by the old

Government since 1955 and (there is a big  file  in

my possession) no work had been done. The files and

correspondence have been built up for four or  five

years,  and  it is only when the P.A.P.  Government

came  in  that  work  was started  immediately  and

completed.

<div align="center"><b>BILL INTRODUCED</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>PINEAPPLE INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to  introduce  a  Bill intituled "An  Ordinance  to

amend  the Pineapple Industry Ordinance, 1957  (No.

15 of 1957)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

lay  upon the Table a Certificate of Urgency signed

by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in respect  of  the

Pineapple Industry (Amendment)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed  copies of the Bill available for the use  of

Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (3) of section 7 of the existing

Pineapple   Industry  Ordinance   does   not   make

provision   for  the  functions  of   the   Malayan

Pineapple  Industry Board to include the  grant  of

financial assistance, whether by way of subsidy  or

otherwise,  to the industry as a whole  or  to  any

section  thereof, and the Governments of the  State

of  Singapore and the Federation of Malaya consider

that  this provision is essential in the  light  of

past experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the urgency of this amendment is

to  enable the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board  to

assist  any section or sections of the industry  in

the event of a crisis which is expected in December

1959.  Similar amending legislation is being  taken

through  all its stages in the Federation House  of

Representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment of subsection (1) of section 8 of

the  Ordinance  is  to  enable  the  Minister,   in

consultation with the Board, to make an  order  for

the    imposition,   collection,    variation    or

cancellation of a cess or cesses on the exportation

of  canned pineapples, instead of doing so only  on

the  recommendation  of  the  Board.  This  may  be

necessary   in  order  to  raise  funds   for   the

assistance of any section or sections of industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill- [Mr Low Por Tuck].

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ordinary times, the presentation of the budget

by the Government of the day is always an important

occasion.  For  the budget sets out in  detail  the

Government's  proposals for  the  coming  financial

year. It describes the ways in which the Government

intends to raise its revenue. It gives a blue print

of expenditure by each department of Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This occasion, however, holds even greater

historical importance than one normally attaches to

Government budgets. This is the first budget of the

People's Action Party Government elected under  the

new  self-governing constitution of  Singapore.  On

this  occasion, therefore, it would be  appropriate

for  me  to  do  a wider survey of  events  and  to

venture  further afield than is the normal practice

of  Finance Ministers when presenting their  annual

budgets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a democratic socialist Government and our

purpose,  within  the five years  of  our  stay  in

office, is to produce at the end of it a more  just

society  in  which the democratic institutions  and

practices  would be more firmly rooted. An  elected

Government which enjoys the support of the mass  of

the people must have objectives basically different

from  the  Government  that it  replaced.  It  will

strive  to  remove  those glaring injustices  which

still  remain  in  our society.  It  will  seek  to

eliminate the forms of exploitation of men  by  men

which the exploiters, through being tolerated  over

the  years,  have come to regard as customary  and,

indeed,  normal. It will strive to  bring  for  the

ordinary man the full fruits of his labour. And  in

so  doing  it must resolve also those conflicts  of

interest  which  inevitably will arise  within  our

society  and  which  may threaten  to  disrupt  the

orderly progress of social adjustment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things, these objectives take

time  to  attain.  For  we  are  committed  to  the

democratic  process  by  which  changes  are   made

through the processes of law and carried out by the

administrative machine which we inherit. There  is,

therefore,  the need, whilst making these  changes,

to  retain some continuity with the past.  And  the

process  of  national budgetting  illustrates  this

very clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of a Government budget is a

lengthy   and   involved  process.   The   original

proposals  on  which  this  budget  is  based  were

initiated early this year, months before the P.A.P.

Government  assumed office. It is not  possible  to

scrap  all these proposals nor, within the time  at

our disposal, to introduce new procedures and start

completely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



afresh.  The  establishment  scales  of  Government

Departments  have  to be carried forward  and  such

adjustments  to it as are being made  are  marginal

ones.  To  do otherwise at this stage would  be  to

invite a breakdown of the machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this extent, therefore, the budget which I

have the honour to present to the Assembly is based

to  a  considerable  extent on  the  administrative

practices  and  policies which have been  built  up

over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary in presenting the budget for the

Finance  Minister  to make a brief  review  of  the

economy  and  to assess prospects for the  year  to

come. In Singapore, we have an open economy and the

level  of business activity is conditioned  not  so

much  by  what  we  ourselves  do  as  by  economic

conditions in neighbouring territories.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Federation of Malaya</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the general position outside

Singapore  must  begin with our closest  neighbour,

the   Federation  of  Malaya.  1958  has   been   a

remarkable year for the Federation. The decline  in

the  price  of  rubber  which  began  in  1957  and

continued steadily ever since was arrested in  this

year.  Before  this,  the  Federation  had  several

anxious  moments  when an enormous  budget  deficit

loomed  over the horizon because of the decline  in

the revenue on the export duty on rubber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily the world economic expansion caught up

with  the  total available supply of  rubber,  both

natural  and synthetic, and as inevitably  happens,

the  price of rubber increases. At first, there was

hesitation owing to the uncertainties of the rubber

stockpiling  policy of the U.S.  Government.  When,

however, it appeared that stock releases,  both  in

America  and  the United Kingdom, were insufficient

to  fulfil the needs for rubber, especially of  the

higher  grades,  the  spectacular  rise  in  rubber

prices  followed. Thus the Federation's  threatened

difficulties disappeared almost overnight. The  way

was open to them to prepare a prosperity budget for

1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosperity in the Federation inevitably brings

with  it  an  increase in business in Singapore  so

long  as  the two territories are agreed that  they

should  work  as one economic unit, whatever  their

political divisions may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government, through its prudent

action  in laying aside substantial sums  of  money

for  replanting  of rubber, has  assured  that  its

economic   strength,  which   today   still   rests

principally on rubber, will continue in  the  years

to   come.  It  has  also  set  in  motion  a  very

successful programme of industrial growth. There is

a major building boom in Kuala Lumpur today and all

these,  together  with  the high  targets  set  for

development  expenditure in  1960,  will  ensure  a

steady expansion of the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two developments in the Federation give

cause  for  concern  in Singapore.  There  is,  for

instance,  the valuation on a new basis  of  branch

transfers  between  Singapore  concerns  and  their

branches in the Federation. This recent move by the

Federation Government is being studied by Singapore

and  it is hoped that, whatever the merits of  this

particular  action, the Federation will not  pursue

any policy designed to isolate Singapore whose port

and  commercial facilities have served her so  well

over  the  past years, to the mutual  advantage  of

both territories.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Indonesia</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to our second great neighbour,

Indonesia.  Our  trade with her is  of  importance.

Through  numerous  little  ships,  we  supply   the

scattered  islands  of  the Indonesian  Archipelago

with  much  of  their basic needs. In  return,  our

traders bring back the many varied tropical produce

of these islands and, after processing them, export

them  to  the great markets of the world.  On  this

trade   and   its   allied   services,   such    as

transportation,  handling of  cargoes,  processing,

finance  and  insurance, depends the livelihood  of

large  numbers of our population. What  happens  in

Indonesia   has  therefore  immediate  and   direct

economic consequences to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this trade is of benefit to both parties. On

our  side  we  hope that the Indonesian  Government

will  not  look  upon Singapore  as  a  parasitical

centre  of traders living off the fat of Indonesian

primary  producers. I shall later give  figures  to

show    that   the   Indonesian   economy   derives

substantial  benefits from our  trade.  We  are  an

entrepot  and we survive because we offer the  best

prices which the primary producers around us,  both

in  Indonesia  and the Federation  of  Malaya,  can

obtain.  Through our efficient shipping and banking

facilities,  we make it easier for these  producers

to dispose of their products in the great commodity

markets  of  the world at the best prices  possible

and  we of Singapore wish for nothing more than  to

see  Indonesia  overcome her economic  difficulties

and bring about those conditions under which honest

traders can conduct their business on a stable  and

permanent basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would not attempt to Whitewash Singapore

completely. Unfortunately, in the past this country

has given refuge to elements hostile to the present

Government  of Indonesia. We have thereby  incurred

their displeasure and quite naturally so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government cannot be held responsible

for  the acts of its predecessors. We have made  it

abundantly clear to the Indonesian authorities that

we  wish for a new basis and a new approach to  our

mutual problems. Our relations with Indonesia  have

immensely   improved  since  the  advent   of   our

Government.  We  shall  continue  our  efforts   to

improve upon them. We have undertaken not to  allow

any  action  to  proceed  in  Singapore  which   is

directed  against  the security of  the  Indonesian

State. This assurance we shall fulfil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the improved relationships with

Indonesia,  there  is the trade agreement  recently

concluded between the Governments of Singapore  and

Indonesia  on  the  supply of  raw  cotton  to  our

spinning  mills for processing and  return  in  the

form  of yarn to Indonesia. This is a small  symbol

of  the  new spirit of mutual respect which we  all

hope will grow in the years to come. I am sure that

members of the Assembly will join me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



in  congratulating our Deputy Prime Minister on the

success   of   his   efforts  to   promote   better

relationships between the two territories.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Singapore in 1959</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the year 1959 had been a period of

some  uncertainty. The first half of the  year  was

notable  for  a  general attitude  of  wait-and-see

adopted by business enterprises. It was a period of

comparative  stagnation. The reason was  of  course

the  impending general elections, scheduled to take

place in May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, possible to exaggerate the extent

of  the  trade recession. The total trade  for  the

first  half of the year stood at $2,787 million  as

against $2,960 million for the first half of  1958.

The decline was less than 6 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Government assumed office, trade has

picked  up somewhat. The value of imports  for  the

period  July  to October this year averaged  $261.5

million  per month as against $255 million for  the

first  half  of  the  year. The  value  of  exports

increased to a more marked extent. Exports  in  the

last four months ran at $236.3 million per month as

against  $211 million per month for the first  half

of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore see that the scare about the

decline  in  business  generated  by  the  cuts  in

variable allowance was largely unfounded. Even  the

Singaporean's capacity to enjoy himself  showed  no

decline  in the last few months as the receipts  on

entertainment duty and liquor revenue plainly show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared with the similar period last year,

recent trading conditions showed an improvement  of

about  10 per cent in respect of imports and nearly

30  per  cent  in  respect of exports.  These  more

favourable  trade  figures result principally  from

the  higher  prices of rubber and so  long  as  the

present  state  of the market can be sustained,  we

can  look forward to an increase in incomes in  the

months to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian trade, however, witnessed a grievous

decline  in  exports from Singapore. In  the  first

nine  months of 1958 exports to Indonesia  totalled

$276.2 million. For the corresponding period this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



year,  the total dropped to just over one-third  of

this figure, $107.5 million. This decline was  due

to  the  severe restrictions on imports  introduced

this year by the Indonesian Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against the decline in exports, imports from

Indonesia  showed  a  substantial  increase,   from

$662.7  million for the period January to September

1958  to  $837.6 million for the same  period  this

year.  These  figures show that  Indonesia  derives

considerable  benefit by way  of  foreign  exchange

earnings in their trade with Singapore and  it  was

Singapore's  trade lines that made it possible  for

her  to  have  disposed of so  much  quantities  of

produce through the ready made market of Singapore.

There   is   therefore  every   justification   for

Singapore  to ask for a relaxation on the  controls

on   Singapore   exports  of  consumer   goods   to

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building trade in Singapore, however, went

through a difficult period. The statistics  on  the

number  of  buildings completed this year  for  the

period January to August are misleading. They  seem

to  indicate  that  the level of  activity  in  the

building  and construction trade was  at  least  as

much as that for the same period last year. Figures

on  the  production of local building material  are

probably   better  indicators  as   they   show   a

considerable decline in 1959 as compared with 1958.

The production of bricks for the first eight months

fell  from  51  million in 1958 to 38 million  this

year. The production of broken granite dropped from

391,000 cu. yds, to 243,000 cu. yds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local industries were adversely affected for a

variety of reasons. The local soap industries, sago

flour  production, coconut oil and rubber  footwear

registered  declines. The reasons were varied.  The

local  rubber  footwear  industries  suffered  from

overseas   competition,  primarily  from   Japanese

sources. The coconut oil industry is plagued  by  a

shortage  of  copra imports. The rubber  re-milling

industry, however, saw more activity this  year  as

imports  of rubber increased consequent  on  higher

prices.  The biscuit industry maintained an  active

tempo.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of electricity and gas both for

domestic and industrial purposes continues the rate

of  increase  shown  in the  last  few  years.  The

consumption  of  petrol and liquor  maintained  the

normal  expected rate of increase. In the  case  of

cigarettes,  the  revenue declined,  but  this  was

principally  due  to  a  switchover  from  imported

cigarettes to local brands. This developed  such  a

threat  to  the  revenue that it was  necessary  to

introduce  last  September changes  in  the  import

duties  on  cut tobacco and the cheaper  brands  of

cigarettes  in  order  to  arrest  the  decline  in

tobacco revenue.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Common Market</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foregoing review of trade and production

figures, it is clear that a special effort must  be

made to stimulate business activities in Singapore.

In   the  case  of  trade,  much  depends  on   the

prosperity of our neighbours. I have already  dwelt

on   this  in  my  remarks  on  conditions  in  the

Federation of Malaya and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of promoting the growth of industry

is  one  to which the Government is paying constant

attention.  This has both its long term  and  short

term aspects. In the long term, whether or not  the

country will survive as a going concern depends  on

the  extent  to  which our attempt to industrialise

the  economy  succeeds.  In  the  short  term,  the

immediate problem is to stimulate the basic demands

for  products already being produced.  As  I  shall

describe  later, the prospects for  so  doing  next

year are excellent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term policy of creating new industries,

however,  is a more complex one. It is  clear  that

the  domestic market limited by a population of our

size will attract only a small range of industries.

If  industries  established in Singapore  could  be

assured  of a more extensive market, e.g. that  of

the  Federation and Singapore combined, we can look

forward   with  greater  confidence  to  industrial

expansion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me immediately to the question of a

common market with the Federation. It has been  one

of  the  major points in our election programme  to

achieve  this.  And  this may  be  the  appropriate

moment  in  which to give a broad  outline  of  the

proposals  which  we have made  to  the  Federation

Government  for  the  establishment  of  a   common

market. It is not possible to go into great  detail

as   the  matter  is  under  consideration  by  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one talks of a common market, one usually

has in mind two varieties following the practice in

Western  European countries. The first is a customs

union in which the territories proposing to form  a

common  market attempt, within a given  period,  to

set  up similar customs duties against imports from

outside  the area. In other words, if  we  were  to

have  a customs union with the Federation, we shall

impose  on  our  imports the  same  duties  as  the

Federation does, while permitting the free movement

of goods between the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other form of a common market is the free

trade  area.  Under this arrangement, each  partner

retains  independence of action as regards  customs

duties  on  goods coming in. There is a same  duty-free movement of goods between partners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that neither of these systems would

be  acceptable both to the Federation of Malaya and

Singapore.  A  Custom's Union may ruin  Singapore's

entrepot trade which is based on duty-free  imports

of such goods as enter the entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a free trade area may give a

preponderant advantage to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore thought out a third hybrid

which,  in  good  conscience,  we  believe  to   be

attractive  enough  to  the  Federation  of  Malaya

without  at  the same time incurring  the  risk  of

destroying our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a modified form of a Customs Union. It is

proposed  that the list of goods be agreed  between

the two Governments on which similar duties would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



be  levied in both territories against imports from

overseas.  These  goods will not  be  charged  with

customs  duties  if  they are  produced  in  either

territory on entering the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of common market may be called a

commodity  common  market. The  commodities  to  be

included would naturally be those which offer  good

prospects  of local production either in  Singapore

or  the  Federation. They would not  include  goods

which enter extensively into our entrepot trade. As

a  corollary  to  the commodity common  market,  it

would    be    necessary    to    integrate     the

industrialisation programme of the two  territories

so   that,   in  lines  of  production  where   one

production   unit  is  sufficient  to  cover   both

markets, there would be arrangements for the zoning

of such units. This would enable more efficient and

more  competitive industries to be established  and

further  would  avoid the danger of  having  excess

capacity installed in relation to consumer demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our proposals to the Federation

Government  and these are being examined.  We  have

also  requested  that  the proposals  submitted  be

examined  by  a Joint Committee of Officials.  This

Committee  could  go  into  great  detail  on   the

implications of the system proposed and report back

to   the   respective  Governments  what  are   the

differences that still remain to be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from the foregoing account that an

arrangement  of this kind accepts the fact  of  the

economic unity of the two territories. Whatever the

political  divisions, it is obvious that they  must

co-operate  in  economic fields  and  it  would  be

injurious  to both countries to take an independent

and   competitive  line  of  action  in   promoting

industrial  growth. From the point of view  of  the

prospective   manufacturer,   the   attraction   of

investing  in  Malaya would immensely  increase.  A

Federation investor, for instance, would be assured

of  a protected market not only in his own country,

but  also  in  Singapore.  Similarly,  a  Singapore

manufacturer would not have to surmount  the  tariff

wall   which  the  Federation  now  places  against

Singapore products. It is therefore hoped that an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



early  decision  would  be reached.  Any  delay  in

reaching   a  decision  would  merely   mean   that

prospective  investors may be induced  to  adopt  a

waiting policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attraction as a partner to the common

market  is much greater than the comparison of  the

population  figures  of the two  territories  would

suggest.  While the Federation has more  than  four

persons to one Singaporean, the purchasing power of

the two territories by no means follows this ratio.

This is because a concentrated urban population has

a  higher  purchasing power than a dispersed  rural

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958 separate figures of foreign trade were

published  for the first time which would  give  an

indication  of the potential market in manufactures

in the two territories. In Singapore the imports of

manufactured  goods  for domestic  consumption  for

1958 was $489 million. The corresponding figure for

the  Federation was $630 million. The disparity  in

purchasing  power  is therefore  considerably  less

than the ratio of population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this gives the overall totals and

there would be considerable variation in respect of

individual  commodities. At the same  time,  it  is

well to remember that Singapore has an enormous re-export  market in manufactures which  an  efficient

industrial concern can penetrate. The re-export  of

manufactured goods from Singapore in 1958 was  $293

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give these figures to show that the integration

of  the two economies would produce benefits  which

are  not as one-sided as some people may think.  On

the  contrary, the access to a protected market  in

Singapore  for Federation manufactures  must  be  a

factor   which  would  increase  considerably   the

attractiveness and profitability of enterprises  in

the Federation.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Financial Review of 1959</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget for 1959 which this Government

inherited  was framed on a standstill  basis.  This

meant that only sufficient provision was entered in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



Estimates   for  works  and  services  which   were

considered  necessary  to  maintain  the   existing

Government  machinery. New services and development

expenditure  had  to  be  provided  to   meet   the

expansion  in  educational  and  medical   services

demanded by the growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total expenditure of $269 million was envisaged

in  the  Ordinary  Estimates  as  against  a  total

revenue   of  $265  million.  The  last  Government

budgetted for a deficit of $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Budget was planned at $42

million.  This  was to be financed by  $20  million

from  the Ordinary Estimates, $18 million from  the

General  Revenue Reserve and $4 million from  other

sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total deficit in the Ordinary and Development

Estimates  combined was therefore of the  order  of

$22  million. However, before the general elections

in  May,  supplementary provisions were voted  for,

totalling  $10 million. This further increased  the

expected deficit to $32 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the revenue from tobacco began

to  fall in an alarming way due to the transfer  of

consumer choice from imported cigarettes, on  which

the   duty   was   high,  to  locally  manufactured

cigarettes made from cut tobacco, on which the duty

was  kept  low. A shortfall of $10 million  on  the

tobacco revenue was expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If events were allowed to take their course, we

will  find  that our deficit, taking both  ordinary

expenditure and the development estimates together,

would eventually amount to $42 million. That is  to

say  that  this would be the total decline  in  the

General Revenue Balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position would be unacceptable to any prudent

Government  and consequently economy measures  were

introduced.  This was especially necessary  as  the

substantial  surpluses accruing in the  boom  years

and amounting to $325 million had very largely been

spent. While it is true that some of these had been

converted  into concrete forms, such as new  school

buildings, new S.I.T.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



houses,  improved roads and so forth, this  however

provides  a  very  scant  consolation  to  the  new

Government which had its own ambitions in  the  way

of  a  development programme. The economy  measures

which  we introduced are so recent that it  is  not

necessary  to recapitulate them in detail.  Briefly

they fall under three main headings. There was  the

cut in variable allowances; there was the cessation

of   development  projects  which  had   not   been

commenced  and, finally, there was the freezing  of

vacant posts and uncommitted special expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action had also been taken to bolster up the

declining  revenue from tobacco.  While  increasing

the  tobacco  duty  to  check the  severe  decline,

opportunity to the same level as that obtaining  in

the  Federation.  At the same time  a  tax  on  the

hiring  of films was introduced, was also taken  to

bring  the  petrol duty. All these measures,  though

they failed to bring revenue to the estimated total

of  $265  million, nevertheless, had the effect  of

bridging what, at one time, threatened to be a most

serious gap between revenue and expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two months ago, I reported to the Assembly

that  the  effect of these measures, together  with

prospective increases in taxation, would mean  that

we  should just about balance our budget at the end

of the year. The latest revised Estimates show that

total  expenditure will amount to $257 million  and

revenue to about $258 million, leaving a surplus of

about $1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government had not acted as promptly and

as  decisively as it did, we would have  ended  the

year  in  the  red.  The deficit  on  the  Ordinary

Estimates  would  have been at least  $20  million,

consisting  of $12 million by way of reductions  in

expenditure  that would not have  taken  place,  $4

million in revenue shortfalls plus the original  $4

million deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exertions of the Government, unpleasant

though  some of the consequences were, had achieved

the  objective of placing the finances of the State

on   a   sound  footing.  Nothing  could  be   more

disastrous for this Government than to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



find  in the first six months of its term of office

that serious inroads had been made on the financial

reserves as a result of a very large deficit.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Ordinary Budget</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the 1960 Ordinary Estimates. As I

mentioned  before, the process of budgetting  is  a

continuous one. Hardly had the budget for one  year

been  approved by the Assembly then all departments

and  Ministries begin to think and plan  ahead  for

the Estimate proposals for the following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Ordinary Estimates for 1960,

the  present Government was confronted by what  was

really  a  fait  accompli. The first  cast  of  the

Estimates  which was presented to me was so  dismal

in   outlook   that  I  asked  for   an   immediate

reconsideration  of expenditure items.  Members  of

the  House  have  been constantly assailed  by  the

spectre of budget deficits and may by now have been

persuaded that the whole thing is a bogey  conjured

up  by the Finance Minister with some ill intent in

mind. I assure Members that this is not so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words on the trends of revenue

and  expenditure in the last few years.  Ten  years

ago  revenue  collection totalled  $180.8  million.

Expenditure  was  then $94.3 million.  In  1953  we

reaped the full harvest of the post-Korean War boom

and revenue collected totalled $238.5 million. From

1954  to 1957 revenue varied between $207.3 million

and  $241.5  million. The high figure for  1958  of

$271.4  million included a windfall of $20  million

from  the  sale of Christmas Island.  Increases  in

Income  Tax  rates introduced for  1959  brought  a

slight  revenue  increase but it  is  now  becoming

clear that the revenue had lost the buoyancy of the

immediate post-Korean War years. We had reached the

plateau in revenue yields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, expenditure went up

relentlessly.  In  particular  the  expenditure  on

social  services  seemed  to  have  an  independent

momentum  of  its  own. By 1958 it became  apparent

that  the natural growth of expenditure had reached

the tax plateau and was continuing to forge ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so much that the Civil Service had been

accustomed  to lavish and extravagant standards  of

expenditure but that we are now paying very  dearly

for  the  enormous birth rates that  had  been  the

feature of post-war Singapore. The large number  of

babies  born every year may be a welcome  testimony

to  the virility of the population. But it sets  in

store  problems of nightmarish proportions for  the

Finance   Minister  of  Singapore.  For  with   the

increase  in  population in Singapore,  there  must

follow  inevitably  increases  in  expenditure   on

education, health and the social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may, as we are now doing, take severe measures

to keep expenditure within available resources, but

however ingenious we can be, the growing population

exerts  its  inexorable pressure. Where  population

increases  are  not  matched by  increases  in  the

national  income, the country will inevitably  head

for  a breaking point. For there is a limit to  the

tax  capacity  of  any economic system.  I  am  not

saying   that  we  have  reached  this   limit   in

Singapore.  But  it  is  obvious  that  unless  the

national  income can be increased as  fast  as  the

growth in population, we shall be faced either with

the  scaling down of the volume of public  services

or we must undertake further reductions in the cost

of these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore of paramount importance for the

future  well-being of Singapore to ensure that  the

national income grows as fast as the population and

where   this  growth  is  not  possible,   due   to

circumstances  beyond  our control,  we  must  make

every  effort  to slow down the rate of  population

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a simple but graphic illustration of

the  effect  of the population growth on Government

expenditure.  I  shall  take  the  expenditure   on

education   not  merely  because   this   is   most

immediately  affected by the growth  of  population

but  also because the increases in expenditure  can

be foreseen and calculated with accuracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school children now attending the primary

schools consist of those children born between  the

years 1946 and 1952.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



During these seven years, 318,000 babies were born.

Seven  years  from now the children  attending  our

primary  schools would be those born  between  1953

and  1959. The number of births in this period  was

423,000, an increase of exactly one-third.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, we shall be spending a total of $87.2

million  on  education,  $65.3  million  being  the

running  cost and $21.9 million being  the  capital

expenditure on new schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can assume that the increase in the number of

children  in  primary schools in 1967  will  be  at

least one-third greater than the number now. If - and

I  stress  this - we  were  merely  to  maintain  the

present  ratio of children of school going  age  to

children attending school and not increase on it we

shall  have  to spend one-third more  on  education

than  we  now  do.  Allowing  for  the  decline  in

infantile mortality rates, we can expect at least a

40  per cent increase in children of primary school

age in seven years' time as compared with now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1967, therefore, we shall have to spend not

less than $122 million a year on education, that is

if  we  are  satisfied  only  to  maintain  present

standards. If we want to give every child  a  place

in  school and if we want to increase the number of

children  receiving secondary and higher education,

the  figure  may  well be 50 per cent  greater.  In

other words, by 1967, if we want to make strides in

our education programme, we shall have to spend  in

one year, some $180 million on education alone. And

this  sum  is  nearly 70% of the  total  Government

revenue as it now stands. It covers the whole yield

of  Income Tax and Customs duties on liquor, petrol

and  tobacco.  If  anybody were  to  say  that  the

increases  envisaged here are improbable,  I  would

refer  them  to  the  increases in  expenditure  on

Education  between 1953 and 1960.  These  increases

were much greater proportionately than what is  set

out above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the first cast of the Estimates;

there  was  no  other way but to call  for  further

reductions   in   expenditure  and  accordingly   a

circular  was  issued  informing  departments  that

unless they could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



offer offset savings, no new items or increases  of

expenditure will be entered in the 1960  Estimates,

other   than   those  resulting  from   commitments

approved  by  this Government. It was  possible  to

reduce the expenditure by $10 million in this  way,

but  at  the last moment, however, the Ministry  of

Education  submitted late proposals for  a  further

increase  of  $4  million.  There  was  no  way  of

avoiding this expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to new appointments these have been

kept to the barest minimum. 1,109 new posts will be

created in 1960 as against 885 in 1959 and 1,622 in

1958. Of the 1,109 new posts all except 80 are  for

the   Ministries  of  Education  and  Health.   The

majority  of  these 80 new posts have been  created

against deletions of existing posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure, including revotes, now

stands  at  $275.3 million as against  an  expected

revenue  of  $269.2 million, leaving a  deficit  of

$6.1 million.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Ordinary Expenditure</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described some of the steps taken to keep

expenditure within distance of estimated revenue. I

shall  now  describe some of the  more  significant

items of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the re-grouping of

departments into Ministries and the creation of two

new Ministries, and the abolition of one. There  is

further  the  measures initiated to integrate  City

Council  departments  into the  Central  Government

Ministries. I shall refer to this at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-grouping of departments and Ministries is

now  familiar history and I need not expand on  it.

The   estimates  themselves  show  in  detail   how

departments have been re-allocated to Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most departments show less expenditure in 1960 as

compared  with  the previous year. Special  mention

may  be made of the Police who in 1960 are expected

to  spend $1½ million less than in 1959,  a  most

welcome  reversal of past trend of mounting  Police

expenditure.  The Police expenditure had  increased

from  $8.2  million in 1950 to $24.4  million  nine

years  later. No one would deny the need for having

a strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



arm   of   the   law.  Nevertheless   the   reduced

expenditure  on the Police should not  bring  about

any  deterioration  in  efficiency,  for  with  the

support  of  the  public which a popularly  elected

Government  can  rally round the Police,  there  is

every indication that the efficiency of their  work

would  be enhanced. The efficiency of their  recent

action against gangsters proves this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the economy measures undertaken,

most  Heads of Expenditure show reductions for 1960

as  compared with 1959. Of 47 Heads of expenditure,

25   show  reductions,  one  head  of  expenditure,

namely, Head 43 - Film Censorship, shows an identical

amount  as  between 1960 and the revised  estimates

for 1959. 24 heads of expenditure show increases of

varying degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance shows a saving of $2.3

million in 1960 as compared with the revised figure

for 1959. I would like to believe that this results

from  a  more Spartan degree of self-denial on  the

part  of  the Minister. This however would  not  be

wholly  true.  The  reasons are more  mundane.  The

savings   are   principally   due   to   accounting

transfers.  Repayment of War Damage  Interest  Free

Loan  of  $1.5  million has been  removed  to  Head

23 - Charge on Account of the Public Debt.  The  task

of   luring  tourists  to  our  shores - formerly  my

responsibility - now falls on the broad shoulders  of

my colleague the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions of expenditure under other heads

are  principally the effect of the cuts in variable

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Heads of expenditure which show

substantial  increases, those heads of  expenditure

which  provide  the  social  services  continue  to

increase.  Head 21 - Health shows an  increase  from

$33.3 million to $35.2 million, an increase of $1.9

million.  Head 37 - Social Welfare shows an  increase

from $11.3 million to $13.6 million, an increase of

$2.3  million. There is also the perennial increase

in  expenditure on Public Assistance which in  1960

is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  as  against  $6.7

million this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred to the increase in the

running cost of Education which in 1960 will  reach

$65.3  million,  an increase of $3.8  million  over

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above represents the increases in expenditure

on  the  social services which must be regarded  as

unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next group of heads of expenditure which

show increases, the reason is that these relate  to

departments  which provide commercial  services  of

one  kind  or  the  other  to  the  public  and  to

business.  The  Marine Department  and  the  Marine

Surveys   Department  show  slight   increases   in

expenditure.  No one would grudge the  increase  in

the    expenditure   on   Postal    Services    and

Telecommunications which are necessary to  keep  up

with increased demand for these services. These, by

and large, pay for themselves. Similarly the Survey

Department  and  the Trade Marks  Registry  provide

services to the public and to the trading community

and the cost for these must be met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8 - Civil Aviation, however, is a different

proposition. There is an increase of half a million

dollars  in  the estimated expenditure in  1960  as

compared with 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as we prize our Airport, the time has come

to  consider  whether it is justified to  subsidise

the   operations  of  the  Airport  by  an   amount

exceeding $2 million a year. It is hoped that  ways

and means will be found to increase the earnings of

the  Airport, improve its efficiency and reduce the

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items of major importance which

show   sizable   increases  are  either   statutory

payments such as Head 23 - Charge on Account  of  the

Public   Debt   and   Head  24 - Pensions,   Retiring

Allowances  and Gratuities. The latter  expenditure

goes  up  from  $16.8 million to $18.6  million  in

1960,  an  increase  of  $1.4  million.  These  are

statutory  payments and nothing more need  be  said

about  it.  The  Charge on Public Debt  is  also  a

statutory  payment and shows an  increase  of  $6.6

million  in  1960,  the  expenditure  being   $13.3

million  as  against $5.7 million  this  year.  The

principal increases appear on page 208, Subheads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



4  to  7. These provide for the payment of interest

on  short term Treasury Bills and Treasury deposits

which it is proposed to float next year. There is a

demand  for  Treasury  Bills  by  banks  and  other

institutions  which have surpluses  of  cash  which

they  want  to keep in interest-bearing short  term

liquid assets. It is also intended that an approach

be  made  to the small savers who may want  to  set

aside  their  savings  in the  form  of  bonds  and

savings certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are measures which the Government

proposes  to  take  in  1960  with  the  object  of

mobilising  domestic savings and  putting  them  to

productive  uses. Subhead 11, O.C.A.R. under  Head

23, Repayment of War Damage Interest Free Loan - $1.5

million  is  merely  a transfer  item  referred  to

previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rural Board shows an increase of $4.9 million

in  1960, the estimated expenditure under  Head  19

increasing from $3.2 million to $8.2 million.  This

is purely an accounting transfer resulting from the

integration  of Local Government into  the  Central

Government.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Revenue</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue for 1960 is $269.2 million

as against a revised estimate of $259.2 million for

1959.  The  estimated revenue shows an increase  of

$10  million  as against 1959. These estimates  are

based on the same rates of taxation in all fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, considerable variations in a

few  individual  items, though for  the  most  part

items  of  revenue have been taken at substantially

the same level as 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these changes are principally due to

changes  in  the accounting system consequent  upon

the  integration of the District Councils into  the

Central  Government. For instance, the Rural  Board

Revenues  which were formerly shown as an  appendix

in  the  Estimates are now in the Estimates itself.

This  accounts for a total of $6.5 million  of  the

extra  yield of $10 million. The net real  increase

in revenue is therefore $3.5 million only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the principal items of revenue, income tax is

estimated to yield $65 million for 1960 as  against

$76 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



in  1959.  The decline is due partly  to  the  less

favourable  trading conditions in 1959 as  compared

with  1958. It is expected that incomes and, hence,

the  tax  on incomes, would be lower this  year  as

compared with last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the fact that in the course of the

year    several    companies   transferred    their

headquarters   from  Singapore  to  other   places,

principally   the  Federation  of   Malaya.   Their

operations  in  Singapore,  however,  continue   as

before,  but  the  transfer of Head  Offices  would

mean,  under  the  provisions  of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance, a deferment of tax payment which  would,

accordingly, reduce the amount payable in 1960. The

recent  increases  in the rates  of  petroleum  and

tobacco duty are expected to have an effect on  the

yield  of  these  duties next  year.  Petroleum  is

expected to yield $40.4 million in 1960 as  against

$35 million this year. The duty on tobacco goes  up

from  $34.2 million to $43.1 million. But this item

needs   close  watching.  It  is  based  on  certain

assumptions  about  consumer  preferences   between

locally    produced   cigarettes    and    imported

cigarettes.  It  remains to be seen  whether  these

assumptions will, in fact, be justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected yield of revenue from all sources

clearly demonstrates the point I made earlier  that

we  have  reached the tax plateau given the present

basis of personal incomes, consumer expenditure and

tax  structure. Such marginal adjustments  as  have

been  made in the past year or two as well as those

that  are contemplated for next year will  not  produce  the spectacular revenue increases which  were

witnessed during the period 1950 to 1953  when  the

total revenue more than doubled in four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the period during which the post Korean

war  boom tools place and brought about both  rapid

increases  in  incomes as well  as  a  considerable

amount of capital accumulation. The initial impulse

was,  of  course, external and we benefited largely

in a fortuitous manner. If we want to bring about a

similar expansion in the economy, it would  be  too

risky  a policy to wait for a repetition of such  a

stroke of good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



fortune.  This may well come about, but  we  cannot

stake   the   future  of  the  country  on   chance

occurrences, such as international conflicts.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>City Council</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment ago I referred to the City Council. The

integration of the City Council into the Government

has  already commenced under the direction  of  the

Prime Minister. Initially, City Council Departments

have   been  allocated  to  appropriate  Government

Ministries  for  guidance and decisions  on  policy

matters.   The   Departments  still  retain   their

separate  identities, hierarchy and  organisational

procedures. In particular, the financial accounting

of  City  Council Departments will remain  separate

from the Government. Establishments and staff have,

in  general, not been merged into a single  uniform

organisation with Government Departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of integration must be carried out in

stages.  The  first  stage, in  which  only  policy

directives are issued from Government Ministries to

City   Council   Departments,  has   already   been

undertaken.  The other stages which  remain  to  be

carried   out  must  be  completed  in  an  orderly

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous matters of great complexity

standing   in  the  way  of  complete   and   final

integration.  It would be quite possible  to  carry

out  the  complete  integration  scheme  ourselves,

using the personnel available in the Government and

the  City  Council. This would, however, mean  that

the best administrative, legal and financial brains

will  have to be set aside for a fairly long period

to handle these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that, in view of the

heavy  pressure of work found at the upper echelons

of  the  administration, it is desirable to  invite

overseas  experts to advise the Government  on  the

many  problems of integration. Accordingly, we have

approached, under the Colombo Plan, the  Government

of  Canada  for a team of experts in the fields  of

finance  and  budgetting, establishment  and  staff

matters,  and local government legislation.  It  is

expected that the team of experts will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



arrive early next year to assist the Government  in

this  heavy and complicated undertaking. Until  the

recommendations have been received and  considered,

the budgets of the City Council Departments and the

Central   Government  will  continue  to  be   made

separately.  A consolidated budget is not  possible

until  all issues have been finally resolved, staff

and   departments  fully  integrated,  the   Public

Utilities   Board   set  up,   loans   and   assets

distributed  as  between  the  Government  and  the

Public  Utilities Board, and many other complicated

problems  solved. It can well be  imagined  that  a

task of this magnitude will take several months  to

complete.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Development Estimates</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development projects entered in the

Development Estimates fall into two groups. In  the

first  group is included those projects which  were

in  the  process of construction in  1959  and  had

therefore  to  be  carried out to completion.  They

were  all  projects which formed part of  expansion

programmes  worked  out in the  past  and  awaiting

completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of continuing projects carried forward

from  1959 amounts to $28.0 million. Education  and

Health  lead the field with $7.7 million  and  $5.8

million  respectively.  These  are  items  in   the

construction  and  extension of schools,  hospitals

and  hospital  services. Continuing  projects  have

therefore been entered and assessed in detail. They

will be carried out to completion next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, and by far the larger part of the

Development  Estimates, consists of  new  proposals

initiated   by  this  Government.  In  this   sense

therefore the Development Estimates have much  more

of  the  imprint of the policies of this Government

as  compared  with  the  Ordinary  Estimates  where

continuity with the past had to be preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the nature of things, with the short

time  available and the pre-occupation of immediate

tasks, that the new development proposals are  more

definitions of targets and objectives than projects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



which  had  been  processed  by  architects,

engineers  and  other technicians to  the  required

degree of finality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, two consequences follow. The

first  is  that  the  amounts are  entered  in  the

Estimates in round numbers. The second is that they

are  all  subject to Treasury control. This  latter

step is necessary to ensure that no expenditure  is

made  before  the  project  has  gone  through  the

detailed  screening by the technicians. It  may  be

that,  taking  into  account  the  vast  amount  of

planning  and preparation that will be required  in

relation   to   the  availability   of   engineers,

architects   and  others,  there   will   be   some

difficulty  in completing all the works  envisaged.

Nevertheless,  every effort will be made  to  bring

into  fruition the intentions of the Government  in

regard  to  these capital development  projects.  A

detailed  study will be made by the  Commission  of

Enquiry recently appointed on the capacity  of  the

building  industry. This will enable the Government

to put the development funds to the optimum use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, the value of the development proposals

add  up to $105.8 million. The expenditure of money

of  this  order  of magnitude will  give  a  strong

stimulus  to the economy. As will be apparent  from

the  details, it will have more than just  a  pump-priming function, necessary though this may  be  at

this  stage. The development projects will  add  to

the   permanent  accumulation  of  wealth  in  this

country and strengthen the sinews of the economy. I

will  now  give a brief account of what  these  new

projects are and what they hope to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest single item in the Development

Estimates   goes  to  the  Ministry   of   National

Development.  A  sum  of  $27.4  million  has  been

allotted  to that Ministry. The details  appear  on

page  477.  There is a loan of $25 million  to  the

Housing  Authority which will be  established  next

year. There is also a sum of $800,000 allotted  for

rural  development projects. This will  consist  of

various   schemes   designed   to   increase    the

productivity of farmers and fishermen, as  well  as

to extend the areas under cultivation. The Ministry

of Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



stands  second in the demands on finances  provided

by  the  Development Fund. A total of $21.9 million

has been allotted to them of which $7.7 million  is

for  continuing projects and $14.2 million for  new

development. I have already referred  to  the  need

for  money  to  be  spent  on  education,  both  on

teachers  and on building new schools. The  sum  of

$21.9  million is not as much as the  Minister  for

Education would like to have, but this is all  that

we can spare in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that the present Minister, with his

long  business experience, will be able to put this

money   to   far  more  effective  uses  than   his

predecessor who had to make an untimely  exit  from

the  political scene. Some of the schools sited  by

the  previous  administration show  an  astonishing

degree  of  incompetence  and  lack  of  foresight.

Anyone  who  passes  through Jurong  Road  will  be

astonished  to  see two large and modern  buildings

sited in the middle of nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has made a claim for

$20.5  million.  $500,000  consist  of  the  second

instalment of a $2 million loan to be made  to  the

Singapore Government Officers Co-operative  Housing

Society.  $20  million  has been  allotted  to  the

Economic   Development   Board,   which   will   be

established next year. This is a long awaited event

and   I  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  say

something about it.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Economic Development Board</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Economic Development

Board  is  related  to  the  Government's  plan  of

accelerated  industrial growth  in  Singapore.  The

intention  to establish such a Board was  announced

during  the election campaign and accordingly  this

proposal  in  the  Development  Estimates  has  the

mandate of the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the total resources of the

Board  will reach a figure of $100 million  if  the

Board were to make any significant contribution  to

industrial  growth. In 1960 the  first  draft  from

public  funds would be made and an initial  sum  of

$20 million has been set by.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first draft of the Bill to establish the

Board  has  been  completed and it is  under  close

study  by  the  Government. A number  of  important

issues still remain to be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without attempting any precision in definition, I

may be permitted to discuss the principal functions

and objectives of the Board. The Board will act, in

the  first instance, as an industrial bank and will

make available to industrial concerns loans on both

short  and  long  terms. The  Board  will  also  be

charged  with certain executive powers in  carrying

out      the     Government's     programme      of

industrialisation, particularly in  regard  to  the

planning  and preparation of industrial sites.  The

Board  will  have a staff of economic planners  and

industrial  technicians  with  which  it  will   be

equipped  to  discharge its  functions  within  the

framework  of  general Government policy.  It  will

also  be able to offer both industry and Government

technical and expert advice and services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An undertaking of this nature is one not lightly

to  be embarked upon. Its necessity is apparent  to

all.  But great care has to be taken to ensure that

the  large  sums  of money placed at  its  disposal

would  be  spent to the maximum advantage  and  not

frittered away in unprofitable ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has approached the International

Bank   for   Reconstruction  and  Development   for

assistance in recruiting the top executives of  the

Economic Development Board. In so doing, we are not

departing   from  our  previous  pledges   to   the

electorate.  I  say  this  because  there  may   be

criticism from certain quarters that the policy  of

overseas recruitment may run counter to the general

principle  of Malayanisation which this  Government

supports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stated in our election manifestos and

other pre-election documents that there is not  the

skill and experience in this country which can cope

with  the immensely responsible and complex  duties

which  the Economic Development Board will have  to

discharge.  It was stated then quite  clearly  that

local talent and experience not being available, we

shall have to recruit from overseas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of Asian revolution, this step which

we  adopt may appear to be distasteful to some  and

retrograde to others. To these people, we  can  say

with  perfect  candour that members of  the  P.A.P.

political  leadership are not  lacking  in  talent,

vigour  or self-confidence. A combination of  these

qualities,  however, may well lead to  recklessness

bred  out of arrogance and ignorance if it  is  not

tempered with a sense of realism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an open city exposed to the business

and political currents coming from all parts of the

world. As such, we are more cosmopolitan in outlook

than  perhaps any other country in Asia.  While  we

passionately believe in nationalism in its fine and

creative sense, we must desist from those forms  of

economic  nationalism where these militate  against

our interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to recruit the top executives of the

Economic   Development  Board  from   overseas   is

therefore  a  measure  which  should  find  general

support  in  this  country. It is fitting  that  we

should  approach  an agency of the United  Nations,

namely,  the  World  Bank, for assistance  in  this

matter  and  if we succeed in attracting  the  best

talent  available, this will be all to the good  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also made applications to the United

Nations  through the U.K. Government for assistance

in a technical study of investment possibilities in

Singapore. In 1960, with the establishment  of  the

Economic Development Board and the full use of  the

technical  and advisory services available  through

the  United  Nations agencies,  we  shall  see  the

beginning of an energetic plan to promote  a  rapid

growth of industries in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I wish to reiterate the broad

outlines  of our industrial policy. We have  stated

in  our  election manifestos that in the  stage  in

which  Singapore  finds itself today,  the  primary

responsibility of industrialisation  must  rest  on

private enterprise. This being the case, we  should

do   everything  possible,  consistent   with   the

wellbeing of our population,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



to  attract  to  Singapore  the  maximum

amount  of  overseas capital and overseas technical

and  managerial skills and do all that  we  can  to

induce  local  enterprise  and  capital  into   the

establishment of new industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of this policy must be

understood by all. Business people do not embark on

new  ventures for political objectives, such as the

defence of the democratic system. They do so  on  a

calculation  of  profits and if we want  to  induce

them to develop new industrial enterprises, we must

make   the  economic  setting  suitable   for   the

promotion of these activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Development Estimates, the

next  substantial item is an amount of  $7  million

allotted  to the Ministry of Labour and  Law,  Head

D.34, at page 484. This sum of money is intended to

be  used  on capital development so as to alleviate

the  grave problem of unemployment now facing  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic solution of course is not to be found

in  relief  projects but in the  expansion  of  the

economy,  particularly in the way  of  establishing

new industries to provide for greater employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the new development expenditure

would  be to inject a sufficient stimulant  in  the

economy  to  raise  it from its  present  state  of

stagnation.  Greater prosperity engendered  in  the

price  of  rubber  would  also  contribute  towards

economic recovery in this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely, however, that there will still

remain    a   residual   of   unemployed   persons,

particularly  the young looking for  work  for  the

first  time.  It is to provide useful activity  for

these  persons that the Government has  allotted  a

sum  of  $7  million  to be spent  on  unemployment

relief  works  under the direction of the  Minister

for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to organise

unemployed youths into work brigades. They will  be

grouped  in  residential units to be  stationed  in

various   parts   of   the  island   where   useful

construction activity can be carried out by way  of

land  reclamation, road building, irrigation works,

reclamation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



of  swamps and so forth. Special attention will  be

paid  to the spiritual and moral wellbeing of these

youths organised in these work brigades. They  will

be  taught the value of social discipline  and  the

meaning of social responsibility Their needs in the

way   of   cultural  enlightenment  will   not   be

neglected. These are important matters for we  must

avoid  the  atmosphere of spiritual  demoralisation

which  could  creep into poorly managed  and  badly

conceived relief works projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that this sum would be sufficient

to  provide  for the employment of at  least  5,000

persons.  Rates  of pay would below,  considerably

less than those paid to the present detachments  of

unemployed persons now engaged in construction work

of one kind or another At present these persons are

paid  $3  a  day, with provision in some cases  for

overtime.  Such rates of pay are higher  than  what

people  in  fulltime occupation in some trades  are

earning,  and it would therefore be a  misnomer  to

consider  such  projects as properly falling  under

the relief of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable amount of detailed planning

remains  to  be  done as regards the organisational

structure of the work brigades, and the engineering

and   construction  details  on   selected   sites.

Accordingly,  this  whole item of  expenditure  has

been made subject to Treasury sanction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5 million under Head D.

9 - Marine - represents  really a token  provision  for

port improvement. For some years now the Government

has   been   considering  plans  to   improve   the

deplorable  condition of the Singapore River  which

is a vital artery of our entrepot trade. This river

is  very  congested; river traffic  is  subject  to

stoppages at low and high tides, and parts  of  the

quays  on  private  land are  in  a  state  of  sad

disrepair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department has made a proposal for the

deepening of the inner harbour opposite Beach  Road

and  the construction of a new breakwater. Detailed

planning and expert evaluation of this project have

still to be made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, these projects have been entered in

the  Development  Estimates even though  the  final

decision to embark upon them will have to be  taken

by  the  Port Authority as was recommended  by  the

Milbourne  Commission. The inclusion of this  item,

if  it  does nothing else, serves to underline  the

Government's  keen  interest  in  maintaining   and

promoting  the efficiency of our port services.  It

also  indicates  the  Government's  willingness  to

approach  overseas  governments or  United  Nations

agencies for loans to finance these projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last item of the Development Estimates on

which  I  wish to comment is the sum of $2  million

allotted  under  Head  D. 40  to  the  Ministry  of

Culture for the extension and development of radio,

information and publicity services. It is  intended

to introduce next year commercial broadcasting in a

somewhat  diluted form. For all these, a  provision

of  $2  million  has been made, the expenditure  of

which is again subject to Treasury sanction.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>The Civil Service</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinary Estimates show a deficit of $6

million - and  this after the most strenuous  efforts

had been made to reduce expenditure. There will  be

further claims on the revenue next year by  way  of

applications for supplementary Votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, for instance, the question of

Government contribution to Nanyang University.  The

question of a grant to Nanyang University  will  be

decided  after due consideration has been given  to

the  Report, only just received from the Commission

of  Inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr  Gwee  Ah

Leng.  Accordingly, this item has not been included

in  the  Estimates, and I prefer that reference  be

made to it in the Budget statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other item can be foreseen - and this is the

payment   for   the  Scientific  and   Professional

Allowances,  which  the  Government  has   declared

itself willing to introduce. Negotiations with  the

Associations     representing     technical     and

professional officers have not gone as smoothly  as

desired.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors, for reasons not clear to me,

considered  the  present moment opportune  to  make

claims  for a revision of basic salary. It  is,  of

course, not possible to accede to this request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to take this opportunity to announce

the amount of technical and professional allowances

which  the  Government  is prepared  to  offer  its

technical  and professional employees  with  effect

from the 1st January, 1960:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) $100 per month for those with basic

qualifications  and less  than  7  years  of

experience;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) $200 per month for those with higher

qualifications or 7 years experience or more

in their profession;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) $300 per month for officers who show

exceptional merit in their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is prepared to discuss with the

Associations     representing     technical     and

professional  officers  the  terms  and  conditions

under which these allowances will be paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general run of Government employees, who

do not qualify for these allowances, the Government

is  prepared  to present, for the consideration  of

their   Unions,  a  scheme  whereby  officers   who

experience hardship as a result of the pay cuts can

obtain  assistance to tide them for the  period  of

their financial difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer which the Government is prepared to

make will be more generous than what the Staff Side

Unions    have    led   themselves   to    believe.

Unfortunately,  difficulty has been experienced  in

getting the Staff Side to discuss these matters, as

they  take  the  attitude that further  discussions

should  deal only with the restoration of  variable

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations with the Association representing

expatriate officers have reached an advanced stage.

Many complicated issues have been resolved, and  it

is  hoped that an agreement would be reached before

very long, to be made effective as from the 1st  of

January, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have dealt with various matters affecting

the Civil Service, this may be the opportune moment

to  discuss Civil Service affairs in their  broader

perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little doubt that, on the assumption to

office  of  this  Government, many members  of  the

Civil  Service experienced difficulty in  adjusting

themselves  to  the new situation. Some  have  been

resentful over the pay cuts. Others have been taken

aback by the exacting standards which the Ministers

expect of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Civil Service is going

through a difficult period. The acceleration in the

speed of Malayanisation has imposed a severe burden

on  the local officer. While a few have been  found

to  be  wanting, the great majority  of  them  have

risen to the occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation provides for serving officers the

opportunity for accelerated promotion,  which  will

never  occur again. This has both its strength  and

weaknesses. On the one hand, some Departments  have

been  placed in a difficult position, but,  on  the

other  hand, it provides an opportunity for serving

officers  who  are prepared to work hard  to  prove

their worth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended next year to make a review of the

staffing  position to ensure that there is  a  hard

core  of  experienced officers in all  Departments,

and   that  opportunities  will  be  provided   for

accelerated  promotion to those local  officers  of

merit and ability who are prepared to give of their

best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be regretted that a number of officers

in   administrative   and  technical   posts   have

resigned.  Some of these have chosen to  leave  the

Government  service  for a more  lucrative  private

practice.  It must not be forgotten, however,  that

service   in  Government  provides  officers   with

special opportunities for advanced training,  which

are   not   available   elsewhere.   This   applies

especially to doctors, whose programme of  advanced

training  overseas has been maintained despite  the

need for economies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>The Deficit</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now return to the deficit and the means of

meeting it. There are normally two methods open  to

us: the first is to reduce expenditure; the second,

to increase revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards economy, the recent steps taken by

this Government leave no room for doubt that we are

prepared to do the utmost. But the methods  so  far

used,   though  they  have  been  considered   very

drastic,  have  been  simple  ones.  They  are  the

methods  which the Chinese call Ta tau k'uo  fu  or

"the big knife and the broad axe".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been simple ones in that they do not

require detailed examination of each and every item

of  expenditure. They could be justified only on  a

temporary  basis  and, for long-term  economies,  a

more delicate instrument than the big knife or  the

broad  axe  has  to be used, if we  want  to  avoid

impairing  the  efficiency of  the  administration.

What  is  needed  is  an  instrument  such  as  the

surgeon's  knife to cut out waste and  extravagance

that  may  be  occurring in  regard  to  individual

items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of services has been so rapid in

the  last  ten  years  that  it  is  unlikely  that

unnecessary  expenditure had not been incurred  and

retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every fresh item, when introduced in the

Estimates  proposals for any year,  is  subject  to

close scrutiny, once it has passed the vigilant eye

of  the Treasury, it tends to remain thereafter  in

the  Estimates  practically as a matter  of  right.

This particularly applies to O.C.A.R. items. These,

despite  every  effort to keep them within  bounds,

continue to expand inexorably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year the Government proposes to establish a

Commission  to  examine Department  by  Department,

every   item   of  P.E. and  O.C.A.R.   Heads   of

Departments  will  have to justify  that  each  and

every  item included is necessary for the efficient

running of the administration. The Commission  will

also  inquire  into procedures and organisation  in

order to see whether or not any simplification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



work  could  not  bring  about  both  economy   and

increased efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would hasten to assure the civil

service  that  this would not lead to an  extensive

retrenchment of personnel. Such posts as are  found

redundant  will  be abolished, but the  holders  of

these  posts  will be given every  opportunity  for

transfer  without  loss  of  emoluments  to   other

departments  of Government or to other agencies  of

Government   where  they  can  be  more  profitably

employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not set its face against

increasing the volume and the value of services  it

presents  to  the  public. On the contrary,  it  is

intended to give the public an increasing scope  of

services which would promote the wellbeing  of  the

population  and  sustain an increased  standard  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people may therefore rest assured that the

Government will strain every effort to  see  to  it

that   public   money  is  spent  to  the   maximum

advantage. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that in the

reorganisation envisaged whether substantial enough

economies would be produced to balance the  Budget,

taking into account the fact that in the course  of

the year Ministries and Departments will inevitably

submit applications for supplementary votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxpayer must therefore be called upon to

bear  his  burden  of  responsibility.  However,  I

hasten to assure the taxpayer that there will be no

unduly  heavy  claims  on  his  purse.  It  is  not

proposed to make any changes to the rates of income

tax  next  year,  or  to  the  scales  of  personal

reliefs. It is, however, intended to tighten up the

provisions against the evasion of income tax and to

provide the Comptroller with more extensive  powers

than  he now has to combat tax evasion. I have been

in consultation with the Minister of Finance of the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  we  are  in   complete

agreement  that the war on evasion must be  stepped

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has one major tax proposal to

announce. This is the imposition of port  dues.  At

the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



moment,  other  than  the  wharves  and  facilities

provided  by the Singapore Harbour Board,  services

to   shipping   by  way  of  harbour  control   and

maintenance  and other services have been  provided

largely by the Singapore taxpayer. Such charges  as

are  levied  for  specific services,  such  as  the

inspection  of  ships  by the  Surveyor-General  of

Ships  or  the Master Attendant, do not even  cover

the   cost  of  the  administration  of  these  two

Departments. Port conservancy has cost  $2  million

per  annum  and the Government has willingly  borne

this.  The  port dues envisaged, however,  will  be

modest  ones and shipping interests will  be  fully

consulted  before they are implemented. It  is  not

expected  that  the  port dues under  consideration

will yield more than $2.5 million a year, and this,

taking   into  account  the  enormous  tonnage   of

shipping  that  passes through the harbour,  is  an

extremely light charge for the use of our port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from Port Dues will not be sufficient

to  cover  the  estimated deficit. Other  means  of

raising  revenue  may have to be considered.  There

is,  however, one element in the financial position

of   the   Singapore  Government  today  which   is

unique - and,   before  this  source  of   additional

finance  has  been fully uncovered, the  Government

does not intend to make any further incursions into

the  taxpayers'  pocket. Should this,  however,  be

necessary, it is the intention of the Government to

make  marginal adjustments over a broad field.  The

principal  sources  of  Government  revenue,   i.e.

income  tax,  customs duties on petrol and  liquor,

will  remain  as  they now are  in  any  review  of

taxation in 1960. There may be adjustments  to  the

tax  on tobacco, depending on factors which I  have

previously discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new element in the situation to which I

referred above is the request made by the Singapore

Government to the U.K. Government that the cost  of

defence,  being a constitutional responsibility  of

Her  Majesty's Government, should be borne by them.

The U.K. Government has agreed to study this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



proposal  in detail, but until now we have  had  no

indication  what progress has been made  with  this

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of maintaining our Defence Forces is

expected  to amount to $9.3 million in the Ordinary

Estimates,   and   $180,000  in   the   Development

Estimates.  The Singapore Government  will  do  its

utmost to get an early resolution of this question.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Conclusion</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to end with a brief overall review of the

Budget  and to assess its main effects. The  budget

is  designed to expand the economy. This budget has

claims to be called an "expansion budget". It  will

stimulate  activity  in two  ways.  First  are  the

substantial   outlays  on  development  expenditure

which   will  lead  to  a  high  rate  of   capital

formation. Second, by keeping domestic taxation  to

its  present level, the consuming public will  reap

the full benefit of the expansion of the economy. I

hope that this would not encourage the public to go

on  a  spending spree but rather to induce them  to

put  aside,  as much as possible, their incomes  in

the form of investment for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, the Government can fairly

claim as a remarkable achievement the avoidance  of

increases on domestic taxation in the budget.  This

should provide some of the psychological impetus to

economic  expansion.  Nor  have  we  neglected  the

claims of the masses for better social services and

for  the  amelioration  of  the  condition  of  the

unemployed. The country should now take  heart  and

get down to the tasks that lie ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to pay a tribute to the Treasury

officials  upon whom the combined tasks of  pruning

this  year's  expenditure and drastically  amending

the  first  draft  estimates for  next  year,  have

imposed  an  unprecedented burden. They have  borne

this  cheerfully  and  have applied  themselves  to

their   work   with  dedication  and   skill.   The

Government  Printer,  in the midst  of  exceptional

calls or his time resulting from Loyalty Week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



preparations, has taken in his stride, the printing

of  these  Estimates. As Members can  see,  he  has
