   <b>SINGAPORE MEDICAL TEAM IN SAUDI ARABIA</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Cost)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew-Choh -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence what is the cost of keeping the Singapore medical team in Saudi Arabia and whether there was any request from anybody for a medical team to be sent from Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Yeo Ning Hong) (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government sent a team of 30 SAF officers and men to Saudi Arabia in response to a British request, and with the agreement of the Government of Saudi Arabia. It did so in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 678. The Resolution requires "all States to provide support for the actions" undertaken to further efforts "to uphold and implement Resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose was humanitarian. We expected many casualties when war broke out. The team's mission was to provide medical care for all who needed it, regardless of nationality. Several other countries, including South Korea, Sweden, Norway and Poland, also sent similar medical teams to Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team was attached to a British Field Hospital. The British provided all administrative and logistical support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cost is concerned, the estimated cost is $630,000 so far. However, the final cost of the entire mission will only be known after the team has returned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Charles Chong (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, could the Minister tell us whether the lives of our officers and men were ever in danger during the period of assignment in Saudi Arabia?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the team was deployed away from the scene of actual
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> combat. But they were in the war zone. They were in the vicinity of Riyadh. And Members who have followed the Gulf war will know that Riyadh came under regular attacks by Scud missiles. Yes, the team did put their lives on the line in the execution of their duties on this particular occasion. Notwithstanding that, the morale of the team was high. They demonstrated a high level of commitment and dedication to the task in hand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our regular national servicemen and reservists who make up this team have done us proud and they deserve our every support. I am happy to note that the survey published by the Sunday Times a few weeks back showed that 90% of Singaporeans supported our mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister when the medical team is expected to return to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the British Field Hospital that the medical team was attached to has decided that the mission has been completed and they will be returning to the United Kingdom very shortly. I expect our team will also be coming back to Singapore shortly, maybe some time this week.

   <b>OVERHEAD PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE ACROSS YISHUN AVENUE 2</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Erection of shelter)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what were the reasons for not approving the request to erect a shelter on the overhead pedestrian bridge across Yishun Avenue 2 at MRT Khatib Station and (b) what is the estimated cost of erecting such a shelter.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department (PWD) has a programme to construct covered bridges where the pedestrian traffic is heavy during peak hours. PWD has adopted the guideline of 1,200 pedestrians per hour (20 per minute) during the peak hours, below which a covered bridge would not be justified. The request by Yishun Town
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Council to erect a shelter over the existing pedestrian bridge across Yishun Avenue 2 was carefully considered by PWD. The bridge is not part of a busy walkway linking, say, a bus interchange with a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. The actual pedestrian traffic on site is well below the guideline of 1,200 pedestrians per hour during the peak hours. Therefore, the request for a covered bridge was turned down. PWD will monitor the situation and will construct the covered bridge when the pedestrian traffic volume justifies it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the roof structure for the 64-metre long bridge is about $100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon South):</b> Sir, is the Minister or the PWD aware that the proposed shelter will benefit about one-quarter of the Yishun New Town population and that is equal to 2% of the Singapore population?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: Does the Minister agree that the $100,000 is a very small sum of money to spend for the benefit of 2% of the Singapore population? Furthermore, is the Minister aware that once the shelter is provided the traffic volume will increase?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that a covered bridge will become an attraction for people to visit the site. Whether it benefits one-quarter or one-third or one-half of Yishun, ultimately it must be reflected in the number of people who use the bridge during peak hours. As I have said, studies have shown that the peak hour traffic is well below the 1,200 per hour that we have set as the cut-off point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a later stage, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there will be an opportunity to build a proper bridge because the site opposite the MRT station, which is a vacant site, will be sold for commercial development and a site adjacent to the MRT station is also a site to be sold for commercial development. We can then integrate the two commercial developments together with the MRT station and have a proper pedestrian bridge. But if before we sell the sites, there is a great increase in the number of people using the present uncovered bridge, we can construct a cover for the bridge.

  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government intends to mount another exercise to convert all civil servants on the pension scheme to the Central Provident Fund Scheme, and whether he will assure civil servants on the pension scheme that they will retain their right of option if and when such a conversion exercise is mounted.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to both questions is "Yes". Details of the conversion exercise will be announced by my Ministry as soon as they have been finalised.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has always advised medical practitioners to keep their patients fully informed about their charges so that they are aware beforehand of the financial implications of the recommended treatment. The way this is accomplished, however, has been left to the discretion of the individual practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is in favour of requiring all medical practitioners to display their basic rates of charges. This would allow patients to know what they can expect to pay in any consultation or before undergoing any form of investigation or surgery. We are studying how this can be incorporated into the proposed amendments to the Medical Registration Act which are scheduled to be tabled in Parliament later this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, my Ministry has requested the Singapore Medical Council to study the implications of the proposal to require all medical practitioners in private practice to display their rates of charges.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after several years of sustained economic growth, the US economy has gone into a recession, reportedly a mild one. The UK economy is in the midst of a rather severe recession. The growth of two other powerful economies, Germany and Japan, have slowed down. The OECD economy as a whole is projected to show a growth of less than 2% this year. The economies of our neighbours, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, however, remain buoyant. But they are likely to be affected by the recession and the anticipated fall in commodity and oil prices later this year. The impasse in the GATT's talk remains a concern. Much economic uncertainties still prevail after the end of the Gulf War.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this world economic scenario, the outlook for the Singapore economy remains uncertain, albeit much slower economic growth. The outlook would have been worse if the Gulf War had protracted. Fortunately, it was shortlived.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these uncertain economic prospects and the general economic slowdown, the Budget, as presented by the Finance Minister, is a sensible one. It is conservative, it is prudent. It is a Budget aimed at fine-tuning the economy to help those sectors affected by the recession. It is also a Budget with a little pump-priming to the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, the various incentives announced in the Budget reveal two structural transformations taking place in our economy. Both structural changes show that we are on course in our plan to become a developed economy by the turn of the century. The first structural change shows that we are becoming a more services-oriented rather than a manufacturing-oriented economy. The services sector forms something like 55% of our GDP in 1990 compared to 42% in 1980. The share of the manufacturing sector has, however, remained constant at 29% during the same period. This move to becoming a services economy is inevitable given the scarcity of labour and land resources and our strong Singapore dollar. It is also generally in line with the development of most OECD economies where the services sector forms a sizeable proportion of their economic pie. Indeed the formation of the Growth Triangle will further accelerate this transition to a services economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second structural change in our economy is the foreign component of our national income and that is the gap between our GNP and GDP. The gap based on current market prices has increased from about $0.2 billion in 1988 to about $1.2 billion in 1990, which is a six-fold increase over a period of three years. This shows that our efforts in recent years to encourage Singapore companies to invest abroad have been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> successful. However, this foreign income component as a percentage of our total GNP is still small at 1.9%. The Government and the private sector must collectively step up their efforts to get more companies to invest abroad. The introduction of tax exempt dividends paid out of foreign income is a good move. However, this move alone is not enough. A major obstacle to companies investing abroad is that they will be taxed twice, once on the profits generated and, secondly, when they try to remit their profits back to Singapore. May I therefore urge the Government to speed up the Double Taxation Avoidance negotiation process with many more countries. This will further spur Singapore companies to invest abroad.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, a trend has emerged in our economy which is a cause for concern. Real wages increased faster than productivity growth. In 1990, real wages increased by 6.4% compared to 3.4% for productivity growth. This trend is indeed unhealthy. We have to watch it carefully. We must avoid what happened in the early 1980s when wage increases were so high compared to productivity growth that we lost our international competitiveness and landed ourselves in a recession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage increases are inevitable as they reflect the tight labour market situation. The Government too, as the largest employer of manpower in Singapore, faces the same constraint resulting in wages in the public sector having increased markedly in recent years. And wage increases in the public sector do influence wage increases in the private sector. There have been instances in the past when the private sector tried to match the wage increases in the public sector. I would therefore like to urge the Government to ensure that, in the light of uncertain economic prospects ahead, wage increases this year be as moderate as possible. If the Government takes the lead by moderating wage increases this year, I am sure the private sector will follow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I say the budget is generally conservative, there is one aspect of it which is a bold one, and that is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> decision to increase employers' CPF contribution by1% in July this year. No doubt, the increase will add on to the high wage costs. This would put further burden on companies, particularly the SMEs which are already facing high wage and rental increases given the scarcity of our labour and land resources. Since economic trends are uncertain until perhaps the middle of this year, may I suggest that the Government consider deferring its decision to increase employers' CPF contribution by 1% till after the second quarter of this year; and if prospects are less encouraging then, increase the employers' CPF contribution by only 1/2% to bring it to 17% instead of 17 1/2%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Finance Minister for the various incentives announced in his budget to try to revitalise certain sectors of our economy. A reduction of 1/2% CPF contribution from the employees, though small, will help boost domestic demand. So is a reduction in entertainment duty and tourism cess. This will help the retail and the restaurant sectors tide over their current difficulties. Higher Government development expenditure, which is 22% higher than the previous financial year, aimed at improving our infrastructure will help pump-prime the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister's budget objective to ensure a balanced budget by raising enough revenue to finance expenditure and keeping the public sector lean and trim is a prudent one. Indeed we are among the few Governments in the world that enjoy a small budget surplus every year. It reflects prudent financial management on the part of the Government. Government's total expenditure as a percentage of GDP is currently estimated at 23%. The Minister stated in his Budget Statement that this is below the long-term objective target of 25%. Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what determines the long-term rate of 25%. Why do we set the size of the public sector at 25% of GDP? To me, this percentage share should drop as we continue to privatise the public sector. There is no need for a large public sector as our economy matures. Infrastructural development will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> eventually taper off. Furthermore, as our economic pie expands, more and more of our national income will be generated overseas as more Singapore companies expand abroad. And there is no need for an equivalent large public sector to try to support this foreign income. May I therefore suggest that the Minister consider lowering the long-term target of Government expenditure to 20% (and maybe even 15%) of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the programme to set up Management Accounting Systems in all Ministries. This will allow the Government to track costs, identify poor performance, inefficiencies and wastage in the civil service. This exercise though useful must be closely monitored. I would like to caution Ministries against using this exercise as an excuse to increase rates and fees to justify their costs. Alternatively, Ministries could be so cost conscious that they reduce the level of services to the public. If this happens, perhaps the Service Quality Improvement Unit to be set up under the Prime Minister's Office should look into this matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I believe this is the most difficult budget ever drawn up by the Finance Minister. It was prepared in the midst of the Gulf War and conflicting reports regarding the US recession and world economic trends. There are just too many variables, too many unknowns, and too many uncertainties. Because of these, I believe the budget as presented before us cannot be bolder. Any prudent Finance Minister will have adopted a similarly conservative approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has painted a very cautious picture of the economic prospects for the year. And as Mr Chew Heng Ching said he must have had a difficult time since the budget was prepared in the shadow of the Gulf crisis. The land offensive by the allied forces ended only two days before the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, however, did point out that we should "be prepared for quick
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> changes in the economic environment". Now, with the Gulf War over, there are prospects of a mini-boom which will benefit Singapore. Still, the Minister had urged that for 1991, "wage increases should be moderate in the face of the general slowdown and uncertain economic prospects". In saying this, he would have in mind the complaints of businessmen that the cost of doing business in Singapore has risen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I listened to Mr Chew Heng Ching recounting the increase in wage cost before the recession of 1985/86, I think for someone who just reads or listens to the speech by itself he will come to the conclusion that it was the high wage cost that led to the recession. I think the record should be set straight. It is not wage cost that was the cause of the recession. It was a convergence of three factors - recession in the world economy, recession in the regional economies, and a sharp slowdown in the construction activities in Singapore. Domestically, we had the HDB scaling down its programme from as high as 65,000 units of flats constructed in a year to about 20,000 and this must surely have its effects on the economy of Singapore. But recession is caused by uncompetitiveness. So we should look at the issue on a wider context of total business cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Economic Survey of Singapore 1990, the unit business cost index, which takes into account labour and other costs, rose by 7.3% last year. If we compare this with the index as it stood at its lowest in 1987, then there has been a significant cumulative increase in cost. But if we take the decade as a whole, the cost of doing business here has risen only slightly and this must be quite remarkable for any economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is always the case, businessmen would complain about labour costs. Indeed, they have criticised the 1% rise in the employers' contribution to CPF. Such criticism is not justified. I would remind employers that in 1986, workers took the brunt of the recession through a 15 percentage point cut in the employers' contribution to CPF. The 1% restoration this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> year means that up to now, after several years of good economic growth, only half the cut has been restored. It would be unwise of employers to harp on this 1% restoration. The workers ask: why is it that when a cut is made, it is done in one go, but when it comes to restoration, it is so gradual? I have this word of advice to employers: continuing criticism of the 1% restoration will only develop workers' distrust of employers. So, please stop it. Do not forget that not the full 15 percentage points will be restored. Only 10 percentage points will be restored. So this is a major concession of five percentage points.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government constantly monitors our wage cost competitiveness with other NIEs. The index shows that last year, our wage cost competitiveness was about the 1983 level. Surely this is not bad. A major part of the rise in the index was due to the appreciation of the Singapore dollar vis-a-vis the US dollar and the currencies of the NIEs. The appreciation against the US dollar was 8.6%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, employers will point out that last year, average monthly earnings rose by 9.4% as reflected by what Mr Chew has said. Since the consumer price index rose by 3.4%, this means that the real wage increase was 6%, exceeding the productivity growth of 3.4%. And employers will say that this trend will erode our competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last year's wage increase reflects two things: companies did well, and there was a persistent labour shortage. So in this kind of situation, the balance of advantage when it comes to negotiations lies with the unions and the workers. And unions could have pressed home the advantage to get high built-in wage increases. They did not. Instead, they acted responsibly and agreed to contain the built-in wage increase within productivity gains. The NTUC's survey of wage settlements for 1990 shows that the built-in wage increases averaged 6.7%. Accounting for inflation of 3.4%, the real built-in wage increase was only 3.3%, just a shade below the productivity growth of 3.4%. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> built-in wage increase has lagged behind productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one explain the 9.4% rise in monthly earnings then? The 9.4% rise in monthly earnings included bonus payments and higher overtime. Bonus payments vary with the profitability of the companies, and overtime depends on how much business and how much work companies have. So this shows how flexible our wage system now is.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, I think that employers ought to be showing their appreciation for the responsible action taken by our unions and workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indicator which employers would point out is the rising wage share in nominal GDP. But, again, this GDP share is about the 1982 level. There is also no magic number which will indicate when a danger point is reached. The wage share in nominal GDP varies with the mix of the economy. The wage share in nominal GDP of developed countries is higher than ours. As an economy moves more and more into services, the wage share in nominal GDP can be expected to rise. For example, the wage share of value added in manufacturing hovered between 28% and 32% in the past 10 years, except during the recession when the wage share rose to 38%. On the other hand, the wage share in value added in the restaurant and hotel industry is as high as 60%, and during the recession it rose to about 70%. The wage share in the retail trade is typically about 45%, but went up to 60% during the recession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been significant changes in our economy. In the last 10 years, manufacturing accounted for about 28-29% of GDP. Commerce has stabilised at about 17%, dropping from 22%. Transport and Communications share has risen from 12% to 14%. Financial and business services have risen sharply from about 20% in 1980 to the current 32-33%. So this shows that the economic mix has changed quite significantly. The usefulness of the wage share in nominal GDP as an indicator of wage cost competitiveness is therefore limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry has, in the Economic Survey of Singapore 1990, included an essay on "Profitability Indicators" which stresses more on the bottom line, the margin of profits and the trend of profits. These are better indicators of our competitiveness as a place for doing business. What the essay shows is that we are doing all right at the moment, though there is a down trend.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing must be clear. Our objective as a Government must be to improve the standard of living of our people. In this decade, we aim to come of age as a developed nation. This means wage levels of a developed nation, not of an NIE or of a developing nation. So the economic policy must encourage two things:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, develop the education and skills level of our people; Second, upgrade business to higher value added activities. This year's budget has these two objectives. I therefore support the financial policy of the Government. Employers and workers should work together to achieve these two objectives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what can we expect of wage increase this year? Wage negotiations will commence mid-year. Much will depend on how the economy performs between now and then. If the post-war mini-boom takes off, wage increases should be comparable to last year's. The labour shortage persists. In this situation, last year's principle that built-in wage increases should lag behind productivity growth would be a sound principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's budget is a painless budget, which is not a surprise. For several years past, we had painless budgets, some more, some less. This year's budget is also a hard-nosed businessman's budget, which is also not a surprise. Our Government has never made a secret of its commitment to making Singapore an economic success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budgetary proposals for a more resilient economy include further tax incentives to boost the financial sector and also to encourage our local companies to go abroad and to do business. Other proposals will result in more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> funds being channelled towards education and investments in infrastructure, which means better schools and the upgrading of old HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To top it all, the Minister for Finance has not forgotten to tie up his budgetary package with a principle our Government holds sacred, that is, a balanced budget with more reserves for a rainy day. Despite the widespread expectation of an economic slow-down which can only have been worsened by the destructive and violent Gulf War that ended recently, the fiscal year 1991 obviously does not qualify as a rainy year. Although this year's surplus is the lowest since 1987, our Government evidently believes there may be a much more rainy year ahead, so that we should save while we can.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget would, therefore, seem to have been designed to take care of Singapore's best interests. That was my first impression when the Minister for Finance presented his budget in Parliament. At the same time, there was a little thought nagging at the back of my head, whether something has been overlooked in the budget. The next day I read in the newspaper, ie, the Straits Times dated 2nd March 1991, the headline, "Shenton Way Budget" and the thought clicked in my head. It is an apt description of the budget as the banks and other business corporations that line both sides of Shenton Way stand to benefit from the budget. At the same time, we all know without fully appreciating that the Trade Union House is part of the Shenton Way set-up. Perhaps the Trade Union House is dwarfed by the towering blocks of offices around it. In the same way, I am afraid, the budget may be perceived to have overlooked the contributions of workers to the economic success of Singapore. Perhaps, the modest wage packets of workers are dwarfed into insignificance by the profits and reserves of the banks and other corporations along Shenton Way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not this year's budget is business-oriented, it is perceived by workers as such, and there seems to be a basis for it. For example, the budget
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provides for an increase in the employers' CPF contribution by 1% to 17.5% and the CPF contribution by employees to be reduced by 1/2% to 22.5% from 1st July 1991. This is to be welcomed as the workers' take-home pay will be increased accordingly so that they can have the means to enjoy a high quality of life. On the other hand, the CPF contribution by employers will be increased by only 1% to 17.5%, which is still 2.5% points short of the targeted 20% CPF contribution by employers. This is an increase of only 7.5% percentage points over five years from the 10% contribution rate in 1986. This means that the restoration of employer's rate of CPF contribution has been relatively slow when compared to the sudden huge slash from 25% to 10% in 1986 to help in the economy's recovery from the 1985 recession. We can only hope that there is no recurrence of another economic downturn of the same degree of seriousness, otherwise the workers will likely find their employers' CPF contribution reduced overnight from 17.5% to 10% and will have to wait for another five years to have it restored.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I am being too far-fetched in what I have said about the relative speeds of cutting and restoring CPF rates. Some businessmen have commented in the press about this one percentage point increase as being another increase in business cost. It is an attitude that is apparently shared by the Finance Ministry. In the words of the Finance Minister, "CPF increases are part of wages" and businessmen are expected to "conduct their collective bargaining accordingly". In other words, the increase of one percentage point is a wagecost and, therefore, an item of business cost. However, CPF increases and CPF reductions seem to obey different rules in collective bargaining. When employers' CPF contribution was cut in 1986 from 25% to 10% in order to help employers tide over a difficult period, employers strongly argued that the CPF was a statutory business saving and not a saving in wage-cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is understandable for employers not to want the CPF cut to be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> shown in their accounts as an increase in operational profits. In other words, employers did not want to pay out as bigger bonuses from increased profits that they had saved from the CPF cut in 1986. This has now given rise to a peculiar situation. Employers are being urged to use any CPF increase against unions in wage negotiations. But employers were never likewise advised to concede a CPF cut to unions in wage negotiations. Sir, for unions, it seems to be a situation of "Heads you win, tails I lose". I do not think there is a need for the Ministry of Finance to molly-coddle employers to this extent. They can look after their own interest very well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the workers who need a helping hand from the Finance Ministry. In that sense, the 5% personal income tax rebate as a reward to individuals for contributing to Singapore's success last year is much to be welcomed. However, it is the highly-paid professionals, managers and executives who will enjoy the rebate the most. To benefit the ordinary workers who form the bulk of our labour force and population, the Government should consider a tax revision of a more permanent nature, such as raising the personal income tax allowances to be more in line with the present day cost of living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the increase in personal tax allowances resulting in lower tax payments can be seen by the people as a form of wealth distribution and appreciated accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same basis, I hope the Government will give very careful consideration to the effect of an imposition of the proposed consumption tax on the vast majority of Singaporeans in the lower income group. Unlike the direct personal income tax, consumption tax and other forms of indirect taxes hit the poor harder than the rich because they are levied in proportion to the amount of goods and services used and not in proportion to the level of income of the users. Of course, the plausible argument is that it is only fair people are taxed according to their level of consumption. But we must remember that, while many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> workers have their earnings regulated by the National Wages Council, the entrepreneurs, the professionals, the managers and the executives have their profits, dividends and earnings regulated only by the free-play of market forces. These people, unlike the workers, can pass on the full burden of the consumption tax to other consumers, most of whom will ultimately be the workers and their families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope our economic performance will greatly improve by next year's budget so as to enable the Minister for Finance to make full use of the potential of the budget for helping the workers of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I support the Budget for fiscal year 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Marine Parade GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this budget has been praised by many as one which is hard to come by. It reflects the consistent style of our Government and is, at the same time, a caring one. Basically, there are not many changes from the previous year's budget. I could see that the response from the public is also not very enthusiastic. Of course, the working class will be happy because they will enjoy a 5% rebate. But the businessmen would feel that this budget is too conservative and too prudent. Basically, businessmen hope that the corporate tax could be reduced and that the employers' CPF contribution should not be changed. Because the United States is in the midst of an economic recession, the Gulf War has just concluded and its actual impact on the world economy is still uncertain. At the same time, as the Minister for Finance has said, last year we had more than 3% inflation and also our business community feels that the total cost of doing business here is going up because of higher wages, utilities, communication and freight charges. They fear that this may result in a loss in our international competitiveness, thus resulting in poorer economy and business performance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the businessmen's view of the budget, I am only partially in agreement with them because I do agree that we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have to maintain our competitiveness. But we must also look after the people in our country. Of course, we want to look after the welfare of our employees, but the company must be profitable before the employees could enjoy the fruits of their success. Many are feeling the effect of a tight labour market. We are looking for labourers, just as many other countries are doing so. Some feel that the labour shortage could be temporarily relieved by importing some foreign workers. In the interim period, I feel that the Government should give more consideration to various aspects so as to reduce the burden on our people. I sympathise with our local businessmen. I am a businessman. So I hope the Government would pay more attention to the feelings of our businessmen so that Singapore would retain its competitiveness. The progress of the NIEs and the developing industrial countries in this region should be closely monitored as their progress has got a very significant effect on our economy. From another perspective, we can see that the 1990 budget had its effect. We had surplus and our economy had good growth. So there is no need for us to change our financial policy. However, I hope that the Government would pay more attention to our increasing inflation rate. Korea and Taiwan are two very good examples.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget there are no further incentives for our young couples to have more children. Of course, having children is a family affair. It is a decision between the husband and the wife. However, for our young couples to have more children, particularly the professionals to have three, four or five children, then the wife may have to give up her job in order to look after the children. In this way, the income of the family would be reduced and the husband will have to bear the burden to pay for all the expenses in the family. This is indeed a very heavy burden. I suggest that the Government consider extending the tax deduction for the third and fourth children to the husband, because this tax relief is an encouragement for the couples to have more children. I think it
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should be extended to the husband as well. In order to have better effect, we should provide better child care services, such as creches, nursery classes, and a better education system. The Minister for Education has announced a new education system to delay streaming until Primary Four and also for vocational classes to be improved. This policy has been well received by the parents. I hope that with better facilities, Singapore will be a better place to live in. Under the circumstances, our young women will consider having more children and then later on to go back to work when there are sufficient facilities for their children to be looked after.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is the tax relief for handicapped dependants. I feel that this is still not enough. We all know that looking after children is a labour-intensive job. We have to spend a lot of time and energy. More so, if we have to look after our handicapped dependants. A deduction of $3,500 is definitely not enough. The Government should provide better tax incentives and also more facilities to look after these handicapped people. Of course, we do not want to have a radical welfare state, but we must have a society where one could feel that it is caring and loving.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our home-ownership scheme, our result has been remarkable. It is something that we are proud of. However, there are still some young couples in Singapore who are having problems with housing. Why? This is because their combined income has exceeded the ceiling for the purchase of a HDB flat and, at the same time, they find that they could not afford to buy private property. Somebody has suggested to me that the Government should give tax deduction on the interest they have to pay for their housing loans. By so doing, we would encourage more people to buy their own property and, at the same time, it would also help to prevent young people from thinking of migrating to other countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the Government to consider raising the ceiling for self-employed people who wish to make
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> voluntary contribution to CPF, up to the contribution rate for employees, because the self-employed people also wish to have some savings that they could use in old age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Minister for Finance would, while encouraging our businessmen to venture overseas, also consider giving tax incentive to employees who are posted overseas on long-term basis. Singapore is their home. They have to look after their children and maintain their families. However, because of their work, they have to be away from home. I hope that the Hon. Minister for Finance would consider giving them some tax concessions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has been candid and transparent in his Budget Statement and in his analysis of the problems facing the economy. Put in a nutshell, the problem is one of rising business costs. This problem is being discussed by businessmen, entrepreneurs and investors in forums ranging from the coffeeshops to the boardrooms. The Minister has confirmed that in 1990, business costs rose by 7.3%. Even more significant, the Minister has warned that this has brought business costs back to the level of 1982 - the pre-1985 recession scenario. Again, as in the scenario of 1985, the main factors (and here I refer to the local factors or indigenous factors) contributing to the rising costs of business are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) increase in labour cost;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) increase in rentals; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) increase in cost of services, such as transport and utilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Labour costs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour costs have increased tremendously. Nominal wage rose by 9.4%, translated to a real wage increase of 6.4%. The wage share in GDP rose from 42% in 1989 to 44% in 1990. Although this is below the previous peak of 48%, this is indeed cause for concern as the trend seems to be for it to rise further. One only needs to look at the advertisements for employees in the newspapers to confirm the complaints of businesses that they are short of labour across the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> board - from factory operator level to clerical staff and executives. The Minister has warned that we should "watch it carefully", that is, this trend of increase in labour costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Other Costs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentals have also risen sharply. In the Central Business District, rental increases of 200-300% are not uncommon. Many small businesses, especially those in retail, have been very badly affected. The greatest cause for concern is that many of them are our own citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's infrastructural cost has also increased with the increase in labour and fuel costs. The services highlighted by the Minister are transport and utilities. These services also affect all our workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this scenario, the business community is asking: "What is the solution?" The scenario is so similar to the 1985 recession that to many, it is tempting to prescribe the same treatment. However, before we over-react, perhaps the Government should take the lead in providing pro-active action or advice. It is only the Government that has the resources to mount an exercise akin to that of the Economic Committee set up in 1985 to analyze the problems and propose solutions. A global perspective of the problem and its solutions is best put forward by the Government with the private sector actively participating. As Mr Lim Boon Heng has said, there should be a tripartite approach involving Government, employers and labour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must reiterate that the private sector is very anxious (I am sure that the Government is too) for a solution. One not uncommon statement that reflects this anxiety is this: "In a recession, there is no business. In good times we are bogged down by insufficient labour, high labour costs and high rentals. When is it ever a 'good time'?" This statement is of course cynical, but reflective of the mood. The private sector is comforted that the Minister for Finance is acutely aware of the problem of rising business costs, but nowhere in the Budget Statement is it clearly stated what steps the Government is willing to take to rectify
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the problem. We all accept that external factors are beyond our control. However, as the 1985 Economic Committee had shown, there are some factors within our control - more specifically, within Government's control. Taking a wait-and-see attitude is only increasing the anxiety level. Statements like: "The Government cannot cocoon businesses from the resource constraints that we face as an economy" are not absolute truths, and give little comfort. The recession of 1985 has shown that active and timely Government intervention (Government acting as the catalyst) is important in the resolution of the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, paragraph 33 of the Budget Statement [col. 247] puts this Government's approach to the problem more accurately than the previous statement that I quoted. The Minister reiterates, in paragraph 33, this Government's belief in a free market mechanism, whilst acknowledging that "the market mechanism is not a panacea", and that it will "take some time to work out proper schemes to harness market forces constructively, and design mechanisms which are as distortion free as possible".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour problem and our policy towards foreign workers deserve high priority for re-examination. The reason for the increase in foreign worker levy has been explained ad infinitum. However, the formula has not worked to resolve the problem in a wider perspective in that labour cost is a problem today again, as in 1985. The levy may have helped to contain the narrower objective of controlling the number of foreign workers in Singapore. To compound the problem, there are still sectors, eg, in construction, where labour shortage is still acute. I will elaborate on this problem further in the debate under the Ministry of Labour. We need to re-examine our whole philosophy regarding guest-workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of high rentals also needs to be re-examined. Much as tenants today do not relish high rental increase of 200-300%, likewise, landlords and investors do not relish the "below-cost" rentals of 1985 and 1986. To make
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for a smoother economic cycle, perhaps we should indeed take the advice of the Minister to take this opportunity "to work out proper schemes to harness market forces constructively". Yes, we have taken years to do away with the archaic "rent control" laws. Can we put in place a more rational system by persuasion or, as a last resort, by legislation? This Government can be very successfully persuasive if it wants to, so we may not have to resort to legislation. As the property market is now around its peak, perhaps all can be persuaded to accept a ceiling figure for fluctuation when it comes to renewal of rental. I am sure that the experts (property consultants and economists with a wider perspective) can propose a range, if not a fixed figure. Thus, both landlord and tenant can live together, and comfortably. Perhaps there are models overseas that we can follow. In this area of property management, Government is a key player, as a major landlord, and thus can do much to influence private sector's attitude.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say that the recession of 1985 is still fresh in our minds. The painful sacrifices that all had to make is a stark reminder of the importance of the Government, private sector and labour working together. If the scenario and problems facing us now are vastly different from that in 1985, I would be more comforted. Alas, they are similar - high cost of business due to increase in labour costs, increased costs of services and rentals. We should now press on, with the advice of the Minister, "to work out proper schemes to harness market forces constructively, and design mechanisms which are as distortion free as possible". This is our best insurance for a prosperous future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement announced by the Finance Minister. It is an excellent Budget and will benefit almost everyone. I would like to comment on the following:
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>(1) CPF Increases</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced by the Finance Minister, with effect from 1st July 1991, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employers' CPF contribution rate will be increased by 1 percentage point to 17 1/2 per cent. The employees' rate will be reduced by half a percentage point, from 23% to 22 1/2%. The total CPF contribution rate will therefore increase by half a percentage point, to 40%. This CPF rate increase of 1/2 percentage point is small compared to the 9.4% increase in average monthly earnings over last year. However, this 1/2% increase is large compared to the 1990 overall labour productivity increase of 3.4%, as reported in the Economic Survey of Singapore 1990. In 1989, the average monthly earnings increased by 9.8% compared to a productivity increase of 4.8%. 1990 was the second successive year of wage increases exceeding productivity increases since the 1985 recession. As shown so clearly by Chart 4.6 of the 1990 Economic Survey of Singapore, one of the main causes of the 1985 recession was the fact that annual wage increases exceeded productivity increases for several years prior to 1985. I am afraid, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now repeating the same mistake. If our wage increases continue to exceed productivity increases for a few more years, Singapore's competitiveness vis-a-vis the other Newly Industrialised Economies (NIEs) will be completely eroded. Singapore will be hit by another recession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late to reverse this trend, Mr Speaker, Sir. Singapore's competitiveness and Singapore's future depend very much on our ability to keep our productivity increases above our wage increases as shown so clearly by our economic performance of 1986, 1987 and 1988.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is impossible to achieve if we continue to maintain a total CPF contribution rate of 40%. This is simply too high. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I request the Finance Minister to seriously consider reducing the total CPF contribution rate in his next Budget statement before he is forced to do so by another recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>(2) Entertainments Duty and Tourism Cess</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to reduce the duty on entertainments from 10% of the payment for admission to 5% will be strongly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> welcomed by the travel industry. Tourist arrivals have slowed down as a result of the Gulf War, and occupancy rates of many hotels have been reduced to as low as 50%. With this reduction in entertainments duty, more shows can be organised, leading to a more vibrant, cultural and entertainment scene in Singapore. We can expect to see more big-time entertainers, better quality international sports competitions such as wrestling, boxing and golf, and improved cinemas. This will definitely benefit Singaporeans as well as helping to increase tourist arrivals. Hotel managers will cheer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important for the travel industry is the reduction of the tourism cess from 4% to 3%. According to Table 8.3 of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1990, the tourism cess for 1990 was estimated to be about $89 million, an increase of 60.4% over that collected in 1989. This is a hefty increase and has partly led to the increase in the cost of having a holiday in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has stated that the tourism cess reduction will only be implemented for a year from 1st April 1991. May I suggest that in order to keep our tourism industry on a competitive basis, the tourism cess should be kept at 3% for a few more years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>(3) Local Entrepreneurship</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the Finance Minister has ignored the plight of local entrepreneurs in their struggle for survival in Singapore's foreign dominated and very competitive business environment. The tax incentives for companies announced this year will benefit mainly the bigger and more established companies, many of which are Government owned, directly or indirectly. How many local companies, for example, can benefit from the tax exemption on dividends paid out of foreign income? Generous tax incentives were also given to banks, trust companies, securities companies and shipping companies. May I suggest that the Government seriously consider granting some tax incentives for the promotion
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and development of local entrepreneurship in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1990 Economic Survey of Singapore seems to indicate that local enterprises are performing well, stating that local enterprises account for 94% of establishments, 71% of total employment and 59% of total value added in the manufacturing, commerce and services sectors. Unfortunately, the Government choose to define local enterprises as companies with more than 30% local equity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the more conventional definition of local enterprises as companies with more than 50% local equity, the picture is not so rosy. In fact, Lawrence B. Krause, Koh Ai Tee and Lee (Tsao) Yuan in their book "The Singapore Economy Reconsidered" have shown that foreign enterprises, which is defined as enterprises with more than 50% foreign equity, dominate the Singapore economy. In the manufacturing sector, for example, over the years 1975 to 1984, foreign manufacturing enterprises comprised only 23.1% of establishments, but generated 84.2% of direct exports, 72.9% of output, 65.1% of value added, 67.2% of capital expenditure and 54.6% of employment. Similarly, in the commerce and services sectors, foreigners played important roles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not begrudge the economic contributions made by foreigners, especially MNCs, that have invested so heavily in Singapore. But is it not time that the Government paid more attention to the problems faced by local entrepreneurs? For example, all companies in Singapore face an acute labour shortage problem. I am not asking the Government to consider giving double tax relief for the foreign workers' levy paid by local companies. What I am requesting is that the Government should consider more leniently applications by local companies for foreign workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some tax incentives would be useful. For a start, I hope the Finance Minister will review the proposal made last year by Mr Chandra Das, MP for Cheng San GRC, that the earnings of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> local companies of less than a quarter million dollars be taxed at a lower rate. Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I still hope that the Government will seriously consider setting up a separate agency to look after the interests of our local entrepreneurs. The EDB has done a good job in the economic development of Singapore, but their primary concern is with the MNCs. A separate statutory board will go a long way in dealing with the problems faced by our local entrepreneurs. I hope that the Government will review this issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the budget proposed for the new financial year shows that our economy has been functioning at an even keel. The Minister for Finance has not proposed any dramatic changes, tax incentives or tax deterrents to alter the state of the economy. In fact, one could see that the Minister's main focus of attention was external. He stressed on the need to build external linkages and international networking. So, most of his new tax incentives are favoured towards expanding international activities of the business sectors, such as,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the tax exemption on dividends paid out of foreign income;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Approved International Shipping Enterprise (AIS) scheme;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the tax deduction for General Provisions made by banks;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the tax incentive for services provided by trust companies; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the tax incentive for underwriting and managing international securities issues. In comparison to these five tax incentives, on the home front, little is given out except for the tax relief for handicapped spouse and the property tax refund for vacant residential buildings undergoing building works.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Minister's attention is directed at stimulating international businesses for Singapore, I feel that he should keep an eye on the domestic scene as well. As he has said in his Budget speech "there were signs that strong demand had led to overheating in the economy." Therefore, there is no
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> need to sound the alarm bell yet. But there are obvious demand-pull and cost push factors that will cause the economy to overheat. Some of these factors are, as have been mentioned by other Members of Parliament, the tight labour market, a strong Singapore dollar, and also the higher cost of doing businesses such as higher wages, rentals, telephone and utilities bills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that we saw a higher inflation rate last year. The official figure quoted from the Consumer Price Index is 3.4%. As this index only measures the prices of basic services and commodities, the real inflation rate for the average Singaporean (who has been labelled as a middle income earner or a middle class person), his inflation index in fact could be higher, between 5% and 7%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Gulf War is over, it is expected that the US and other western economies will become buoyant arising from the extensive re-building of Kuwait and Iraq. Singapore will enjoy the spillover effects of this overall fast recovery of these Western countries. The projected 3% to 6% growth for 1991 may become once again underestimated. I would urge the Minister and his economic planners to keep a close watch on the state of our domestic economy. And particularly, to avoid the over-use of the price mechanism and market forces justification to increase the rates and fees controlled by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to comment specifically on three issues:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The comprehensive goods and services tax or commonly known as the consumption tax;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The shifting of long-term CPF rates; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some suggestions on the Edusave Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Comprehensive Goods and Services Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed consumption tax is generally unpopular. It is natural that any new tax scheme will meet with strong resistance. Each person is fearful of being taxed more. A similar experience was encountered with the Poll Tax in UK and the consumption tax bill in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the consumption tax and the proposed charging of telephone bills by time-usage are not warmly welcomed. The people are concerned that they would see the opening of the Pandora's box. Even though assurances are given that the tax scheme and the time usage charge for telephone bills will be equitable, there is naturally much worry that the new systems, once in place, will facilitate the imposition of higher charges by the Government as time goes on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as there will be a White Paper on this subject, we shall leave the debate till then.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>CPF Contribution Rates</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have spoken on this subject. It is a stated Government policy that the long-term target is 20% contributions each from both employers and employees. From 1st July this year, the CPF rate will be 17 1/2% for employers and 22 1/2% for employees. I would like to suggest a review of the target level of 20% each from both sides. I suppose the objective of equal contributions from both sides is to be equitable. As the shift of contribution weighs towards the employers and away from the employees, there will be the benefit of higher take-home pay for the employees. However, we must be mindful that as the employers pay higher CPF rates, their cost burden is increased. As our companies' competitiveness gets eroded due to higher labour cost, the viability of these businesses will be adversely affected. The previous rate by the employers was 25%, which was obviously untenable, as it was part of the reason that contributed to the recession in 1985. I am not sure, Sir, whether the 20% that is targeted for the long term will also be tenable for the employers. What I am suggesting is that perhaps the Government should do a very detailed study on whether such rates are equitable to both the employees and the employers and whether they will have any overall beneficial or adverse impact on the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the adverse impact will also affect the employees. The slowdown of business can lead to lower year-end bonuses. In drastic cases, retrenchments may result. As an employee myself, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would naturally like to enjoy higher take-home pay. However, taking into account the global considerations that local companies must maintain their cost competitiveness, I would like to suggest that the Government make a review of the target contribution levels for both employers as well as employees, and also to take a very cautious approach to future adjustments in CPF contribution rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Edusave Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must state that I fully support the Edusave Scheme. It is bold and a very creative stroke of genius. The objective of the Scheme is to demonstrate the Government's commitment to invest in our people and to provide equal opportunities for each new generation. As I said earlier, the scheme is bold and creative, but I do have one major lament on it. I strongly feel that the shortcoming is that the contribution is being made by the Government only and no counterpart commitment or contribution is expected from the people themselves. It is structured too much of a handout, a give-away.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as parents, recognise that investing in our children's education is paramount. Therefore, the Government should allow the parents to demonstrate a commitment on their part as well. I would like to make the following suggestions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to raise the eligibility age from 16 to 18 years old. I feel that the additional two years of 17 and 18 years old of a child's education is in fact the most critical stage. Moreover, the costs as well as the benefits of extra-curricular activities and enrichment programmes will be higher at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as a demonstration of their commitment, and to enable more funds that can be utilised for the child's educational enhancement programmes, parents should be permitted to make a counterpart contribution, up to the amount made by the Government. This counterpart contribution should be voluntary as not all parents have the means to make such payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as a gesture of encouragement, the counterpart contribution from parents can either be in cash or from their CPF ordinary account. If the contribution is in cash, I would like to suggest that it be tax deductible. The Minister has already proposed that the parents' contribution for the fourth child be tax deductible. If it is from the CPF account, it can only be drawn from the portion of the CPF account which is allowable for investments. This way, Sir, there will be no additional demand for higher CPF contribution. The parents can either decide whether to invest in stocks and shares, or put their CPF money in their children's education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, may I conclude by hoping that with the ensuing peace after the Gulf crisis, the world will enjoy rapid economic recovery and Singapore will see continued better times ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of the Feedback Unit Panel, I was privileged to chair the last Feedback Unit dialogue session on the budget last week. The session was attended by representatives of the chambers of commerce, trade associations, companies and the NTUC. I would like to take this opportunity to share with this House the main points of the feedback received, followed by my own personal views. Let me say from the outset that I do not necessarily agree with all the feedback received.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Feedback Unit Dialogue Session</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Finance Industry</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance industry was generally happy with the budget and welcomed the incentives offered by the Government and is looking forward to the Government releasing more information on these incentives soon. Finance companies, however, would like to know whether they can be included for the tax deduction on general provisions as they are also required to maintain adequate reserves to cushion themselves against unforeseen losses in their loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Manufacturing and Construction Industry</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing companies, on the other hand, were disappointed with the budget. They felt that the budget did not address
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the two current problems faced by the industry, namely, high business costs and shortage of labour. They were unhappy with the 1% increase in employers' CPF contribution rate and the introduction of the water conservation tax. They feared that as a result of these increases, the manufacturing industry would soon lose its competitiveness. They wonder whether the Government has any long-term plan or strategy for the industry. And if it does, the Government should make clear its strategy for the industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing companies expect a slower growth this year. As the recession in the US started last year, they expect that they will be hit by the recession in the second half of this year. They were hoping that the Government would introduce some measures to help them tide over this difficult period. At the same time, due to the strong Singapore dollar, their business cost has gone up even before the new tax increases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industry supports the Government's call to relocate operations to the neighbouring countries where labour cost is cheaper. However, they find that there is little incentive from the Government for them to do so. In fact, companies which have relocated part of their operations overseas face problems with the training of their workers. Companies which need to train the workers of their overseas plants or branches are presently required to pay the foreign workers levy for these workers when they send them here for training. At the same time, these workers also count towards the 40% quota on the total number of foreign workers for the company. They request that these foreign workers on training be exempted from the foreign workers levy and be excluded from the 40% quota. The Ministry of Labour could introduce regulations to prevent possible abuse by companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the manufacturing and construction industries were also unhappy with the Government's policy of controlling the influx of foreign workers through both the foreign workers levy and the foreign-to-local-worker ratio of 40%. They felt that since the Government has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> already fixed the ceiling of foreign workers to determine the supply, there is no further necessity for the high foreign workers levy which only serves to raise the cost of doing business here.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Corporate and Property Tax.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business representatives were also disappointed that there was no reduction of the corporate tax rate. They disagreed with the Finance Minister's statement that our corporate tax rate is among the lowest in the world. They quoted corporate taxes being lower in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The long-term tax rate recommended by the Economic Committee is 25%. Based on the present tax rate of 31%, it appeared to them that we are still very far off from the long-term target rate of 25%. They had also expected property tax, which is presently higher than Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, to be reduced further so that investments in property would become more attractive, especially in view of revaluations of property carried out by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Overseas Earnings.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business representatives also felt that an across-the-board tax exemption could be given for overseas earnings repatriated to Singapore rather than on a case-by-case basis. In so doing, more funds would be remitted to Singapore for development purposes. At the same time, tax breaks could have been given for expenditure incurred by Singaporeans working overseas, eg, such as expenditure on housing rental. This type of incentives would encourage more Singaporeans to work abroad.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to give my own views of this year's budget which I consider a cautious and conservative one. There has been a great expectation that the corporate tax rate would be reduced this year in view of the economic slowdown, because the Economic Committee had recommended a long-term corporate tax rate of 25%. It is not clear whether the Government has accepted that as the long-term tax rate to attain. I would like to suggest that the Government states publicly the long-term tax rates, both corporate and personal, that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> it is striving to achieve, and also the time frame for achieving it. This will help companies, and even individuals, in their long-term planning.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for personal income taxes, most of the lower income earners were disappointed that the tax reliefs for the taxpayer and the family members have not been raised. With rising cost of living, especially in keeping children at school, lower income earners are shouldering relatively heavier tax burdens than before if these reliefs are not adjusted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the relief for the first, second and third child is $1,500 each, and for the fourth and fifth child born before 1st August 1973, it is $300. For the fourth child born on or after 1st January 1988, the relief is $1,500, but there is nothing for the fourth or subsequent child born between 1st August 1973 and 31st December 1987. I find this regulation inconsistent with our present population policy. I feel that the Government should simplify this tax relief to $1,500 for every dependent child under 16 years of age, or if over 16, still in school, college or university. Why do we keep penalising those parents who, on hindsight, have done a great service to the country with four or more children?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for contributions by parents to the fourth child's Edusave scheme, there seems to be no compelling reason why we should not allow tax relief for contributions for the fifth and subsequent child too. The amount involved is minimal, but the gesture would clarify the Government's population and education policies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a case for the personal tax rates to be lower for Singaporeans than permanent residents or foreigners. The differential need not be too wide, say, 1-2% in favour of Singapore citizens. This is necessary, in my view, to convince non-citizens that there are advantages of being Singapore citizens. Right now, many permanent residents who have lived in Singapore for a long time are reluctant to take up Singapore citizenship as they feel that the obligations outweigh the perceived benefits. While the benefits are almost identical, they
  <br>
  <br>

  <br> prefer to remain as permanent residents so that they can enjoy the best of both worlds, ie, their host country as well as their home country. This problem should be addressed so that Singaporeans will feel more appreciated and proud to be Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that a White Paper on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be released soon. I urge the Government to take the opportunity to do a comprehensive review of all income taxes when the GST is studied and the machinery put in place later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's financial policy for the year 1st April 1991 to 31st March 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to support the budget statement. I would also like to commend the Minister for Finance for a painless budget which seeks to strengthen Singapore as a financial centre. One may ask why is the budget painless. It is painless because many of the increases were done outside the budget period. There is nothing more to increase and therefore I would think that it is painless in nature.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase has been very insignificant for the ordinary wage earner. You may ask what is in store for the ordinary wage earner. I think there is nothing much in store, except for the 5% tax rebate which has been offered. This is not enough to even buy two plates of nasi goreng.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister would have relieved many people if he had announced an increase in personal relief, an area which has not been reviewed for a long time. The question of personal relief is a recurring theme in many people's discussion in each budget. I am sure if the Minister goes round the constituencies, he probably would have an earful on the need to review personal relief itself. This has not been done for the last 20 years or so. People are looking forward to a change in personal relief much more than the small tax rebate given over the last two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cost of living has risen as a result of increased cost in the purchase of some main public services, such as transport, health, education and housing. Our inflation is on the rise and this is around 3.4% this year, and I hope that inflation will be under control. If we have a runaway inflation, real wage earnings are likely to be eroded. All these increases have effects on the working class and they are concerned about the affordability of public services. Sir, Government has to moderate the increase of charges for public services by taking the following measures:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, allocating more grants to meet the operating cost of basic public services. Sir, I am not saying that we should move to the welfare model. I am not advocating that. I am suggesting that in view of the surpluses that we have accumulated and with our overall objective to spend money on more human resource development, the area of health education and housing deserves a deployment of more resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, ensuring better coordination of increase of charges amongst different Government departments so that it would not give undue burden to consumers. If you look at runaway increases by different Government departments, all coming together at one time, they have caused tremendous pressure and burden on the ordinary wage earners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, making Government departments to justify the need for increases. Unless there is specific justification for Government departments to increase their costs, the Minister for Finance should perhaps relent on this. Otherwise there is a need to review and relook at the requirement for increases by different departments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, ensuring that those who are poor and cannot afford are provided the services. In relation to education, I note there is much worry that the cost of education in Singapore is increasing. Many families with primary and secondary school children are concerned about the increase in educational expenses. These expenses are likely to be higher in the near future. In view that we are encouraging human resource develop-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment, it would be relevant for Government to grant tax deduction for expenses up to $200 per year per child on educational enrichment programmes organised by the primary and secondary schools. Sir, we have provided Edusave. I see no reason why we are not allowing parents to have deduction in their spending in this area. The costs in terms of supplementary fees and other related fees for primary and secondary schools are likely to increase. Hence, there is justification to look into more details to allow for tax deduction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government encourages families to look after their aged parents by providing tax relief. This is indeed a good policy and we should continue to review such a policy to see how we can enable families to look after and support their aged sick parents. However, the tax relief provided for families looking after their aged sick parents is the same as those caring for aged parents. Sir, it is financially more burdensome for families taking care of aged sick parents and it would therefore be more appropriate to consider a higher tax relief for this group. It is suggested that the amount of relief for each dependent aged sick parent be increased from $2,500 to $3,500.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already introduced some form of consumption tax. The water conservation tax is a case in point. The time-based telephone charges to be introduced by Telecom will be coming next. Sir, the budget provision for these areas will have to be reviewed. Sir, the subject of consumption tax must be carefully examined before it is implemented as this is a radical departure from our present taxation system. We have a big base of small taxpayers and, as such, consumption tax may have to be carefully examined before we introduce it because such an introduction may have ramifications for the lower taxpayers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I urge the Minister to carefully follow up on Government departments which are making surplus in revenue to see if there is justification for increasing their charges in future. In this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> way, Sir, it will help ensure that our basic social services, namely, education, housing and health are more affordable for the people.

   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I rise in support of the motion on the budget for the financial year 1991 by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget Statement could be considered to be cautious and low-key, but it is a budget targeted towards our long term economic goal. The increase of 1% on CPF contribution by employers and a once-off 5% across-the-board rebate on personal income tax reflect the influence of the Gulf War and the US economic recession over us and hence the cautious tone of this statement, which is understandable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging more Singapore companies to venture overseas by eliminating double taxation on dividends paid out of foreign income is also good for our long term economic development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other announcements such as lowering entertainments duty, tourism cess, tax refund for vacant homes under renovation and higher import and excise duty on tobacco and cigarettes are considered lukewarm to those non-smokers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin Harn Tong spoke for the workers. Mr Choo Wee Khiang spoke for the businessmen. I am going to speak for the man-in-the-street. The disappointing feature of this statement is the increase in tax on domestic water bill regardless of the number of members in the household. For example, take my small family size when I was living in a private condominium. With due consid-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> eration over water conservation daily, my family water consumption was only about 25 to 35 cubic metres per month. The rationale to levy a 5% tax on the amount in excess of 20 cubic metres per month is not convincing. We have to consider the fact that this 5% tax is to be levied on top of the existing 5% tax on household PUB bills which exceed $40 per month. The existing 5% tax on the excess amount is already a reminder towards the importance of conservation of water. The additional levy has resulted in some people criticising that this is contrary to our recent policy of encouraging higher birth rate and promoting extended families. I hope that the Minister for Finance will give the man-in-the-street a better explanation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the revelation that the White Paper on consumption tax together with the draft legislation will be presented to Parliament in due course. Sir, the introduction of a consumption tax should be reconsidered to prevent any wide-ranging repercussion. It should not be allowed to become a sensitive political issue. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Ministry of Finance would defer the implementation for as long as possible so as to alleviate the worries of the lower income group. As a Chinese saying goes: Hear the creak of the stairs but see no one coming down the stairs. Let this be the case as far as consumption tax is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following our universal education policy and the improvement in our education system, the cost of education has increased. This has been reflected in the many adjustments in the school fees in the independent schools, polytechnics, NUS, and NTI over the past few years. Many parents are beginning to feel the strain of the school fee for the children and the burden of bringing up their children is getting heavier. I would therefore like to propose that the education fees of about $3,600 per child for those in the tertiary level should be given tax exemption. I hope the Minister for Finance will consider this proposal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for letting me speak in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak in support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his budget speech mentioned that in spite of the strong growth of 8.3% in 1990, there were signs of over-heating in the economy. Inflation rate was 3.4% and business cost specifically rose by 7.3%, and nominal wages by 9.4%. The Minister also mentioned that 1990 was the fourth year in a row that we have achieved growth that exceeded the growth of the indigenous labour and productivity. The productivity rate for 1990 was 1.4% lower than the figure of 4.8% in 1989, as given in the annual Economic Survey. And the share of wages in the GDP has also risen by 2% from 42% to 44%. The ordinary businessman is concerned about the rise in cost. In this year's budget, called the "Shenton Way Budget" by some, there are no goodies for the small and medium local businesses. If the prospect for export-oriented businesses and manufacturing for 1991 is expected to be lower than in 1990, as mentioned in the budget speech, should the Government not also consider some assistance to the category of small and medium sized local businesses so that the small businesses in Defu Lane and Alexandra Village can also share in the goodies given this year to Shenton Way?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are always happy when our neighbour's economy do well, but generally this has also brought about scarcer foreign labour availability to us. On top of all this, labour cost will rise again by the raising of the CPF rate in July. I urge the Minister to watch the cost increases carefully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area which I would like to cover concerned the stalled Uruguay Round and the proposed East Asian Economic Grouping suggested by Malaysia. The concern about the stalled Uruguay Round amidst the intra-regional trade concerns and practices, particularly in agriculture between Europe and the US, is shared and articulated by the Malaysian Minister for International
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Trade. While I feel that it is good for Singapore to build networks and linkages in outside grouping, we should not sidetrack ASEAN as an established regional grouping for such dialogue and discussion with outside parties. ASEAN has established a substantial track record and goodwill. And ASEAN has also been a springboard for dialogue and discussion with outside blocs. My concern, Sir, is that we should not dilute the focus and goodwill ASEAN attracts in international fora, particularly at this crucial stage when the Uruguay Round is about to be re-started.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the biggest trading partner, the major country we export most to, is still the US, which accounts for 20% of our domestic exports. I believe the US is also the top foreign investing country in Singapore. While we need external linkages as stabilizers, some stabilizers may require undue counter-weights. I sincerely hope that our linkages with such a proposed EAEG grouping should not affect the trade and investment relations we have with the US and the EC countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area which I would like to touch on concerns the budget surpluses generated each year and which are being transferred to the Sinking Fund. Last year, 1989/90, $3.4 billion of the surplus was transferred to the Sinking Fund. This year, 1990/91, an estimated figure of $4.1 billion from the Consolidated Revenue will be transferred. This transfer to the Sinking Fund represents the budgetary surpluses run by the Government - revenue over expenditure. At the same time, the development expenditure in the same period is $4.1 billion for 1989/90, drawn down from the Development Fund. For 1990/91, the amount is estimated to be around $4 billion. However, the income on the investments of the Development Fund which stands at about $47 billion is about $2 billion each year for the past two years. This is about 50% of the spending of the development expenditure last year. The Development Fund has been increasing from $43 billion in 1989/90 to $47 billion in 1990/91, and the total amount in the Development Fund and Sinking Fund today totals $73 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> These figures are found in the Command Paper, pages 95-98.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the argument of prudence by the Government. Running high surpluses into Consolidated Revenue and Development Fund may represent Government's prudence. But at the same time, there are many off-budget increases in taxes and charges borne by ordinary people and businesses. I sincerely hope that the Government can think of more ways to go slow on revenue increases which are always justified on the grounds of achieving some desirable policy objectives, for example, car parks, road taxes, and telephone charges, and to think of more ways of passing back the wealth to the people. One such way thought of and proposed by the Prime Minister is the Edusave Scheme. Then the people will really begin to appreciate more what the Government can do for them, and to share in the wealth created by them. In this way, the "Shenton Way Budget" may be shared by all ordinary people and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget is a great disappointment to the man-in-the-street. The one-time 5% income tax rebate is really parsimonious when compared to the hefty surplus which the Government has again accumulated. If another 5% tax rebate had been given, it would have been more reasonable. A 10% income tax rebate would have been more reflective of the reward given to the people for their contribution towards making last year another successful one for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government always commends itself for the success of Singapore. Actually, the people of Singapore play an equally important part. The people of Singapore are responsible and always respond to the call of the Government, whether it is in relation to wage restraint, to be economically more productive, to serve in national service, to be more productive in terms of having more babies, or whatever policy of the day,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which needed their cooperation. Yet, what do the people get in return at budget time? This year, it is a miserly 5% income tax rebate, at a time when the Government can well afford it, and the average working man can barely make ends meet due to the high costs imposed on them by the Government, in particular over the last two years. Is there Asian-style gratefulness on the part of the Government given in return for the wholehearted support of the people for the various Government policies? I would say, No. The people of Singapore have to fend for themselves all the way, whether it be overcoming poverty, often through no fault of theirs, health care, education or housing. The people have to pay, often at great sacrifices, for these social services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gulf War had made the latter half of 1990 and the beginning of this year a difficult time for the majority of our local shopkeepers. It is well known that the tourist arrivals during that period were low. Our local businessmen reported a drastic drop in business over the December peak holiday season. I was also told that hotel occupancy rates were low. I was informed that one five-star hotel had only 45% occupancy in January of this year. Therefore, I would say that an additional 5% income tax rebate, and also taking into account the cut in one-half percentage point of the employee's CPF contribution, would not contribute to an inflationary pressure on our economy. The extra money that would go into the hands of Singaporeans would quickly be mopped up by the higher costs imposed on the people by the Government, and not go to overheat the economy, as some people would fear. Because, in any event, the people already have less money in their hands due to the bad economic situation over the last half year or so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people in Singapore say that this year's budget is a letdown. They expected the corporate tax and the personal income tax rates to be reduced. I agree with them. The income tax rate for both companies as well as individuals should have been lowered to 30% each. A lower corporate tax rate would make
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore more competitive internationally and, in particular, a great help and boost to our struggling local businessmen, in view of the fact that they now have to pay a higher employers' CPF rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only lip-service given by the Government to help our local small and medium-sized enterprises. In reality, almost nothing effective has been done for them. It is high time the Minister reviewed this issue more seriously and come up with fiscal policies to assist our local businessmen more meaningfully. It must be remembered that they do not have ready-made international markets like the multi-national companies. If there is a new fiscal policy, it is almost certain that there shall be an increase in cost to our local businessmen. This has been the trend. It is common knowledge that the local Chambers of Commerce have been asking the Government to keep down the costs of doing business in Singapore, but they have all not been heeded. One concrete step the Government could have taken in this budget to assist local entrepreneurs is to have lowered the corporate tax rate to 30%, but the Government has refused to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards Edusave, the majority of people in Singapore do not believe in the sincerity of the Government in introducing this programme. They see it as a political gimmick to win votes at the next elections. Education must surely be the responsibility of the Government, in particular to those children in the lower-income group, regardless of whether there is an Edusave programme or not. Under the Edusave programme the Government apparently gives $100 per child per year, but at the same time it will inevitably take back that money through higher ECA fees, higher school fees and university fees. Then, one would ask: Why bother to have the Edusave Scheme at all, if it were not for a political reason?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative cost of administering the Edusave programme for 500,000 school children must be substantial to the Government. Which department will take care of the Edusave programme? Will it be the CPF Board (and starting
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> early to have each citizen have an account at the CPF Board) or the Ministry of Education? Why incur all the additional expenses to maintain this massive Edusave Scheme? Would it not be better to plough back the added administrative cost to our school children?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the goods and services tax (GST), the people of Singapore await with trepidation the arrival of the implementation of the goods and services tax. When the Bill comes before Parliament, there will surely be a full debate on it. Meanwhile, I can only say that the GST is a backward step. Such a tax was widely opposed in Japan, and I am certain it will be equally unpopular in Singapore. Effectively, it will make Singapore lose its free port status when nearly all the goods will come under this tax. Cost of living in Singapore will surely rise, and Singapore will be less competitive as a tourist designation. The working people of Singapore generally will surely suffer. The SDP will oppose the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the opportunity of going through the financial statements. On pages 198 and 199, I note that the Government spent only about $880,000 (less than a million dollars) towards grants for development of day care centres. I would say that that amount is surely not enough. There is a crying need for more day care centres, especially when there are increased births over the last two years, and many mothers need also to work to supplement the family income. The funds allocated to building of child care centres must be increased by at least two-fold.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 198 of the financial statement, we see that less than half a million dollars ($450,000) was spent in direct development of libraries. Why this small amount? One would think that library services are something which would rank as important as any school needs. More money should have been expended on this very important area, but it has not been done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on page 199 of the financial statement, one sees that a large sum of about $340,000 is given to upgrade furniture of 30 Residents' Committees. I do
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not know why they need so much money to upgrade furniture. At my MP's office, we buy chairs at only between $12 and $15 each. Why do Residents' Committees need to expend thousands of dollars of public money on furniture? I think this is a sure case of over-extravagance. Residents' Committees must be told to practise economy. One Member has already commented on the sums of money spent unnecessarily by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 199, we note that the People's Association is given a capital grant of nearly $6 million. As far as I know, only PAP constituencies enjoy that money. At Potong Pasir, as an Opposition Member, I do not see one cent of that large sum of money paid out at public expense.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another item which has perplexed me. On page 117 of the financial statement, I note that the Ministry of Defence spent about $1.4 million on official celebrations. Why that large sum of money? I would like the Minister to explain under what circumstances and for what occasion or occasions such a big amount has been approved by him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only picked up a few items from the financial statements to show that the Government can improve and be more prudent in spending public money. It has been shown that in areas that the Government needs to spend more money, they do not do so, and then in areas that are seemingly unimportant, large sums of money have been freely disbursed. All this goes to show that there is need for closer scrutiny on the expenditure of public funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Chee Whye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Chee Whye (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has presented a well-prepared budget that lays the foundations for tomorrow, with its emphasis on education, infrastructure development and improvements to our quality of life. I would like to offer some comments for the Minister's consideration. But before I do so, please allow me to declare my interest as a businessman and as a Cor-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> porate Manager because naturally business will benefit if the Minister lends us a sympathetic ear.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been sentiments expressed against the 1% increase in CPF contributions by employers. The effect of this increase, I feel, will be washed away in the larger annual wage adjustment and we should not allow it to divert our attention from the greater underlying issue. My colleagues, speaking ahead of me, have addressed their concern about the rising wage cost in this tight labour market. My union colleagues have also had their say. Let me join in to point out that we should in fact not discuss this as a labour-employer issue. Rather the basic question is whether our small but rapidly expanding economy can afford to maintain a restrictive manpower supply policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important indicator, Sir, is the share of wages in nominal GDP that has risen from 42% in 1989 to 44% in 1990. You may say what is the significance of this. This development brings us uncomfortably close to the 48% share of the wage of GDP which burdened the economy in 1985, just before we plunged into recession. The question is whether we should read the current developments as a danger signal. There are other signs as well, Sir, that show that we have to be prudent in our labour market policies. The relative unit labour cost index which measures our competitiveness has also declined against other newly industrialised economies. These are all factors which we should take into account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, we need to urge the Government not to bring on additional costs to wages this year and plead with unions for a moderate wage adjustment. But most important of all, we must look towards more flexible immigration policies so that we could ease the tightening labour market. A more liberal interpretation of the educational requirements for foreign workers and flexible approval for recruitment from non-traditional sources will go a long way to relieve the problem even if the quota ceilings for foreign labour are to remain. In the longer term, I urge the Government to reconsider and implement more liberal manpower policies which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are necessary to maintain a non-inflationary long-term growth necessary for bringing us into the next lap.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to a second issue. To encourage Singapore companies to invest overseas and repatriate their profits, the Minister for Finance has proposed to exempt from tax, dividends paid out of foreign income for which there is insufficient franking credit due. This proposal, Sir, will partially remove a disincentive but it is incomplete because it applies primarily to tax treaty countries. This proposal, for example, will not include income from United States, or from, say, Burma, which are non-treaty countries in so far as Singapore is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some of our tax treaties do not allow all foreign tax payments to rank for foreign tax credit relief. In treaties where, for example, the underlying corporate tax is excluded from tax relief, part of the income from such treaty partners will still be subject to double taxation if it is to be distributed as dividend. We need, therefore, Sir, a more comprehensive solution to this problem. I request that the Minister consider a form of unilateral tax credit relief to be accorded on foreign income from all origins provided there is foreign tax paid equal to or greater than Singapore's tax structure. The foreign income net or foreign tax should be allowed as tax-exempt dividend.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are countries which offer tax rates lower than Singapore's corporate rate, particularly for specific and desirable activities. If income is brought back from such countries, Singapore would now raise the effective tax on this income up to 31%, or it will impose double taxation if there is no tax treaty. We need to re-examine this treatment if we want more overseas investments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas investments involve a high level of business risk because it takes place in a culturally different environment, with political conditions that are far less familiar to Singapore investors. Except for tax haven situations,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore companies should be allowed to take advantage of lower tax structures elsewhere to tap and invest in their markets. Since such projects or investments do not make use of Singapore's domestic markets or our infrastructure, there is good reason for Singapore not to tax such foreign income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could, however, be argued that these principles are already embodied in section 13(7) of the Income Tax Act as well as in the Overseas Headquarters (OHQ) incentive relief which grants preferential tax or tax-free treatment for foreign income on a case-by-case basis. However, Sir, case-by-case approvals involve very lengthy deliberations which can go on for months and require a large amount of paperwork. This puts the smaller and medium-sized Singapore companies at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the absence of clear published criteria for section 13(7) approvals also dissuades Singapore companies from applying for such arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony of all this is that in any case, the Singapore company can in fact proceed to invest outside of Singapore and not be taxed by Singapore at all, provided the money is not brought back to Singapore. Thus, what this means is that given our present tax regime, whenever we call on Singapore companies to invest overseas for all practical purposes, we are telling them to keep their money outside and not bring it back home. I am sure this is a situation that we need to address.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel strongly, Sir, that we can broaden the provisions of section 13(7) and the OHQ reliefs by moving it away from a case-by-case treatment to something that is more generally available. If Singapore companies can be certain of a favourable tax environment at home, they will be more willing to venture abroad and, more importantly, bring their wealth back when they have earned it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can leave it to the ingenuity of company tax consultants and tax administrators to work out provisions which are acceptable, and which have safeguards for tax leakages. If we wish to help local businesses
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> internationalise, we must take this large step forward to change our tax regime instead of making incremental small adjustments.

  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Eunos GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the tragedy of the Gulf War that had preoccupied the world over the past two months and other uncertainties, it is a welcome relief for us to be presented with a healthy report card by the Minister for Finance on the state of our economy. It reflects once again the flexibility and adaptability of our Government's financial policy, aimed at maximising opportunities for economic growth. This will enable us to safeguard the standard of living thus far enjoyed by Singaporeans.

   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Boon Heng) in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Statement, what is most gladdening to the general public is the 5% rebate on personal income tax. This is consistent with our exhortation over the past several years to every Singaporean worker to work harder and smarter and to increase productivity. In this regard, I would like to know whether our workers can look forward to yearly rebates as an incentive in recognition of their efforts subject, of course, to the constraints of our economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I would like to move on to the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST). Whilst we await the details of the draft legislation to be announced, reaction from the public is still one of anxiety about its implications. Granted that this issue is not new and has been thoroughly debated way back in 1986, the concern is that this tax will hurt further the pockets of the ordinary citizens, in the light of a number of recent increases, such as the upward revision in public transportation rates. One may ask whether there is still a need to introduce
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the consumption tax as a revenue item when the Government has been enjoying a surplus budget since FY 1987 and this trend is expected to continue for FY 1991 and perhaps for many more years to come. Sir, I must admit that I am aware of its rationale, but would like to appeal to the Minister to remind his officers to be careful in selecting the range of goods and services to be taxed. I make this appeal bearing in mind that what are deemed as necessities vary from year to year in a society of rising expectations like ours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, may I know whether the Ministry of Finance is prepared to withhold the implementation of this tax for so long as the Government enjoys a surplus budget or whether there is a time frame already set for its introduction?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I applaud the move to grant tax deduction for parents contributing to an Edusave account for their fourth child with effect from FY 1993. However, I feel further consideration should be given to extend the tax deduction beyond the fourth child since the contributors to the Edusave account will be the parents themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to touch on the water conservation tax for households consuming more than 20 cubic metres of water monthly. What matters to me here, is the impact this will have on the lower income section of our population. Although the House has been informed that about 60% of households are not affected, perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on the profile of the 40% of households whose consumption exceeds 20 cubic metres monthly. Since this tax will come into effect from 1st April 1991, I would like to know what steps the PUB will be taking to counsel or educate the excessive water users. To me, the emphasis must be on an extensive public education programme, to be mounted when the tax is implemented as otherwise what will arise will be the perception that this is another attempt by the Government to deliberately impose a tax on an item of daily necessity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, once again, I support the motion.

  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Yio Chu Kang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the Economic Survey of Singapore 1990 which was released just before the end of the Gulf War, the US economy went into recession in the fourth quarter of 1990. Moreover, it predicted gloomy prospects for the first half of this year and uncertainty thereafter. The reasons for the rather pessimistic forecast for the US economy are not hard to find.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few years, continuing budget and trade deficits, inflation, declining productivity and a beleaguered banking sector have caused widespread concern. Is the US economy facing a reckoning for over-indulgence in the 1980s, ie, high consumption and low savings? Is the US living on borrowed time? Some economists such as Lester Thurow and George Lodge think so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recession" has been defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GNP which occurred in the last quarter of 1990. However, some economists believe that the US economy is far too complex and too fast-changing to be precisely monitored. The economy cannot be described simply as going up or down. It is usually going both ways. The US Department of Commerce index of leading indicators, although elaborated and refined over the years and in spite of the use of the most advanced computers and statistical techniques, is 50 years old, much older than many of our Members here. It is also based on lagged data, the measurement of which is subject to great variability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the econometric models based on fiscal and monetary policies, money supply, interest rates, capital investment, have not been able to predict the sustained growth of the US economy since 1984. A possible reason is that the transfer of capital among market economies for strategic reasons has not been catered for. Foreign companies continue to invest in US short-term notes and plant and equipment during both upturns and downturns. Investments are no longer just driven by economic cycles, but by strategic decisions such as increasing market share and increasing manufacturing flexibility globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is that individual US manufacturing sectors have less of animpact on the overall economy than historically. The US supply industries are tied to both domestic and foreign operations. A downturn, for example, of the automotive industry would not lead to an immediate impact on the steel or machine tools industry. Perhaps the most important reason is that US industries have in the last decade become much more flexible using "just-in-time" and related techniques to manufacture smaller lot sizes and compress development cycles. Lower inventories are maintained, approximately 60% of monthly sales compared to 80% in the 1970s. The firms can therefore respond quickly to changes in demand and a more stable economy is thus achievable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new statistical product developed by two professors called "Experimental Recession Index", based on real-time information from the financial markets, has shown a declining probability for the 1991 recession. Now that the Gulf War has ended, the demonstrated superiority of American weapon systems has stimulated renewed interest in its defence industries. Moreover, US exports have done somewhat better in the last two years due to the weakening of the US dollar. The outlook for the US economy is therefore more optimistic than that described in the Economic Survey.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the details of the budget proposals for this year, I am glad to note that the Government will concentrate on manpower and infrastructural development. The Ministries of Education, National Development and Defence will account for half of the total expenditure in FY91. Quality education for all will be a highlight. The Ministry of Education's announcement of changes to the primary school system has confirmed what many Members of this House and others have repeatedly pointed out that streaming at primary 3 is premature. The slower learners have not been able to benefit fully from the existing education system. And more should be done to help them acquire skills and become useful citizens. Although it has taken the Ministry of Education 11 years to do this, it has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> finally acknowledged that the streaming system was flawed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many grassroots leaders have pointed out the apparent inequity in excluding the handicapped children from the Edusave scheme. Although the handicapped children may be given separate treatment, we should not make them feel alienated. They have perhaps an even greater need to be accepted by society in every possible way. Including them in Edusave will heighten their sense of belonging and hopefully reduce their sense of alienation. Moreover, the funds, however modest, will help them improve their skills and knowledge. The Minister for Community Development's statement that the question was being reviewed is indeed welcome news.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision to introduce Management Accounting systems in all Ministries is a step in the right direction. There is a need to streamline procedures and improve workflow in any organisation, particularly in a rapidly changing environment. Alvin Toffler predicts that the successful economies in the 21st century will be the fast economies, ie, those that change and adapt quickly. Past practices are not sacrosanct. To question their relevance to current conditions is absolutely necessary. I would like to ask the Minister to what extent will the private sector management consultants be involved in this exercise as they have had considerable experience in this area and can ensure earlier system implementation, standardisation and consistency among the various Ministries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the across-the-board rebate of 5% on personal income tax is good news. Since 1990 was a successful year, a symbolic gesture of giving a small rebate is well received. As for those who pay little or no income tax and get to drive BMWs and live in style, could the Minister inform the House what progress has been made in getting them to account for their wealth? We wonder how many economically active people are in fact not paying any income tax at all?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, most Singaporeans accept the fact that water is a precious resource. The additional tax
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is a measure to curb wastage. But for it to be more effective, it ought to be on a sliding scale, ie, the greater the usage, the higher the rate. In this regard, perhaps the PUB should publicise the "water-wasters", ie, households which persistently consume far greater amount of water than the average without good reasons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax deduction for general provisions for banks is welcome as it highlights the importance of prudence. It will encourage banks to set aside a greater amount to build up adequate provisions to withstand losses and diminution in the value of assets. In this connection, some finance companies would like to know the reasons for not extending the deduction to them. Prudence in financial management is a desirable goal for all financial institutions. Is it because the finance companies operate only locally and do not have an international presence? Or is it because finance companies are allowed to grant loan facilities without collateral up to a maximum of $5,000 only? Whatever the reason, the attempt to build up reserves is commendable and ought to be encouraged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the question of exemption of foreign income, would the foreign income qualifying for exempt dividends be segregated from the company's other income, eg, trading income? If there is no segregation and if the other trading activities generate a trading loss, normal income tax rules dictate that the loss be offset against the foreign income before foreign tax credits. Would the Minister clarify whether the foreign income qualifying for exempt dividends could be treated separately from trading income or loss?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the 10% concessionary tax rate to be applied to income of approved trust companies for providing specified trust services to non-residents in respect of their non-Singapore dollar investment. Would this be extended to Singapore resident trust companies or is it meant for foreign trust companies which may wish to set up operations in Singapore?

  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before us is really whether we agree with the economic growth forecasted for 1991 of 3-6%. And is it to be a target that we should be working at or is it to be the expected outcome for this year? I think it is important for us to consider this issue, because if we are comfortable with this target, then the rest of the factors will follow. It is important for us not to allow further overheating in our economy. Since 1986, our economy has grown substantially and if we were unwittingly to allow further pressure to be placed on the economy with serious labour shortage, then by itself the wage cost will go up. But the problem facing the employers is really the combination of the employers' CPF rate and the foreign workers levy. If we just take the employers' CPF rate alone, there should be very little quarrel with the 1% increase. In 1986, I believe there was no foreign workers levy, but today with a very high foreign workers levy and the provision of allowing up to 40% of the workforce to be made up of foreign workers, this has compounded the problem in that the employers have incurred very substantial costs in the employment of workers. This is the problem faced by the employers - the combination of the employers' CPF contribution and the foreign workers levy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee's point that it is important for us now to review whether we want to work towards the 40% target, 20% each for the employers and the employees. Because in terms of the real earnings of the average employee over the years, it has gone up substantially and it means that on that same rate of CPF contribution, the cost to the employers has gone up substantially.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that we should allow for a moderate economic growth for this year so that there will be minimal effect on the loss of jobs if there are some unfortunate enterprises that face difficulties with regard to down-sizing or redundancy. I think it is important because if we allow the economy to grow and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> suddenly there is a downturn, then there will be the danger of loss of jobs by many people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem faced by employers with regard to the increasing cost of business is the increased cost in the fringe benefits provided by the employers. Medical and health costs have gone up. It is part of the fringe benefits provided by the employers. It is not evident because you do not account for it easily, and transportation cost, ie, reimbursement for transport incurred by the employees, all these add up to the increasing cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to encourage the extension of employment for workers beyond 55. If the costs were to build up, the concern of employers is whether they are able to retain the services of these employees beyond 55. But the point here, Sir, is that if we agree with a moderate economic growth of 3% to 6%, the Finance Minister has his policies right.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, economically Singapore is very vulnerable. This is because we are small and we are dependent on other economies. Singapore needs to respond to the vast changes taking place in today's world. The situation in the Middle-East is uncertain; the United States is working towards trading arrangements with South America; United Europe in 1992; China is yet to firm up its national and international policies; Hong Kong faces 1997. Closer home, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are opening up. All these swift and uncertain changes can also present business opportunities. Singapore, being small and disciplined, has the advantage of reacting and responding swiftly. But forward planning is the key to our survival.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the Minister for Finance has announced a two-pronged strategy. Our network of linkages to other economies is well spread and profitable. Many of our local businessmen have benefitted over the past 10 years. From the multi-nationals, we have gained in technology, acquired the art of modern management
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and organisation, international marketing skills, and the knowledge in creating new products. We have matured and some have graduated to become investors overseas, particularly in the ASEAN region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long term economic stability will be more secure if we can achieve a good balance between foreign investments in Singapore and our investments in other economies. The next five years will see many business opportunities for investment. To invest overseas, companies must be of a certain size, have adequate management and financial resources. Very few local companies fall into this category; most are small. For these smaller ones, we must take a longer term perspective. EDB must continue its good work in getting multi-nationals to assist local companies upgrade their production facilities and management. Many local companies are now more productive. I am of the opinion that encouraging them to join forces for economy of scale should be the main goal. By companies coming together, wastage in manpower is minimised, some jobs can be done more productively, and with stronger financial resources, more qualified and experienced managers can be recruited. As a result, bigger contracts can be targeted, growth will be achievable, expansion overseas can be a reality. But our best bet is to concentrate on the few bigger local companies. A study should be made of their strength, identify overseas business opportunities and then to match them, provide the necessary incentives and assist them to organise a structure suitable for regional and international management and control; finally, to lead a mission to the respective countries concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can we achieve this? I think a master plan should be drawn up. Who should undertake this task? I suggest the Enterprise Development Division of the EDB which is already doing some of it. The Government should give this Division the necessary budget and manpower. In this way, our investments overseas can be more prudent, calculated
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and systematic. In this way, we will be ready when the overseas business opportunities come our way. When our investments overseas materialise in substantial numbers, we would have attained a good balance to foreign investments here. Singapore will then be more stable economically.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to turn to another issue. We strive hard to maintain and improve our economy. It is not uncommon for Singaporeans to work more than eight hours a day, seven days a week. The danger is that money-making can become our only pre-occupation if we do not balance up with cultural and recreational enjoyment. Such activities for relaxation are few. I suspect that the Singaporean's alternative to hanging around or watching the television is work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has started to address this problem. To make our society more vibrant, I suggest that we create a culture among companies to be part of it. These companies should also include shopkeepers, market stallholders, hawkers in the hawker centres; in short, a social obligation culture.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, most companies have benefitted from an honest and efficient Government and, not less importantly, a disciplined society. As an appreciation to the society, companies should be encouraged to contribute to arts and performances, sponsoring of sporting events and giving to the less fortunate. We should encourage the spirit of participation and the amount of contribution should be free-will. Some companies are already doing this. But with a social obligation culture, more can be encouraged to join in. I think the employees of participating companies will be more motivated when they identify themselves with certain charities, sports or performances. This is a human touch to money-making.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore need not be a cultural and recreational desert. We can become a more balanced Singaporean materially and culturally.
