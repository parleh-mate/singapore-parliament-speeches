<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Minister for Finance if the  Ministry  can

consider  (i)  extending  the deadline  for  the  128,000

persons  who  missed  out  on the Economic  Restructuring

Shares  (ERS); (ii) providing some measures to reach  out

to  this  group of people; and (iii) assisting them  with

their  top  ups if they are in financial difficulties  or

have some other compelling reasons for being unable to do

so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  for  Finance  whether  his  Ministry  will

consider  waiving  the $50 contribution  to  the  Central

Restructuring  Shares  (ERS)  in  instances   where   the

recipient is facing financial difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Finance, in view of the  large  number  of

128,000   persons   who  missed  out  on   the   Economic

Restructuring Shares (ERS), will the Government  consider

extending the deadline for this group and waiving the $50

top-up in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) for those with

financial difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Loh Meng See</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister for Finance (a) what are the reasons for  a

sizeable number of more than 100,000 citizens not topping

up   their   CPF   to  benefit  from  the  new   Economic

Restructuring  Shares; (b) what is the profile  of  these

citizens  and why are they having difficulty to  top  up;

and  (c) will the Government be able to give them another

chance to benefit from the scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Finance if he will (i)  give  a

breakdown of the profile of the 128,000 Singaporeans  who

missed  out  on the Economic Restructuring Shares  (ERS);

(ii)  inform  the  House whether additional  efforts  are

being   made to reach out to these people and  help  them

with  the top-up, if needed; and (iii) state whether  the

unallocated  money  from the ERS will  be  channelled  to

provide more aid to the poor and needy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission, I will answer Questions 1-5 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The ERS is part of the offset

package  to  help Singaporeans adjust to the increase  in

the  GST  rate.  It covers the net increase  in  tax  for

nearly every Singaporean for at least 5 years.  There  is

no  question  of the offset not being adequate  for  this

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the latest data from CPF Board, about

100,336  Singaporeans, or about 5% of the total  of  2.18

million  eligible  Singaporeans, did not  contribute  $50

into  their CPF accounts by 31st December 2002.  This  is

lower  than the earlier reported figure of 128,000, which

was  not  the  final count, as last minute  contributions

were still being processed by CPF Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed breakdown is in the table (Cols. 2273 - 2274) that I have circulated to Members, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>

you  should find it on your seats.  The highest rates  of

non-participation  came  from those  staying  in  welfare

homes and 1-room HDB flats.  The rate for those in 2-room

HDB flats was also rather high.  There were 9,791 of such

cases in all (in other words, welfare homes, 1-rooms  and

2-rooms).  They account for about 13% of the total number

of  eligible Singaporeans in these categories,  but  only

0.5%  of the total number of eligible Singaporeans.  This

is the relatively small group that we should focus on.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030121/20030121-HA-0752273.htm">Annex - Singaporeans who did not qualify for ERS (Cols. 2273 - 2274)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in considerable effort to

remind Singaporeans to top up their CPF accounts by  31st

December  2002 to qualify for the ERS.  In  August  2002,

CPF Board sent letters to all Singaporeans to inform them

of  the  ERS Scheme and to remind those who had  not  yet

topped up to do so as soon as possible.  In November  and

December  2002, MOF and CPF Board issued press  releases,

and ran radio trailers and newspaper advertisements.   We

mobilised  the  grassroots  organisations  (GROs).    The

grassroots organisations not only put up reminder posters

at HDB void decks, but made house visits to those staying

in 1- to 3-room HDB flats.  If the occupants were not in,

they  made repeat visits; sometimes three or four  times.

If the residents could not afford the $50, the grassroots

organisations  helped them financially on a  case-by-case

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be many reasons why people did not top

up  their CPF accounts in time.  Some may have forgotten,

others may have been overseas.  There may even have  been

some  who  were  not  interested  in  the  shares.    The

grassroots  leaders  who  made  the  house  visits   have

reported that a significant proportion of those  who  had

not  topped-up their CPF accounts could not be  found  at

the  addresses given.  Conceivably, they had not  updated

their   addresses  on  their  NRICs  with  the   National

Registration  Office and hence, would not  have  received

information about the ERS scheme posted to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the lower income households, especially the

older  folks, many of those who did not top  up  probably

did not have active CPF accounts.  They may have found it

difficult to top up their accounts, even though help from

the GROs was available.  Some may not have understood how

the scheme would help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Lily Neo have asked to waive

the  $50  CPF top-up requirement for those with financial

difficulties.   Let  me explain the purpose  of  the  $50

contribution.    Besides  encouraging   Singaporeans   to

maintain  an  active CPF account that helps  provide  for

their retirement, the top-up is a way for Singaporeans to

show  that they are doing something to receive their ERS.

It  is really to put up your hand and say, "I'm here.   I

would  like  to participate in the scheme".   It  is  not

desirable for the Government simply to give the shares to

all  Singaporeans, without even knowing where  he  is  or

whether he wants the shares.  For example, the person may

have  emigrated,  and may not have maintained  his  links

with Singapore.  Why should we give it to him?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Mr Loh Meng See and Dr Amy Khor have

asked  if  the Government will give those who missed  out

another chance to benefit from the scheme. For those  who

are  not  poor, and these form the majority of those  who

did  not top up, I think we should respect their decision

not  to  participate in the scheme.  The Government  made

them  an  offer, they decided not to take it up,  and  we

should leave the matter there.  We have to be fair to the

95% of Singaporeans who took the trouble to top up by the

deadline,  some of them queuing up to do so on  the  last

day.   If  each  time the Government sets a deadline,  it

gets  extended because people did not make the effort  to

meet  it, soon the Government's terms and statements will

not be taken seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the lower income groups, ie, the 9,791

cases  of  1-roomers,  2-roomers and  people  in  welfare

homes,  I  agree  fully with the MPs that  we  should  be

flexible and make a further effort to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>

reach  them.  They are the ones most likely to  have  had

genuine financial difficulties and to have been unable to

make alternative arrangements.  They are the most in need

of the ERS shares.  The Government will therefore make  a

special arrangement to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will give all the Advisors to the grassroots

organisations the list of residents staying in 1- and  2-room HDB flats, and welfare homes, who have not topped up

their  CPF.   The grassroots organisations  will  get  in

touch  with  them  and  make  arrangements  for  them  to

participate  in the ERS scheme, extending financial  help

where  necessary.  As the numbers are not  too  many,  it

should  be feasible for us to take this more personalised

approach.   The special facility will be provided  up  to

31st  March  2003,  to give the grassroots  organisations

sufficient  time to identify and reach out  to  those  in

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked whether the unallocated money

from  the ERS will be channelled to provide more  aid  to

the  poor and needy.  The special arrangement I have just

mentioned  will  help  some more needy  Singaporeans  get

their ERS.  The rest of the ERS money will remain in  the

ERS   Fund,   and   become  available  for   future   ERS

distributions.  The ERS Fund is set up as a private trust

fund   specifically  to  distribute  ERS   shares.    The

Government  has many other schemes to help the  poor  and

needy who require assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For future lots of ERS, we are considering possible

ways  to  be  more  flexible with  the  CPF  contribution

requirement,   especially  for  the   lower-income,   the

elderly,  and Singaporeans staying in welfare homes.   My

Ministry  is studying the options.  We have time  as  the

next contribution is not due until 31st December 2003.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Deputy

Prime Minister whether he would consider the extension of

the  ERS  CPF top-ups to 3-room HDB dwellers as well,  as

there are residents in the 3-room HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>

flats who also require assistance from the grassroots and

the MPs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also ask whether it is a fair proposal for

the   Community  Development  Council  to  come  up  with

matching funds in the respective constituencies  to  help

those  residents who have financial difficulties in their

CPF top-ups?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on the

3-roomers.   I think we have to draw the line  somewhere.

If  I had drawn the line at the 3-roomers, I think Dr Neo

would   have   asked   me   for  the   4-roomers.    But,

nevertheless,  there will be cases where  3-roomers  will

have financial problems.  And if MPs come across any such

cases  and  write  in to the CPF Board,  the  Board  will

consider them sympathetically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for using the CDC's money to match, perhaps we

should  remember that the CDC's money actually came  from

the  Government in the first place.  But I  am  sure  the

Member  will have sources of funds and that the  CDC  has

arranged  for donations and wants to use those  donations

for this purpose, that would be very helpful.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

two  supplementary questions, please.  As  regards  those

who  have  been  helped with the $50  through  the  CCC's

visits, could we know the number of people who have  been

helped, because they could not even afford the $50?   The

other question that I have is on the almost 10,000 people

-  the  1-roomers,  2-roomers and  residents  of  welfare

homes.    The   Deputy   Prime   Minister   spoke   about

arrangements.  What exactly are these arrangements?   And

if  they do not have $50, is it possible to help them  in

other ways?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have

the  exact  number  of how many were  given  $50  by  the

grassroots organisations, because these were arrangements

made by the individual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>

Advisors.   But I am assured that the Advisors have  gone

through  it  and  wherever people needed  assistance  and

could not afford the $50, it has been forthcoming.  I  do

not think the number is very large.  I believe they would

number in a few hundreds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what exactly the arrangements will be for the

10,000  which we are talking about now, I leave  that  to

the   Advisors.    I  have  discussed   it   with   them,

particularly  the Advisors from the constituencies  which

have  larger concentrations of the poor and older  folks,

like  Dr Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer and a few others who have

smaller  flats and older residents.  And they assured  me

that  the  financing is not a problem.  The question  is:

does  the  person want to participate and is it really  a

problem that he is unable to find the $50?  If it is,  we

can  make the arrangements for him.  Because if you  just

look  at  it,  10,000 people times $50, it  is  $500,000;

divided  by 80 Advisors, it is about $6,000 per  Advisor.

It  is  not  an  enormous amount of  money.   It  can  be

arranged.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, in the review

that  the  Ministry of Finance is conducting  for  future

ERS,  I  would  like  to  ask the Deputy  Prime  Minister

whether  he would consider lowering the quantum from  $50

to something less, eg, $10, for this particular exercise.

The  groups that have the highest disqualification  rates

are  actually the lower income.  After all, everybody who

qualifies could actually draw out their $50 the day after

receiving their ERS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

consider all possibilities.  I think for the older folks,

we  can  be much more flexible.  Because as Mr Heng  Chee

How  has pointed out, once you pay the money in, you  are

entitled  to  draw  it out the next  day.   But  for  the

younger people, they are not entitled to draw it out  the

next  day.  When they reach the age of 55, then they  can

take  it  out together with the rest of their CPF  money.

So  I think there is a point.  And to put in $50 in order

to  collect $400 or more from the Government  is  not  an

unreasonable request.

<div align="center"><b>PROFITEERING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and   Minister  for  Finance  whether  there  have   been

significant  incidents of profiteering arising  from  the

revision of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to  4%  from

1st  January 2003 and if so, what actions have been taken

so far in dealing with these incidents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, there appears to have been no

significant  incidents of profiteering so  far.   Anyway,

conditions for profiteering are not present.  There is no

shortage  of goods in the market.  Retailers  are  trying

their   best  to  retain  customers  through  competitive

pricing.   Consumers have many choices and can turn  from

one  retailer  to  another.  We have investigated  a  few

items which have increased in price and we found that the

increases cannot be attributed solely to the increase  in

GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee Against Profiteering, which I am

chairing,  was  set  up  to deal  with  profiteering  and

unjustified price increases.  From 1st December  2002  to

20th  January 2003, the Committee received a total of  47

reports.  The majority related to price increases of food

items as well as cooked food items.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these, 29 were found not to be due to

profiteering  on account of GST increases.  Replies  have

been   given  to  these  respondents.   Nine  have   been

forwarded   to  the  respective  Constituency   Committee

Against  Profiteering for further investigation, and  the

investigation  is  still  in progress.   Four  have  been

forwarded  to  the  Consumers  Association  of  Singapore

(CASE) for review.  The Committee Against Profiteering is

currently  looking  into  the remaining  five  unresolved

reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If consumers come across any instances of businesses

trying  to  profiteer from the GST increase, they  should

provide feedback to the Committee by filling in the forms

which  are  available in all community centres, community

clubs as well as our website.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STUDENTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  how  many students  have  approached  his

Ministry for financial assistance for the year 2003;  (b)

how  many  have  been  granted such assistance;  and  (c)

whether  there  has been a significant  increase  in  the

number  of  students seeking the assistance  compared  to

previous years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 18th January 2003, schools have

processed  and  approved  6,555  applications   for   the

Ministry  of Education Financial Assistance Scheme  (FAS)

which  grants  waiver  of school fees  and  part  of  the

miscellaneous  fees,  and  provides  free  textbooks   to

students.   In  year  2002,  a total  of  7,387  students

received  help from the MOE Financial Assistance  Scheme.

2002 saw a significant increase in approved MOE financial

assistance cases compared to 5,332 cases approved in year

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income criteria for the MOE Financial Assistance

Scheme are pegged to MCDS' Public Assistance scheme.   In

line  with the revision in MCDS' Public Assistance  rates

with  effect  from  January this year,  the  Ministry  of

Education  has  also  reviewed  and  raised  the   income

criterion for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme.   From

2nd  January  this  year,  a  citizen  student  would  be

eligible for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme  if  the

family's gross income per month does not exceed $900  for

families  with  one  or  two  children,  and  $1,050  for

families  with  three  or  more  children.   Before   the

revision,  the income ceiling was $775 for families  with

one  or two children and $900 for families with three  or

more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students can approach the schools for financial

assistance  at  any  time  during  the  year.   For   all

financial assistance applications received, schools  will

first  assess  the  student's  eligibility  for  the  MOE

Financial  Assistance Scheme.  If the  students  are  not

eligible or need additional financial assistance, schools

will help to source for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>

support  from other sources, eg, the financial assistance

schemes  administered  by the School  Advisory/Management

Committees (SAC/SMC) and community organisations like the

Community  Development  Councils  and  voluntary  welfare

organisations.   No  child  is  denied  an  education  on

account of financial difficulties.

<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use for dormiciliary medical and nursing care)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for

Health  in  the light of increased emphasis on  step-down

services, will his Ministry allow the use of Medisave  to

pay for dormiciliary medical and nursing care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, first, I wish to reiterate that Medisave is

primarily   intended   for  inpatient   hospitalisations.

However,  over  the  years, the Ministry  of  Health  has

allowed the use of Medisave for day surgeries and certain

expensive  treatments,  which were  originally  inpatient

treatment  but  are now carried out more  effectively  as

outpatient   treatments,  such  as  renal  dialysis   and

chemotherapy for cancer patients.  However, the  Ministry

does  not  intend  to  allow  Medisave  to  be  used  for

dormiciliary   medical   and  nursing   care,   so   that

individuals  can  preserve their Medisave  for  the  more

expensive medical treatments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st October 2002, the Ministry of Health has

extended   Government  subsidies  to   eligible   elderly

Singaporeans  who require home medical and  home  nursing

services so that they can afford such services.   Out-of-pocket  expenditure is kept low, at between  $30-$60  per

home  medical  visit and $13-$28 per home nursing  visit,

after  the 50% to 75% subsidy from the Government.  Those

who  are  severely disabled and covered under ElderShield

or  IDAPE Scheme can also receive cash payments  of  $300

per month from ElderShield, or up to $150 per month

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>

from IDAPE Scheme. These would further help them pay  for

their home medical and home nursing services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> There are two

principles  of home medical and home nursing care.   One,

it  actually gives convenience to the patient as well  as

providing holistic approach to patient care.  The  second

point  is that with home medical and home nursing, it  is

one  of the ways to decrease health expenditure.  And the

fact   that   Singapore  is  moving  towards  an   ageing

population ----

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Dr Chong?

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Home medical is one of the

roots  which  can  avoid  hospitalisation  for  patients.

Thus,  with this change of trend of hospitalisation,  can

we not use Medisave for home medical and home nursing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained earlier,

medical  treatments are very expensive.   We  are  asking

Singaporeans  to save 6% of their income in Medisave  and

therefore  we have to make use of our Medisave correctly.

The  policy of Medisave is to target this saving  at  the

more  expensive medical treatments, which is largely  the

inpatient care.  Over the years, we have extended  it  to

some outpatient care which is very expensive too.  But so

far, we have not allowed Medisave to be used for GP care,

for  step-down care, home medical and home nursing  care.

And I think these are very sensible reasons.  Because  if

we  allow  Medisave  to be used for  GP  care,  for  home

nursing  and  home medical, very soon you will  not  have

very much Medisave left for your hospitalisation care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we made an exception. We recognised that

home  medical and home nursing care for the very severely

disabled will cost a lot of money, and that is the reason

why we introduced ElderShield and allowed Singaporeans to

use  up to 1% of their Medisave if they insure themselves

under  ElderShield.   And if they are severely  disabled,

the group insurance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>

that  they  participate in will help pay for  their  home

medical  and home nursing.  So we are already  making  an

extension of using the Medisave for the severely disabled

who  need  home  medical, home nursing  or  institutional

nursing care.  But if we extend Medisave to all kinds  of

home  medical  and  home nursing, then your  6%  Medisave

contribution  will  not be enough.   If  the  Member  can

convince  other  Members  of  this  House  to  raise  the

Medisave  contribution from 6% to 8%, then I am  prepared

to consider extending it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister what has his

Ministry done to improve dormiciliary step-down services,

especially  in  patient  care  and  in  the  training  of

personnel?   And does he agree that this is an  important

area to develop in view of the demographic profile?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree entirely with the Member.

I  think  home  medical  and home  nursing  are  critical

components  of  our step-down care infrastructure.   Over

the  last  two years, for example, we have put  in  place

what  we designate as approved providers - nursing homes,

community  hospitals - who can extend  home  medical  and

home  nursing services.  We are trying to build  up  such

services, not just by specialised home medical  and  home

nursing  services like the Home Nursing  Foundation,  but

also  extend  the  provision by other  groups  -  nursing

homes,  community hospitals - so that these  become  more

readily  available.   Recently,  I  announced  that   the

Ministry is extending training grants for step-down care,

not  just  professionals in the community  hospitals  and

nursing homes, but also people extending home medical and

home  nursing services.  So, we recognise that this is  a

very  important  area.  It is a very  manpower  intensive

area, despite Singapore being a small island.  If we have

a nurse visiting homes, there is a very limited number of

visits she can make every day.  So it is a very expensive

service.   But  we  recognise that this is  an  important

service  because  it  helps to keep the  elderly  in  the

community, in the home, and we intend to build this up.

<div align="center"><b>EXPULSION OF STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statistics and guidelines)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) how many students, by levels, were expelled

from schools for each year from 2000 to 2002; (b) whether

these  numbers  had been increasing over the  years;  (c)

what  are the current guidelines provided by the Ministry

to school principals regarding the expulsion of students;

(d) what help and counselling these students are given or

can  turn to before and after expulsion; and (e)  whether

the  Ministry can provide clear guidelines and assistance

for  their re-admission to schools, instead of asking the

students  and  their  parents to apply  directly  to  the

schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of students

expelled  at the primary level was 0 in year 2000,  three

in  year  2001 and four in year 2002.  For the  secondary

level,  the statistics were 118 in 2000, 164 in 2001  and

94  in 2002.  At the pre-university level, it was six  in

2000 and none in 2001 and 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students expelled at the primary level

has  remained  small  over the last three  years,  and  I

should clarify that out of the four who were expelled  in

year 2002, two of them were really drop-out cases who had

Malaysian  parents and went back to Malaysia.  They  have

been technically classified as expulsion cases because of

absenteeism but they are really drop-out cases.  For  the

secondary  and pre-university levels, there  has  been  a

falling  trend.  This can be attributed to  the  measures

put  in place by schools, junior colleges and centralised

institutes  to instill good discipline in their  students

and to sustain their interest in schooling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student is expelled if he commits a very serious

offence  such as assault, and if allowing him  to  remain

would  threaten the safety of other students or undermine

school   discipline.   There  are  also  some  cases   of

expulsion   on   account   of   persistent   absenteeism.

Expulsion is only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>

done  as a last resort when measures such as counselling,

suspension  and other disciplinary measures have  had  no

effect  on improving the student's conduct or discipline.

The  Ministry  does  not  have a  set  of  guidelines  on

expulsion which principals have to follow.  The principal

has  the  full  authority to decide on the  expulsion  of

recalcitrant  students.  The principal  is  in  the  best

position to decide when a student should be removed  from

the  school  for serious misdemeanours so as to  maintain

discipline  and good order for the safety and welfare  of

all students in the school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools take a proactive approach to ensure that

students  remain interested in schooling.  The  proactive

measures that schools adopt include pastoral care,  life-skills and career guidance programmes which are aimed  at

helping  students build self esteem, take  responsibility

for their own actions and develop purposefulness in life.

Each school has in place a formal structure involving the

Principal,   Vice-Principal  and   teacher   counsellors,

together  with  external agencies, such as the  self-help

groups  and family service centres to counsel and  assist

students with behavioural problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intervention measures that schools adopt include

counselling  the  students with the  involvement  of  the

parents.   Schools  also  work  quite  closely  with  the

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor also asked about readmission to schools.

Students  who  have been expelled can  be  readmitted  to

another  school.  Having students apply directly  to  the

new  school  for  readmission is part of the  process  of

helping them turn over a new leaf.  In personally seeking

readmission to the new school, the student will have  the

chance to explain why he is deserving of a second chance.

The  student will have to give an undertaking to his  new

principal that he would take personal responsibility  for

his  conduct and attitude.  This has been found to be  an

effective approach in helping the student value his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>

education  and  eventually  improve  in  the  new  school

environment.  MOE has also assisted, where necessary,  in

the  readmission of students who have in fact  approached

various  schools.  Where necessary, MOE  will  assist  in

their  readmission.  Upon readmission,  the  school  will

provide  guidance and counselling to the student to  help

him  maintain  good behaviour.  Ultimately, however,  the

student must have a desire to learn and benefit from  the

educational opportunities offered to him.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to inform the Senior Minister of State  for

Education  that I have come across students  and  parents

who  are very frustrated because they cannot get into any

school  after expulsion.  I would like to ask the  Senior

Minister  of  State  whether the present  ranking  system

actually  discourages  principals  from  admitting   such

students,  because it will pull down the overall  ranking

of the school.  Could the Ministry actually consider such

cases  if  the  principal admits  them  and  whether  the

results of such students could be waived from the overall

school ranking or make an exception, so that it will  not

be  so  frustrating for these students?  Otherwise,  they

will end up as juvenile delinquents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

not  drag  the ranking system into this.  The  number  of

students expelled is actually very small, to begin  with.

And  it  is not that students are expelled for performing

badly academically as such.  They are behaving badly, and

they are affecting the quality of the school environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student has to have the desire to learn and

conform  with what the school considers to be appropriate

conduct.  That is the main criterion.  Students who  fail

to  get readmission are usually those who are not able to

convince  the new school to take them in, that they  have

reformed, that they have turned over a new leaf, and that

they are going to put in that extra effort.  That is  the

reason  why  they are unable to get in.  There  are  some

cases where a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>

student is genuine, remorseful, wants to turn over a  new

leaf, and the parents are backing up the student.  And in

those cases where the student is really unable to find  a

school,  the Ministry of Education will step  in  to  see

what we can do to help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, of the 94

students who were expelled from school in 2002, were they

all   disciplinary  cases  and  how  serious  were  they?

Secondly,  how  many of these 94 expelled  students  were

readmitted to our school system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> The vast majority of

cases  that  are expelled are on account of very  serious

and  repeat  disciplinary offences.  An  expulsion  comes

only  after repeated counselling, not just of the student

but also the parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many will be readmitted? I do not think it is

possible  to put a number on it, because it is really  up

to  the  students and the parents rather than the school.

I  can  assure  the House that schools go  through  great

effort to prevent the situation from coming to the  point

at which expulsion is really necessary.  So, it is not  a

situation of schools being quick on the draw.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there have been cases of juveniles who have been

sent to welfare homes, and the probation officers and the

staff  of the welfare homes face difficulties in  getting

them readmitted.  So, we can say that there is this group

of   students   who   pose  sufficient   behavioural   or

disciplinary  problems  and they  cannot  be  readmitted.

What  is the future for this group of students, if we  do

not  find ways and means to get them readmitted to school

and to prepare them for employment in future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> For students who have

been rehabilitated and who have changed their conduct and

are  keen to learn, we will find them a place in schools.

I  do  not know of the specific cases the hon. Member  is

talking  about.  But where it is clear that  the  student

has reformed and the home in question is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>

vouching for the student, we should be able to find him a

place in a school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why schools do not take expelled students

back  has  nothing to do with a lack of capacity  in  the

system.  It has to do with the fact that the student  and

his  parents have not shown that genuine desire  to  take

school seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, whilst we talk about

compulsory education in an effort to get everybody to  be

educated and employable, is the Ministry of Education not

concerned about these 100-odd average students  who  were

expelled from schools and may not be given a chance to go

back to school, because the principal may think that they

have not turned over a new leaf?  But who is to decide at

the  end  of  the day?  They do not seem to  be  given  a

chance.  Does the Ministry check on what is happening  to

these  expelled students?  How genuine is it  that  these

students cannot turn over a new leaf at all?  Or  is  the

principals' concern that by admitting such students, they

are inviting problems to their schools?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> First, let me reiterate

that  the number is very small.  If we compute them as  a

percentage  of  all students, it will  be  a  very  small

percentage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, let me reiterate that schools do not expel

students lightly.  It is usually after several months  of

counselling of both student and parent before this action

is taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not institutionalise the system by having

the  Ministry  of  Education arrange for  readmission  of

students automatically into another school.  There has to

be  more than a modicum of effort required on the part of

the  student  and  his parents to gain readmission  to  a

school.  That effort is required.  It should not  be  too

easy  to  get  readmission to a school, because  then  we

change the whole process, which requires that the student

really  turns over a new leaf before getting readmission.

If it is a process of central allocation, the student can

bring a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  of Education letter to the principal  and  say,

"Please  readmit  me."  He does not have  to  change  his

conduct and his parents do not have to vouch for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, it is a system in which it is not smooth

sailing for those students who have been expelled to gain

readmission.  But that is probably for the better.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> May I ask

the  Senior Minister of State whether there is a duty  on

the  part  of  the  school to report to the  Ministry  of

Education  when  a  student has  been  expelled  and  the

reasons  for  doing  so?  And, if there  is  any  dispute

between the school and the students, is there any process

through which they can appeal directly to the Ministry of

Education  to look into the case and perhaps  mediate  on

the  case?   If  the  students have great  difficulty  in

seeking  readmission to another school, not because  they

do not want to change over a new leaf but because the new

school's  principal may think that it is not  appropriate

to  have  such troublemakers in the school, what  is  the

best  approach the Ministry would suggest to students  in

that predicament?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> There are two parts to

the  question: one, on the process of expulsion, and  the

other on the process of readmission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the process of expulsion, the Ministry respects

the  authority  of the principal.  The principal  reports

all such cases to the Ministry and they give the reasons.

If  we come across a case where it is clearly a matter of

poor judgment on the part of the school, we will want  to

do  something.  But we have not come across  such  cases,

and  we trust our principals to make good judgments.  The

basic  point is that schools go through great  effort  in

trying  to prevent such a situation from happening before

they really expel a student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On readmission, yes, the Ministry does step in to

assist where it finds that a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>

student is genuine in wanting to gain readmission and  is

unable  to  get  a place despite trying.  Those  are  the

cases  where  we  think it is worthwhile stepping  in  to

assist.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> May I ask the Minister

whether  it  would  be  possible  for  the  Ministry   of

Education  -  in any case, the Ministry of Education  has

done  it  for  certain cases - to accept the applications

for  readmission  and  to  evaluate  the  suitability  or

genuine  sincerity of the students to be  readmitted  and

then match them to schools?  Because there are many cases

where the principals, for various reasons, do not want to

admit  them and the students actually go from  school  to

school to apply for readmission before they finally  come

to see us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> In many ways, it touches

on   the  same  point.   The  basic  point  is  that  the

initiative has to come from the student and his  parents.

I do not think it is desirable to have a system where the

Ministry  of Education manages this centrally,  where  we

keep track, try to match students, try to ascertain their

tone  of  behaviour and see whether it  has  reached  the

point where we can say, yes, he has crossed the mark  and

he is now to be put back in school.  It should be left to

the  student  and his parents to be convinced  that  they

really want readmission to a school.  And where they  are

convinced and they seek readmission to a school  and  are

unable  to find a school that will take them in, then  we

will  step  in.  So, we should not go for a system  where

the  Ministry  of  Education centrally manages  this  and

tries  desperately hard to reduce the figures;  in  other

words, to try to get readmission of all students who  are

expelled.   I  do not think that would be  good  for  the

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Senior

counselling to pupils.  Does this counselling include the

help  of  a  psychiatrist?  The purpose  of  employing  a

psychiatrist is to find out the underlying problem  of  a

child, and whether he apparently has disciplinary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>

problems.   There may be some very good reasons  for  the

disciplinary  problems  of  a  child,  and  I   think   a

psychiatrist is the best person to find out what  is  the

problem  of  the  child.   Is the  Ministry  thinking  of

employing a psychiatrist to give counselling to students?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  several layers to the counselling process,  starting

with  the  teacher, going on to professional  counsellors

and, sometimes, involving external agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many cases there have been where

specialist psychiatrists were called in.  I would not  be

surprised  if the cases were few.  But it is  really  for

the   school  to  manage  and  draw  on  the  appropriate

counselling resources.  The professional counsellors that

are  engaged by the schools are well-trained.   They  are

trained in some element of psychiatry as well.  They  are

not professional psychiatrists, but where it is really  a

case  that  is  more  involved  and  requires  specialist

expertise,  schools will be able to  draw  on  the  right

resources.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> In the absence of a good

role  model where parents are concerned, how can  such  a

child get a form of readmission into a school?  Secondly,

would the Ministry of Education consider - although it is

a  very  small problem, it is cumulative year by  year  - whether  there  could  be an interface  kind  of  school,

perhaps  falling back on the old model of the  SAF  Boys'

School, or an equivalent for girls?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> In the case of students

who  do  not have parents, they will typically  be  in  a

welfare  home, where we will be able to seek  the  home's

views  and advice.  So the views of homes or of probation

officers  would  certainly be taken into account.   These

cases  are few, and we deal with them case by case  quite

sympathetically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your second question, Ms Braema?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> If it is 100 plus 100

yearly, we cannot just have them out there.  Is there any

form of agency or a system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> To begin with, the

number is not large.  Quite frankly, if you compare us to

any other school system, I would say the rate of drop-out

is  lower  in Singapore.  And we would like to  keep  the

discipline  in  the system, which is a system  that  says

that if you come to the point where you are expelled, you

had better put in a lot of effort before you get back in.

That is the basic discipline.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, would

the  Senior Minister of State consider the fact that  the

students have to move from one school to another to  gain

readmission  is  indicative  that  principals  are  using

different  kinds of criteria because they  are  the  same

cases,  unless  the  students tell different  stories  to

different  principals?   Does  the  Ministry   have   any

guidelines in this regard?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> There are no formal

guidelines.  But I think principals exercise  quite  good

judgment in most cases.  Sometimes, of course,  it  is  a

case  where  the level that the person is trying  to  get

back  into is up to full capacity in a particular school.

We  do not have a problem for the system as a whole.  But

for a particular school, it may be literally full up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it may be a matter of the student not

being  able to convince one principal but being  able  to

convince  another because the case is at the  borderline.

Matters  of  judgment are involved.  But I think  we  can

trust  our principals to make good judgments in all these

cases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I would just like to

follow up on this issue of helping schools which are keen

to  help but maybe they need extra help with some of  the

more  difficult  cases.  I think a  case  is  made  where

principals,  if  they are not given additional  resources

and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>

Ministry says, "Well, you deal with it.  If you want  it,

it is at your risk", then where is the incentive for them

to  take  back these youths?  I am just wondering whether

the  Ministry of Education could actually encourage,  and

there  is some way to give them some incentive or reward,

so that it would be an example for other schools, or best

practice.   I think we want schools to be inclusive,  not

exclusive.  And until we have compulsory education,  even

if  the  number  is small, we are talking about  precious

human  resources.  We know that if we go the extra  mile,

many of them would turn out to be very productive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Prof. Ngiam?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Sir, my question is:

are  we doing enough to help the schools so that they  do

not  just take the line of least resistance, and the poor

kid  has  to go from school to school in order to finally

find  a  place?   And  some do not even  get  readmission

finally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> First, I do not know of

any  cases where a student who is genuinely keen to  come

back  is  unable  to find a place in school.   Where,  in

fact, there is difficulty being encountered, the Ministry

of Education does step in to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, schools do not take the line of least

resistance.   There  have  been many  students  who  have

gained  readmission to schools even where the student  is

not  performing  well or might require a  great  deal  of

resources  and attention.  They had been taken  back  in.

So  it  does show that, in fact, our principals  are  not

bloody minded about it.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> I just wonder how

does  the  principal of the school that has expelled  the

student convince the principal of another school who  may

be  prepared to actually admit the student.  From what  I

understand, sometimes the students do seek reference

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>

from  the  principal  of  the school  that  expelled  the

students.  So are there any guidelines which MOE provides

to  the  principals of schools that there should be  some

objectivity to be observed in the event that  a  decision

has  to  be taken in considering the readmission  of  the

expelled student?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I think principals have

a  good  understanding of this.   They  know  that  if  a

student is expelled from a particular school, he does not

gain  readmission into that particular school.  So  there

is  no  adverse implication in an expelled student having

to  go to another school.  There is no implication of the

first school having not been convinced as to whether  the

student  is  someone who should be taken  back  as  such.

Very  often, you will find a principal of a school  which

has  expelled a student taking in a student who has  been

expelled from another school, if he is convinced that the

student has turned over a new leaf.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY 1 REGISTRATION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) how many of the 178 children who could  not

be  traced for registration in Primary 1 have since  been

found;  (b)  how many of the 312 children who  are  still

being  traced  are  now  in  school;  (c)  what  is   the

proportion  of  boys  and girls  in  the  cohort  of  467

children  who have enrolled into madrasahs; (d)  what  is

his   assessment  of  the  implementation  of   how   the

Compulsory Education Act has been put into effect by  his

Ministry;  and (e) what improvements, if needed,  can  be

made to get more children into schools under this Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in November 2002, the

Ministry  of  Education reported  that  a  total  of  490

children  either could not be contacted or  were  in  the

process of being traced.  Of these 490, 33 children  have

come  forward and registered for Primary 1 on their  own.

For  the  remaining 457 cases, we have managed to contact

287 of them.  Of these 287,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>

263  were overseas, 14 subsequently sought admission  for

Primary 1, and four were granted exemption.  The Ministry

is  still  looking into the remaining six  cases  out  of

these 287.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, there are 170 children who could not be

contacted  despite attempts to reach  them  by  mail  and

house  visits.  The families of these children  may  have

changed  their place of residence, without informing  the

authorities, although they are legally required to do so.

Most of them are likely to have left the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;391 Singaporean children of compulsory school-going

age  enrolled in madrasahs this year.  134 were boys, 257

were girls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of Compulsory Education year has

been  smooth.  The vast majority of children continue  to

be  registered  for Primary 1 in national schools.   Over

42,000  children  or about 96% of the  cohort  have  been

registered  for Primary 1 in national schools  for  2003.

This  is  comparable  to  the percentage  registered  for

Primary 1 in 2002.  Most of those who have not registered

are  either exempted from Compulsory Education or  living

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in place a system of house visitation

for  those  who  have not registered their  children  for

Primary  1 in the annual registration.  For the  year  of

admission of 2003, the house visitation managed to get 24

children  to  register for school.  We have also  put  in

place  a  counselling and community mediation process  to

deal  with  cases of non-compliance.  Our  officers  will

provide  information on community organisations to  those

parents who need assistance from these organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The processes we have put in place are working well.

While  we  will continue to put in our best  efforts  for

children  who did not register for school, we  should  be

mindful that it is not always possible to locate each and

every child.  If Members have information on children who

should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>

be  in school, but are not, we will be happy to follow up

on them.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Could the Senior Minister

of State please enlighten as to how many home visits were

done,  whether the officers were accompanied by any other

officers to aid them when doors were not opened?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

visit  all cases who do not respond to our letters.   The

first  step is sending out letters to the parents.  Where

there is no response, we visit all cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the officers are accompanied by specialists

in  door  knocking or in eliciting a response, I  do  not

have  the  details immediately with me, but I  think  the

officers themselves know how to get a response if someone

is at home.  The real problem is more in follow-up, where

we  are  able to meet the person at home and there  is  a

reluctance to send the child to school.  This is where we

need  to  counsel  the parents.  The process  is  working

quite  well  so far.  Our main problem is  that  we  were

unable to locate 170 pupils last year.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> For year 2003, how would

improvements be done in the area of locating the pupils?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> We are trying our best.

I  think  the processes are already improved.   To  begin

with,  before  Compulsory Education, the  processes  were

working   quite  well,  but  we  have  strengthened   our

resources.  We have got many more officers now on the job

of house visitations.  As regards those who we are unable

to  locate, it is not something that we can do very  much

more  about.  Most of these people, I suspect, have  gone

abroad.   Again, if we have any information  coming  from

Members or any other source, we will follow up on it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to ask the

Senior Minister of State whether the 170 cases, which the

Ministry  could  not locate, have been  referred  to  the

Family Service Centre or social workers, because some  of

them may be gypsies,

staying  in  friends'  and relatives'  home?   And,  also

perhaps the grassroots organisations could help if  these

cases are known.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I will look into the

suggestion  of  whether we should  refer  such  cases  to

grassroots  organisations, if it  has  not  already  been

done.  But, basically, there is a limit to how far we can

track  everyone in Singapore, and I suspect  citizens  do

not   want   the  Government  to  literally  track   them

completely.  We are trying our best.  The number is quite

small, and for this residue of cases we will see what  we

can do.  We are putting every effort into it, but we will

not be able to bring the figure down to zero.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> The Senior Minister of State said that it is likely that

these  children could have gone overseas.  Has any effort

been   made   to   counter-check  with  the   Immigration

Department  to  see whether these children have  actually

gone overseas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> We have checked with all

the  available sources.  In other words, where  there  is

information.  So these residual cases are cases where  we

really do not know where they are.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Does the Ministry consider

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> All suggestions for best

<div align="center"><b>FORMER WORK PERMIT HOLDERS MARRYING SINGAPOREANS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for  Manpower  (a)  if  he will  clarify  the  policy  of

disallowing  former  work permit  holders  from  marrying

Singaporeans  even after they have ceased  being  a  work

permit  holder; and (b) if his Ministry will  consider  a

timeframe for which a former work permit holder  who  has

ceased  holding the work permit, be allowed  to  marry  a

Singaporean without facing charges of violating his  work

permit agreement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  currently, there are  already  more  than

500,000 lower skilled foreign workers on work permits  in

Singapore.   To discourage unskilled work permit  holders

from  marrying locals, with the view to sinking roots  in

Singapore,  we  require all existing and  ex-work  permit

holders to seek approval before marrying a Singaporean or

a  Permanent Resident.  Ex-work permit holders  are  also

required  to seek marriage approval to prevent them  from

circumventing this requirement simply by cancelling their

work permits in order to marry a Singaporean or Permanent

Resident without prior approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry approved more than 80% of marriage

applications  by  existing and  ex-work  permit  holders.

Hence,  this work permit condition is not an unreasonable

hurdle for Singaporeans who wish to marry existing or ex-work  permit holders.  There are no plans to change  this

work permit condition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the general guideline

or  criterion for the Ministry to approve ex-work  permit

holders marrying Singaporeans?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the general

guideline is the capability, the skills of both  parties,

the  Singaporean and the work permit holder, or  the  ex-work permit holder.  We have to make an assessment of the

work  permit  holder or the ex-work permit holder.   Once

given  the chance to sink roots in Singapore, would  they

be  able to look after themselves in the long term?   So,

the  level  of  skills  that they have,  the  educational

achievement   that   they   have,   are   all   important

considerations.  There is no hard-and-fast rule.  We look

at  both  parties.  If the Singaporean has  a  very  high

level  of  education, and also high  skill  level,  then,

obviously, that can help to compensate if the non-citizen

party has lower skill level, and vice-versa.  Overall, it

is  a question of the ability of both the Singaporean and

the  non-citizen to satisfy us that they are able to look

after  themselves.   They will not  become  part  of  our

burden  of  being unemployed, especially if  the  economy

were to take a turn for the worse. And if they have lower

skill, they are most likely to be made redundant even  if

they  may be employed now.  So we want to be assured that

under  any  circumstances, they should be  able  to  look

after themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who lack the skill and they want to apply

for  approval, then the advice to them would be to please

go  and  make an effort to upgrade their skill, both  the

Singaporean  party and also the non-citizen party.   They

should  both make efforts to upgrade their skill and,  if

they do so, they could be considered more favourably  the

next  time  they  make an application.  As  I  have  said

earlier  on,  we have already approved 80%,  which  means

that  our criteria cannot be that rigid nor are  they  so

unreasonable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> I understand that if

they violate the agreement, they are supposed to serve  a

ban  for a certain period.  Can I check how long is  this

ban?   Also,  if they did not apply for a permit  to  get

married,  even  if the spouse had ceased  to  be  a  work

permit   holder,  but  if  the  husband  is  capable   of

supporting  her,  how long is the ban  that  she  has  to

serve?  Does she still need to serve a ban if the husband

is capable of meeting the criteria set by MOM?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said,  for  those who choose to consciously  violate

the  conditions of the work permit which are  stated

upfront and quite clearly that they must seek  prior

approval, then we have no option but to insist  that

they  suffer some penalty.  Otherwise, the provision

itself is ineffective as a deterrent.  As to exactly

how  long  the  ban  should be, it  depends  on  the

circumstances of the case - some are perhaps  a  bit

longer  than others.  Also in the interim,  if  they

make efforts to further upgrade themselves, then the

lifting of the ban can be achieved much earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of those who married a Singaporean who

obviously is of a fairly high calibre, high education and

achievement,  could we have a shorter period  ban?   Yes,

that would be considered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Is having children out of

the marriage in this case one of the reasons for the non-approval?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the couple

proceed to have a child before they seek our approval for

the marriage, they will be deemed to have contravened the

work  permit condition and the penalty will  have  to  be

enforced.

<div align="center"><b>POLYCLINICS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Prices of drugs)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a)  why the prices of some drugs in  polyclinics

are  higher than those of restructured hospitals; and (b)

how  can  the Government ensure that polyclinic  patients

will get the best deal in drug prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member asked why the prices  of  some

drugs   in   polyclinics  are  higher   than   those   of

restructured hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anomaly arose because historically we charge

drugs  in  the  polyclinics  under  a  system  which   is

different   from  the  way  we  charge   drugs   in   the

restructured hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charging system for Standard Drug List (SDL)

medication at the polyclinics is set at a fixed  rate  of

$1.40  for one week's prescription.  It has been  so  for

many  years.   The reason is because we  want  it  to  be

simple  and  easy to administer.  So in such  cases  some

patients  will  pay more than the cost of drugs,  if  the

cost of drugs is lower than $1.40, whereas other patients

will pay less than the cost of drugs, if the cost of drug

is  more  than $1.40 per week's supply.  So  there  is  a

cross-subsidy in the polyclinic system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restructured hospitals, being corporatised,

they  charge  the drugs based on the cost of  the  drugs.

So,  as a result, you will find that some drugs cost more

in the polyclinics than in the hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this charging system has served us well in

the  polyclinics, my Ministry is reviewing  this  system,

together  with the clusters, to explore ways  to  improve

the charging system and harmonise the drug charges across

the  different public sector institutions.   We  have  to

take  into account constraints, such as IT infrastructure

and  also how to educate Singaporeans to adjust to  these

changes  in  the  pricing system.  The  results  of  this

review will be made known in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question about ensuring that patients

get  the best deal in drug prices, I would like to inform

the House that the two healthcare clusters have set up  a

central agency, called the Group Purchasing Office (GPO),

to   purchase   drugs  for  all  the  public   healthcare

institutions,  including  the  polyclinics.   The   Group

Purchasing  Office  has started with bulk  purchasing  of

high  volume standard drugs and would, over time,  extend

it  to  all  the  other drugs.  Currently, both  clusters

purchase  around  90% of their standard drugs,  which  is

around  400  items, through the Group Purchasing  Office.

Central  purchasing by the Group Purchasing Office  helps

to  standardise  the  price of  drugs  and  also  achieve

savings, which can then be passed on to patients.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am worried about this

review  on the drug charging system.  Would the  Minister

tell  us more about this review and whether or not  there

will  be  a  cap  on  the charging of drugs,  as  in  the

existing  charging system for polyclinics,  which  is  at

$1.40?  Will the cap remain at $1.40 or is it going to be

bottomless?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think the Member meant the

"ceiling"  and  going over the roof and not "bottomless".

That  is the reason why we have been taking some time  in

considering this review.  As I explained earlier, in  the

polyclinics,  we  have a very simple system,  a  standard

$1.40.   So  for  those drugs which are cheaper  to  buy,

cheaper  in cost, then you pay slightly more.  For  those

drugs,   especially  for  patients   who   have   chronic

conditions,  they come to the polyclinic very  regularly,

this  ceiling of $1.40 helps them.  This system has  been

in place for a long time.  It has served us well.  We are

quite reluctant to change it.  But then it gives rise  to

this  anomaly that for those drugs which are  very  lowly

priced, you are charged $1.40, whereas if you go  to  the

hospital,  it could be 60 or 70 cents.  Then, people  may

raise  problems.  If we go by charging actual cost, then,

of  course,  the  cost  will  be  harmonised  across  all

institutions.   But  as Mr Low Thia  Khiang  says,  those

chronic  patients, who have been paying the low  standard

price of $1.40, may now have to pay higher prices because

the cost is actually much higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered this last year and we wanted to make a

change.   In  the end, we decided not to change  for  two

reasons:  first, to make the change requires us to  spend

money  on  IT,  which will then cause the charges  to  be

higher  also.  And, secondly, some people will pay  less,

but some will have to pay more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the light of last year's economic conditions,

we  decided  to keep the change in view.  But  a  lot  of

questions  were raised by Members and also in the  press.

We  cannot  keep this standard charge forever.   At  some

point, we have to move to proper charging by cost.   When

the time is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>

necessary   to  make  the  change,  we  will  have   some

transitional measures so that the changes would  be  made

as light as possible for those who have to pay more.

<div align="center"><b>TUAS AND WOODLANDS CHECKPOINTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of car lanes by motorcyclists)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs if his Ministry will consider (i)  allowing

motorcyclists holding Singapore passports to use the less

jammed  car  lanes at the Tuas and Woodlands Checkpoints,

so  as  to  alleviate the long jams caused  by  Malaysian

motorcyclists returning home after work and  (ii)  adding

more  staff  and  opening up more immigration  Checkpoint

counters during peak hours so as to reduce the time taken

for    Malaysian   motorcyclists   to   clear   Singapore

immigration.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, our Checkpoints are our

first   line   of  defence  in  safeguarding  Singapore's

security  and safety.  Since September 11 2001,  security

checks  at  all our Checkpoints have been stepped  up  to

prevent   the  entry  of  undesirable  persons,  weapons,

explosives, etc.  Whilst SIR, Customs and other  agencies

manning  the  Checkpoints  try  to  clear  travellers  as

quickly  as  possible,  security cannot  be  compromised.

Hence,  travellers may, at times, have  to  put  up  with

slightly longer clearance times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has suggested that we should allow

motorcyclists holding Singapore passports to  be  cleared

at  car counter during peak periods.  Sir, we have  found

that  this  idea is not very practical.  I  will  explain

why.   Currently,  the  land Checkpoints  adopt  a  sound

practice  of segregating the different forms  of  various

types of traffic: motorcycles, cars, lorries, buses, etc,

as  they enter or leave the Checkpoints.  This allows for

easier  traffic  management.  However,  if  motorcyclists

were  allowed to weave in and out of traffic, they  could

obstruct  cars, lorries and other vehicles from  entering

the Checkpoints and even slow traffic down

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>

further,  as had happened in the past.  They  would  also

pose safety problems and even endanger their own lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has suggested adding more staff and opening

up more immigration counters during the peak period.  SIR

monitors  traffic  conditions at the Tuas  and  Woodlands

Checkpoints  very closely and has undertaken measures  to

alleviate the traffic congestion.  During the morning and

evening   peak   periods  when  motorcycle   traffic   is

particularly heavy, as many motorcycle clearance counters

are  open  at  the  two  Checkpoints  as  possible.   All

available  manpower  is deployed to clear  all  modes  of

transport during the peak hours, with more being deployed

to  the  critical areas.  For example, if there are  more

motorcycles,  more  officers will be  deployed  to  clear

motorcycles.  SIR has also staggered their shifts and has

a system to call upon off-duty officers to help with very

heavy volumes of travellers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic congestion, however, is inevitable whenever

a  large number of motorcyclists and other travellers try

to  pass  through the Checkpoints at the same  time.   We

urge  all travellers, wherever possible, to adjust  their

travelling  times  to avoid the peak periods.   They  can

call  the  traffic information hotlines or listen  in  to

TrafficWatch on our radio stations to find out the latest

traffic conditions at the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints.

In  some cases, they should consider to car pool or  even

use public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the House that all the

agencies  operating at the Checkpoints are  committed  to

minimising  traffic  congestion without  compromising  on

security and safety.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, does the Senior

Parliamentary   Secretary   know   that   most   of   the

motorcyclists are actually Malaysian workers  going  back

after  work and there is no possibility of them  actually

staggering  their working hours, unless  their  companies

agree?   In  a  sense, it takes about one hour  for  them

every day to clear the Customs, and something has to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>

be  done.   So, would the Ministry actually increase  the

workforce  at peak hours?  After monitoring the situation

for  such a long time, they should actually know when are

the peak hours and should have more officers manning more

counters.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, the question asked

by  Mr  Chia was whether motorcyclists holding  Singapore

passports  could  be allowed to use the less  jammed  car

lanes.   In this respect, the suggestion is for  them  to

try  to  adjust their time - they should not go into  the

Checkpoints  when  all the Malaysian  workers  are  going

back,  because they are going to be trapped in a  traffic

jam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, at the moment, overall, our

figures  show  that 85% of motorcyclists are  Malaysians,

and   they   are  holding  long-term  passes.    At   the

immigration counters, they are cleared within 20 seconds,

because  we have their data, and they are cleared faster.

The  traffic jam, for most, according to our  survey,  is

between  30-45  minutes, before they reach the  20-second

clearance time.  This is already much better than in  the

past.   Because at the previous Checkpoint at  Woodlands,

for  example, where most of these workers passed  through

before  the  new Checkpoint was ready, they had  to  wait

longer  than one hour before they were cleared.   At  the

moment,  because we segregate them, we have been able  to

clear them, and they get caught in a jam of between 30-45

minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers are made available, whenever necessary. In

fact, at peak hours, we have, if I am not mistaken,  more

than 25 counters open to clear the motorcyclists.  During

normal  hours, there are about eight counters only.   So,

we   have,  in  fact,  trebled  the  number  of  counters

available  to clear them, and we will try to do  more  as

and when it is necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I am happy to hear

that the waiting time has been cut down from one hour  to

40 minutes, and I look forward to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>

department cutting down the time to less than 15  minutes

per waiting time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first part of my question about Singapore

passport  holders,  I  have the  personal  experience  of

reaching  the Customs and seeing the car lanes  were  all

empty.   We  actually wanted to use the car lane  but  we

were told, "No, you cannot."  One has to squeeze with the

other motorcyclists, even though the car lanes are empty.

On  such  an  occasion, would the Customs actually  allow

Singaporean  motorcyclists to use  the  car  lane  to  be

cleared, so as to divert the traffic away?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, at the moment, I

think  the  answer  is  no,  unless  we  can  make  prior

arrangements.   If  once  we allow  for  a  change,  what

happens  if 10 seconds later, cars are coming in?   These

are  the  situations which will become more difficult  to

manage.    Anyway   when   we  talk   about   Singaporean

motorcyclists,  there is no guarantee  that  the  pillion

rider  is  also  a Singaporean.  And if  you  go  into  a

Singapore  citizen counter, your pillion rider cannot  be

cleared.  So all other practical problems may arise if we

change  the system without taking into account all  these

factors.   However,  the  point has  been  noted  by  the

Immigration  Department.   They  will  see  whether  such

changes  are  necessary in the future.   At  the  moment,

because  we  have been able to clear the  traffic  faster

without undermining our security and safety, we find  the

current  system quite useful and it should  be  continued

for the time being.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Customs Officer at

the  Woodlands Checkpoint aware that at peak  hours,  the

motorcyclists  are actually occupying the  car  lane  way

before  the  Checkpoint and as a result  of  which,  they

actually cause a traffic jam all the way from the flyover

to  Woodlands?   And  I do not see that  any  officer  is

actually helping to clear the lane.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, what Mr Low

mentioned was actually the situation that occurred mainly

at the previous Checkpoint, before the new Checkpoint was

built.  At the present

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>

Checkpoint,  because of the experience in  the  past,  we

have actually segregated the different transport modes at

about  200  metres  before the Checkpoint.   So  at  that

point, if there is a traffic jam, there is a traffic jam.

What  we have done actually is to divide them into  their

separate  zones and, hopefully, to speed up the  process.

That  can take about - I do not know how many motorcycles

or cars - but beyond that, a jam is a jam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. The jam is

actually before the lane divider where the motorcycle and

motorcar lanes are segregated, and everybody gets  jammed

up and occupying the whole road.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, that was the

explanation  I gave earlier to Mr Chia.  As the  vehicles

reach  the  Checkpoint, we should not allow the different

modes  of  transport  to be mixed together.   As  he  has

explained,  before the 200-metre point,  the  mixture  of

vehicles   has  caused  a  little  bit  of  a   difficult

situation.  This is what we have avoided - by segregating

them at the 200-metre point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Basically, would the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that the demand  for

the  clearance is actually more than the supply  provided

by the Customs Office at the moment?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> During the peak period,

yes.   What  happens  is this.  The peak  period  in  the

morning, for example, is between 6 am and 9 am, when  the

vehicles come in.  It is not possible for the Immigration

Department,  for example, to open up all the counters  to

cater  for this big number of vehicles and to clear  them

as fast as possible.  Because after that period, officers

will be there and they will be idling around.  They would

have  nothing  to do because all the vehicles  have  been

cleared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the figures here for Mr Chia's information.

In  the  morning  peak hours, we open  up  more  counters

because we understand that they need to reach their  work

place as fast as possible.  At the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>

arrival  point, in the morning, we open up 25  car  lanes

and  44  motorcycle lanes to cater for the vehicles  from

Malaysia.  So the processing is faster.  In the  evening,

it is different because they are departing, and they have

no  urgency to reach home within a certain period.  So we

open up 25 lanes.  That is the maximum we can do for  the

morning  and the evening because of the urgency for  them

to  reach  their work place by a certain time.   We  have

done  what  we  can  to accommodate the  needs  of  these

workers, ie, to clear them as fast as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we are jammed up by these

questions, please raise your next Question, Mr Low.

<div align="center"><b>CLAIMS AGAINST EMPLOYERS FOR UNPAID WAGES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower (a) what is the number of claims lodged with the

Ministry  by non-unionised workers against employers  for

unpaid wages in 2001 and 2002; (b) what is the number  of

claims  where the claimants have not been able  to  fully

recover  their  unpaid  wages;  and  (c)  what   is   the

Ministry's  response  to cases where  employers  fail  to

comply  with  orders of the Labour Court to make  payment

and  what  further recourse is available to the claimants

in such cases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, last year, a total of 12,705 non-unionised

workers, including foreign workers, sought the assistance

of  the Ministry's Labour Relations Department to resolve

their employment claims.  There were 12,203 claims by non-unionised workers in the year 2001.  In 2002, 11,918,  or

94%,  of  the  claims were successfully resolved  through

conciliation  at  the Ministry.  The  majority  of  these

claims were over unpaid wages.  The balance of 787 claims

which  could  not  be settled through  conciliation  were

adjudicated by the Commissioner for Labour.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 787 workers, 664 of them were awarded

payments by the Commissioner for Labour, while the claims

of  the  remaining 123 workers, or about 1%, were  struck

off  or  dismissed as the workers failed to turn  up  for

inquiry  by the Commissioner for Labour or were found  to

have no valid claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the 664 workers who were awarded payments,

167 workers were  fully paid by their employers while  17

were  given partial payment after orders had been issued.

The  remaining 480 workers did not receive payments  from

their  employers within the stipulated period of 14 days.

Of these 480 workers, 280 were from three large companies

and  the  remaining 232 were from many  small  companies.

Majority   of  these  companies  face  severe   financial

difficulty or are insolvent already.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 301 of the 480 workers who were awarded payment

by  the  Commissioner sought my Ministry's assistance  to

enforce  the orders in the Subordinate Courts  while  the

rest of 179 workers did not pursue their claims further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in cases where the workers decided to enforce

the  orders in the Subordinate Courts, the Ministry  will

help  them prepare the necessary documents.  But  whether

the  workers  get  any  payment depends  on  whether  the

companies have any assets left for sale.  The Member  may

wish  to know that many of these employers are likely  to

be  in severe financial difficulty and have no asset left

for  payment to the workers.  Our officers would  usually

advise  on the chance of recovering the claims but  leave

the  decision  to  proceed in the  Civil  Courts  to  the

workers.   They  would have to accept the  reality  that,

when  a  company  is broke, enforcement  action  may  not

result  in any positive outcome.  Fortunately, the number

of  workers  in  such  a situation is  relatively  small,

constituting  some 3.7% of the total number of  claimants

who lodged their claims at the Ministry.

<div align="center"><b>NORTH EAST MRT LINE</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam

See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. To ask the Minister for Transport when will the

North East Line be opened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Question No. 15, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) handed over the

North East Line (NEL) system to the operator, SBS Transit

(SBST), on 16th December last year.  Since then, SBST has

been carrying out trial runs of the system to prepare for

passenger service.  LTA is working very closely with  the

operator   to   fine-tune  the  system  to  improve   its

performance and reliability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the current progress, we expect that the

operator  will  be  ready to operate  NEL  for  passenger

service in April this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, will the

Minister  please tell us whether the rates of  the  fares

for  the  North East Line will be the same as  the  other

lines?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the fare structure for NEL

has  not  been finalised yet.  The operator will need  to

submit their fare proposals to the PTC for approval,  and

the  fares  will eventually be decided upon  by  the  PTC

after  taking into consideration the justifications  from

the  operator and the impact on the commuters.  Mr  Chiam

may   wish  to  note  that  the  NEL  line,  being  fully

underground, is a more expensive line to operate compared

to  the  other MRT lines.  So, the fare structure is  not

likely to be identical to the current MRT system.   I  am

sure  the PTC, in approving the fare structure, will take

this into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that,

whilst the line may be more expensive to construct, as it

is  underground, but it is also driverless?  So, I  would

expect  that  the operator would save a lot  of  manpower

costs.  Would he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>

ask  the PTC to take this into consideration for the fare

structure?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> As I said just now, the PTC

would   take   into  consideration  all   the   different

justifications  given by the operator.  However,  when  I

said  that the NEL line is more expensive, what  I  meant

was  that the NEL line is totally underground and,  being

totally  underground, the stations are going to  be  more

expensive to operate because of the aircondition  system,

etc.   There will be some savings on the drivers but  the

system will also be a lot more complicated because, being

driverless,  the  control systems, and  everything  else,

will  be  more complicated and the maintenance  cost,  in

effect, will counter the savings for the drivers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> If that is the case, then why

driverless?  There is no saving.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo, I do not think you need to

answer that question.

<div align="center"><b>REGIONAL SHELTER-CUM-DROP-IN FACILITIES FOR TROUBLED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEENS AND CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Community Development and Sports if he  will

consider  setting  up regional shelter-cum-drop-in  short

stay  facilities for troubled teens or children  to  give

them  respite  care  or  to help parents  who  need  such

temporary refuge for their children.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, the

Ministry  adopts  a  multi-pronged  approach  in  helping

families  and  individuals.  Troubled teens who may  need

shelter  can  approach  any social  work  agency,  Family

Service   Centre,  children's  home,  or   their   school

counsellor.  The agencies function as a form  of  drop-in

for  troubled  teens  who require  a  listening  ear,  or

advice, as they are open to all who need help.  These are

located all over the island and are easily accessible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelters for teens and children are currently

provided by homes for children

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>

and  young persons.  Depending on the circumstances,  the

social  worker  or  counsellor will  determine  the  most

suitable  facility for short term stay.  A few  shelters,

such  as the Teen Challenge Youth Centre, the Andrew  and

Grace  Home, The Tent and the Pertapis Centre  for  Women

and Girls, focus on young persons who need time away from

their  family  while they get help with the  issues  that

trouble them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the issues that trouble teens, the

social   workers  will  always  engage  the   family   in

counselling therapy and as part of the effort to  find  a

long term solution.  The teenage years can be a difficult

time  for young people and we will continue to work  with

the  schools,  social service agencies  and  families  to

reach  out to young people who may need help.   We  would

encourage  young people and parents to come  forward  for

help  early and not wait till things are so bad that they

need  to run away from home to seek shelter.  Should they

need to do so, they can approach or drop in at any social

work  agency, or call the Family Service Centre  hotline,

or the Tinkle Friend hotline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of the above homes and the various

community resources like social service agencies,  Family

Service Centre, school counsellors and helplines serve as

strategic  contact  points  for  teens  who  may  require

assistance.   For teens who have intention to  stay  away

from home or are beyond parental control, the setting  up

of  specific  drop-in centres may not serve the  intended

purpose  of  attracting them as they are more  likely  to

stay  with their friends.  Our message to teens  is  that

they can get help by speaking to a pastoral care teacher,

or a social worker.

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL DEPOSITORY FOR UNWANTED BABIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports  if  he  will  consider

allowing  parents, who have babies they cannot care  for,

to  leave  them  at  a legally designated  place  without

penalising them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have three minutes, Dr Yaacob.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the MP has

asked   if   my  Ministry  will  consider  legalising   a

designated  place for parents to leave their babies.   My

Ministry   has  previously  responded  to  questions   in

Parliament and the media regarding our position  on  such

repositories,  also  known as `Baby  Drops'.   While  the

objective  of  such repositories is to protect  the  baby

from  danger and the anonymity of the parent who abandons

the  baby,  they remain controversial even  in  countries

that have introduced them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our existing legislation, it is illegal to

abandon  a  baby.   This is to underline the  inalienable

responsibility of parents for the safety and  welfare  of

their children.  The `Baby Drop' scheme could unwittingly

encourage  child  abandonment, which will,  in  the  long

term,  put  far more children at risk.  The anonymity  of

the  mother  would  also deprive  her  of  the  emotional

support that she needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to highlight, once again, that we do

not  intend  to legalise such schemes as we believe  that

there are far more constructive ways to help mothers with

unwanted  pregnancies.  My Ministry  and  social  service

agencies prefer to engage the mother, apprise her of  her

options  and assist through counselling her, her  partner

and  her parents, to make an informed decision, including

the  possibility  of  giving her baby  up  for  adoption.

Currently, mothers with unwanted pregnancies can approach

the  Child Protection and Welfare Service in my Ministry,

Rose  Villa  or the Pertapis Centre for Women and  Girls.

There  are also shelters for those who wish to  keep  the

baby and a 24-hour hotline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to encourage those who find themselves

with  an  unwanted  pregnancy to come forward  early  for

help.   We assure them of confidentiality as they receive

counselling and other forms of help.  For girls  who  may

be underaged, we will work with them and their parents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>

If  the girl has reasons not to inform her parents  about

the  admission to the shelter, the staff will try to work

with the girl to address her concerns.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's release of the White Paper on

Jemaah  Islamiyah arrests and the threat of terrorism  is

timely  and  well-intended.   It  is  important  for  all

Singaporeans,  regardless  of  their  race,  language  or

religion,  to  understand the extent  and  depth  of  the

security  threat facing our country.  This threat  deeply

impacts  on  our  racial harmony and,  more  importantly,

undermines our very survival and existence as a peaceful,

stable and thriving nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we attained our independence in 1965, very

few  people  outside Singapore believed  that  we  had  a

chance  to survive.  Even though we attained independence

by chance, we never left our survival to chance.  And not

only did we succeed, but we prospered.  For more than  30

years,  Singaporeans of different races, such as Chinese,

Malays, Indians and Eurasians, rallied together in  unity

and  toiled to build this great nation of ours.  We  have

thrived  and prospered against a backdrop of  social  and

racial  harmony.   Today,  Singapore's  achievements  are

acknowledged  world-wide.  Millions  from  all  over  the

world come to our country yearly to visit, work or study.

They  do so with confidence that Singapore is a safe  and

peaceful place.  At the same time, thousands of companies

from all over the world have invested billions of dollars

in our economy with trust and confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have translated into jobs for Singaporeans

which,  in  turn,  have  generated growth,  progress  and

stability  for  our  people  and  country.   Workers   in

Singapore,  comprising the different races and  religion,

are determined and committed in continuing our efforts in

nation-building  as  one united people.   In  short,  our

social  stability has been a fundamental  pillar  of  our

growth.  Today, we learn that the pillar - and, in  every

sense, Singapore - is threatened by terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the workers, I strongly support

the firm actions taken by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>

Government  against the threat of terrorism posed  by  JI

and  other  militant extremist groups in the  region.   I

also endorse the recommendations in the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the security agencies of the Ministry of Home

Affairs and the Ministry of Defence have done a good  job

in  keeping our homeland safe and secure for Singaporeans

of  all  races  and religions.  But the security  of  our

nation, be it internal or external, cannot be solely left

to  the  security  agencies alone  or,  worse  still,  to

chance.   As  an  open  and  multi-racial  society,   all

Singaporeans  must  always be vigilant  against  external

adverse influences.  We must forever be mindful that  any

threat to our security is a threat to workers' livelihood

and well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is a very small nation without any

natural  resources, except for our people.  A  threat  to

Singapore  is,  thus, a threat to our  people.   We  have

never  left our survival in the past to chance, and there

is  no  reason to leave our future to chance.  We  should

never allow the acts of the few to destroy the efforts of

the  many  Singaporeans.   Neither  should  we  target  a

particular community for the acts of a few, be it in  the

employment  scene or at the inter-community level.   More

importantly,   we   must  never  be  complacent   or   be

indifferent  when  it  comes  to  the  security  of   our

homeland.  In doing so, it would arguably just fall short

of betrayal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Prime Minister expressed concern about

inter-racial and inter-religious relations at a  dialogue

session  on the 28th January 2002.  I quote what he  said

then:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A minor incident could show up into a major

confrontation between the races and religions.   We  must

prevent this."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is precisely right. We must be

vigilant  and must never allow a few to ignite the  spark

that will set off the fire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to share a personal experience. In

1984,  I  attended  a leadership programme  in  an  Asian

country.  From the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>

day  I arrived in that country and for the next two weeks

while  I  was there, I saw people of different  religions

going  about  their daily lives in the country.   It  was

calm  and peaceful.  On the 15th day, there was a serious

incident caused by a few people.  Immediately, the  peace

and  unity  broke down.  It totally stunned  me.   I  saw

racial   fights   between   two  different   communities,

resulting  in  deaths, loss of homes and properties.   I,

too,  almost fell victim to the situation.  There was  an

attack  on  the hotel where I stayed, and I  was  hit  by

broken  glass.  My head was covered with glass splinters.

But,  fortunately, big pieces of glass and  stone  missed

me.   I  was lucky.  But the many innocent people in  the

streets  and in their homes were not so fortunate.   Till

this day, whenever I recall that incident, I remember the

images of chaos and I still feel very sad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must never allow such incidents to ever

happen  in  our country.  The best ways to  achieve  this

objective are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Further strengthen inter-racial and inter-religious relations at all levels, starting from the

schools, community and places of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) All Singaporeans must exercise strong vigilance

against extremist religious teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) We must be alert to suspicious or clandestine

activities,  and  inform the authorities,  if  they  come

across any.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call upon Singaporeans of all races and

religions  to  rally behind our Government  to  keep  our

homeland safe and secure.  The greatest gift we can  give

to  our children and future generation of Singaporeans is

to  have  a  homeland which is safe and secure  from  all

threats of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>

support  the motion in the name of the Minister for  Home

Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin my speech, I would like to make two

points of clarification.  Yesterday, the hon. Member  for

my  GRC,  Mr Sin Boon Ann, talked about the need for  the

Muslim  community here to practise moderation.   I  sense

his  pessimism.   I would like to give an assurance  that

the majority of the Muslims in this country are moderate.

The word "moderate" is quite relative in meaning.  It  is

also  the  same as the word `fundamentalist'.   What  has

been  accepted  by  the Muslims as moderate  may  not  be

moderate for some others.  As an example, we take a  look

at  Turkey.  Many in their Muslim community feel that the

Turkish  people are not only moderate, but too  moderate.

Since  the  Mustafa Kemal Attaturk era, Turkey had  taken

actions  to erode its religious and Arabic image  and  to

promote secularism. However, until today, it has not been

able  to  bring  down the psychological barriers  Western

leaders have on them and has not been accepted as a  part

of  Europe.  Therefore, the meaning of "moderate" in this

context  does  not  mean to practise  it  moderately  but

practising  it  in a way that  would be seen as  moderate

by  others.  This is the message which I understand to be

what Mr Sin intended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about this view. To me, there must

be  acceptance  by  all quarters with  respect  to  being

moderate.   The  religious followers here could  practise

their religion but they should also take into account the

common  good of the country as a whole.  In this respect,

it would not narrow the common space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Sin said that many Muslims are now

converging in mosques and there are fewer of them in  the

community  centres.   I would like to  stress  that  this

phenomenon  of growing religiosity is not only  happening

to  Muslims.  The Christians, Hindus, Buddhists  and,  in

fact,  Taoist  followers  are also  going  in  increasing

numbers  to  churches and temples.  This is  a  universal

phenomenon.  I believe, with the firm

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>

action taken by the People's Association, there are  more

Muslims who are active in grassroots bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now address this White

Paper.   The  world  is  no longer  the  same  after  the

horrendous  incident of September 11, 2001.  Many  regard

this  as a cliche.  But when the Twin Towers in New  York

collapsed, bringing down thousands of innocent lives, and

the  Pentagon was attacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists on  the

same  day, the words not only make our hair stand on ends

but  also  make us nervous.  In fact, it has changed  the

views  of  the  world forever.  It is an  incident  which

jolted us.  It means that there is no place on earth that

is safe from terrorist acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the case following the detention of

members  of the JI militant group and the statement  that

the  mastermind  behind this activity  is  in  Indonesia.

There  are  also voices refuting the existence  of  these

threats  and the presence of terrorists in their country.

A senior Indonesia leader in fact said proudly that there

were  no  terrorists in Indonesia.  If anyone  wanted  to

arrest terrorists, they should arrest him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the bomb blasts killed many in Bali on 12th

October  last  year,  then we heard  the  admission  that

terrorists existed in the country.  I think it was rather

late.   But for Singapore, the blasts were another  shock

that  the terrorist threats had already arrived in  front

of our doorstep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our security agencies were not efficient and

proactive  in  arresting the members of the  JI,  and  if

there had not been the concerned Muslim who informed  the

authorities  of  the  person who was suspected  of  doing

something  suspicious,  then  it  is  very  likely   that

Singapore would have suffered the consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we all know this frightening fact - that

Singapore  was  chosen  as a terrorist  target,  but  the

planned attack was postponed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can sigh a relief because we had been able to

avert the disaster.  But this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>

relief  is  temporary.  The threat still  exists  and  we

cannot be caught off-guard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why do I recollect briefly the

series  of  these terrorist incidents in  discussing  the

Government's  White  Paper on the JI?   There  are  three

reasons.   Firstly, the terrorist threat is global.   Its

roots  are  found  outside Singapore, in  Afghanistan  or

elsewhere.  But the branch roots and hair roots  can  and

have  spread into Singapore.  Second, in Southeast  Asia,

there   are  already  local  movements,  politically   or

militarily, in several countries, for example,  the  MILF

in  Mindanao,  PULO in Southern Thailand,  GAM  in  Aceh.

They are potentials that can be exploited by the Al-Qaeda

to form its operations networks.  The White Paper reveals

how   the   MILF  camp  had  been  used  to  train   some

Singaporeans   on  terrorist  operations.    Third,   the

terrorist group acts in the name of Islam.  This can have

wide  implications which are not easy to  fathom  on  the

multi-racial society in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reactions of the Muslim community to

the  arrests  of the JI members are clear, unanimous  and

comprehensive.  You may have read and heard  through  the

local  media the reactions and views of Muslim  political

and  organisation leaders and Islamic religious teachers.

However, I have to stress in this House that the  Muslims

unanimously and unequivocally reject the actions  of  the

JI  members.   We  reject in total that the  JI  members'

actions  had  anything  to do with  Islam  because  Islam

forbids such acts.  We are shocked and cannot accept  the

statement of one of the JI members now in detention  that

when  he  told  a panel interviewing him that  those  who

disagreed with the JI's actions were "infidels".  Who  is

he  to  pass such a judgement?  Rational thinking  people

will know about the thinking of that JI member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the same time, we do not want the

entire community to be affected because of the actions of

a few.  We know that when Singapore faced the Communists'

attacks in the fifties and sixties,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>

all  Chinese middle and high school students were  viewed

as  potential  Communists.  When Indonesia  launched  its

Confrontation,  a  significant  number   of   Malays   of

Indonesian  origin  had their houses  raided,  especially

those  who  received frequent visits from their relatives

in   Indonesia.   My  family  in  Lorong   Sinaran   also

experienced this when our house was raided at 3.00 am.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, after the attack of the Chechen

separatists  at  the theatre in Moscow, the  attitude  of

Russians towards Muslims in their country changed.   This

has  been stressed upon by the Minister for Home Affairs.

The   Muslims  became  a  suspected  people.   In   fact,

following  the  Bali  bomb blasts, Hindus  who  form  the

majority  there  looked  on the Muslims  with  suspicion.

Hence,  Muslim Singaporeans greatly welcome the statement

that  the  Government's action against  the  JI  and  its

publication of the White Paper on the JI are not directed

at  the Muslims.  It is a security issue.  Full stop.  In

fact,  we  are also assured when leaders of  the  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry and the Federation  of

Chinese  Clan  Associations  expressed  the  same   view.

However,  I agree with the concern on its impact  on  the

Malay/Muslim  workers, as mentioned by  Mr  Othman  Haron

Eusofe and other members who had spoken earlier. We  hope

the  same  assurances could be extended to the workplace,

factories, offices or everywhere else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we can make an analogy of the JI as

"mud-covered buffaloes which smear others that come  into

contact with them", then we have already separated  these

"wild  buffaloes" to their own pen.  But the question  is

not as simple as we may think.  As our Prime Minister has

said, it is a complex matter.  In the final analysis, the

action of individual Muslims and the Muslim community  at

large  will be taken into account.  In fact, some  regard

this as the deciding factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, what should we do? In my view, this

is the question that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>

should  give adequate attention.  The White Paper  serves

as the starting point for us to take the next step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, the White Paper is very important

because of several reasons.  First, it makes us aware  of

the  fact  that  the fault lines in our multi-racial  and

multi-religious society can grow bigger as  a  result  of

the  irresponsible  action of a few people.   Second,  it

shows that Singapore is vulnerable to destructive foreign

influences  if  we are not careful and vigilant.   Third,

the  way we conduct our religious education needs  to  be

reassessed and it is important for us to create a  safety

net  to  prevent  negative  influences  from  undermining

stability in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some may think that we have the

Religious  Harmony  Act and the Presidential  Council  on

Minority  Rights.  Are these not enough, they asked?   In

my  view, the Act and the Presidential Council deal  with

the  religious issues from different angles or platforms.

We  need to address it from the social perspective.   For

this  reason,  we support the setting up  of  the  Inter-Racial  Confidence  Circles  as  proposed  by  the  Prime

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the social aspect, the White Paper provides an

opportunity  for  us to reassess our attitude  on  racial

ties in Singapore.  It will open a bigger space for us to

discuss  the religious issues which were deemed sensitive

previously  to talk about and which many felt  better  to

avoid  or  sweep  them under the carpet than  facing  the

issues  openly  and  with candour.   A  new  attitude  is

important  if  we want to break the cocoon of  prejudice.

The  open  and  mature discussion can expand  and  deepen

mutual  understanding and trust among  us.   This  is  an

important factor if we want to build a strong and  united

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to other multi-racial countries, we have

moved far ahead in social engineering.  We are not shy to

admit that our policy is aimed at closing the racial gap.

We   practise   racial   quota  in   every   HDB   block,

neighbourhood and housing estate.  Our children go to the

same schools and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>

attend  the  same classes as the children  of  the  other

communities.  Our sons do National Service with the other

young  men  from the other communities.  We  have  multi-racial  grassroots bodies.  We eat at food centres  which

cater to the various communities and sit down at the same

table  even  though the food is not the  same.   We  even

celebrate Racial Harmony Day every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these steps have yet to produce the

desired level of cohesion and mutual trust.  Perhaps,  it

takes  a  longer time to achieve it.  Maybe  the  various

efforts  made  are  not strong enough to  bring  about  a

meeting  of  minds and the adoption of common  attitudes.

The White Paper actually challenges us to make a paradigm

shift in our attitudes and minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also calls on us to be more on guard against

globalisation and IT revolution as they have been used by

groups  such as Al-Qaeda to achieve their own objectives.

There are many websites which advocate various issues and

views  and  people  who visit these websites  who  cannot

differentiate  between  the  good  and  the  bad  can  be

influenced by them, especially those that discuss  issues

emotionally  and in a confrontational manner.   They  can

divide the people.  It is a fact that writers always  see

an  issue from their own experience and perspectives  but

argue  it as a global issue and this can mislead  readers

whose  contexts  of  life are different.   This  is  very

dangerous.   For  Singaporeans,  including  the  Muslims,

which  have  a limited social history, they  need  to  be

concerned about such a possibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of a local newspaper report on a youth

who  complained about his failure in a job interview  but

was  seen wearing a T-shirt carrying the picture of Osama

bin   Laden.   I  do  not  know  the  background  of  the

publication  of  the report but it has made  many  people

form  their own opinions and conclusions.  The youth  has

only  himself to blame for not getting sympathy from  the

members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I agree with the recommendation that the

question of regulating local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>

Muslim  religious  teachers or missionaries  as  well  as

those  from  overseas  be left to the  Muslim  community.

First,  it  reflects the Government's confidence  in  the

capability of the community to tackle the issue.  Second,

it is in line with the policy of religious freedom in the

Republic as long as it takes into account the common good

of  the Singapore multi-racial society.  Third, it  gives

opportunity  to  the community to carry  out  its  common

responsibility  in  deciding what  is  suitable  for  it.

Fourth,  it challenges our Muslim scholars, intellectuals

and  Muslim organisation leaders to achieve consensus and

unity  among  themselves.   Such  a  unity  is  vital  in

preparing the Singapore society and the Muslims  here  to

face various challenges from inside and outside.  What we

will  and  will  not  do  will  be  observed  closely  by

investors and prospective investors.  They want  to  know

whether we are able to control and manage problems  well.

If  it  is proved that there are signs of cracks  in  our

unity, they will not hesitate to leave and relocate their

investments  to  other countries.  So is  the  case  with

local investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, social unity is an important pillar that

can  guarantee  Singapore's survival and well-being.   We

need to defend and strengthen it at whatever price.  With

this  conviction,  I  support the motion  tabled  by  the

Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, like my

Parliamentary  colleagues, I support the motion  standing

in the name of the Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter terrorism, we have to be united as one

people,  not  only by enhancing our security  means,  but

also  by strengthening our social cohesion.  This  is  to

send  a  clear signal to our investors and also to ensure

our survival as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial society. Our main

communities  came  from the two ancient civilisations  in

Asia.  Because of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>

our   bilingual   policy  and  our  policy   of   seeking

similarities  among  differences, we  have  succeeded  in

maintaining our traditional values.  For this reason, the

history of the fatherland of our ancestors and the events

happening therein would have considerable impact  on  us.

This  applies not only to the Chinese community, but also

the Malay community, and the Indian community as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the Chinese community and the Muslim community,

for  example.   1,000 years ago, the  two  most  powerful

civilisations in the world were the Chinese  civilisation

and   the   Muslim   civilisation.   History   of   these

civilisations continues to be taught in our schools, from

where  we  derived  our  traditional  values.   Beautiful

poetries  we  learn  and appreciate came  from  the  Tang

Dynasty  in  China.  Algebra, trigonometry, and  geometry

that  we  learn in school are  products from the  ancient

Muslim world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the 19th century, the Chinese

civilisation and the Muslim civilisation began to go down

the  hill.  The fortunes of the Chinese society  and  the

Muslim society began to turn from bad to worse.  That was

because  they were too complacent with their  development

and failed to keep pace with technological and industrial

revolutions  in  the  west.   They  did  not  strive  for

geographical  and scientific discoveries.  As  a  result,

both China and the Muslim world were faced with a lot  of

problems, both internally and externally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, since the Opium War in 1840, whenever they

were at war with foreign countries, it ended as the clear

loser.   So,  when  the People's Republic  of  China  was

established in 1949, Mao Zedong declared that the Chinese

people  had "stood up"!  This had created a great  impact

on  the  Chinese  people, both within and outside  China.

During the Korean War in the 1950s,  the Chinese army won

a  battle against a foreign army, for the first  time  in

more than a century.  This created a great impact on  the

overseas Chinese. For this reason, many Chinese people in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>

South-east  Asia  appeared to  be  sympathetic  with  the

Malayan Communist Party, which enjoyed the peak of  their

activities then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I must say is that not all Malayan Chinese and

Singapore  Chinese  at  that time supported  the  Malayan

Communist  Party.   In  fact,  most  people  opposed  the

activities  of  the MCP.  But because of  our  historical

baggage  and our historical links, most students  in  the

Chinese  schools were curious about what  the  Communists

were  doing  in  China.  For this  reason,  just  as  was

mentioned   by  my  colleagues  just  now,  many   people

suspected  that  all the students in the Chinese  schools

were  Communists.   During that period  of  time,  I  was

studying   in  a  Chinese  school.   But  I   can   state

categorically that I have never been a Communist.  But in

my  young heart, I was very curious about the development

of China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the 70s, as a student in London,

I  went  to Chinatown, and the first thing I did  was  to

purchase  a  copy of Mao Zedong's quotations and  to  see

what  was in them.  Although I found the terminology  and

phrases used were very impressive, I was not converted. I

think  if  there were some Communists around to  convince

and  brainwash the  young university students, many would

have been converted to Communism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I telling this story? Because there was, in

fact,  similar and   parallel development in  the  Muslim

world too.  Since the Ottoman Empire collapsed during the

First  World  War,  people  in  the  Muslim  world   were

beginning  to  feel that everything was not  going  their

way.  Everything seemed to be going against them.  As the

Minister for Home Affairs mentioned yesterday, events  in

the  Middle East after 1948 had caused the people to feel

that the world was rather unfair to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the revolution in Iran in 1979. This is

somewhat  similar  to  the 1949 Communist  revolution  in

China.   The Iran Revolution had significant   impact  on

the Muslim community at that time, because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>

the  people saw it as a great change.  This country which

used  Muslim  teaching as the way to  govern  the  nation

became  the role model for the Muslim world.   I  believe

the  Muslim  community in Malaysia  must  have  the  same

feeling as the Chinese community in Singapore in 1949.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of JI members must have been a tremendous

shock  to  the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore.  This

was  particularly  so after the second arrest.   However,

the  leaders  and  members of the Malay/Muslim  community

here  were  very clear in their mind that these  sabotage

activities of the JI must be condemned, and they did just

that!   They  made it very clear that  the  JI  does  not

represent the Malay/Muslim community here.  My colleague,

Mayor  Othman Haron Eusofe, had openly said that  he  was

very  angry  over this incident.  We all know  our  Mayor

Othman.   He  is  not a person who would get  very  angry

easily.   But  this event made him very angry.   This,  I

feel, is an exemplary  representative of our Malay/Muslim

community in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, fortunately, a great difference between

the  JI  and our brothers and sisters in the Malay/Muslim

community.  Otherwise, our social cohesion and  religious

harmony  would have been undermined - and this is exactly

what  the  terrorists  wanted.   This  is,  in  fact,   a

psychological  warfare.   They  want  to  make  us   feel

insecure,  to feel threatened.  Had we fallen into  their

trap,   they  would have succeeded and we  would  be  the

losers.  We do not want to be losers.  We want to be  the

winners.   We do not want them to win.  So,  we  must  be

united and stick to the spirit and principle of the White

Paper, to be even more united as a people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at the situation in China and the

relationship  between  China and  the  Chinese  community

here.   The feeling is quite different from that  in  the

50s  and  60s.  No one will suspect that I am a Communist

now.   Why?   Because since 1976, China has  adopted  the

economic  reform  and  open-door  policy.   The   Chinese

leaders realised that economic development,   modernising

its defence capability

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>

and raising the standard of living of their people should

be their main targets.  At the same time, they also began

to realise that pursuing the old route of Communism would

lead  them nowhere near the attainment of these  targets.

The  reform  and  open-door policy has  resulted  in  the

severance of their relationship with the Communist groups

in  Southeast  Asia.  As a result, in  the  eyes  of  the

Chinese people in Southeast Asia, the Communist Party has

disappeared into thin air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese community in Singapore has also advanced

with  the time.  We have clearly stated that we  have  no

link  whatsoever  with the underground Malayan  Communist

Party.  We focused on how to raise the educational  level

of  our  people so that when our economy took off in  the

60s, 70s and 80s, we could rise to the occasion and enjoy

a  better  standard  of  living.  Through  our  bilingual

policy,  through our clan associations, we  maintain  our

traditional culture and values.  For example, the  dragon

dance,  the  lion dance, the traditional  Hokkien  music,

nanying  and the various traditional dialect operas,  are

being promoted and developed among the Chinese community.

The  Chinese community has also cooperated with the other

communities to jointly build up our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot expect life to go on plain

sailing  all  the time without some trouble.   There  are

bound to be some sensitive issues among us.  For example,

just  over  a  year  ago, there was this  blunder  in  an

official  literature  of  a  certain  Government   agency

whereby   the   "Festival  of  the  Hungry  Ghosts"   was

mistakenly  translated  as  the  "Festival  of  Hungarian

Ghosts",  causing an uproar among the Chinese  community.

Years  ago, when there was this anti-Chinese campaign  in

Indonesia,  the  Chinese  community  here  acted   rather

vigorously,  showing not only sympathy but  also  support

for  the victims there. More recently, people were  again

raising  the  Nantah  issue.  There are indeed    certain

sensitive issues among our communities.  However, we  are

able  to  look  at  the  big  picture.   When  there  are

sensitive issues, we deal with them through the proper

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>

channel,  rationally and professionally, such  as  having

dialogue   sessions  where  the  issues   are   analysed,

discussed  and  explained. We  do  not  use  the  Malayan

Communist  Party  way  of  threatening  the  people   and

exerting  pressure on our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sincere hope and wish is that our brothers and

sisters  in the Malay community would cooperate with  the

other  communities here and build up better  relationship

among  us.   We  accept  the fact that  there  are  still

sensitive issues which have to be resolved, but let us do

it  rationally  and  professionally  through  the  proper

channels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy has brought with it many challenges

and  opportunities.  We  have to be  forward-looking  and

seize  the opportunities that are open to us. To do that,

we   have   to   raise  our  educational  standard,   our

technological level, and upgrade our skills.   We  should

not look for solutions from terrorist activities, because

there  is  no way out from there.  I think we  should  do

what  the  mainland  Chinese are  doing.   We  must  have

economic reform and adopt the open-door policy.  We  must

be  forward-looking. We must cooperate with one  another.

Go regional, go global,  to attain our target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people are afraid that economic

prosperity would affect the pursuit for religious growth.

Actually,   there   is  no  conflict   between   economic

prosperity and religious fervour. In the new economy,  we

are  faced with great challenges and intense competition.

It is inevitable that we may have losses and defeats from

time and time.  Very often, we will be extremely stressed

up  and  pressurised. This is when we may  want  to  seek

solace  from  our  religious beliefs.   Being  pious  and

fervently  pursue  good values through our  religion  is,

after all, not a bad thing!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that our Singapore Malay/Muslim community

would  likewise  work  hard to  raise  their  educational

standard and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>

economic standing.   I must say the other communities  in

Singapore  are  ever  ready  and  eager  to  support  one

another.  I can remember that soon after the September 11

event,  we held a farewell party for our Muslim  brothers

who  were  going for their haj.  In Joo Chiat, there  are

not  many Malays.  On that occasion, we had only some  20

to  30  Muslim brothers going for their pilgrimage.  Yet,

some  300 grassroots leaders and supporters turned up  to

bid them farewell.  I asked them why they were turning up

in  such a large number.  They said, "Oh, we want to show

our  support  for our Muslim friends."  So, deep  in  our

hearts,  we  are  still brothers  and  sisters.   Let  us

continue  to  be  good  brothers  and  sisters.   Let  us

maintain the good relationship among us. Then, we will be

able  to  find  more  common space  among  us.   We  will

continue  to  cooperate, to stand  united  for  a  better

future for our country.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   having  heard  the   speeches   of   my

parliamentary colleagues, I am glad that we are  able  to

discuss   so  candidly  this  issue  of  how  to  counter

terrorism. No doubt, the question of religion is always a

very  sensitive issue.  As the Minister for Home Affairs,

Mr  Wong Kan Seng, has said, we want to be frank and open

in  our discussion of this issue, and I hope that we will

all  try to be as objective as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of this White Paper has led me to ask

this  question:  "What kind of Singapore do  Singaporeans

want?"  The significance of the White Paper lies in  what

kind  of  Singapore do we want.  There are two  kinds  of

response from our people to this White Paper.  On the one

hand,  there  are  people who feel that the firm  actions

taken  by  the  Government against  the  JI  members  are

appropriate  and  that our security  agencies  should  be

applauded  for  a job well done. On the  other  hand,  as

mentioned  by  Professor Chin yesterday, there  are  some

Singaporeans  who  are simply indifferent  to  the  whole

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the campaign to counter terrorism, the Government

has been positive and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>

thorough.   However,  the  fight  against  terrorism   is

international  in  scope  and long-term  in  nature.   As

reported by the Home Affairs Minister to this House,  the

Government  has  taken various measures  to  counter  the

threat  to our security posed by the JI group.  What  the

Members  in  this  House should do is to  promote  mutual

trust  and confidence among the various ethnic groups  in

Singapore.   Apart from strengthening our security,  this

White  Paper also seeks to enhance our awareness  of  the

terrorism threat so as to prevent any terrorist act  from

taking  place in Singapore, thereby restoring the foreign

investors'  confidence in Singapore.   This  is  also  to

ensure that such acts of terrorism will not undermine our

racial harmony that has been built up over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been terrorism since time immemorial, but

the  September 11 incident and the Bali bombing have made

us more keenly aware of the fact that the threat is right

in front of our doorstep.  Therefore, we cannot afford to

be complacent.  We cannot compromise our resolve to fight

terrorism.   You  may  think that if you  avoid  visiting

countries where terrorist acts are likely to take  place,

nothing  will happen to you.  Some may ask what  could  a

small  country  like Singapore do in the  gigantic  fight

against terrorism.  However, one must not forget disaster

may  strike even if you are sitting right in your sitting

room  at  home.  Terrorism is insidious  and  ubiquitous.

Though Singapore is small, we have to be prepared.   Like

a  hedgehog,  we  must  have  the  capability  to  defend

ourselves.   Otherwise, the bombing that  took  place  in

Bali could well take place in some corner in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to work together with other

countries in the fight against terrorism, as suggested by

our  colleague,  Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung.   We  should  work

together   with  our  neighbouring  countries  to   fight

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask one question. Now that the

Government  has  made great effort in this  regard,  what

contributions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>

can  individuals, grassroots organisations and  religious

bodies  make?  Since the release of the White  Paper,  we

are glad to see Malay MPs and Muslim organisations making

immediate and positive response on the White Paper.  They

condemn such terrorist acts and express their support for

Government's policy on counter-terrorism.  They will  not

allow  any  individual  or  organisation  to  engage   in

terrorist activities under the name of Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We applaud them for this correct attitude. I am

pleased  to  note  that the Deputy  Mufti  would  form  a

committee  comprising representatives  from  the  various

mainstream  Muslim organisations.  This committee,  after

consulting  the  views  of  local  Muslim  scholars   and

religious teachers, would formulate a code of conduct for

the local Muslims to follow in their daily life to comply

with  their  religious laws.  They  would  also  ask  the

religious  teachers  to  explain to  the  public  certain

Islamic  terminology, so that terms such as  jihad,  etc.

are  not  misused  to  glorify  violent  activities.   We

welcome the setting up of such a committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the other religious bodies might want to

do  the  same - to formulate certain code of conduct  for

their followers, and to educate their people so that they

can  have a better understanding of one another's culture

and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot avoid the reality that the threat posed by

the   JI  group  has  generated  a  negative  impact   on

Singapore, even though its earlier plot has been  foiled.

It  may  well shake our confidence and the confidence  of

the  potential  foreign investors. This is especially  so

since  the  bombing incident in Bali.  This incident  has

forced  our  Muslim  brothers to be constantly  defensive

about their religion. It has also  caused members of  the

other  ethnic  groups  to  look  at  the  Muslims  in   a

suspicious   light.   Many  Muslims  in   Singapore   are

attributing  their   retrenchment and inability  to  find

jobs to discrimination from employers against their race.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we consolidate the racial harmony that we

have achieved so far?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>

Many  foreign  leaders  and visitors  to  Singapore  have

praised  us  for being an international model  of  racial

harmony.  I asked the CEO of a MNC what he thought  about

Singapore's  progress  in achieving  racial  harmony.  He

replied  that he was impressed by what we had  done,  and

that  very few countries in the world can claim  to  have

people from different racial and religious groups working

at  the  same  place,  studying in the  same  school  and

shopping at the same shopping mall and eating in the same

hawker centre, while at the same time retaining their own

cultures  and  faiths.  I am very glad to  hear  such  an

endorsement from a MNC official.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see churches, temples and mosques located in the

same  housing estate.  How are we going to seek unity  in

diversity?   We cannot force other people to behave  like

us.   We  have to respect the differences of other races.

Singapore  is  not a theocratic state.  It is  a  secular

state.   Our racial and religious harmony is  not  to  be

taken  for  granted.  Hence, we have to  nurture  it  and

consolidate it.  We cannot allow a few religious fanatics

to undermine it in the name of religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect the religious freedom of the various

groups and we respect their religious values.  But things

that   touch  on  national  interest,  such  as  defence,

education and internal security, must be looked  at  from

the perspective of national interest.  On this, I believe

the  various  racial  groups  have  the  same  consensus.

Hence,  we shall all view the White Paper rationally  and

with a mature outlook.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more important is that we have to be

exemplary  in  our behaviour, especially  as  Members  of

Parliament.   We have to try and understand  the  customs

and  religions of other racial groups.  We must also have

good communication skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do people strengthen their psychological defence

and strengthen their confidence?  This is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fight against terrorism should be

undertaken by the Government, we,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>

the  people, should be vigilant at all times and  not  to

harbour  suspicions  against  each  other.   We  have  to

strengthen    the    people's   psychological    defence.

Grassroots  organisations in the  various  constituencies

have  been conducting mutual visits for believers of  the

different  faiths.  Many religious  bodies  such  as  the

Muslim organisations, the Buddhist organisations and  the

Taoist  organisations have also come  together  to  raise

funds  and carry out social welfare work, for the  common

good  of  our  society.  We also  encourage  our  younger

generation to value their own ethnic cultural heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southwest CDC is now actively working on a

fashion  show and a food fair to be participated  by  the

various    racial   groups,   showcasing   the   cultural

development of the various ethnic groups.  Through  these

activities,  it  is  hoped that  there  would  be  better

understanding of the customs and cultures of the  various

ethnic  groups. This is particularly useful and necessary

for  our younger generation of Singaporeans.  The various

religious   groups   should  take   the   initiative   to

communicate with each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have spoken about the moderate faction

among the Muslims. In fact, the concept of moderation  is

not  confined  to  the  Islam  faith  but  to  all  other

religious groups too. Therefore, the nine major religious

groups  in  Singapore should come together to generate  a

common  code of conduct which is acceptable  by  all  the

moderate  followers.  But most of the moderate  followers

are  silent  in  nature. They should come out  and  speak

their  minds  so  as  to  isolate the  few  militant  and

extremist groups.  If the moderate group can enlarge  its

influence, it would be better for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the history of civilisation, we can find many

examples  of  religions  being  naturalised.   These  are

Buddhism  in  Thailand and Japan,  Islam  in  China,  and

Hinduism  in  Bali, where they have integrated  with  the

native  cultures.  The four main racial groups  and  nine

major  religions in Singapore must try to  adapt  to  our

local  circumstances and forge a distinctive multi-racial

culture.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people have different views on this issue,

but the views must be presented and discussed frankly and

openly. I suggest that grassroots organisations, and even

the  schools, should hold discussions on the White Paper.

Our  National Education channel should be used to educate

the  public  on the significance of the White  Paper,  so

that  they can have a better understanding of this  issue

and rebuild their confidence.  This will help to build up

confidence and mutual respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of Singapore do we want? Our ultimate

object  is  to build up a secular and democratic  society

based  on  meritocracy, regardless of race,  language  or

religion.  This is my aspiration for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will

take the Chair again at 3.25 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I stand here today in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, yesterday and earlier today, heard several

references to the threat by the JI as being a new threat.

But,  actually, it is not new at all.  If we really think

about  it, there are very few things under the sun  which

are  new.   The ideological basis and the means  and  the

dimension might be new, but not the threat in itself.  If

we  listen to the voice of Singapore's history,  we  will

actually  hear  a very loud echo of what  we  are  facing

today.   Let  me  just  take  Members  back  to  life  in

September 1964, ie, about a year and a half after  I  was

born,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>

and probably before many people in Singapore were born.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the headline in the Straits Times of 22nd

July 1964:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore curfew after clashes. The Acting Prime

Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, made an appeal for calm  in  a

broadcast  tonight  on  the  clashes  which  occurred  in

Singapore, to which 74 people were killed and  about  178

injured, leading to the imposition of a curfew from  9.30

pm to 6.00 am.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quoted Mr Lee Kuan Yew at that time saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each one of us shares a responsibility in keeping

the situation here sane and rational."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbance had actually occurred during a mammoth

procession  which started from the Padang where,  earlier

in  the  afternoon, about 25,000 Muslims had gathered  to

commemorate  the birthday of the Prophet.   The  incident

which started the clashes was not immediately known,  but

scattered incidents were reported as the main body of the

procession moved eastward towards Geylang.  A  series  of

incidents  then  occurred near Lorong  3,  Geylang,  just

opposite the Gay World, where ice-water and other  stalls

were overturned.  Fighting broke out between stallholders

who  grouped  together and retaliated.  The  police  were

called out in force, and the entire area from Arab Street

to Changi Road was cordoned off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John Jacobs, the President of the then Malayan

Indian Congress, said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this time, when we are threatened by external

forces,  the  people of Malaysia should  be  united.   We

should  remain  calm and do what is necessary  to  create

understanding and mutual trust."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the Straits Times of 25th July

1964 reported:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First Peace or Goodwill Committee was set up and

their  aim  was  to make effective arrangements  for  the

mutual  protection  of residents regardless  of  race  to

prevent unruly elements from outside the area to come  in

and  stir  up trouble or communal hatred and  to  impress

upon   each  race  living  in  the  area  the  need   for

restraining their own irresponsible members from creating

agitation and communal misunderstandings."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Singapore's Deputy Premier, Dr Toh

Chin Chye, and three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>

Ministers  set  out to meet leaders in  their  respective

constituencies  with  the common purpose,  which  was  to

instill in people the urgency of maintaining inter-racial

religious  harmony  in an inter-racial  society  and  the

dangers  of  allowing rumours to disrupt  the  peace  and

harmony  in  the  State.  By 27th July 1964,  there  were

Peace or Goodwill Committees in all 51 constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers also reported something else. They

reported  that  some Chinese shopkeepers had  refused  to

extend  credit to Malay customers, and some  hawkers  had

refused to sell to them at all.  Steps were then taken to

have  the  Chinese  Chamber of  Commerce  and  the  other

Chambers  of Commerce to step in.  At the same time,  the

CCCs  -  there  were CCCs back then - together  with  the

kampong penghulus and ketuas did a good job of easing the

tension and fear caused between neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also reported on 27th July 1964 when Mr Lee

Kuan  Yew  was  speaking  at an  Extraordinary  Delegates

Conference  of  the Singapore NTUC, he  called  upon  the

people  to keep down extremists who may emerge  from  any

racial  group in the State.  He warned that if  this  was

not  done, then the extremist elements would also  emerge

from  other groups.  And he said to the unions - make  an

effort  in  your union in the next few days to renew  the

faith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation slowly stabilised until it flared up

again  in  September 1964, and the Straits Times headline

of  5th September 1964 read as follows:  "8 Dead, 60 Hurt

In  New  Rioting - Singapore A Danger Zone."  A state  of

danger  had  been  proclaimed  in  Singapore  where   the

casualty toll in 48 hours of sporadic Indonesian-inspired

clashes  was given as 8 killed and 60 injured.  A  curfew

was  imposed  and, over the next few days,  more  arrests

were made.  A few days later, the Central Government  had

swooped  down  on the ringleaders of the Indonesian  plot

and  they slowly restored order.  Eventually, as we know,

these problems were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>

stamped out and we moved into an era of racial harmony in

the 1970s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point that I wanted to make was the very

interesting  historical parallels.  Then, as  now,  there

were  foreign  elements instigating our local  people  to

cause  strife  and enmity.  Then, as now,  the  favourite

means were violent means.  Then, as now, there was racial

tension because the Malays felt after the event that they

were  being  discriminated against, and the  others  felt

that  they were upset with them.  And then, as now, there

were  peace and goodwill committees.  Now, we  call  them

IRCCs,  but the basic purpose and function is  the  same.

Then, as now, there was the call to be rational, tolerant

and  understanding and a call to reach out and bridge the

gap  and heal the hurt.  And, very importantly, then,  as

now, the objective of the foreign elements was the same - it was all about gaining political power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we have to understand about terrorism is

that it is a form of war.  Anyone who studies the history

of  war  will be familiar with the work of Clausewitz  on

war.   And he defined war as "An act of violence intended

to  compel our opponents to fulfil their will."  And this

is exactly what the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Al-Qaeda are

trying to do.  They are trying to use violence as a means

to  compel  us to fulfil their will.  And what  is  their

will?   To  create a Daulah Islamiyah in the  region  and

they  have  to  do it through violent means because  they

cannot  do  it through democratic means.  And  they  know

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not fall into the trap of thinking

that  the  JI's  cause  is about religion.   It  is  not.

Ultimately,  their  objective is political.   It  is  all

about   gaining  political  power,  and  they   have   no

hesitation in using and misusing religion in order to  do

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might say that was a very interesting history

lesson,  but what was the point of that?  The points,  or

what  we  can  draw  from the historical  parallels,  are

these.   One, we have faced this threat before.  Two,  we

have  overcome it before.  Three, we can overcome it now.

And from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>

our  experience in the past, we have the key  to  dealing

with the present.  When you actually look at what we  did

in  the past, you will see that what the White Paper  has

set  out  does  contain the basic  points  that  will  be

necessary to deal with this present threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that we have done, and that is what

the White Paper is about, is exposure.  Anything which is

good,  anything  which is wholesome,  anything  which  is

right  can stand up to public scrutiny and can  stand  up

when you shine a light on it.  And that is what the White

Paper purports to do.  It sets out the activities of  the

JI  to show everybody and to expose them so that we  know

exactly  what they are, what they are about,  what  their

objectives are, so that we can deal with them.  The White

Paper  is not about Muslims in general.  It is about  the

extremist elements and how every Singaporean, Muslim  and

non-Muslim alike, can cope with the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of the White Paper, obviously, is

how do we counter the threat.  And there are three things

identified there, which are extremely important.   First,

enhancing   security  measures;  second,   policing   the

terrorists   and   extremist  ideologies;   and,   third,

strengthening social cohesion and religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the first one, enhancing security measures is

obviously  the  role  of  the  Government  and   security

agencies, and I think we can leave this safely  in  their

hands.  The second, the policing of ideology is something

which I believe is best done by the Muslim community  and

their leaders.  The only thing that the non-Muslims would

have to do, obviously, is to be vigilant and to look  out

for  things  which  may seem suspicious  and  inform  the

authorities.  But it is the third strand of our  strategy

in  dealing  with  this threat that is very  important  - strengthening  social  cohesion  and  religious  harmony.

This  is  the one task that we cannot delegate to anybody

else.   This  is  the responsibility of  each  and  every

Singaporean.  As it was in 1964, so it is now.  It is not

the task of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>

Government, it is not the task of the MPs, CCCs, IRCCs or

grassroots  leaders alone.  It is the  responsibility  of

every taxi driver, every hawker, auntie, uncle, pak chik,

mak  chik,  lawyer, doctor, engineer, secretary,  student

and   factory  worker.   It  is  the  responsibility   of

everyone, whether you live in a condominium, a  HDB  flat

or   landed  property,  the  responsibility  of  everyone

sitting in this Chamber, up in the Gallery and who  walks

on   the  streets  of  Singapore  outside.   It  is  your

responsibility and mine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how do we do this? The funny thing is that the

complex  is  often achieved by the simple.  The  simplest

thing to do is to look at the points of contacts that  we

have with people and other races, and that is not just at

grassroots  activities.  That is our everyday life,  when

we  go about our jobs, when we go about interacting  with

people.  It is the small things that matter.  Do we  take

the  time  and  trouble to wish our neighbours  of  other

races  and  religion, or do we just walk  past  them  and

ignore them?  If you are an Indian or Malay, do you pause

at Chinese New Year to wish your Chinese friends?  If you

are a Chinese, do you pause at Deepavali or Hari Raya  to

wish your Indian and Malay friends?  Are you a parent who

does  not  let your children play with children of  other

races?   When  your  children reach perhaps  the  teenage

level, do you tell them that they cannot have a boyfriend

or a girlfriend of other races?  It is the little, little

things like that.  Because they all impact on the way  we

think and act and behave towards somebody else.  So  that

is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, it is important as well. It

is important to reach out and I will just give an example

of something which happened in my constituency.  For Hari

Raya,  the  Buddhist Lodge, which is in  our  area,  very

kindly  offered to contribute the sum of  $10,000  to  be

used  as ang pows or to buy things for the poor and needy

Muslim Malay citizens in our constituency for Hari  Raya.

It  was given with sincerity and goodwill.  When the  ang

pows and the goodies were distributed, they were received

with appreciation.  And it is things like that which help

bridge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>

the gap.  So every Singaporean can contribute in part  to

this strategy of dealing with the JI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing which, of course, has

surfaced in the course of the debate in the past few days

-  the  concern of the Malay/Muslims that they  might  be

associated with the JI and blamed for what the  JI  tried

to do. If you think about it, this is not so distant from

back  in  1964  when the Malays were then concerned  that

they  were discriminated against.  At that time,  it  was

about   the   extension  of  credit  and  the   sale   of

necessities.   Today, in this environment,  it  is  about

fear  of  not being able to get jobs.  This is where  the

employers  can step in.  How you treat your  Malay/Muslim

employees will make a big difference in the way that they

react  to you.  As a non-Malay and non-Muslim MP, I would

have  this to say to the Malay/Muslims in Singapore.   We

do not blame you for the acts of the JI members.  We know

that you did not do anything wrong, and it is unfortunate

that as a result of a few misguided people, the spotlight

is  on  you  and your community.  You have to  understand

that  obviously  some  people of other  races  will  have

concern  - that is normal.  But I think I can safely  say

that  I,  and  I think every other MP in this  House  and

community  leaders, regard you as one  of  us.   We  will

stand  for  you and ensure that you are not discriminated

against.   But  in turn, we ask that you stand  with  us.

Stand  with us against the JI and against the extremists.

Stand with us in making sure that Singapore is kept  safe

and  whole,  because it is your home  as  well  as  ours.

Stand  with  us in making sure that our way of  life  and

freedom is preserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if I might just take the liberty to

translate into two sentences what I have just said  "kami

akan   bediri   bersama  kamu,  dan  akan  sedaya   upaya

memastikan   yang   masyarakat  tidak   akan   menghadapi

diskriminasi".  I stand together with you to ensure  that

the  Malays will not be discriminated.  We also want  the

Malay  community to stand together with  us,  with  other

races, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>

defend  the country, our beloved country, from the threat

of the JI and the extremists.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>







<div align="center"><b>THREAT OF TERRORISM</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I rise in

support  of  the  motion moved by the Minister  for  Home

Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper documents in detail the

seriousness of the threat posed by terrorism to the peace

and security of Singapore.  That the terrorist threat  is

real and present is highlighted by many recent events  in

the  region.   The  Bali bomb blast  and  the  subsequent

arrests  of the personalities involved confirmed  earlier

information  and  intelligence  that  many  were  key  JI

leaders  and operatives.  The discovery of bombs, weapons

and   ammunitions  in  the  Philippines,   Malaysia   and

Indonesia, showed that the JI movement and its associated

ideological  partners are operating in  the  vicinity  of

Singapore's security perimeters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confirmation of information that the JI

attempted to purchase 21 tons of ammonium nitrate  to  be

used  as  truck  bombs  in  Singapore  worries  everyone.

Further  confirmation  that  some  of  the  Singapore  JI

members  had gone to Afghanistan, Mindanao and  Indonesia

for  military  training  and  were  ready  to  serve   as

operatives to sabotage action in Singapore is a  poignant

reminder how lethal they are and how close they  came  to

carrying  out their plans.  We also know that many  local

sites  were  carefully selected for destruction  of  both

lives and properties.  They were surveyed and matters had

progressed to the planning stage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further confirmation that two of the Singapore JI

members  had  hands-on  experience  in  bombing  civilian

targets  as  shown in their participation  of  the  Batam

bombings  on  Christmas eve in 2000 is another  important

factor  that is very worrying.  With some key JI  leaders

like  Hambali,  Malaysian JI member Azahari  Hussain  and

Singapore JI member Mat Salamat are on their run and have

yet to be apprehended is also a cause for concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also many sleeper cells lying low and can

be activated when required, as shown repeatedly by recent

arrests in Indonesia and the Philippines.  In fact,  what

is  clear is that because the heat is on, many have  gone

underground in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is estimated that many of these JI

members and their ideological partners are to be found in

some  of  the  pesantren  in Indonesia, so much  so  that

among the pesantren members, there is a feeling that what

JI  members  and the ideological partners  have  done  is

right and not wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of what I have stated, I support

the  strong  action taken by the Government  against  the

Jemaah  Islamiyah group and other militant and  extremist

groups   in  the  region.   I  also  support   the   many

recommendations put forth in the White Paper in the three

areas.  Let me now focus on the three areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, enhancing security measures. It is clear

that the Al-Qaeda and its affiliated regional associates,

like  the  JI, KMM, MMI, Laskar Jihad, have well educated

and   intelligent  leaders  and  members  who  understand

Government  terrorist counter-measures,  and  accordingly

target soft targets to achieve their goals.  They pose  a

real  challenge to the security forces in the  region  by

adopting  asymmetrical warfare as their  modus  operandi.

In  the aftermath of September 11, they have shown  their

creative  side by targeting new targets in novel  ways  - explosives   in  shoes  in  an  aircraft,  surface-to-air

missiles in Kenya, suicide boat bombs off Yemen, car and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>

suicide  bombs in Bali and many more.  Stocks of ammonium

nitrate  discovered in Philippines and Indonesia  clearly

show  that  the  preparatory materials for terrorism  are

always in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these show that the terrorists we are dealing

are  on  a class of their own.  Our security forces  have

shown that they can deal with any class of terrorists and

deter  them  with  our  counter  terrorist  efforts   and

measures.  I thank our security forces and their services

for a job well done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our security agencies must continue to address the

security challenges thrown up by this new terrorism  that

is   facing   us.   The  creation  of  the   Home   Front

Coordinating Committee to oversee the terrorist threat is

a  welcome  move.   Greater inter-agency cooperation  and

devotion of more resources are needed to check the threat

in its formative stage.  No doubt, many of these security

measures  will entail inconveniences and loss of  privacy

to  many, but it is a price to pay for a safe and  secure

homeland.   We  must  also  continue  with  regional  and

international efforts and share intelligence  to  cripple

the terrorist movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the comprehensive range of

measures  taken to counter terrorism will help  to  deter

terrorist acts in Singapore.  Tighter border controls  at

the  airport, causeways and ferry terminals entail  great

inconvenience, but we must accept these as the  necessary

price  for  a secure homeland.  Of course, at  times,  we

have   misinformed   and   mischievous   politicians   in

neighbouring countries who make frivolous and  scandalous

allegations  when  we  conduct such searches  within  our

territory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean must not think that the Government

will  take  care of the problem and go about  their  life

complacently.  As responsible citizens and  residents  of

Singapore, all of us must be vigilant and alert and be on

the  lookout  for matters which arouse our suspicion  and

alert the authorities.  I am confident that collectively,

Singapore  can  overcome the challenge of  the  terrorist

threat.  But that was only the hardware part.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the software part, which is

the  second  topic, policing the spread of terrorism  and

extremist ideology.  Sir, the method adopted by the JI is

that they start out as legitimate religious teachers  and

only  later isolate the vulnerable ones and recruit  them

as  cell  members.  The method of recruitment of   JI  in

Singapore  is  well explained in the  White  Paper.   One

cannot  also overlook the excellent details furnished  on

such recruitment practices which are contained in the ICG

report  dated 11th December 2002 on "How the JI Terrorist

Network Operates".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI method of recruiting from an internal process

within the Muslim community does pose a challenge for the

Muslim  community in what measures they should  adopt  to

nip the problem in the bud.  The JI leaders exploited the

trust  and  respect that members of the Muslim  community

traditionally accord to religious teachers and  scholars.

And  this is something which is also common in many other

religions.   The  foreign terrorists also  exploited  the

deeply  felt sense of Islamic brotherhood among  Muslims.

The  important factor that stands out is the  involvement

of  foreign  religious teachers.  They stayed  away  from

mainstream  religious activities and kept to  themselves.

They also had a code of secrecy and they took an oath  of

personal allegiance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of Political Islam and the extreme

manifestation  of Wahabism in the world are  issues  that

need  to be addressed within the Muslim community.  To  a

casual  observer, one cannot deny that there are  changes

that  have  occurred in our Muslim community.  To  assert

that  one has become pious and is now a true Muslim is  a

simple  overt answer to thwart a deeper understanding  of

our Muslim friend's complex make-up today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Barry Desker in an article entitled "Islam and

Society in South East Asia After September 11", published

in the Australian Journal of International Affairs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>

recently, summed it up crisply by stating that "there  is

struggle  for the soul of Islam within the global  Muslim

community  today".   He states that  "the  small  Islamic

monarchy  of  Brunei and the significant Muslim  minority

populations  in Thailand, the Philippines  and  Singapore

are  influenced  by  trends  and  developments  affecting

Muslims  in  Malaysia  and Indonesia".   He  cites  "that

Islamisation race in Malaysia has resulted in the Islamic

discourse  domain being dominated by conservative  ulamas

and  advocates of Wahabi austerity".  The tidal  wave  of

influence  from  our  neighbouring  countries  has   made

inroads  into our Muslim community.  Where do we go  from

here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the call made in the White Paper for

greater cooperation of the Muslim community and the wider

community of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened to note that both the Malay/Muslim

MPs  and  the Malay/ Muslim organisations, together  with

the  Malay/Muslim  religious leaders, have  come  out  to

condemn the JI and its extremist agenda.  I support their

call that non-Muslims play a critical role by getting  to

know  better  their  Muslim  neighbours,  workmates   and

classmates.   I am equally inspired that MPs  have  urged

the   community  to  contribute  in  the  mainstream  and

actively  reach out to other Singaporeans  to  strengthen

understanding and trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that MUIS has taken upon itself the task

of    regulating   Islamic   religious   education    and

development.   The  online registration  system  and  the

formal  accreditation  system  are  moves  in  the  right

direction.  I am confident that this measure will  go  to

some  measure in tackling the spread of extremist Islamic

teachers and teachings and help identify deviant teachers

and teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot deny that it is not an easy task to build

consensus within the Muslim community in the light of the

fact  that  just  like  many other religions,  there  are

different    schools    of    thought    and    differing

interpretations of the holy text.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the issue facing the Muslim community in

the  area  of  religious teaching and the  regulation  of

Islamic  teachers was raised in an article by  a  Straits

Times journalist, Mr Marfoot Simon, on 12th January 2003.

He stated some of the difficulties:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was difficult to look out for individuals

like Ibrahim Maidin as it is not easy to distinguish them

at the registration stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the power to require the asatizah

(religious  teachers) to register does not  exist  within

the  power  of  MUIS  and  also that  MUIS  has  no  real

authority to monitor and take the necessary action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) He highlighted the weakness of MUIS in not

having control over madrasahs or even their curriculum  - save  for  one  madrasah.  He also  raised  the  question

whether  the same fate will befall a MUIS-led  regulatory

framework for religious education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is perhaps timely to see whether we need to

strengthen   the   hand  of  MUIS  by  making   necessary

legislative  changes  and also  consider  other  ways  to

empower  MUIS  and  the other relevant  organisations  to

ensure  that  deviant teachers and deviant teachings  are

always in check.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that the Muslim community has its

own  set of problems and priorities to sort out just like

all the other communities.  If there is one thing that is

clear,  it  is that all in the Muslim community,  whether

they are individuals or organisations, must work together

and  overcome the problem and challenge boldly.  If  they

are  unable to do so, there would come a time when  there

will  be  a call for the state to get involved to  police

religious teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are religious deviants and religious

extremists to be found in all religions.  History is full

of  them.  They will claim divine and exclusive right  to

interpret  their  religions.  Tackling them  is  no  easy

task.  But not tackling them will only allow bigger  harm

to befall the wider community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, the White Paper has starkly

projected the challenge that all religious communities in

Singapore  will face at some stage of their  development.

It  is  a  matter that I hope all religious  leaders  and

groups  will take heed and pay attention.  If  necessary,

they  should also build safeguards and monitor  religious

teachers and preachers in their own communities  so  that

problems like the JI and extremist religious teachings do

not surface among their flock in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the third topic, which is

strengthening social cohesion and religious harmony.  The

vast majority of Singapore Muslims are moderate, tolerant

and  law-abiding, and they do not support the actions  of

the  Muslim  militants.  The setting up of the  IRCC  and

Harmony Circles can help in building better understanding

and  trust among the various communities.  I believe that

it  is essential that all communities assess how they can

create better bonding and better interaction between  all

races in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an increasing number who think that

Singaporeans  from the various races are not  interacting

enough,  although the official statistics show otherwise.

Many  are too polite to discuss the matter openly as they

consider it a sensitive matter.  If such a trend is  true

indeed,  then I think all the communities have  to  share

the blame for perpetuation of this negative trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good starting point is to ask some pertinent

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are we truly interacting with people of other

races?   Do  we harbour prejudices and do we  pass  these

prejudices to our children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do the different communities, as a whole,

encourage interaction and an attitude of give and take or

have we become too rigid?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Do the minority communities sincerely try to

accommodate  the  desires  of  the  majority   community?

Does the majority community, in turn, sincerely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>

encourage  the  same?  Or is it a case of each  community

only desiring engagement on their terms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the public domain, have we put sufficient

effort   to  ensure  that  there  is  no  room  for   all

communities to participate and develop true bonds?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Have some of our community's attitude changed

to  the  extent that it is a futile effort  to  turn  the

clock?   Is  the religious and racial divide a  temporary

divide or is it a permanent divide?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we address these issues

squarely as the answers to these questions will determine

what  kind of society we will evolve into and whether  we

are  going to encourage more radicals or even terrorists,

be it a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or a Buddhist one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked a good Muslim friend what causes many of our

Muslim  friends  to look to the Middle  East  and  absorb

Middle  Eastern  cultures, traditions and even  dressing.

His  simple answer was that for the Malay Muslims,  there

is  no  history  in  Singapore beyond the  period  before

Raffles.   It  is a sore point among the Malays  but  one

that sometimes we overlook.  They want to identify with a

rich  and  proud  tradition.   They want their  own  rich

heritage  to  identify with.  The Middle East  offers  an

alternative  to them.  But that package also  comes  with

its  own idiosyncrasies and others like Arabism and  Arab

political  views, etc.  But I saw the pride in my  Muslim

friends  when heritage centres like the Lieutenant  Adnan

Centre was opened at Pasir Panjang Hill.  They need  more

such  icons  and  symbols and rich heritage  to  identify

with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member, Mr K. Shanmugam, highlighted a

few more reasons for the prevailing self-esteem among the

Malays.  These are subtle matters which are not discussed

openly.   But  the problems are there.  We must  identify

the  pull  and  push factors that are prevailing  in  the

Muslim  community and take the necessary steps.   Perhaps

we can focus on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>

these and work with them and help resolve them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an MP, I try very hard to get the various

communities  to  mingle  and bond.   To  community  event

organisers,  I emphasise the importance of having  multi-racial  programmes,  multi-racial participation,  and  to

have programmes in the language that all Singaporeans can

understand.  Despite this, I am aware that many community

organisations  overlook the same.  Just  last  month,  my

sister bought many tickets for her family for a RC  block

party  near her home.  Imagine, to her disdain,  all  the

organisers had was karaoke singing in one language.  I am

quite  sure that there are many more culprits out  there.

What  they do not realise is that first impression counts

for them.  If increasingly community organisations ignore

participation by all communities, then many will withdraw

to their own communities and that will not augur well for

our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am equally heartened that there are gems in

our  midst who are shining examples of those who help and

work   with  different  communities.   The  four  Chinese

gentlemen  who  contributed  to  help  the  JI   members'

families  are  one,  and  this  was  highlighted  by  the

Minister  yesterday.   I was also heartened  to  see  the

Buddhist  Lodge  volunteers helping out during  Thaipusam

last week.  There are many more fine examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is equally important for the minority

communities to be engaged and to participate actively  in

community  events.   Stay away  at  your  own  peril  for

history  shows  the  necessity  for  interaction  by  the

minorities.  The majority can live without the  minority,

but the minority cannot do the same.  So I would like  to

call  on all communities to come forth and work together.

Let us strengthen the Singapore Team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, the

White  Paper  on  the Jemaah Islamiyah  Arrests  and  the

Threat of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>

Terrorism  brings into focus several issues,  which  have

dominated  much  of  the  past  year,  both  locally  and

internationally.   Since  9/11,  there  has   been   much

discussion  about  the  threat  of  global  terrorism  by

extremist  Muslim groups, and the need for more  moderate

voices  within  the Muslim world.  To  some  extent,  the

discussion has also centred on the faith itself.  Being a

Muslim  and  believing  in Islam became  the  subject  of

intense  scrutiny  and,  in  some  instances,  even   the

receiving end of hatred and violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests in Singapore of a group plotting violent

terror  and  with links to other terrorist  groups,  both

regionally  and internationally, brought home a  chilling

reality,  which all Singaporeans hitherto could not  have

imagined: that there are Singaporeans who are prepared to

sacrifice innocent lives for their cause.  For the Muslim

community   in   Singapore,  this  is  an  entirely   new

phenomenon  - the group's total disdain for the  sanctity

of  human  life  is totally unfamiliar to the  community.

Nonetheless, this new phenomenon brought undue  attention

to  the Muslim community here in Singapore.  For the non-Muslim community, it was a test of their trust and  faith

in  fellow Muslim Singaporeans.  It was a difficult  time

for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have the White Paper - a report that puts

into perspective these issues and provides enough clarity

about the JI group and the threat of global terrorism  to

establish a rational basis for all Singaporeans  to  move

on with their lives.  The Paper has correctly defined the

threat of terrorism as a national problem, which must  be

tackled by all Singaporeans.  The Paper has also made  it

clear that the JI ideology and its exclusivist tendencies

and  millenarian orientation is but the belief of a small

group  of  Muslims  in Singapore.   The  Paper  has  also

outlined  steps to be taken by all groups and  Government

agencies to tackle the threat of terrorism.  In  view  of

this,  is  it possible for us now to go back to the  pre-9/11  and  pre-JI  arrests days?   Things  cannot  remain

unchanged.  What has happened cannot be erased.  Negative

impacts will take time to be addressed, or removed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I am encouraged by the strong consensus

shown  in this House and by the public in general on  the

need  to unite against the terrorist threat. There  is  a

strong  determination by everyone not to let  this  issue

sow suspicion and destroy the bonds between Singaporeans.

There  is  a recognition that greater security challenges

are  a given in the foreseeable future.  There is a valid

concern that the security threat is one, which also poses

a  challenge to social harmony.  What will be critical is

how  Singaporeans  pull together to overcome  these  twin

challenges, so that we become more resilient as a people,

and come out stronger and more cohesive as a nation.

<br><br><i>Response of the Malay/Muslim community</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim community and religious leaders are

united in their determination to tackle these challenges.

The  responses of the various Malay/Muslim organisations,

such  as  MUIS,  Mendaki, Pergas,  Perdaus,  and  various

community  leaders  to the White Paper  again  underscore

this commitment.  We want to play a constructive role  in

this important effort of building trust and strengthening

ties across all groups in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for the House to know that the

Malay/Muslim community had embarked on this process  long

before  the  appearance of the White Paper.   During  the

past  two  years  or  so,  Muslim community  leaders  and

institutions have come together to work on measures  that

will   strengthen   Islamic   religious   education   and

development  in Singapore.  The Muslim Religious  Council

of Singapore (MUIS) has initiated a variety of programmes

to  strengthen both the full-time and part-time  madrasah

systems,  and to train and upgrade the skills of  Islamic

religious  teachers in Singapore so that they  understand

the  context in which they operate.  MUIS has also sought

to  organise  public  seminars for both  the  public  and

community leaders on issues of importance, and to  invite

non-Muslim Singaporeans to visit our mosques.   MUIS  has

formed a committee with other Malay/

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>

Muslim  organisations  to  study  ways  to  improve   the

training  of local religious teachers.  These are  but  a

few  examples  of  the efforts that are already  underway

within the Malay/Muslim community.

<br><br><i>What more will be done?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other measures are also being considered. We will

strengthen the safeguards against adverse influences from

outside Singapore.  There is already a vetting system for

foreign   speakers.   We  will  also  leverage  on,   and

strengthen   information   sharing   among   Malay/Muslim

organisations  and  mosques so that we  can  more  easily

detect  activities  that are out of  the  ordinary.   The

White Paper has helped in educating the public on how  to

recognise  potentially  untoward activities.   MUIS  will

provide  guidance to students in selecting  the  overseas

institutions in which to pursue religious education.   It

will also undertake pre-departure programmes and keep  in

touch with the students while they are overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, other than adopting a defensive

approach,   we   want  to  strengthen  our   own   Muslim

community's  religious education system, not  only  as  a

safeguard  against deviant teaching, but also to  support

the holistic development of the Muslim community.

<br><br><i>Strengthening   of  part-time  religious  education   for

children and adults</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong and vibrant part-time religious

education   system  within  the  Malay/Muslim  community.

Almost  every  mosque  in Singapore provides  classes  in

religious  instruction  for  both  children  and  adults.

There  is also a thriving private sector market  in  this

area.   Given the extensive reach of this system,  it  is

important  that we pay close attention to it.  MUIS  will

set  up  a Religious Education Advisory Panel.  And  this

panel will make use of a collaborative approach that will

bring  together all stakeholders, and seeks out the views

of parents, teachers, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>

students   on  religious  education.   The  comprehensive

review  will  look  into  the  appropriate  content   and

teaching  methods relevant to different  age  groups,  as

well  as  training for our teachers.  It will  also  look

into enhancing the quality of the network of teachers and

institutions providing religious education.

<br><br><i>Developing asatizah and enhancing their role</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim religious teacher, or asatizah, holds a

respected  place in the Muslim community.   Many  Muslims

can  recall  fondly  a teacher who has  made  a  positive

impact  on  his/her  life and values.   This  respect  is

something the teacher earns through continuously learning

and being able to address the concerns of the students of

today.  We want to systematically enable our asatizah  to

enhance  their  knowledge and exposure.  MUIS  will  work

closely with relevant Malay/Muslim organisations to  look

into  their  professional  development  and  recognition.

Currently, MUIS has platforms to engage religious leaders

and  teachers to discuss professional issues, as well  as

generate  new  ideas  for programmes.   MUIS  also  gives

scholarships  to  assist individuals to pursue  religious

education  at  reputable institutions of learning.   MUIS

will   build  on  existing  initiatives  and  develop   a

structured training and development framework.  This  can

then  form  the  foundation  for  the  consideration  and

development  of other measures, such as the accreditation

of  our religious teachers.  To help point the public  to

qualified teachers, MUIS will work to maintain an updated

and comprehensive database for their reference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of the above initiatives are components of

the  comprehensive  regulatory  system  that  the  Muslim

community  is putting together as proposed by  the  White

Paper.  With time and greater experience in managing  the

various  aspects  of the system, MUIS  will  be  able  to

provide  more precise guidance to Muslim Singaporeans  on

their religious education needs, either independently  or

in collaboration with other Malay/Muslim organisations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, Mr Ravindran, noted the issue of

the  credibility  of  MUIS in the  eyes  of  Malay/Muslim

Singaporeans.    I   think  it  is  important   for   the

Malay/Muslim community to give their support and  respect

to  MUIS.   As the highest religious body in  the  Muslim

community  in  Singapore, Muslims have  a  duty  to  work

together  with  MUIS  to  build  it  into  a  strong  and

responsive organisation.  I would also urge our religious

leaders  to  work  closely with MUIS  in  our  effort  to

strengthen Islamic religious education in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Building Social Cohesion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building social cohesion is an issue for all

Singaporeans,  not  just the Muslim  community.   The  JI

security  challenge has been a test of  our  cohesiveness

and  resilience  as a people.  Although the  issue  is  a

difficult  one, it is good that the Muslim community  has

not  withdrawn into itself, but actively reached  out  to

others  - and built bridges across communities.   At  the

same  time,  non-Muslims should understand that  communal

worship is an integral part of Muslims' lives, and should

not  view  this as Muslims `retreating to the mosque'  at

the expense of social interaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that other communities have not stood and

looked on as bystanders or commentators, but have made  a

sincere effort to better understand and reach out to  the

Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need that understanding and trust not just at the

level  of  the  community  leadership  but  also  at  the

grassroots level.  Community leaders have a critical role

in  modelling  the  attitudes and  actions  that  promote

community bonding.  As leaders, they can also help dispel

misperceptions, prejudices and encourage members in their

groups  to interact socially with people in other  ethnic

communities.   The IRCC is one important  platform  where

these  initiatives are taking place.  But  the  principle

applies  to  all  social environments  such  as  schools,

workplaces,  and community clubs.  While  the  Government

and community can provide platforms

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>

and facilitate social bonding, Members of this House have

rightly pointed out that individual Singaporeans have  to

make the effort to interact and understand one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out by the White Paper, there is no

quick  solution  to  counter  the  threat  of  terrorism.

Groups,  like the JI, took a long time to form and  morph

and  can exist in our midst without anyone knowing  about

it.   Similarly, building cohesion and trust is  a  long-term  process  requiring  every  one,  Muslims  and  non-

Muslims,  to stay focused on the real issues.   The  real

challenge  for  us  here, in Singapore,  is  to  build  a

climate where extreme views will not take root.  We  must

create  an  environment that is conducive  to  a  healthy

development  of  every  one's faith  and  belief  in  the

context of a multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parliamentary Malay/Muslim colleagues and I are

committed  to this process.  We had started a process  of

consultation   with   the  Malay/Muslim   community   and

religious  leaders long before the attacks  on  the  twin

towers and the JI arrests.  The process will now continue

with a sharper focus on what needs to be done within  our

community.   I  recently met a group of such  leaders  to

share  with them my views on the White Paper and  what  I

intend to say today.  I found the process useful and will

continue  to consult community and religious  leaders  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my discussions with many Malays from all

walks  of  life in the past year or so, I heard  concerns

about  jobs and livelihood, as well as how the  community

was  being  put under the spotlight.  These are  concerns

that  the Government, community and business sectors  are

addressing.  However, the Malays certainly did  not  view

the  Singapore system as being stacked against them.  Nor

did  they  think  that  the  community  is  marginalised.

Indeed,  this view is borne out by objective measures  of

the  community's progress in education, income and social

and  material  well-being.  Our own  Prime  Minister  has

given us the data of the past 10 years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>

achievement  of  the Malay/Muslim community.   The  Malay

community  has  seen  successful individuals  in  diverse

fields   in  line  with  the  overall  progress  of   the

community.   Over time, we will see more of  them.   With

greater  interaction between Muslims and  non-Muslims  at

all  levels  and  more  visible  examples  of  Malays  in

leadership,  we  will strengthen the mutual  respect  and

understanding between our various communities  and  build

on  the cohesion that we have achieved in the last  three

decades.

<br><br><i>Finding the Common Ground</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community has gone through an

entire  year of discussions, dialogues, meetings,  cross-cultural  sessions and many other forms of trust building

efforts.   The  community wants to move  on.   While  the

White  Paper has been well received by most Singaporeans,

I  understand why some in the Malay/Muslim community feel

uneasy  about being in the spotlight again and they  want

to move on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is useful for us to reflect exactly on

what  moving on means in the context of what is happening

around  us.   Moving on does not mean  ignoring  and  not

dealing  with  the  JI  incident  and  its  implications.

Moving  on  requires understanding what  the  issues  and

challenges  are all about and what needs to  be  done  in

order to avoid a similar incident in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For non-Muslim Singaporeans, Sir, I hope they do not

view  the White Paper as proof of a fundamental  flaw  in

the  Malay/Muslim  community.   Muslim  Singaporeans  are

equally  shocked  at the emergence of a  terrorist  group

within  our midst.  We did not create this group.   Most,

if  not  all, of us are saddened that there exist  within

the  community  people who are prepared to use  violence,

even towards fellow Muslims, to further their own goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the need to move on and the need for

concrete action to prevent the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>

emergence of terrorist or extremist groups, lies a common

ground where all Singaporeans should converge.  And  that

is  to understand this global phenomenon correctly and to

see  that  it  affects  all of us,  irrespective  of  our

religious or ethnic backgrounds.

<br><br><i>Understanding this global phenomenon</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any religious group, as pointed out by Mr

Ravindran,  there  can emerge, and have  emerged,  groups

that  are  prepared to be different and, in  some  cases,

even  pursue a path of violence to achieve their  vision.

Martin  E.  Marty and R. Scott Appleby are editors  of  a

five-volume  work  on the study of fundamentalism.  These

studies  have noted that fundamentalists share a tendency

to  separate  from  fellow believers,  and  to  establish

strict   boundaries  between  insiders   and   outsiders.

Fundamentalists also define the opposition  as  including

both  non-believers and believers who do not share  their

views.   While  the term "fundamentalist"  is  frequently

associated  in the popular press with Muslim  extremists,

fundamentalist  thinking  can  exist  in  any   religious

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fundamentalist groups, like the JI, who

see  the  modern  world as offering no future  for  them.

They manifest this as a struggle between their vision  of

how  society  is  to  be  organised  against  models   of

societies  developed in the West.  These groups  perceive

secular  nationalism  as  a Western  construct  that  has

failed  to address their concerns.  This struggle,  which

is  ideological in nature, has been termed by one  author

as  a  conflict of the "ideologies of order".   One  side

maintains that secular nationalism is the glue  that  can

bind  groups  into  a coherent nation,  while  the  other

insists  that  it must be religion.  And  true  to  their

fundamentalist traits, their vision harks back to a  past

which they deemed glorious and perfect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve their vision, these groups are

prepared to use violence.  In their minds, they  see  the

world dominated by Western ideals and which holds nothing

for them.  Hence the need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>

destroy  in  order to build something  new.   People  who

believed   that  all  symbols  of  the  West  should   be

destroyed, carried out the 9/11 attacks and the Bali bomb

blasts.   And that in doing so, their own death serves  a

perceived  so-called  higher  purpose.   This   form   of

revolutionary violence has been noted by some writers  as

being similar to the way in which revolutionary socialism

and  violent anarchism have seduced young Westerners into

terrorism in a previous generation.

<br><br><i>The JI and Terror</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we juxtapose all of the above against what the

White Paper has described to us about the JI, we will see

a    picture    emerging   reflecting    the    so-called

fundamentalist  mindset.  The JI is  an  exclusive  group

that mistakenly believed that they had found the path  to

salvation.   Those  who  do not share  their  belief  are

considered as "unbelievers", a demarcation that in  their

mind  legitimises  the use of violence against  everyone,

including Muslims.  Their vision of a Daulah Islamiyah or

Islamic state is anchored in the past, with no scope  for

change  or  adaptation,  and no tolerance  of  diversity.

While  not  all fundamentalist groups support  terrorism,

they  indirectly provide the ideological  motivation  for

religiously inspired terrorism.  The JI showed us that it

is  a short step indeed from religious fundamentalism  to

terror.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may all appear academic. But the point I

am  trying  to  make is that both Muslim  and  non-Muslim

Singaporeans  owe  it to themselves  to  understand  this

phenomenon.  This phenomenon is not about Muslims  versus

non-Muslims.   It  is  about  a  particular   orientation

towards life that insists that the modern world offers no

salvation;  it is about returning to an idealised  notion

of  a religious past and accepting a rigid interpretation

of religion as the true path.  It is about justifying the

use  of  violence for this purpose.  We must oppose  this

orientation  towards life; we must believe  there  is  no

inconsistency in being both religious and modern  at  the

same time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Diversity and Tolerance: Best Guard Against Extremism</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community here cannot pretend that

nothing  has  changed in the last 20  years.   The  White

Paper  calls  for  a  comprehensive  system  to  regulate

religious  education within the Muslim community.   This,

as  I  have explained earlier, is being done by  MUIS  in

collaboration with other Malay/Muslim organisations.  But

is  this sufficient to safeguard against the emergence of

groups like the JI?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in the White Paper, Ibrahim Maidin and his

JI  members attended religious classes, like other Muslim

Singaporeans would do.  But slowly, over time, and for  a

select group of members, the JI ideology gets introduced.

Having  taken the oath of allegiance, the JI ideology  of

violence,  hatred and extremism was never  challenged  by

anyone in the group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, as a community, allow intolerant and

extremist  views  and ideas to go unchallenged,  then  we

inadvertently allow such views to take root here.  If  in

response  to a question on how Muslims should  deal  with

banking  interest,  a  foreign Muslim  religious  speaker

tells a crowd in Singapore that they do not need to  live

in   Singapore,  and  we  allow  such  a  comment  to  go

unchecked, then we unwittingly sow the seeds of  conflict

and  fundamentalism.  The response by a foreign religious

speaker  echoes  that  of the local  JI  leader,  Ibrahim

Maidin, who wrote to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar,  on

whether Muslims should all migrate to Afghanistan  as  he

believed then that, under the Taliban, Afghanistan was  a

true  Islamic state.  Both Ibrahim Maidin and the foreign

speaker  reflect the same mind.  And this is the  nub  of

the  problem:  what  we are dealing with  is  a  peculiar

orientation of the mind.  If we allow myopic, extreme and

radical  views to go unchallenged, even if  they  do  not

advocate  violence,  then  we  inadvertently  provide   a

conducive environment for the growth of intolerance and a

rigid fundamentalist orientation to life.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the fundamentalist groups who reject

everything Western without a clear understanding, we find

today  such  thinking permeating the  Muslim  mind  in  a

variety of ways.  Articles and journals that present  the

West  as  the  great evil of modern society  and  present

alternatives, on matters such as politics and  economics,

couched in religious terms as the absolute truth, reflect

the   fundamentalist  traits.   But  these  articles  get

published   while   those   with   a   more   rationalist

interpretation are blocked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge, as has been suggested by several

Muslim  and non-Muslim scholars, is for the moderates  to

speak up.  And I know the term "moderate" is loaded  with

meaning.  But it must be so.  To those who view the world

as  incompatible  with their version  of  religion,  they

would  see people who advocate a multitude of voices  and

interpretations  of  the religion  as  being  the  enemy.

Their insistence on a monolithic interpretation of Islam,

with  no  room  for disagreement, must necessarily  clash

with  those who advocate diversity.  Hence, we see groups

issuing edicts of death to those who advocate a different

view  from them.  We must collectively reject these views

immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best safeguard we can put in place is to allow a

diversity  of views and opinions to emerge.  Muslims  all

over   the  world  will  never  have  disputes   on   the

fundamental principles of Islam, such as the  oneness  of

God,  the  Prophecy of Muhammad, the five daily  prayers,

the  payment of wealth tax, and fasting.  But in the  way

we  order  our  lives,  cherish our women,  organise  our

religious  life,  exist  in  a  multi-religious  society,

educate  our  young, and so on, there can be differences.

Of course, the diversity cannot be unlimited.  Certainly,

if  some  advocate violence as a basis of their struggle,

then  we must all condemn it.  As rightly pointed out  by

several  Muslim  scholars, the proper  interpretation  of

Islam is compatible with democracy and human rights.  And

democracy  is about respect for differences  of  opinions

and  consensus building by the strength of arguments  and

not by the size of your arsenal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The Way Forward - Building the Good Society</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Islam encourages all Muslims to build the good

society.   Elements of the good society include a  system

to  protect weaker members of society, measures to insure

a  corruption-free  environment, the establishment  of  a

safe   and   secure   environment,   the   provision   of

opportunities  for everyone to grow and develop,  a  good

health  care system, and an economic system that promotes

development for all in that society.  Our contribution to

Singapore  must be to help build this good  society.   In

fact,  I  would argue that elements of the  good  society

exist  in  Singapore, and that it is  our  duty  as  good

Muslims and good Singaporeans to protect this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am encouraged by the achievements of Ms

Misnati  Dollah  and Mr Zainul Sarib who  are  among  the

winners  of the National Productivity Award for the  year

2002  in  Singapore.  In their own quiet ways,  they  are

helping  to promote the productivity movement,  which  is

central to an efficient economic system.  They, like many

other Malay/Muslim workers in Singapore, are building the

good  society in Singapore.  Our meritocratic system  has

also  allowed  us  to identify talented  Malays  for  key

appointments  on  the  boards  of  statutory  bodies  and

Government-related agencies.  And we have been doing this

for a very long time, ever since your days as Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Sir.  So, today, we find Malays

on  the  boards  of  organisations, such  as  the  Public

Service Commission, MPA, CAAS, LTA, Science Centre,  MDA,

National  Heritage  Board  and the  Singapore  Management

University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other ways in which Muslims can

contribute to the building of the good society.  The  BBC

reported  last  week on the discovery by a  group  of  US

researchers in the fight against cholera.  Using old sari

material  folded four times as a filter for river  water,

they  found  that  they could cut down the  incidence  of

cholera by half among villagers in Bangladesh.  I  traced

the  report  and found that one of the researchers  is  a

Muslim from Bangladesh who is currently working in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>

Maryland  with  other  non-Muslim  scientists   on   this

project.  I communicated with him, and he told me that he

and  his colleagues have been working for 27 years  in  a

search for a cure for cholera among poor villagers.  As a

Muslim,  Professor Anwar Huq is contributing to the  good

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As various Members of the House have pointed out,

the  current  challenges present a window of  opportunity

for  Singaporeans to stand up to defend  the  society  we

want to preserve and build upon.  Muslims and non-Muslims

in  Singapore  have a role to play in ensuring  that  the

good society prevails.  Apart from the need to reach  out

to  one another and to strengthen our social cohesion and

community  bonding,  it  is  also  necessary  for  us  to

encourage  good  behaviour and  contributions  from  each

other.   By  expanding  our  common  space  through   the

encouragement  of the adoption of healthy common  values,

such  as  the  respect  for diversity,  a  commitment  to

securing peace and harmony for Singapore, a determination

to build a strong economy, a desire to provide assistance

to  the weaker members of society, and to provide a  safe

and  secure  environment,  all Singaporeans  will  surely

contribute  to the good society.  It is by ensuring  that

we  all,  Muslims and non-Muslims, work together  towards

the  common  good  that  we can  ensure  a  peaceful  and

harmonious, cohesive and resilient Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the threat of terrorism is a complex challenge.

Our  efforts  at strengthening our social  cohesion  must

continue  with  renewed vigour and focus.  Everyone  must

understand that he or she has a role to play,  be  it  in

schools,  workplaces, recreational centres, and  even  in

places of worship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also argue that the solution to this

problem lies more in the hands of those with the power to

effect meaningful change.  Those in leadership positions,

in  whichever  organisations or  institutions  that  they

belong  to,  play  a  key  role  in  this  fight  against

terrorism.  If we fail to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>

diagnose  and understand this phenomenon correctly,  then

we   risk  the  well-being  of  our  nation.   Simplistic

analysis  of  the global terrorism threat  and  distorted

views of history and of contemporary Muslim societies and

countries  serve  only to confuse and detract  from  real

understanding.   Fashionable  ideas  of  the   clash   of

different religious communities as the outcome of  modern

history   are  no  different  from  the  views   of   the

fundamentalists  who divide the world into  two  opposing

ethical  communities.   Such ideas  give  fodder  to  the

fundamentalist mind.  We should not give space  for  such

ideas here in Singapore.

When  the  Government  fought  the  Communists  and   the

communalists,  it was the call to, and  support  for,  of

those within the Chinese community who were committed  to

the idea of a modern and multi-racial Singapore, to stand

up  against  such  elements, that  helped  win  the  day.

Similarly, today we should give notice to those  who  are

prepared   to   use  religious  sentiments   to   provoke

resentment  towards the State or any  other  group,  that

they  will suffer the wrath of the people and the  State.

Such  elements  are  destructive to  our  nation-building

effort  and should never be allowed to grow.   Space  and

support  should be given to the progressive  elements  in

the Malay/Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a struggle for the hearts and minds of our

people.  The path of moderation and tolerance is the only

way  for Singapore to survive as a nation.  Terror of any

kind,  and  carried out by any group,  will  bring  great

harm.  We must engender in our people the spirit that  is

constructive towards our nation building effort.  This is

the  spirit that was seen in Whampoa recently when a fire

broke  out  near a lift-landing and a couple was  trapped

inside  the lift.  A Malay family living closest  to  the

lift-landing  rallied  other  neighbours  to  assist  the

couple.  It was the same spirit that drove my late father

and  other  villagers, both Chinese and Malays,  to  form

watch  groups  to  protect our kampong  during  the  1964

riots.   It is this spirit that supports the common  good

that is needed now.

Sir,  I rise in support of the motion in the name of  the

Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore has

travelled   a  long  way.   We  have  witnessed   several

milestones  in  its development as the community  becomes

increasingly  educated and economically  stronger.   Even

though  the  JI  is  not  representative  of  the  Muslim

community in Singapore, their arrests and the threat that

was  posed  sets us back many years, and this saddens  me

tremendously.   While I do not defend  what  took  place,

nevertheless,  a sense of responsibility  arises.   Their

actions have hijacked the community and at the end of the

day, the Muslims cannot help but feel victimised.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.31 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just yesterday, over the radio on the BBC news

programme World Today, there was this gentleman  who  was

lamenting  that the developing and third world  countries

are feeling the impact of uncertainty in security and the

threat  of terrorism.  He claimed that the resources  and

attention  towards  voluntary service organisations  that

operate in these countries are dwindling significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we can see that the victims also include the

impoverished nations of the world.  The world cannot seem

to  run  away from the dollars and cents, and we can  see

the  economic  ramifications of  the  way  the  issue  of

security  threat has been dealt so far.  Let us  honestly

look  at  the state of the world today.  Heads of states,

especially  America,  and numerous  other  countries  and

organisations are spending huge amounts of  resources  in

this  area.  Since funds are limited, then logically  the

equation of opportunity cost arises.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>

threat  of terrorism is real and is being felt  all  over

the world.  The fact that we are spending time and effort

to debate this issue in this Parliament also reflects the

importance  and  urgency of the matter.  Nevertheless,  I

cannot  but  ponder  upon  and calculate  the  amount  of

resources in terms of finance, manpower and time that the

world is dispensing to tackle this issue.  I am not quite

sure  how  one  can  justify pouring  sinful  amounts  of

resources and funds in the area of security threat at the

expense  of  starving  children  and  millions  who   are

jobless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources are being rechanelled and the pinch is

being felt by developing countries that require aid.  Let

us  not  forget  that  the world is still  divided  among

economic   lines.   Though  it  is  important   that   we

understand  how  vital  it is to  tackle  the  threat  of

terrorism,  it is similarly sad that the developed  world

is  now  pre-occupied with this threat, to a  point  that

many  other issues are put in the back-burner.  Thus,  to

put  it  simply,  there are many victims of  the  present

state  of  affairs that was brought about after terrorism

became  a  globalised phenomenon.  Maybe we cannot  blame

the  pre-occupation of the world leaders to minimise  the

threat of terrorism, but we should not expect the goal of

stamping  out terrorists to be a universal goal,  knowing

very well that other equally urgent problems lay upon us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may feel somewhat unsettled with the release of

the  White Paper.  The issues of terrorism and Islam have

received  extensive  coverage  since  the  September   11

attack.  Many Muslims were put on the defensive.  Just as

the  attention wanes with the coming of the new year, the

White Paper surfaces and once again putting the Malays in

Singapore in an uncomfortable spotlight.  This may be the

perception of some but, to them, I say this is  certainly

not  the  case.   The White Paper did precisely  what  it

intended to do, and that is to put the JI issue  and  the

threat  of  terrorism in perspective.  The JI  terrorists

have  been singled out as a deviant group, and  one  that

the majority of Singaporean Muslims completely reject and

denounce.  The White Paper contained information

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>

that needed to be shared with the nation.  It was, indeed

educational, to say the least.  It explained the  arrests

and how the threat was effectively dealt with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, history reveals to us how many

have  committed great crimes against humanity in the name

of  political ideology or belief system.  The  systematic

campaign  of  extermination of  people  carried  by  Nazi

Germany,  the  Cambodian genocide of 1975-79,  Catholics'

and Protestants' troubles in Northern Ireland, Israel and

Arab conflicts in the Middle East and, more recently,  in

East  Timor,  Guatemala, Yugoslavia  and  Rwanda,  having

proven how one can combine extremist ideology with ethnic

animosity  and a diabolical disregard for human  life  to

produce repression, misery and murder on a massive scale.

It  is indeed tragic when something as revered and sacred

as  religion  is  used  as  a scapegoat.   We  have  just

witnessed  how its pure preachings can be manipulated  to

serve one's own hidden agenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JI's heinous plans and the would-be consequences are

harrowing, to say the least, for all Singapore  citizens,

both Muslims and non-Muslims.  The group, though small in

number,   poses  a  national  threat.   The  Malay/Muslim

community  must  take  concrete steps  to  police  itself

against  the spread of terrorists and extremist  ideology

through  religious teachings.  It is clear that the  onus

is  on  every one of us to convince the rest that we  are

not  a  threat.  That we are part and parcel of the  same

community.   We  do not feel that we are exclusive.   But

how do we give off the right signal?  Given the fact that

public  opinion is shaped more by television,  radio  and

film,  than anything else, and sad to say, generally  the

media  shows  negative  images of  Islam,  the  challenge

becomes  more  daunting.   We  must  all  become   active

participants  and  not  mere observers  and  hoping  that

someone  else will do all the work for us.   If  this  is

about defining and projecting a positive identity of  the

community,  then the responsibility rests on all  in  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also highlighted the importance of

preserving harmony with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>

the vast majority of Singapore Muslims who practise their

religion peacefully and are generally law-abiding.   This

category  must not be made to feel awkward or  apologetic

for  being  Muslims, nor made to sacrifice the principles

for  the sake of acceptance.  They have harmed no one and

must  be  given the basic respect any fellow human  being

deserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all that has taken place, let us not lose

sight  of  the grander scheme of things, and that  is  to

continue  building  and  developing  the  skills  of  the

community to face the many challenges ahead of  us.   The

need   to   improve  knowledge-based  skills  and   other

competencies  all  require serious  attention.   We  must

remain  committed  and  focused on  the  bigger  picture.

During an economic downturn, such as the one that we  had

recently,  the lower skilled and lower income groups  are

badly hit.  Statistics have shown that the impact on  the

Malay/Muslim community is quite significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not marginalising the importance of other

issues  pertaining to the community, an urgent  challenge

that   has  far-reaching  consequences  is  the  academic

achievement  and  the  economic  standing  of  the  Malay

community.  The means of a livelihood is critical.  While

we  acknowledge that a growing number has done  well  for

themselves,  the community must realise  that  it  cannot

afford to sit on its laurels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Malay/Muslim community has

made  lots of progress over the past 30 years.  This  was

clearly shown in the recent release of study conducted on

the  progress of the community.  But we still have a long

way to go.  We should put our efforts together to further

improve  the  academic achievements of our students.   We

must  imbibe  in our young the value and the  concept  of

excellence in their daily life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community has benefitted from the system of

meritocracy  and  it  has  made  us  stronger  and   more

resilient.   I believe that we would not have arrived  at

what  we  are  today,  that is being proud  Singaporeans,

standing tall as equal among the other races, if  we  had

accepted tokenism and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>

charity.  Yes, there are more things to achieve.  Yes, we

are still lagging behind in some areas, but we should not

despair.   We  should,  and will continue,  to  work  and

develop  the community and improve the community for  the

good of not only the Malays but for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, there is still a long way to go

in  terms  of creating awareness among the people.   They

must  be  made to see that social mobility is a way  out.

They   must   be   flexible   and   adapt   to   changing

circumstances.   They  must be willing  to  pick  up  new

skills, explore new industries and areas.  The jobs  that

are  typically held by Malays in the production line, for

example,  are  vulnerable to down-sizing when  the  going

gets tough.  The changing paradigm takes time and efforts

must begin now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would sincerely like to thank

the community leaders and religious leaders of the Muslim

community, among others, from MUIS and Pergas,  who  have

come  forward and clearly registered their stand  on  the

issue of terrorism.  They have unanimously spoken against

the  use  of  violence in the name of Islam.   They  have

denounced  this unacceptable tenet.  This will  certainly

allay any fear or anxieties that may still linger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often asked myself this question: where is

the  kampong  spirit of the 60s and 70s that was  earlier

mentioned  by  Dr  Yaacob?  Do  people  smile  easily  in

Singapore?  No, I do not think so.  Do we often hear  the

"thank  you"  and  the "please"?  Just the  other  day  a

foreigner who has been working here for two years related

to  me how many times he bent to pick up a dropped ticket

or  handphone, but never received a thank you, and how he

often  witnessed  an elderly or an expectant  lady  being

made  to  stand  in the MRT train, because  no  seat  was

offered  to  that  individual.   Does  this  sound   very

familiar?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nation progresses, how did something as

fundamental as being a compassionate and kind human being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>

erode?   Often, being rude and cold is mistaken to  being

efficient,  sophisticated  and  successful.   This  is  a

grotesque equation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is success? Bill Clinton profoundly explained

that "Getting what you want is not really success.  Doing

the  right thing with what you have is.  True success  is

about  relating to other people until your time runs  out

on earth.  The most important thing in life is just being

a human being."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we know of Singaporeans who would never

greet their neighbours, even as they share the same lift,

feeling  of suspicion lurks beneath.  Why should  wearing

the  sarong mean asserting one's ethnic roots?  For  fear

of  our  own safety, we so quickly group people according

to visible references, eg, a bearded man or a man wearing

a  turban.  What happens if the next terrorist attack  is

carried  out  by a group of people wearing casual  shirts

and pants?  Do we then have to go around without anything

at all?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us back to the question: do we all need

to  dress  alike to forge mutual respect?   We  recognise

that each Singaporean has the right and the privilege  to

be different.  This is the basis of our humanity.  Let us

not  judge  and jump to conclusions from one's  look  but

rather  by  his or her actions.  I believe the  key  word

here  is  "respect".  Respect for others  does  not  mean

having  to  conform to their belief systems or practices,

but  a  greater  sensitivity and an acceptance  of  these

differences.   In  fact, in the past, we have  celebrated

our  differences and remain one united Singapore.  We can

learn from our past forefathers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to emphasise the

recommendations put forth in the White Paper, and that is

with  psychological strength and mutual respect terrorism

can never take root here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  stand to support the motion by the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs regarding the threat of terrorism.   I

support the statement that it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>

important  for us to accept that the terrorist threat  at

present,  especially from the Jemaah Islamiyah group,  is

real  and we support the actions that have been taken  by

the Government against the group and any other groups  in

this  region  that can pose a threat to the  security  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any doubts on the action taken by the

Government  to  detain the members of the  JI  under  the

Internal Security Act, the Bali bomb incident has  opened

the  eyes  of the people of Singapore that terrorism  can

happen  anywhere, including our country.  I  believe  the

Malay/Muslim community also feels likewise.  If there are

still those from any group in Singapore, especially  from

the  Malay/Muslim  community on  the  JI  threat  towards

national  security and with that the safety of themselves

and  their  own family, I hope they will read  the  White

Paper  which  we  are discussing now.  Read  the  actions

taken by Malaysia and Indonesia to counter terrorism.  In

short, the action taken by the Government is not directed

towards  the  Malay/Muslim community,  and  it  does  not

intend   to  put  the  Malay/Muslim  community   in   the

spotlight.   The reactions of the Malay/Muslim  community

and  religious leaders who are against terrorism  and  JI

have  shown  that the Malay/Muslim community too  desires

peace  in the pursuit of progress together.  However,  we

need  to  discuss  this issue because of the  significant

threat  posed  by this group against the welfare  of  our

community  and  the  survival  of  Singapore,  and   this

includes the Malay/Muslim community as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the extensive and tight security measures

taken by the Government, the community in general has  an

important  role  to play to ensure that  these  terrorist

elements do not take root and expand in Singapore.   This

has  been  suggested by many Members of Parliament  since

yesterday  and  should be undertaken by the  Malay/Muslim

community and the non-Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by Mr Shanmugam, all parties should self-examine the inter-racial and inter-religious ties.

Likewise, the Malay/Muslim community should reassess its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>

internal  relationships,  realign  their  priorities  and

enhance  their  religious practices in  ways  that  could

improve their well-being in this plural society.  To  me,

the proposal for getting Malay/Muslim bodies in Singapore

such  as  MUIS,  MENDAKI and PERGAS to  be  an  important

machinery  to reinforce the community's defences  against

deviant   practices  and  teachings   is   an   important

initiative to avoid potential disaster in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the leaders of the community is to

reach  a consensus on matters which can improve the well-being  of  the Malay/Muslim community and,  at  the  same

time,  to  ensure that Singapore has continued peace  and

progress.   But there are groups who have doubts  on  the

legitimacy of the detention of the JI.  Luckily, they are

small in number.  Community leaders should identify these

groups that could bring confusion to the community and to

correct such views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep introspection should be done by the community

leaders   themselves  with  respect  to   its   religious

practices  and views.  I am attracted by the exchange  of

views  between  PERGAS and the Institute  of  South  East

Asian  Studies  (ISEAS), in what PERGAS feels  as  "views

that will bring about confusion, and could be questioned,

that  could  harm the faith and practices of  the  Muslim

community".   This is in respect of a forum organised  by

ISEAS  recently.  I am not sure what these specific views

raised  by PERGAS that could harm the faith of the Muslim

community are.  If it is true and proven, I think  it  is

important for ISEAS not to repeat it again in the future.

But  if  it is on differences of opinion, I believe  that

the  leaders  of the Malay/Muslim community should  allow

and  discuss  it  in the spirit of introspection  I  have

talked  about.  This discussion should be done among  the

leaders of the Malay/Muslim community themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, in which 90% of its people are

Muslims, the tradition of debating religious matters  has

existed  within acceptable norms.  I suggest we read  the

article  written by our former Singapore's Ambassador  to

Indonesia,  Mr Barry Desker, entitled "Islam and  Society

in South-East

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>

Asia  after 11th September", which was published  in  the

Australian Journal of International Affairs to have  some

idea about the tradition of debate on religious matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this discussion could ensure that the Muslims do

not  see Islamic practices from a narrow perspective  was

discussed in the article.  It reflects tolerance  towards

different views in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the views of the Members of Parliament

and  non-Muslim  leaders who give their  support  to  the

Muslim community here after the September 11 incident and

the  detention  of the JI members.  But I would  like  to

remind  them  to be concerned about the feelings  of  the

Malay/Muslim community.  This is not the time for  us  to

point  fingers  or apportion the blame  on  the  lack  of

participation  from  the  Malay community  on  grassroots

activities.   On the other hand, we should find  ways  to

increase the involvement and participation of all  races,

including the Malay/Muslim community, in our activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also avoid saying that the increased

religiosity  among  the Malay/Muslim community  had  made

them  become more fundamental.  In this respect, I  agree

with  Mr  Sin Boon Ann on the need to practise moderation

among the Muslim community.  In fact, I would like to add

that  moderation should be the practice of all religions.

But it is not right to say that social cohesion cannot be

achieved within the moderate Islamic context if only  the

mosques  here  become  the  focal  point  of  the  Muslim

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, a conservative practice of

religion only cannot lead to an isolationist attitude, it

has  also  not  led  to  the formation  of  transnational

terrorist networks.  What is important for us to do is to

attract more Muslim followers who frequent the mosque  to

come  together  to participate in social activities  that

could  promote  understanding and  solidarity.   In  this

aspect, we should continue to attract all communities  to

interact with one another at the grassroots level.  I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>

addressing  this to all groups because, generally,  those

who   participate  in  social  activities  or  grassroots

activities  are  from the same group of people  who  have

taken part in grassroots activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I agree with Mr Tan Tarn How, the writer

of  the  column  "From  the Gallery",  published  in  the

Straits Times today, that finger-pointing is not the best

thing to do at this moment.  However, I disagree with  Mr

Tan  with  respect  to  self-examination,  which  he  had

written.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan concluded from the speeches of Mr Shanmugam

and  Mr Low Thia Khiang that the JI members who have been

detained   are  from  those  who  felt  they  have   been

discriminated,  that their religion has  been  suppressed

and  they  have  been marginalised.  Mr Tan  raised  more

questions than answers.  But to me, the answer is  clear.

The  members of JI who have been detained are from  those

who  have  a  total and unquestioned obedience  to  their

teachers,  which include the foreign teachers who  taught

them to achieve their goal of setting up an Islamic State

even  if  it has to be done  through violent means  which

they  thought are the teachings of Islam.  This is proven

by  the findings of psychologists who interviewed the  JI

members,  who said that they will be treated as  infidels

if  they  go  against their oath of allegiance  to  their

religious leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their educational level is the cause of their

dissatisfaction, then we could conclude  that  more  than

half of the Singapore population from all communities who

do  not  have the level of education up to the   GCE  `O'

levels  would be seen as potential terrorists.   This  is

because they have the same level of education as half  of

the  members  of  JI  who  are  detained.   Likewise,  if

religious  education  is said to  be  the  cause  of  the

evolvement of the JI members, then it could be  concluded

that  most  Muslim  Singaporeans, who  form  15%  of  the

Singapore population, are also potential terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a right analysis. In fact, it is not

the  reality  here. Most Malays and Muslim  families  are

moderate.  This  is  evident from  the  joint  statements

expressed by the Malay/Muslim community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>

and  religious leaders in Singapore which  oppose  JI  or

terrorism.  These community and religious leaders want to

ensure  that  this spirit of moderation and rejection  of

terrorism  and violence will continue to exist among  the

Malay/Muslim community in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Shanmugam's view regarding the need to

give motivation to the Malay/Muslim community here, which

has  been described as a modified affirmative action,  is

interesting.  I believe this is not what the Malay/Muslim

community  want.  They want to be proud of  the  progress

they  have  made on their own ability in this competitive

society.  I think self-confidence is hard to assess.  But

it  is  important  to  the  pride  and  identity  of  any

community,  including the Malay/Muslim  community.   They

have  progressed  year  by year in  terms  of  education,

occupation, housing, etc.  The Malay/Muslim community has

been  able  to  build modern mosques and  also  propagate

Islam  in  this  plural community.  I  am  confident  the

Malay/Muslim  community will continue  to  progress  with

pride.  They want to be independent and be seen as equals

without  support from the Government.  They will be  able

to achieve more if they practise tolerance and moderation

in  their religious and cultural practices in this plural

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to touch on

instilling  tolerance, solidarity and to have  confidence

in  one another among our students of different races  in

school.   At least three Members - Assoc. Prof. Chin  Tet

Yung,  Mrs  Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Steve Chia - have  talked

about this.  I would like to give my assurances that  the

schools have taught them the best, be it in classrooms as

well  as  in their extra-curricular activities or through

their   academic  curriculum.   There  are   a   lot   of

opportunities   for  our  students  to  interact,   build

friendships, learn to be tolerant and respect one another

through classroom activities, ECA and project work.  This

year,  more  new initiatives will be carried out  in  the

schools  in order to bring about social cohesion.   I  am

proud  that this debate on social cohesion has  given  us

another  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  community   in

Singapore.  But we can achieve it only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>

if  we  are open, moderate and ready to tolerate  without

having to affect our religious practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Opposition Members also give their

support to this White Paper today.  But I found that some

of  them are still trying to gain political mileage.   Of

the  things  that was brought forward by  PERGAS  in  its

press statement, Mr Steve Chia quoted one paragraph,  and

that is, "We are worried that side issues important to  a

particular  group  because of  their  religion,  are  not

receiving due attention."  Mr Chia added, "In particular,

the  Government  should stop questioning the  loyalty  of

Malays  in Singapore."  Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would  like

to  question what had been said by Mr Chia.   He  advised

all  levels  to  concentrate on bigger issues  than  side

issues  which could affect the survival of Singapore  and

their own well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any minority group in any country, the practice

of  moderation in a secular country would guarantee  that

they would be able to practise their religion and culture

without  hindrance.   The  loyalty  of  the  Malay/Muslim

should  not be a question and should not be an  issue  in

our debate today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to state that we would be able

to  achieve  more as a united country, provided  all  the

communities  together  preserve  what  we  have  achieved

today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have

your  permission  to  clarify because  the  Parliamentary

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, you can seek your

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I want to clarify that I was

not  referring to the arrest of JI members for the reason

that  they  might feel discontentment in the society.   I

was  merely raising concerns or feedback that I  received

from  the Muslim community.  For instance, they feel that

there  is  job discrimination against them and that  they

are  not  able to really practise their religion  in  the

fullest way that they want.  Listening

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>

to  the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, are we going to

assume  that  this  discontentment, or  feedback  that  I

received,  is  not  real  and  the  Muslim  community  is

generally  happy with what we are today  and  within  the

setting here?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, we have

debated  many  issues  in this  House.   There  has  been

unhappiness among the general public about bus fare  hike

and increase in prices of essential commodities.  We have

also  talked  about  reactions from minority  communities

over certain issues.  It does not mean that everybody  is

happy all the time.  But it does not mean that people are

really  unhappy about certain issues all  the  time.   We

have  to  be  very  clear about whether  these  are  side

issues, or whether these are integral issues, that affect

the community as a whole.  I think there are issues which

are peripheral and we should continue to put these issues

in  the periphery of our attention.  But if we focus  our

attention on the wrong matters, then we will not be  able

to focus on matters that could enhance cohesion, not just

among  races, but between the people and the  leaders  of

different levels in our society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Mdm Deputy

Speaker.   Does  he  agree  that  in  order  to   enhance

cohesion,  it  does not mean that there are  some  issues

that  should not be focused on?  To him, it may be a side

issue.  But to some members within the community, it  can

be  a  real issue.  So, I was merely raising the  concern

which  was  the feedback that I received.  If  he  thinks

that  it  is of no concern to the community,  I  will  be

surprised.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Before we stray from the motion

and  enter into another debate, I think the clarification

is sufficient.  Mr Seng Han Thong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In

moving  the motion, the Minister for Home Affairs started

off  by saying some people had asked why we released  the

White  Paper. In fact, many had asked why we bothered  to

debate it in Parliament because everyone would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>

support the Government in its anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chinese, the word kong for kong bu zhu yi

(terrorism)  and  the word kong for kong  zi  (Confucius)

sound  alike.  It is terrorism that we are fighting,  not

Confucianism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that terrorism is the most

serious threat to Singapore, after Communism in the 1950s

and   60s.  He  also  referred  to  the  predicament  and

inconveniences suffered by the Chinese-educated  students

in  the  1950s, 60s and 70s when the authority was locked

in a fight with the communists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chinese-educated student in the 1960s, like all

the other Chinese students of that time, I can understand

the feeling of the Malay community now.  At that time, we

were   really  faced  with  pressure  from  society   and

prejudice by the employers.  The only difference  between

then  and  now is that,  at that time, I cannot  remember

the  Government coming forward to urge the public not  to

discriminate against the Chinese-educated.  Although  not

every  Chinese-educated student  was  a  communist,  most

employers would rather err on the side of precaution  and

shut them out for fear of trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the extreme hardship we faced then, we

managed  to  hold out and survived. I have the confidence

that  with  the strong appeal by the Government  and  the

concerted  efforts of Singaporeans, our Malay compatriots

can also overcome the present predicament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, when the Minister was talking about the

inconveniences suffered by the Chinese-educated  at  that

time,  it  stirred up my memory of all those  restriction

orders,  banned books, banned movies, banned songs,  etc.

Bit  by bit, the world map then was being painted red  -- the  Soviet Union was red, China was red, and many  other

countries were turning red. It was feared then  that  the

whole  world was turning red, but it turns out  now  that

the  real world is technicolour. It will not turn totally

green as the terrorists would want it to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present-day terrorism is global and borderless.

In  the past, when technology and transportation were not

so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>

advanced,  the  communists then and  terrorists  now  are

different.  The  communists at that time were  localised,

and  not  cross-bordered. That was why we  had  then  the

Malayan  Communists,   the  Vietnamese  Communists,   the

Indian  Communists, the Burmese Communists,  the  Chinese

Communists   and   so  on.   There  were   no   Singapore

Communists,  because Singapore and Malaya were  one  same

territory at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the new economy, terrorism has been brought to

a  higher  plane by    the development in technology  and

transportation.  They have become global and  borderless.

Otherwise, the JI members would have to take years before

they  could  go  to  Afghanistan and back.  In  the  Tang

Dynasty, when the High Priest Tipitaka went from China to

India to get the sutra, he met with a lot of difficulties

and  danger. If not for his three skilful and resourceful

disciples  who  were  armed with supernatural  power,  he

would not have succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Government's recommendations in the

White Paper for a three-fold counter measures against the

terrorist  threat: (1) Enhancing security  measures;  (2)

Policing  the spread of terrorist and extremist ideology;

and  (3)  Strengthening  social  cohesion  and  religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to present my view on enhancing

security and strengthening unity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In enhancing security, the problem we have is that

the  sense of crisis of our people is not strong  enough.

Let  me  illustrate:  In order to enhance  security,  the

Police  has put up barricade at night-spots to  be  ready

for  all eventualities.   But, we receive complaints from

the  business  community  that this  has  affected  their

business. Some feel that they are being inconvenienced as

parking  was made difficult. No doubt, we want  business,

but  do  they  want  their lives?   We  want  to  counter

terrorism,  and we need also to prevent terrorism.   Only

then can we be safe and sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the SIA's $288 package to Bali

attracted more than 20,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>

people  during  the  school holiday  month.   SIA's  Bali

package  was our show of support for Indonesia.  It  also

served  to  boost  the  outside  world's  confidence   in

Indonesia.   Why did so many people want to go  to  Bali?

Some  people  told me that the most dangerous  place  was

actually the safest place. However, there were only  some

who  thought  that many people went there simply  because

Bali  was  the cheapest destination.  We could visit  the

place, but the question is with what frame of mind do  we

go  there.  In my view, we can visit Bali to support  its

tourism industry, and at the same time to appreciate  the

danger  of terrorism. This is killing two birds with  one

stone. We should not be going there simply because it  is

"cheap, cheap"!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance unity among the various ethnic

groups,   the IRCC and Harmony Circles should place  more

emphasis  on  dispelling the mutual suspicion  among  the

communities. The mutual visits to the places  of  worship

is  just a warming-up exercise.  What we should really do

is  to  cultivate the spirit of comrade-in-arms  to  face

difficulties togther, and not to suspect each other  when

problems arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small debate between the Member for

Hougang  and  Mr  Hawazi.  There was some complaint  that

some   Chinese  employers  persisted  in  employing  only

workers  who  could  speak Mandarin.  From  the  dialogue

sessions  I  conducted for the Feedback Unit, I  observed

that  employers  were  more concerned  with  the  working

capability of the workers during the recruitment  process

than  the colour of their skin.  If the ability to  speak

Mandarin  is a necessity for the job, it would  naturally

become a pre-requisite that the successful applicant must

speak   Mandarin.  As  such,  I  would  urge  our   Malay

compatriots to learn Mandarin as a kind of skill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. I know of a Malay

worker in Koh Brothers Limited, whose father was also  an

employee there. His boss is a Chinese and they get  along

very  well.  The Chinese boss would speak  Malay  to  the

Malay employee,  and the Malay employee would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>

speak to his Chinese boss in Teochew.  I asked him how he

picked  up Teochew and whether it was hard to learn.   He

replied to me in  Teochew, "Tieh gu jiu wei (Listen  more

and  you  will  know)!"  I think we should look  at  this

matter in this light, then there should be no problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is my recent visit to Turkey. I was

visiting  the bazaar  in Istanbul when a shopkeeper  came

up  to  me  and spoke to me smilingly in Mandarin,  "Huan

ying,  huan ying! Qing jin lai canguan (Welcome, welcome.

Please  come in and look around)!  Hen pianyi, hen pianyi

(Very cheap, very cheap)!"  In the past, whenever I  went

overseas,  especially in Europe and the United States,  I

would  be taken as a Japanese, and the shopkeepers  would

greet  me "Irashaimase (Welcome)" in Japanese.  Nowadays,

there are lots of Mainland Chinese tourists visiting Hong

Kong,  European and Asian countries, including Singapore,

and they are big spenders. So now, I am being looked upon

as a Chinese.  These are market forces!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, jobs are hard to come by, and this is due

to  recession, coupled with the fact that many  companies

are  relocating  and  many jobs  were  lost.   Our  Malay

compatriots  have  problem  finding  jobs,  so  have  the

Mandarin-speaking  Chinese compatriots!     This  is  the

problem.   We  should look at the problem in  the  proper

prospective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I suggest we enhance the unity among our

various   ethnic   groups   by   clarifying   all   these

misconceptions  to avoid mutual suspicion  and  mistrust.

That is the important thing to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

I would like to speak in support of the motion from three

aspects, namely, why the need for a White Paper on the JI

threat,  the White Paper itself and what are the  desired

responses to the Singapore society to the White Paper.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having to put the spotlight once again on

the  Muslim  community, I believe it is timely  that  the

White  Paper was released.  I say so because the  various

communities in Singapore have quite different perceptions

regarding  the  JI threat.  This has become  quite  clear

from  the  feedback  received by the Feedback  Unit.   In

particular,  over  the  past  week,  the  Feedback   Unit

conducted  three  dialogue  sessions  with  the   various

communities, specifically on this White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share some of the findings with the House

which,  I believe, are quite representative.  Some people

perceived that the terrorist threat to Singapore at  this

point  in time to be quite minimal as the Government  has

broken the back of the JI organisation and has taken  all

the  necessary precautions.  As a result, they  are  more

than happy to leave it to the Government to deal with the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore as a target for terrorist

attacks,  they  believe that, being a  hard  target,  the

terrorist would choose other easier ones, as demonstrated

by  what happened when the JI carried out the October  12

bombing  in  Bali.  To them, as long as there are  easier

targets around, Singapore will be safe, and will be lower

down the list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other end of the scale, others think that

Singapore, being an icon of modernity and being indeed  a

hard   nut   to  crack,  would  make  it  all  the   more

attractive,  as the psychological impact of a  successful

strike  would  be  all  the  more  greater.   After  all,

terrorism feeds on publicity of the greatest suffering of

human  beings.  The more audacious the target, the higher

the number of casualties, the greater is the value of the

target.  Most Singaporeans feel that the Government has a

handle on the threat and, therefore, they do not need  to

be  personally involved.  Life goes on as per normal.  If

the  Police and ISD do their jobs properly, then  all  is

well.   I  believe the White Paper, by going  into  great

details, will educate those who hold such views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe we are not facing up

to the truth if I do not point

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>

out that from the feedback received by the Feedback Unit,

there  are  segments  in the Muslim  community  who  feel

sympathy for the JI members.  Some even expressed  doubts

about  the  Government's case against the JI.  While  all

Muslims  reject  the violent means advocated  by  the  JI

brotherhood,  many  could not reconcile  with  themselves

that  the JI members are bad Muslims.  Since Muslims  are

taught  from  young to defend themselves  when  they  are

oppressed,  many  Muslims felt that the JI  members  were

just  carrying out their Muslim duties when  they  joined

the JI in the defence of Islam.  Of course, in this case,

they  are not rising to the defence of Islam in Singapore

but   to  the  suffering  of  Muslims  elsewhere  at  the

oppression of the western world.  Hopefully, the  details

of  the  White  Paper would convince these Muslims  that,

indeed,  JI members are misled Muslims and had  been  led

astray by false religious teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to point out to the House,

especially  to Mr K Shanmugam and Mr Low Thia Khiang,  is

that  in  all  the  feedback  collected  from  the  Malay

community, either in open and free dialogue or  anonymous

surveys, no one has asserted that the social and economic

conditions   of   the   Malay  community   in   Singapore

contributed   to  the  increasing  religiosity   of   the

community.  I am, in fact, very disturbed by Mr Tan  Tarn

How's  article  in  the  Straits  Times  which  questions

whether the Government has swept this aspect of the issue

under  the carpet.  Yes, there are pleas from the  Muslim

participants  in the feedback process to accept  them  as

they  are,  as  just another human being.   But,  to  the

credit  of  the Muslim community, they do not  blame  the

society for some of their members being misled into JI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the exchanges between Mr Low Thia

Khiang  and Mr Hawazi Daipi that Mr Low is quite  skilled

in  putting across his point.  He is so skilful  that  he

misled Mr Tan Tarn How in stating in his article that the

occurrence  of  the  JI  could  be  attributed   to   the

political, social and economic factors that may be making

the Muslims behave as they do.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>

I  think  that article is like coming out with an apology

for a murderer.  Instead of asking whether the upbringing

of  the  murderer was at fault, such as whether he  comes

from  a  broken  family, whether his moral education  was

weak, an apology is offered.  The apologist looks for the

presence  of  a  defective gene in his  DNA  make-up,  or

whether  the murderer was basically inclined to  violence

because he grew up in a poor and violent neighbourhood or

he  watched too much violent kungfu movies.  To look  for

an  apology for an individual might give the apologist  a

satisfaction in being a do-gooder.  But to  look  for  an

apology  for the whole community would be to lampoon  the

sweat  and blood put in by the community and to  belittle

the  progress made by the community - in this  case,  the

Malay/Muslim community since Singapore's independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I suggest that we all go and

read  the  booklet titled Progress of the Malay Community

in   Singapore  since  1999  which  carried   the   Prime

Minister's  speech  at  the  Malay/Muslim  Organisations'

Tribute  to  the Prime Minister's 10 Years of Leadership,

dated  21st  January  2001.  In it,  the  Prime  Minister

grabbed  the bull by the horns by answering the question,

"Are the Malay Singaporeans marginalised?" directly.   He

looked  at  the progress made by the Malay  community  in

four  domains: education, occupation, income and  quality

of   life.   In  every  domain,  the  Malays  have   made

substantial and significant progress.  The Prime Minister

also compared the education and economic profiles of  the

Singapore  Malays  with  the Malays  in  Malaysia.   Even

though  it is true that there are more Malay millionaires

and  more Malays holding top positions in the public  and

private  sectors  in  Malaysia,  overall,  the  Singapore

Malays  have fared well compared to the Malaysian Malays.

Since  Singapore  Malays have done equally  well  as  the

Malaysian  Malays, the argument that the Malay  community

is marginalised does not hold water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Ms Indranee Rajah had also touched upon a

comparison  of  then  and now when relating  the  factors

leading to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>

the racial riots in 1964.  She pointed out that there are

many  similarities.  But she neglected to point out  that

between  then  and now, there are also many  differences.

Just  in case hon. Members of the House may be misled  to

believe that history might repeat itself, perhaps we  can

look at the differences between then and now.  Firstly, I

think the difference is that we Singaporeans are in total

charge of our own destiny.  Now, there is the absence  of

racial  enclaves in Singapore through the  HDB's  housing

policy.    Finally,  the  progress  made  by  the   Malay

community, as indicated by the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge this House not to be swayed by

the  arguments  of the apologists in drawing  conclusions

about  the  large number of individuals as complex  as  a

community,  but to look at the cold facts and  figures  - facts  and figures in the booklet I mentioned, and  facts

and figures in the White Paper on the JI terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all these misconceptions and complacency and

doubts, it is indeed appropriate that this White Paper is

released.   If  we  look  at  the  profiles  of  the   JI

detainees, we will find that many of them hold good  jobs

with reasonable incomes and are house-owners.  Those  who

have read the Senior Minister's memoirs would recall  the

episode   of  a  bicycle  owner  carrying  his   precious

possession up to his flat away from harm's way during the

racial  riots  in  1964.  This convinced Senior  Minister

that  a  stakeholder would be a better citizen, since  he

would prefer stability, in order to protect his stake  in

the   nation.   In  this  case,  the  JI  detainees   are

stakeholders, yet they are prepared to give up all for  a

calling.   Perhaps, instead of looking for reasons  which

moved  these  men into joining the JI, from  the  social,

political   and  economic  backgrounds   of   the   whole

community,  maybe,  indeed, it is a simple  case  of  men

looking  for the true meaning of life.  For those  of  us

who are past 50 years of age, I would say that we are all

beginning  to  feel  the cold of  the  grave.   We  stare

mortality  in  the  eye, and have to reconcile  ourselves

with the fact that one of these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>

days  we will die - the strong, powerful, weak or  simple

persons.   Some of us will have to live with  it;  others

would  seek  solace in religion.  I surmise that  the  JI

detainees seek the true meaning of being human and, in so

doing, were misled by the religious teachers.  Those  who

sit  down and read the White Paper with an open mind will

find that this is indeed the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, since its release, the White

Paper  is  of indeed great interest to Singaporeans.   It

seems  to fulfill a need among Singaporeans to know about

the  threat  that prompted the arrests  of  close  to  50

individuals under the ISA.  There was a rush to  buy  the

printed copies, and the number of attempts to access  the

website  hit  an  all-time high.  Unfortunately,  I  have

received feedback that the White Paper is priced at $22 a

copy.  This has made it unaffordable to many in the lower

income  bracket to get a copy.  This led to some  of  the

individuals  raising questions about the  motive  of  the

Government  in  setting  such a high  price.   Since  the

objective of the Government in releasing the White  Paper

must  be  to  disseminate the information  as  widely  as

possible,  it  is fair to set the copy price  as  low  as

possible.   Perhaps the Government could take  this  into

consideration  in pricing future White Papers.   But,  of

course,  the pricing really did not deter those who  were

interested  to  find  out  more about  the  White  Paper,

because the content is widely reported in the newspapers.

Thus,  anyone who is interested in the content will  find

most of the major findings reproduced in the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the content of the White Paper

itself.  Reading through the Paper, one can conclude that

the  knowledge and the expertise within the  Ministry  of

Home Affairs regarding the JI have increased by leaps and

bounds  since December 2001, when the first batch  of  JI

members  was  arrested.   The  White  Paper  paints   the

landscape of globalisation of Islamic fervour originating

from  Saudi  Arabia.   This fervour drives  the  Al-Qaeda

movement  to take on the strongest nation on  earth,  the

United States.  The White Paper also describes the  dream

of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>

Islamic  movement  to  create a  new  pan-Southeast  Asia

state,  Daulah  Islamiyah  Nusantara,  based  on  Islamic

values  and  how the local JI movement is linked  to  the

global   network.   The  analysis  of   the   source   of

revolutionary fervour makes it very clear to  the  reader

that  unless  the  global Islamic revival  subsides,  the

deviant ideology to pursue changes by violent means  will

always   continue   to   influence  Muslims   world-wide.

Singapore  would  be no exception.  We cannot  wish  this

rising tide away, and the world has to learn to live with

it for a long time to come.  As Encik Othman Haron Eusofe

has  said, there is really no quick fix.  It is true that

the  arrests have disrupted the existing network, but the

fundamental motive force driving the fervent  Muslims  to

its cause will remain for a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper details how fire-brand religious

teachers,   like  Ibrahim  Maidin,  identify,  cultivate,

recruit  and  control  the JI members,  using  techniques

bordering   on  mind-control  that  are  reminiscent   of

religious  cults.  The use of oath of allegiance  is  one

such  example.   Once  converted to  the  cause,  the  JI

members  will  stay true to the cause for  a  long  time.

After  all, they truly believe that they are serving  the

purpose  of a higher calling.  I believe that  since  the

first  batch of JI members was detained in December 2001,

few,  if  any, of them, are repentant.  It does  beg  the

question  whether  the authorities have a  rehabilitation

programme  to  return these detainees ultimately  to  the

mainstream  of  Singapore society,  given  the  difficult

tasks ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that the authorities have now a much

more  robust  understanding  of  the  motive  of  the  JI

movement  and  the  modus operandi  on  how  members  are

recruited,  I would say that most Singaporeans  can  rest

easy  to know that counter-measures would be put in place

to  curb the spread of the deviant teachings.  Confidence

of the authorities in these areas has indeed increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, what does this House hope to

achieve in debating this motion?  The Minister, in moving

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>

motion, has touched upon many aspects.  My personal  list

of desired outcomes is as follows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this White Paper has attracted world-wide

attention, in particular, among security agencies in  the

world.  It demonstrates the competencies of our ISD.  The

report  will  serve to reassure the world that  Singapore

has  a  good  grasp of the threat and takes  this  threat

seriously.   We  have the will and the means  to  put  in

place  long-term measures, such as restricting  vehicular

access  to  Jurong Island, despite increasing  costs  and

greater   inconvenience.   This  will  increase  investor

confidence in Singapore despite it being in the midst  of

a turbulent region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second desired outcome is the acceptance that

the  JI  movement  is a low-level, hard-to-detect  secret

organisation  comprising many cells.  Such  organisations

are difficult to infiltrate and difficult to exterminate.

Since  the  threat is a long-term one, we  cannot  depend

entirely  on  the  authorities to eliminate  the  threat.

Every  citizen has a role to play.  Every one of us  must

take  on  the responsibility to eliminate this rogue  DNA

from  our society to prevent the cancer from taking  root

and spreading beyond control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third desired outcome is the need of the Muslim

leaders  to come out loudly to reassure the rest  of  the

community  that the majority of Muslims in  Singapore  do

not  subscribe to the ideology of the JI.   That  Islamic

values  are  consistent with democracy and do not  impose

changes through violent means.  I am glad to note that in

this  House,  most of the Malay MPs who have spoken  have

indeed  done  so.   And it is also true that  the  Muslim

leaders  have in the past repeatedly stepped  forward  to

issue such reassurance.  However, perhaps the message  is

worth  repeating,  so that it could be  driven  into  the

consciousness of the rest of the community.   In  one  of

the  dialogue  sessions, one Muslim  participant  pleaded

with  the group, asking what sort of reassurance  do  the

other  communities need.  She was particularly  disturbed

that   there  were  participants  who  called   for   the

Government to legislate against deviant Islamic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>

teachings.   This motion provides yet another opportunity

for  Muslim leaders to state clearly the condemnation  of

the JI terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to most non-Muslim lay persons that

the  Muslim  community has undertaken  a  self-regulatory

role  to monitor deviant teachings of religious teachers.

If  such  teachings  could be curbed,  the  rank  of  the

potential recruits in the JI would be thinned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth desired outcome is the recognition that

the burden of containing this threat does not rest on the

Muslim  community alone.  As I have said  earlier,  every

one  of  us  has  a  role to play.  At  the  moment,  the

increasing  religiosity  of the  Muslim  community  which

finds expression in more rigid adherence with respect  to

attire,  food and conduct towards the opposite sex,  such

as  not shaking hands, is viewed with some anxiety by the

other  communities.  Instead of greater integration after

so  many  years  of nationhood, this development  in  the

Muslim community seems to lead to greater segregation and

less  interaction.   This need not be  so.   I  think  it

behoves the non-Muslims to develop greater awareness  and

appreciation  of the Islamic culture.  Every  one  of  us

should extend our hands across the racial lines to gain a

better   understanding  of  each  other's   customs   and

religious  practices.  You yourself, Mdm Deputy  Speaker,

and  Mr  K  Shanmugam, both believe that it is  important

that  everyone, in particular, the majority, to take this

step.   We should banish ignorance and eliminate fear  of

the  unknown  through knowledge.  As one Muslim  dialogue

participant  pointed  out,  a stricter  adherence  is  an

indication  of the desire to become a better  Muslim.   A

better Muslim makes for a better member of the community,

a better citizen of the nation.  This cannot be but for a

better Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, prior to the discovery of the JI

movement,  we  all thought that racial harmony  could  be

achieved  through mutual respect and protection  of  each

other's  rights,  as we have done so since  independence.

We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>

were  inclined to leave it to time for a common Singapore

identity to emerge.  There is this faith that we will gel

as   a  nation,  as  a  people,  over  time,  as  if  the

amalgamation process would take place naturally.   It  is

like  managing  the health of our body.  So  long  as  we

provide our body with food and water, the heart will pump

the  blood, the blood will nourish the various organs  so

that the whole body will function well.  The discovery of

the  JI  is akin to the discovery of cancer cells in  our

body.   Left unchecked, the cancer will grow and  spread,

ultimately leading to death.  Active treatment is  called

for,  such  as  surgery,  followed  by  chemotherapy  and

thereafter continuous life-long monitoring and treatment.

Similarly, we no longer can let nature take its course in

managing  the racial harmony and social cohesion  of  our

nation.  The active participation of every stakeholder is

needed.  I agree with Mr K Shanmugam that now is the time

for action so that our children will continue to live  in

peace and harmony in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular situation is forced upon us. We

Singaporeans  must rise to the occasion.  I am  confident

that together we will overcome.

<div align="center"><b>CPR TRAINING FOR CIVIL DEFENCE PERSONNEL</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what are the steps taken to increase the  number

of   civil   defence   trained   people   in   Singapore,

particularly    those    trained   in    Cardio-Pulmonary

Resuscitation (CPR) skills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 20 years, SCDF has worked closely with

various   organisations  and  the  community   to   train

Singaporeans in civil defence (CD) skills, including CPR.

To-date,  more than 260,000 people have been  trained  in

first aid and CPR. In the last 5 years alone, some 70,000

were trained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of SCDF's public education and training

efforts include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Training members of school uniformed groups in

basic CD skills, including CPR;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Educating residents on CD skills through

Community Safety and Security Programmes (CSSPs);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Conducting courses to equip volunteers with the

necessary CD skills;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Conducting CD Awareness Training Programme at

the Fire Stations and Satellite Fire Posts for members of

the public; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Conducting Basic Cardiac Life Support Courses

for members of the public at the Civil Defence Academy to

equip participants with the necessary knowledge on CPR.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCDF has also, over the past 2 years, introduced

new  initiatives to train more Singaporeans in CD skills.

The   CD   Awareness  Training  Programme  is  now   more

accessible  to  the  public as it is  conducted  at  Fire

Stations and Satellite Fire Posts, which are conveniently

located in residential estates. The SCDF has also trained

volunteer  instructors to help train members  from  their

own  community in CD skills. Specifically on CPR  skills,

SCDF  has developed the musical CPR programme where music

is incorporated into the CPR drill to help them learn and

practise their CPR skills in an interesting way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCDF also encourages and supports community-led

efforts  to  train  Singaporeans in  CD  skills.  A  good

example  is  the CPR programme jointly run by  the  Boys'

Brigade,  Alexandra Hospital and Central  Singapore  CDC.

More  than  2,000  people have been  trained  under  this

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more trained CD instructors, training

programmes and community partnerships in place, the  SCDF

is  confident  in  building up the pool  of  Singaporeans

trained in CD skills.

<div align="center"><b>PARK CONNECTORS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development,  in  view of the need to  encourage  healthy

lifestyles among Singaporeans (a) what is the progress in

the  development of park connectors in Singapore; and (b)

whether   his  Ministry  will  consider  expediting   the

development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Park Connector Network (PCN) was initiated

in   1991,  we  have  completed  21  stretches  of   park

connectors,  totaling 51 km. These  park  connectors  are

very  well-utilised by residents for recreation  such  as

jogging and cycling as well as to get to amenities within

the neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of its popularity, NParks is accelerating

the  implementation programme by developing 45 km of park

connectors  over  the  next 3 years.  NParks  targets  to

complete  at least 170 km by 2015. This will help  ensure

that  our parks and open spaces are within easy reach  of

our community.

<div align="center"><b>ABANDONED PETS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) how many pets were abandoned  each  year;

(b)  what  measures  are  being  taken  to  address  this

problem;  and (c) whether his Ministry will  support  the

renting of pets by shops.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority

(AVA)  and  the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty  to

Animals  (SPCA) receive 19,000 dogs and cats.  These  are

abandoned animals and their offspring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animals and Birds Act was amended in July 2002.

An  owner  who abandons his pet without reasonable  cause

may  be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months  or

both.  As it is difficult to catch an owner in the act of

abandoning  his  pet, AVA is studying the feasibility  of

requiring   pets  to  be  micro-chipped   to   facilitate

identification of pets and their owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, AVA inculcates responsible pet ownership

through  its  public education programme such  as  giving

talks  and  exhibitions in schools, libraries and  public

events,  as well as producing educational pamphlets.  AVA

also  enlists  the community's participation  to  control

stray  dogs  and  cats through sterilisation  and  proper

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA does not support the renting of pets as it

compromises the welfare of the animals. An animal that is

rented out constantly faces different environment and new

owners  which cause stress and suffering to  the  animal.

AVA  had  investigated the shop reported in the press  as

offering a rent-a-pet scheme. This shop allows owners  to

exchange  the  animal for another that is  more  suitable

within  a certain time period. The shop has since stopped

using the misleading term "rent".
