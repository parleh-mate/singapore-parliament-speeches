<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on the Prime

Minister's Statement [28th August, 2003].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  concur  with  the Prime Minister's  statement  on  the

urgency to transform our wage and CPF systems so that  we

can save jobs, so that Singapore can continue to shine on

the  world stage, and Singaporeans can enjoy the  desired

standard of living.  But it appears to me that the CPF is

like the Singapore version of a Swiss knife.  It is multi-purpose and has a sharp blade.  A 3% cut in CPF cuts like

a  knife  for the workers, but may not be magical  enough

for  businesses.  Most of all, a CPF cut in  itself  will

not  be  sufficient to give us the competitive edge.   In

fact,  businesses  do  not look at  wage  cost  alone  to

determine  where  to do business.  They  will  study  the

costs and rewards through the four factors of production,

being land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, as well

as  the  ease of doing business and even the  quality  of

life  in  Singapore.   In other words, it  has  to  be  a

holistic  look at our competitiveness, and not just  wage

cost  alone.  Hence, the slew of initiatives unveiled  by

DPM  Lee on Friday, if anything, is a signal to the world

at large that we are prepared to bite the bullet and push

on.   But the question remains: how far and how effective

will these measures be?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year or so, I visited many SMEs and

trade associations to hear their cries.  Four buckets  of

tears  were quickly filled up.  The four buckets are  SME

financing, rental cost, jobs and job applicants, and  red

tapes  and  bureaucracy.  Much has been said about  these

four  buckets of cries in previous debates, and  I  would

choose  to  focus  on  the  last,  being  red  tapes  and

bureaucracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I am delighted at the setting up of the Cut

Waste  Panel announced by DPM.  I applaud the setting  up

of such a brilliant committee and I would like to quote a

few  instances  where  rigidities and  procedures  hinder

businesses.  I spoke with a Mr Renaud Semerdjian, General

Manager  of  Clear Channel (Singapore)  Pte  Ltd.   Clear

Channel is a Fortune 500 company which has invested  $100

million  in  just hardware cost for the bus shelters  and

taxi  stands, and I understand that more investments  are

on  the  way.  In addition, they are committed to  paying

LTA $232 million in rental for the entire contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Renaud reflected to me that up until August this

year,  they were receiving as many as 1,583 invoices  per

month   in  1,583  separate  letters  with  1,583   reply

envelopes from Singapore Power.  Why?  Because they  have

built, to date, 1,584 bus shelters, and each one of  them

is  individually billed.  They spoke with Singapore Power

about  consolidating their bills so that they can receive

one  bill  for  all  the bus shelters in  a  consolidated

account,  so that he does not have to assign a staff  for

the  purpose  of opening envelopes, sticking  stamps  and

sending  them  back.  Unfortunately, Mr Renaud  was  very

disappointed  because  he  had  to  spend  time  engaging

consultants and lawyers to speak with the relevant people

before  this  decision of not allowing  them  to  have  a

consolidated billing was reversed.  I understand that  he

got  positive  news  from Singapore Power  only  on  28th

August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Renaud told me that he was willing to pay six

months of the average total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2990</b></font><br><br>



bill  in  advance, just to cut down on the administrative

hassles.   But  what he also highlighted was  that  if  a

Fortune   500   company   with  financial   muscles   and

substantial investment in Singapore has to go through  18

months  of  negotiations and incur legal  fees  and  huge

administrative  cost,  then what chance  has  an  SME  to

survive  the  bureaucracy and the  procedures?   He  also

pointed  out the opportunity cost forgone for the  entire

process.   The  energy could have been more  productively

used in creating more business opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I was told by some representatives from

the  Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association that  some

of   them   experienced  having  to  apply  for  separate

certificates  for their export to various  countries,  in

particular,  the agriculture and fishery exports  to  the

EU.  I understand that EU does have some requirements but

was  told  that the certificates issued by a neighbouring

country  exporting  to the EU has a much  more  efficient

process and allows many items to be listed within the one

certificate.  I also understand that the cost of  such  a

certificate  is  about four times that  issued  by  other

countries.  They hope that the Government can  look  into

some  ways to help them smoothen this process and  reduce

the cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I have come across some statistics on our

civil service sector.  Perhaps it is time for us to  also

take  a  look  at cutting waste within the civil  service

sector.  From the year 1992 to 2001, I noticed that there

has  been  an  almost 100% increase  in  the  Division  I

officers  over the last 10 years.  In fact,  out  of  the

four  Divisions of our civil service, Division I officers

make up about 40.6% and Division II officers 29.9%, which

means about 70% of our civil servants are in Divisions  I

and  II, whereas Division III, 22.6% and Division IV only

a  mere  7%.  My sense is that it could be that  we  have

outsourced  a  lot  of  the lower ranking  jobs,  thereby

reducing  the  need  for Division  III  and  Division  IV

officers.  Perhaps we have employed more people to  think

and  to  plan  for  us,  and perhaps  teachers  are  also

included in the Division I officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: are we getting too top heavy where

there are too many Generals and not enough soldiers?  How

do  the Generals keep in touch with the heartbeat of  the

heartlanders    and    ordinary    Singaporeans?     Most

importantly,  how  has the quality of the  civil  service

improved  as  they become planners and thinkers,  meaning

top  heavy?  I think our people need to know whether  our

tax dollars are well spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn my focus back to CPF itself. My

hope  is  that  we do not need to revisit the  CPF  issue

again  for the purpose of trimming business costs.  While

the CPF cut may help boost a few businesses, it certainly

means a reduction in retirement nest-egg.  The purpose of

CPF remains that of, first, a retirement nest-egg, then a

housing fund and a medical fund. With the proposed  fine-tuning, Singaporeans will be saving less for their  nest-egg  through CPF.  They are encouraged to do more through

self-help,  such as financial planning.   I  think,  like

entrepreneurship,  Singaporeans would  benefit  from  the

Government's  help to boost consumer financial  literacy.

I  have  spoken on this topic many times.   I  shall  not

repeat too much.  But I would like to point out that even

Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang did not appear  to  understand  the

concept of financial planning, and he linked it to fixing

long-term  CPF  rates  so  that  there  is  certainty  in

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that financial planning is

necessary precisely because there is uncertainty in life.

In  fact,  the purpose of financial planning is  to  help

people realise their financial goals.  And because  goals

are  unlimited,  whereas resources are  limited,  therein

lies  the  need for optimum planning.  And  because  each

route  to  achieving  one's goal is  not  a  smooth  one,

therefore you need to build into the plan shock absorbers

and  do  periodic  plan  reviews to  factor  in  personal

changes, career changes, family changes, economic changes

and  unforeseen circumstances. Any good planner worth his

salt   would   advocate  the  use  of  a  slightly   more

conservative  assumption  and  the  establishment  of  an

emergency fund to take care of events like job loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2992</b></font><br><br>



or  emergency  use of cash, which is why  I  support  the

Prime Minister's statement and advocate using a band  for

flexible CPF contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also mentioned that the changes affect many

Singaporeans'  financial plans.   He  is  only  partially

right.   The  truth is most people do  not  even  have  a

deliberate plan to start with and, therefore, the  urgent

need to educate Singaporeans to help them to become self-reliant.   In addition, I also hope that Mr Low  realises

that  unless  there  is inheritance  money  or  long-term

financial  contributions from friends  and  relatives,  a

person cannot even start planning because, basically,  if

there  is no job, there will be no money, and there  will

be  no meaningful plan.  And this is why the emphasis  is

on cutting business cost, so that the existing businesses

will  stay and more investments can flow in to  help  job

creation.  Let me reiterate that only when there are jobs

can there be meaningful financial plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, with the cut, I am

also  concerned  about the viability of some  workers  in

continuing with some of their own initiatives  that  they

have  already  started.  In the past, when  the  CPF  was

liberalised,  many  workers  invested  their  money  into

financial   products   like  annual   premium   endowment

policies.  These are saving plans that require members to

pay  their  annual  premiums through their  CPF  Ordinary

Account.  The objective is to realise a sizable lump  sum

from  their policies at retirement.  These efforts should

be applauded.  However, with the cut, they may default on

their annual premiums because of fewer dollars going into

their CPF accounts.  If they stop paying, they may suffer

a  substantial loss on these policies.  I would  like  to

point out that these members have prudently set aside the

money  systematically on an annual basis because  of  our

encouragement.   They have planned for  their  retirement

proactively and I think we owe it to them to help them to

fulfil some of their payments.  As such, I advocate  that

we  allow the use of their CPF Special Account to top  up

the differences if they are caught in a bind.  This would

mitigate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2993</b></font><br><br>



their losses and, at the same time, allow them to achieve

their retirement goals and objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many articles have been written about

the  impact  of  the CPF cut.  In today's Straits  Times,

Ernst  &  Young had a report about the group of 50  years

old  and above being the most critically affected.   This

group of people will have less tax sheltered dollars  and

increased tax liability.  My sense is that we do  have  a

vehicle  in  place that could help them, that  being  the

Supplementary  Retirement Scheme (SRS).   The  SRS  is  a

deferred  tax shelter.  Unfortunately, under the  current

regime,  it  is not an attractive instrument.   Hence,  I

hope  that the relevant authorities would relook  at  the

Supplementary  Retirement Scheme  and  fine-tune  it,  to

incentivise people to invest into this scheme to beef  up

their retirement dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the housing fund and the use of Special

Account to top up for any differences.  I am heartened to

hear  that there will be a change of rules to help people

keep the roof over their head.  However, I am mindful  of

the implementation blues.  Here, I would like to quote  a

case of my Punggol North resident, Mr Ang Tock Chye.   Mr

Ang  lost  his job where he commanded a salary  of  about

$1,800  in  the past.  Today, he works in a  supermarket,

taking  home about $800 to feed his family, working  from

<br>10.00 am to 10.00 pm, six days a week. Because of the

reduction in salary, he could not pay his mortgage  loan.

What he did was to write to HDB asking to use his Special

Account  to  pay his instalments.  However, he  was  told

that he had purchased his home after the CPF cut in 1999,

which  meant that the CPF cut in 1999 would already  have

been  factored  into the mortgage loan  calculation.   As

such,  he  was  not eligible for the use of  his  Special

Account  to repay the loan.  In addition, he was  greeted

with  another  letter from HDB titled, "Late  payment  of

charges of mortgage loan instalment".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is where the implementation blues could

set in.  I believe that HDB has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2994</b></font><br><br>



a heart to help, but it has to do more to ensure that its

implementation meets its policy intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for National Development

also mentioned that the additional 0.1% charge (being the

difference  between cost of fund and HDB subsidised  loan

rate)  for  the  loans  issued  under  HDB  is  to  cover

administrative  cost.   I  understand  that   the   total

mortgage  loan outstanding is $64 billion.  At  0.1%  per

annum, it means that the interest cost is $64 million per

annum.  My question is: is that a reasonable sum to cover

the  yearly administrative cost?  Obviously, I would like

HDB  to verify the above figures and also explain why  it

takes $64 million per annum to administer the loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, going back to the final

objective  of CPF, which is that of setting up a  medical

fund,  there is a need for more insurance schemes  to  be

allowed  under Medisave.  The current MediShield policies

and  long-term  disability policies are not  adequate  to

address the range of medical needs, especially if  people

are  to  live  to  100  years old.   It  will  be  almost

impossible  for hard cash savings to catch  up  with  the

cost  of medical needs, given inflation and rising needs.

Hence,  a  good  way  to pass on the cost  would  be  the

pooling  of  risks  via insurance.   I  advocate  a  more

diversified  menu  of  plans carefully  selected  by  the

Government to augment these long-term needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, indeed the CPF cut is a bitter

medicine,  but  it is a necessary though  painful  bitter

medicine.  My sense is Singapore can only continue to  be

competitive  if  the people, the private sector  and  the

Government stay together, and stay as one.  My  sense  is

the  music has not died.  It has perhaps become much more

sombre than before.  But if the three `Ps' - which is the

people,  public and private sector - could stay together,

ie,  whenever  we  hear someone singing to  the  Beatle's

tunes  of  "Help! I need someone", that they are  not  so

self-assured  these  days, I hope we  could,  whether  as

individuals   or   as  Members  of  Parliament   or   the

Government, respond with John



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2995</b></font><br><br>



Lennon's "Stand by me", so that Singapore can continue to

compose  and churn out our own music, and let the  lion's

roar we hear be alive and strong.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the retuning

of  the CPF was a landmark decision.  Unlike past changes

which  primarily  affected the  contribution  rates,  the

present   changes  touch  on  withdrawal   amounts,   the

contribution quantum and how much will be channelled into

the  Special Account.  I must commend the Government  for

its  brevity and honesty in addressing our short-term and

long-term problems openly and rationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people's reaction is mixed. Employers are

naturally  happy and wish they have more.  Employees  are

worried as they have to reorganise their finances and cut

back  their  consumption.  I have received feedback  from

the  public and my grassroots leaders and I do hope  that

the Government can address the issues raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is on wage policy. It is clear that

we have a rigid wage structure in Singapore which becomes

particularly  acute during recessions when wages  do  not

adjust  downwards fast enough.  While the National  Wages

Council has been pushing for the AVC and MVC for the past

few  years, there are few takers in the unionised  sector

and  even  fewer in the non-unionised sector.   In  fact,

MNCs and other businesses find it cumbersome to implement

them.   A one-size-fits-all national wage policy may  not

be  suitable  for our economy which is facing  structural

problems.  Is it the right time to let go of the NWC  and

instead  leave it to employers, unions and  employees  to

work out wage matters?  This may be a better approach  to

wage matters than the Government using a blunt tool, like

the  CPF,  to  macro manage the economy at  the  workers'

expense.   Is  it  the right time to explore  whether  we

could  arrive  at a laissez-faire model,  which  is  more

nimble,  responsive and adaptable to  our  fast  changing

economic environment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on whether it is the right time

to make the CPF changes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2996</b></font><br><br>



With the prospect of the economy recovering in the second

half  of  the year, many have asked whether this  is  the

right  time  to  retune  the CPF,  particularly  the  CPF

contribution  rates.  The reality on the ground  is  that

many companies and firms have already cut the salaries of

workers  over the past few years because of deteriorating

economic  condition.  Some are already working  alternate

days.   The  wage market was working its own  equilibrium

and  determining Singapore's competitiveness.  The latest

CPF  cuts  are  a further cut of workers' salaries.   The

jobs  that  have left Singapore left solely  not  due  to

wages.   Some  of the technologies have become  obsolete.

Some  wanted  to  be close to their MNC customers.   Some

wanted  to be in growing markets.  Some are not convinced

that the small cut in CPF will help keep some of the jobs

from migrating to cheaper labour cost centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the Government's decision to

cap  the  future CPF employer's contribution at a maximum

of  16% is a strong signal that we intend to cap wage and

business  costs,  and  that it will  certainly  help  the

companies to consider staying here.  But as to whether it

will help save costs or businesses to stay here, I am not

convinced.  Perhaps the Government could have provided  a

better  case with more detailed studies rather than  tell

this House that they rely on gut feel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point is on unions. I am truly

impressed  by  the  way our unionists have  come  out  to

support the CPF cuts as measures needed to save jobs  and

create  new  jobs.   My sense is that  some  workers  are

questioning  the  relevance of unions  in  an  era  where

employers  hire and fire at will.  These are tough  times

for  our  union leaders.  I support them for being  frank

and  discussing  the problems with their workers  openly.

But I would like to remind our union leaders that just as

they  support the Government on these CPF cuts, they have

an  equally  important job in getting the  best  for  the

workers when the economy recovers.  I would like to  call

upon   our  unions  to  be  equally  fervent  and  demand

appropriate wages and bonuses when the economy  recovers,

and not let employers off lightly when they make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2997</b></font><br><br>



good profits.  It is important that unionists be seen  to

be  championing workers' rights and fair demands in  good

times  in  as  much  as  they call  on  workers  to  make

sacrifices   during   bad  times.    Workers   are   very

discerning, and how unions represent them will  determine

the  future  of unionism in Singapore.  I sincerely  hope

that  our  unions will get the best deal for our  workers

when the economy turn-around comes about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Singapore companies. Sir, I would like to

urge  Singapore companies locating overseas  or  starting

businesses   overseas  to  see  how  they   can   provide

employment for Singaporeans.  My message to them  is:  do

not  all  of you abandon our Singapore workers.  Many  of

our  workers have worked many years in Singapore and have

valuable  experience.  I am confident that they can  help

pass  on  some of their skills and experience to  foreign

staff.   I  would  like to appeal to these  companies  to

bring  along some of these workers with them and, in  the

process, help reduce unemployment in Singapore.  In doing

this  National Service, I am confident it will  exemplify

these companies as good corporate citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, brain drain. Sir, I would like to ask the

Government as to whether making Singapore a low wage cost

centre   might  make  Singapore  inadvertently   a   less

attractive  place  to  work for expatriates  and,  hence,

drive  them elsewhere.  In the long run, I wonder whether

even  Singaporeans may choose to settle overseas as  they

may  find that the disparity in the wage levels  and  the

cost  of living is more manageable in other countries  as

compared  to Singapore.  We must ensure that  we  do  not

encourage reverse brain drain due to lower wages but high

cost of living.  This brings me to the main issue of cost

of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, businesses can easily choose to migrate to

cheaper cost centres but, unfortunately, Singaporeans are

unable  to.  Some try to save by going to Johor Baru  and

Batam for cheaper shopping, but for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2998</b></font><br><br>



the more daily expenses they are unable to run away from.

I wish the Government could do more to reduce the cost of

living  for  Singapore.  While the consumer  price  index

shows  that  inflation is low, the reality is that  costs

are arbitrarily raised in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. The SGX raised its fees

arbitrarily in Singapore and nobody could object  because

you  either use the SGX or you go somewhere else, because

it  is  a virtual monopoly.  We have many GLCs and  other

businesses  that will claim that business conditions  are

tough and that they are helping their customers.  But yet

they  will  report  $1 billion profits  or  $500  million

profits   when  their  annual  accounts  are   presented.

Perhaps  performance-based and profit-based  remuneration

package  is  making the management of these organisations

ruthless  in  its pursuit of profits at  the  expense  of

ordinary people and businesses.  In fact, the joke  among

professionals  is  that when we deregulate  a  particular

market,  the  price  of  the goods  or  service  goes  up

contrary  to conventional economic theory.   We  seem  to

have a market where deregulation means higher prices  for

consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that we can set up an Anti-monopoly

Commission,  something like the Anti-trust Commission  in

other  countries, that can scrutinise all monopolies  and

oligopolistic market practices and see whether  they  are

colluding  or  charging unreasonable  charges  for  their

goods  and  services.  This commission should also  audit

many of our Government regulators to see whether they are

doing their jobs competently and have the public interest

in  their decisions, and not always give the excuse  that

they  have  to  make  the public service  providers  make

decent returns on investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am glad that the DPM highlighted the case of

the Land Transport Authority reducing the fees for taxis,

I  am  quite sure more can be done by the Government.   I

look forward to the Cut Waste Panel being transparent and

highlighting cases within Government and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2999</b></font><br><br>



statutory  boards  of  wastage and over-charging.   These

cases  will certainly make other organisations take  note

and   work  towards  doing  the  same.   The  inequitable

situation  in Singapore is that Singaporean  workers  can

take  losses  in  their salary cuts  but  public  service

providers can make good profits even in tough times,  and

this  only happens in Singapore.  While I am dissatisfied

with  the  market practice of some of the public  service

providers,  I  do not have kind words for our  own  local

businessmen  who  squeeze  Singaporeans  in  these  tough

times,  and  I  would  just  highlight  an  example.    I

patronised  a  goreng pisang stall in Pasir  Ris  housing

estate.   In the past, they sold three goreng pisang  for

$1.   But  suddenly, last month, they sold  three  goreng

pisang of the same size for $1.50.  I am not going to the

stall again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many businesses in Singapore who are

greedy  and raise prices arbitrarily.  Somehow, my  sense

is  that  these  price increases are not  caught  in  our

Consumer  Price  Index.  In fact, with  the  confirmation

that  GST will be raised next January 2004, we can expect

businesses  to raise prices.  I would like to  appeal  to

businesses in Singapore to help their fellow Singaporeans

to  bring  down  the cost of living, settle  for  smaller

profits,  and not to make life miserable for Singaporeans

by  squeezing them.  Perhaps NTUC FairPrice can take  the

first  step by transferring the CPF savings arising  from

these  CPF  cuts to a 5% discount on all their  products.

That should herald measurable immediate cost savings  for

many Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the relief measures, Sir. While I

am  glad  that the DPM announced some relief measures  to

help   those   affected   by   the   latest   CPF   cuts,

unfortunately, if one takes away the amounts set aside to

help  the  construction  sector and  the  other  specific

programmes,  the amount actually reaching the  worst  hit

people is very minimal.  In fact, in some cases, nothing.

My  middle  income residents have given me feedback  that

the  relief package has very little for them.   They  are

the ones worst affected by these changes.  I do hope that

the middle income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3000</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  will receive some good  news  in  the  next

Budget,  in  terms  of  greater  tax  relief  and   other

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the CPF figures that were provided

yesterday.   Sir,  I would like to seek clarification  on

the  data  that was released by the Acting  Minister  for

Manpower  yesterday as regards the amounts that the  25th

percentile  worker  would have  accumulated  in  his  CPF

accounts.    The withdrawal amounts at age 55  were  also

given.   We  all  know that many workers will  use  their

Medisave  before they reach 55 years of age,  either  for

themselves  or their families.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister how much a worker can withdraw at age 55, if  he

had  used  up  all his Medisave account monies  by  then.

What  percentage  of members would have adequate  Minimum

Sum in this scenario?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on tinkering the CPF scheme. Sir, I would

like  to  ask whether the Government can indicate whether

it  intends  to  stop tinkering with the CPF  system,  or

whether  CPF  would  continue to be  a  regular  tool  of

economic management.  This question is raised as it makes

it  difficult  for Singaporeans to plan  their  financial

future, as the basic premise for their financial planning

is  adjusted by the Government far too regularly.  To  be

candid, I also find it confusing to plan for my long-term

retirement  plans.  Employees above the age of  40  years

are  confused, as regular changes are confusing  them  in

how  they  should  plan for their old age.   Perhaps  the

Government should state that there is a base amount which

will  never be changed and a variable range which can  be

altered.   Can the Government give an assurance that  the

30-36% range would be the final figure?  Or should we  be

looking  at lower figures?  Some clarity would  certainly

help guide our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that the CPF

changes are tough measures, but hard times call for tough

choices.   As a people, we have never failed to  confront

challenges  realistically and squarely.  The way  forward

is to work together - Government, people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3001</b></font><br><br>



businesses - to bring new investments and new  jobs,  and

these  I  am  confident we can achieve.  These short-term

sacrifices  by  our people to make Singapore  competitive

will  certainly  help bring growth  to  our  economy  and

greater prosperity for all in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Government on its

new CPF policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr

Ravindran   has  a  suggestion  for  NTUC  FairPrice   to

consider.   I  will bring the message back to  FairPrice.

May  I  assure  Members of this House that NTUC  and  its

family  of cooperatives are considering measures to  help

those  who  are needy, especially the lower  income,  and

announcements will be made in the course of time.  And  I

can  even  ask  FairPrice to sell goreng  pisang,  if  it

helps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some workers ask: with these CPF changes, how

many jobs will be created?  How many will be saved?  They

are  disappointed that there is no road map for  economic

recovery.  They do not feel secure.  They want to  see  a

plan  that says:  do this to get to point A, then do that

to reach point B, and all will be well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are no precise answers to what

the  CPF  changes will bring.  Technology and  the  world

economy are changing too quickly for anyone to be able to

draw up blueprints that come with a guarantee.  That does

not mean there will be no jobs created or saved.  What it

does  mean  is  that the right economic environment  will

lead  to  the  creation and saving of jobs,  even  though

there  are  no mathematical models to give us  the  exact

numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit like planning to build the bird

sanctuary at Sungei Buloh.  If people asked at that time:

how  many birds will come?  What type of birds will come?

How  long will they stay before they fly away? - then the

bird sanctuary might never have been built.  No one could

have given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3002</b></font><br><br>



those  answers.   But the designers who  understood  bird

migratory  behaviour knew that if we  built  a  sanctuary

with  the  right environment, the birds would come.   And

they did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is it the same with the economy? Get the

economic and investment climate right, and the jobs  will

come.   Precisely what jobs will come, or how  many  will

come?   No one can tell.  But even as we debate  the  CPF

changes in this Chamber, decision makers around the world

would have read about our strong effort to make Singapore

a  good  place  to invest in.  We may not even  know  who

those  investors  are.  The products  and  services  they

might  bring  here may not even have been announced  yet.

But  they  have heard of us and they will make enquiries.

If  we can bring our labour and business costs down to  a

level  that  gives good value for money, more investments

will  come, more jobs will be created and more jobs  will

be saved.  That, we can be confident about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the companies already in Singapore, some are

doing  well.   They do not need the CPF cuts to  survive.

As  Mr Ravindran said just now, they should give some, or

all,  of the savings back to their workers.  The SBF  and

SNEF  have  bluntly dismissed the idea.  But  I  am  glad

that,  since last Thursday, when the Prime Minister  made

the   announcement,   several  companies   have   already

indicated to the union leaders they will share the  gains

with  their employees.  Such enlightened managements  are

to be applauded.  I urge companies that are doing well to

follow their good example in being fair to the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong and other MPs pointed out that one

reason  workers will have low retirement savings is  that

the  rate of return on the CPF savings is low.   In  this

climate of low returns on fixed income instruments, it is

difficult to get higher returns.  Workers should not risk

their hard earned money on high risk investments to  seek

higher  returns.  They may lose much more than  they  can

gain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC will do what we can to help. NTUC has a

savings cooperative, NTUC Thrift.  Its social mission  is

to help workers put aside small sums of money every month

for  a  rainy day.  Since its formation, NTUC Thrift  has

consistently given an interest rate on the small  savings

higher   than  what  the  banks  give  on  their  savings

accounts.  With this renewed impetus to ensure sufficient

retirement savings for our workers, the unions will  work

with  employers and NTUC Thrift to encourage more workers

to open accounts with NTUC Thrift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who wish to give the gains from the CPF

cuts  as  lump sum payments can help the workers  deposit

the  money  into NTUC Thrift accounts.  To the individual

worker,  it  may not seem a large sum at first.   But  if

workers can continue to set aside small sums every  month

and  keep  their  money untouched for long  enough,  NTUC

Thrift will work hard to grow their money at better  than

bank  rates.  In the long run, the money will  be  useful

for   retirement,   or  to  help  cover   a   period   of

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, the rationale and

objectives of the CPF changes have been well explained by

the  Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers.

There is no need for me to further elaborate.  While  the

CPF  system  has been re-tuned with a lower  contribution

rate,  the fundamental objectives of the CPF to meet  the

basic housing, medical and old age needs will continue to

be  preserved.   In other words, the basic social  safety

net for our workers will remain intact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the lower contribution rate, Singapore

workers  need  to  make adjustments  to  their  financial

commitments,  particularly on housing, so that  they  all

could  better manage their needs and expectations.   This

requires a mindset change on the part of CPF members  and

workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Employability of older workers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make reference to the problem faced

by  our  older  workers.   As highlighted  by  the  Prime

Minister,   workers  aged  50  and  above  face   greater

difficulties    in    securing    re-employment     after

retrenchment.  This will be a growing problem because  of

our ageing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers must therefore take skills training

seriously  and continue to upgrade themselves  to  remain

relevant.  But skills alone are not enough.  Due  to  our

seniority-based wage system, our older workers  are  more

expensive than the younger ones doing the same  job.   To

help enhance our older workers' cost competitiveness  and

enable  them  to remain employed, a further reduction  on

the employer's CPF contribution rate for workers aged  50

to  55  is therefore necessary.  This will help to reduce

the  cost burden of employers in retaining older  workers

arising  from  our  seniority-based  wage  system.   Some

workers  may be depending on their full CPF contributions

in  the  Ordinary Account for their mortgage instalments.

They  may  experience shortfall in their monthly mortgage

repayments  as  a  result of the CPF changes.   To  these

workers,  measures  will be put in  place  to  help  them

overcome  their difficulties.  These assistance  measures

have been announced earlier by DPM.



<br><br><i>Phasing out the 50% withdrawal rule</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 42% of active CPF members who have turned

55 are able to set aside the Minimum Sum of $80,000.  The

proportion  of  CPF  members who are  able  to  meet  the

Minimum  Sum requirements is low, partly because  of  the

50%  withdrawal  rule.  Under the rule, CPF  members  can

withdraw  50%  of  their combined  Ordinary  and  Special

Account  balances.  Hence, most members do not set  aside

enough  savings  in  the CPF for their  retirement.   The

revision  of  the  50% withdrawal rule  is  to  help  CPF

members set aside their Minimum Sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some workers may be disappointed by the change in

the 50% withdrawal rule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3005</b></font><br><br>



However,  CPF  members who reach 55 over  the  next  five

years  will  not  be affected.  Even when the  withdrawal

rule  starts to be phased out from 1st January  2009,  it

will  be  done gradually over five years.  Also,  members

will  still  be allowed to withdraw the first $5,000,  or

lesser  amounts,  in their Ordinary and Special  Accounts

when they turn 55.



<br><br><i>Assistance measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that workers understand the need to keep CPF

contributions as low as possible to help companies remain

competitive and preserve jobs.  As assured by PM, DPM and

Ministers,  this  will  be done without  undermining  the

fundamental objectives of meeting the housing, healthcare

and  retirement needs and, indeed, preserving the  social

safety net for our workers.  Changes to the CPF will also

be  introduced gradually and assistance measures will  be

put  in  place to help workers who are affected by  these

changes.   Hence, workers need not be unduly  worried  by

these changes but continue to upgrade themselves so  that

they can continue to be relevant and employable.



<br><br><i>Need to restructure wages apart from CPF changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making changes to the CPF system would be

insufficient  without at the same time pushing  for  wage

restructuring.  Although our wage system is  more  nimble

than before, it is not responsive enough for companies to

closely  link  their wage cost to corporate  performance.

Due   to  our  seniority-based  wage  system,  individual

performance  and  contribution are  also  not  adequately

recognised  and  rewarded.  Changes  should  be  made  to

replace   the   seniority-based  wage   system   with   a

performance-based  wage  system.   With   the   impending

changes  to  the CPF, companies should therefore  quickly

embark  on wage restructuring, so that they could put  in

place a highly responsive wage system to better meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3006</b></font><br><br>



their needs in a rapidly changing business environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help expedite the implementation of a nimble wage

system  which could link rewards closely to  company  and

individual performance, the Ministry of Manpower has  set

up  a  Tripartite Taskforce to study the issues and  make

recommendations.  As  has  been  reported  in  the  House

before,  it is headed by the Permanent Secretary  of  the

Ministry  of Manpower with representatives from employers

and  the  trade unions, and its study is expected  to  be

completed at the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the question raised by the

hon.  Member,  Mr R Ravindran, concerning the  amount  of

money  a worker can expect to withdraw at the age of  55,

if  he  has used up all the money in his Medisave Account

before  reaching 55.  Mr Ravindran is quite  right  that,

based on the table distributed by the Acting Minister for

Manpower  yesterday, the withdrawal amounts  assume  that

the  25th  percentile worker has not touched his Medisave

Account.  This was stated in the footnote below the table

distributed  yesterday.  If the worker uses  up  all  the

money  in  his Medisave Account, then at age 55 he  would

have  nothing to withdraw.  In fact, he would  only  have

accumulated $50,000 for his retirement account and  would

not  have  reached  the $60,000 cash  component  for  the

Minimum  Sum.   The annuity payouts per  month  would  be

correspondingly reduced to $362 from $433 per month.   If

we  assume no transfer from the Medisave Account  to  the

Special Account, then about 76% instead of 80% can  reach

the  Minimum Sum.  This figure may in fact be  lower,  as

many  members  consume all the money  in  their  Medisave

Account  and  then would have to top up the $25,000  from

their   Ordinary  Account  and  Special  Account.   These

numbers reiterate my Minister's point yesterday that  our

CPF  system meets basic requirements for housing, medical

and retirement.  We have not over-provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on some comments made by

Mr Ravindran on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3007</b></font><br><br>



tinkering of the CPF rate.  Members should be aware  that

the  CPF system is an instrument for us to safeguard  our

workers' interests in three main areas: housing,  medical

care, as well as for retirement.  And this instrument has

to  be  guarded very zealously.  But, from time to  time,

when economic and business conditions change, we may need

to  take  a relook at our CPF system to ensure  that  the

long-term  objectives  for our workers,  to  provide  for

their social safety net, will always be safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked whether we should liberalise

the  wage  system  and leave it to  the  unions  and  the

companies to determine wage level.  Sir, we have to  bear

in  mind  that  only 23% of our workers in Singapore  are

unionised.  So, a larger proportion of our workers is not

unionised.   The  tripartite National Wages  Council  is,

therefore,  a very important institution to help  provide

the  guide for determining wage levels.  Indeed, what the

NWC   was   doing  in  the  past  years  was  to  provide

guidelines,  rather  than to give  quantum  increases  or

adjustments to our wages every year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more importantly, as a former official of a

trade  union, it is for us to remember and to  appreciate

the  larger contributions of unions in Singapore.   If  I

can  elaborate on this, beyond negotiating for good wages

and  working  conditions, our unions  are  also  able  to

safeguard the workers' long-term interest.  In a changing

business and economic condition, the three key areas that

I  think most unions and union leaders concern themselves

with remain intact:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Fair wages;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Fair play; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Job security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing business and economic conditions

necessitate  employers as well as unions to look  at  all

these three issues differently.  Yes, we can expect  that

there is no more lifelong employment for most workers, if

not  for all workers.  But, at the same time, despite the

changes in the business and economic conditions, our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3008</b></font><br><br>



unions  are working hard to ensure that some form of  job

security can still be enjoyed by our workers, even though

there would be constant churning in the economy.  So,  we

should  not look at the role of the unions only to  fight

for  the maximum benefits in terms of pay and salary  for

our  workers.   They are doing more than just  that.   In

terms of training, which is to provide the most important

tool  for our workers to be relevant and employable,  our

unions  actually  spearheaded the  birth  of  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  I remember that in  1996,

the  NTUC,  together with unions in Singapore, looked  at

the  issues of structural unemployment in Europe and came

out with the idea of starting the SRP which was taken  up

by  the  Government as a national programme a year  after

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, as mentioned by Mr Matthias

Yao,  our  unions have also been very active  in  helping

manage the cost of living in Singapore.  NTUC's family  - FairPrice, Healthcare and other cooperatives - has helped

Singapore workers stretch their dollar.  And, during  the

difficult  times  in  the  past,  the  union  family   in

Singapore has given away a lot of benefits to our workers

through the cooperatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while Singapore workers feel that their wages

have shrunk and that retrenchments may be looming, it  is

important for us to help them understand that the  unions

have played a very important role in helping them to keep

their  jobs  by agreeing to measures like CPF rate  cuts,

promoting  training and ensuring that fair play  and  job

security continue to be practised in workplaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like also to thank the hon. Member,

Miss  Penny  Low, for her suggestions for more  insurance

schemes, using CPF savings.  I am sure the CPF Board  and

the Ministry of Manpower will look into her suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate

in this debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3009</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first listened to PM's speech on the CPF cuts

last  Thursday,  I  was aghast and  taken  aback  by  the

Government's  intent  on  placing  the  burden  of   high

business  cost  solely  as  the  responsibility  of   our

workers.   This  was very unfair.  I was pretty  troubled

and  upset that our Government likes to slice and squeeze

the  earnings of our workers at the first instance of any

economic trouble.  This is especially so, when PM gave no

announcement of any intent to cut the civil  service  and

his  bloated  Government bureaucracy which,  as  Dr  Marc

Faber   said   recently,  that  the   Republic's   costly

bureaucracy and expensive Government add to the high cost

of doing business here.  This expensive Government places

an  unnecessary heavy burden on the people  of  Singapore

and our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I had prepared a very bitter critique of our

Government  last Thursday night, many of  the  points  of

which  were brought up and very well expressed by Mr  Low

Thia Khiang, the MP for Hougang, on Friday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after listening to DPM Lee's comprehensive

relief  and cost-cutting packages, I must say that  I  am

much  consoled that this Government is not  that  callous

and  unfeeling  to the difficulties and problems  of  our

people.   At the very least, it intends to reach  out  to

the  jobless in our society and teach them how  to  fish.

This  I  am much satisfied, and thankful that the results

of   growing   political  competition  are  pushing   our

Government  to  be  more attentive and sensitive  to  the

feelings  and  aspirations of our  people.   I  therefore

discarded  my original plan for the very biting criticism

of our Government and rewrote this speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now go to my first point.

This  3%  cut in CPF alone will not ensure that Singapore

stays  competitive.  Neither will it bring in  new  jobs.

My  gut feel is that small employers and bosses are going

to  take  the 3% saving on salaries to upgrade their  own

lifestyle and luxuries.  For example, if you are the boss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3010</b></font><br><br>



of a small struggling company with a salary cost of about

$100,000,  a  3% cut in employers' CPF contribution  will

result in a saving of $3,000.  There is nothing much  you

can do with this saving, and chances are that some bosses

will  use this $3,000 windfall to buy a new Mercedes Benz

or  upgrade to first-class seats and hotel rooms when  on

business  travel.  I hope employers will not  abuse  this

sacrifice of the workers for their own consumption gain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this 3% cut will only slow down the exodus of

jobs  to  China  and India.  This is because  the  target

market  of these MNCs is not in this region but in  China

and  India.  Unless Southeast Asia bucks up and  improves

on  its economy and purchasing power as a region, we  are

going to miss out on the investment flows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal is for the Government to spend more

effort and resources to help promote the economies of our

immediate ASEAN neighbours and expedite the establishment

of  a single common ASEAN market.  In this way, when  the

ASEAN economy improves its purchasing power, the tide  of

investment will return to Southeast Asia and we will  all

float higher.  I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry

and   the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  can  be  more

productive in pushing for an earlier date than the stated

2020  for the single market of 530 million people  to  be

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my second point concerns the

investment  return on CPF savings.  The CPF Board  should

seriously  look  into how it can increase the  investment

returns for its members.  Simply buying Government  bonds

at  2.5%  interest and then lending the money to HDB  for

mortgage  loans  is not doing justice to  our  retirement

funds.   CPF  members with money locked in for  the  long

term  should  not  be  forced to do National  Service  by

lending  the money to the Government to lend to  the  HDB

for  its  social  objective at the measly  2.5%  interest

rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Government and the GIC can do

more in this area to provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3011</b></font><br><br>



better  expertise for CPF members.  My suggestion  is  to

consider and encourage the regular investment of the  CPF

money in a group of tracker fund indexes of the developed

and  developing economies around the world.  In this way,

the  investment return is pegged relative to the economic

performance  of the global economy.  And, if the  economy

stagnates, we will not be too far off, and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this point on CPF and HDB mortgage, I feel

that  the  HDB has failed in its duty to source  for  its

best  loans  for its mortgagors recently.  If  commercial

bank mortgage rates for HDB are going at 1% to 1.5%,  how

can  the  HDB be charging its mortgagors 2.6%  and  still

call  it a subsidised rate?  I do not understand.  I feel

that  the  HDB should be more proactive and  be  free  to

source its funds from cheaper lenders (other than the CPF

Board),  especially  if the market provides  lower  rates

than what the Government charges HDB at 2.5%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to my third point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel

that  the Government, the civil service and the statutory

boards  could  still  do  much  to  help  reduce  overall

business  cost.  As freelance journalist, Lee  Han  Shih,

suggested  in an article for the Government  to  cut  its

expenditure by 30%, and which DPM Lee had on Friday  said

absurd, I wonder why!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think DPM owes it to Singaporeans to explain why

it  is  absurd for the Government to cut its  expenditure

and  reduce  the budget by 30%.  If it is not  30%,  then

20%,  and if it is not 20%, at least 10%.  Is it  because

wages   of   civil  servants,  Ministers  and   political

appointees  are sticky and cannot be cut?  Is  Government

too top-heavy and over-staffed?  Why cannot the Ministers

be  given  dual appointments and portfolios like  in  the

past and cut down on the number of Ministers in the Prime

Minister's Office?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table distributed by Mr Lim Boon Heng,

Minister without Portfolio, on Friday, I am surprised  to

see  that Singapore CEOs are earning around slightly over

$200,000 per year.  If that is so, does that mean that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3012</b></font><br><br>



our  Ministers are overpaid and their wages have gone out

of line with market rates?   Has their productivity risen

to  make them wage competitive?  Maybe the Prime Minister

would like to address these concerns in his reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time for the Government to show moral

leadership  and solidarity with the people, by  giving  a

strong signal to investors and citizens alike that it  is

willing  to  cut  down its own fat to help  trim  overall

business  and  living cost.  Just like  a  Straits  Times

Forum  writer  on  Friday said, "I  am  appalled  by  the

excessive  use  of  plasma TVs in the civil  service  and

statutory  boards, and this money saved could go  a  long

way  to  trim  the  excessive expenditure  in  Government

services."   This will be my first proposal for  the  Cut

Waste Panel to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on behalf of many Singaporeans, I want to

express  support  and  thanks to our  new  Acting  Health

Minister,  Mr  Khaw Boon Wan, for cutting  cost  and  the

budget  of the Health Ministry.  I hope the Ministers  in

other Ministries will follow in his footsteps to cut cost

and  budget.  Like he has said, "It can be done."  Please

do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to my last point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I

speak  for  many businessmen, retailers and  Singaporeans

alike in asking the Government to delay the GST hike  for

another year.  I will agree with DPM's argument that  GST

taxes  the rich more than the poor, and that the proposed

1%  increase next year will raise about $650 million  for

the Government in 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what is $650 million to the Government?

It  is  small, like ikan bilis - as what DPM said in  his

Budget  reply  to  me.  A $2.3 billion  deficit  is  tiny

compared to the size of the Singapore economy, and we can

well afford to go for this small fiscal deficit for these

few lean years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the economy recovers, do we believe that

our  economy  will recover?  Does the Government  believe

that we will see more good years after the heavy rain?  I

do,  and I believe when the economy recovers, the  fields

will blossom and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3013</b></font><br><br>



everyone  will  have a good field day.  By  then,  nobody

will  seriously  object  to  the  Government  wanting  to

collect  more in GST to prepare for another rainy season.

And  after giving a good fiscal stimulus to the  economy,

the  Government can expect a bigger catch with the 1% GST

than the current ikan bilis that it is expected to net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I beseech the Government to give more

time for the small ikan bilis to grow bigger.  Do not  be

in  a  haste  to  balance  the  deficit  and  weaken  any

prospects of growth and recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore

expect more substantial policy initiatives from our world-class Ministers than a simple reduction of employer's CPF

contribution.  CPF cuts should only be taken  as  a  last

resort  when all other alternatives have been  considered

and  implemented.  Our people cannot be expected to  take

on  the  low salaries offered in China and India. Neither

can  they be expected to bear the main brunt of any  cost

cutting measures consistently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and GLCs are also required to make

sacrifices by going for deficits and losses in bad years,

hopefully  to recover back in good years.   This  is  the

cycle of life and investing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end off on a brighter note, I would like to urge

all  Singaporeans to look up. The dark clouds  will  pass

because  present-day Singapore has two biggest  resources

that  will see us through any major difficulty, and  that

is,  our  talented people and our huge capital  reserves.

We should not be afraid to seize this opportunity that  a

crisis has brought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  firstly, I would like to thank Members of the House

for  their  suggestions and points made  on  two  of  the

schemes  that  MCDS  is  managing,  that  is,  the   Work

Assistance Programme (WAP) as well as HOPE.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Warren Lee have suggested

that  we  help unemployed Singaporeans to train  for  new

jobs  and  provide them with financial assistance.   Some

Members   have   also  given  encouraging   examples   of

Singaporeans who are determined to find jobs and be self-reliant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon shared her CDC's

experience  and  her  observation that  Singaporeans  are

increasingly  prepared to make the necessary  adjustments

and  to  take up low-income jobs.  NMP Mr Nithiah  Nandan

has  also mentioned some of the examples that he has come

across.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Assistance Programme (WAP) is, in fact,

designed with these resilient Singaporeans in mind.   The

programme,  announced  by DPM Lee last  week,  is  really

aimed  at helping these Singaporeans seek employment  and

transit  quickly back to work.  Financial  assistance  is

only  an  interim measure while our recipients  look  for

jobs under the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAP beneficiaries will receive job placement

services and short-term financial assistance to help them

tide  over this difficult period.  Those who have  tried,

but  are  still unable to secure jobs over a  three-month

period, will be given more personal attention by  a  case

management   officer.    With  this   support   and   the

Singaporean  spirit of self-reliance, we  feel  that  the

majority  of  WAP  recipients  will  find  jobs  and   be

independent within 3-6 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong has proposed that we should do more

to  help  affected  families cope with  their  children's

schooling assistance.  Let me assure him that under  WAP,

provisions  are available to help deserving families  pay

for  schooling  expenses.  This  will  cover  school  and

transport fees and a one-off grant to cover miscellaneous

expenses,  such as uniform as well as textbook  expenses.

There  are  also other sources of help available  in  the

community, for example, the School Pocket Money Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House that the CDCs have

been gearing up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3015</b></font><br><br>



implement the WAP programme from October this year.   The

Government has provided more resources to beef  up  their

employment-related services.  A total of 83 officers will

be  stationed at the CDCs to provide employment services.

53  of these staff are being trained with case management

skills.    They   are  taught  skills   on   motivational

counselling   and  techniques  to  help  the   unemployed

identify barriers and needs.  This training would  enable

the  case  management officers to be  more  effective  in

helping WAP beneficiaries work towards employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the job placement services in the CDCs to

be given a significant boost with these additional staff.

We  are  aware  that apart from financial and  employment

assistance,  some  of  the  families  could  have   other

problems  that need to be addressed, for example,  family

violence, as Mdm Cynthia Phua has pointed out.  The  case

management officer will also look into the needs  of  the

family  and  link  the  family up  with  the  appropriate

agencies,  for example, the Family Service  Centres,  for

assistance and support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs are also fine-tuning their work procedures

to  ensure that all social assistance applicants who  are

fit to work will be referred for job placement services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Singaporeans who have already lost their

jobs  and need help immediately. Between now and October,

they can approach the CDCs for help and advice. Those who

are  assessed to be eligible will be assisted  under  the

existing employment and social assistance schemes  first.

They  will  be  given  short-term  interim  help  and  be

transferred  to  WAP  come 1st October  2003.   Likewise,

Singaporeans who are interested in HOPE can also approach

the CDCs for details.



<br><br><i>Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members also spoke about the Home Ownership

Plus  Education (HOPE) programme.  I would like to  thank

Mr Ahmad Khalis and others who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3016</b></font><br><br>



expressed their support for the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also received feedback, particularly on the

eligibility criteria. Many felt that the criteria  should

be relaxed to allow more low-income families to benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate the objective of

HOPE.   It is designed as an upstream programme to target

young,  low-income families.  The objective is to  enable

their children to get a better headstart in life.  To  do

so, we are encouraging the couples to keep their families

small  so  that they can concentrate their  resources  on

their  children.  The benefits given are  meant  to  help

them  earn a better living, perhaps buy a home, and  keep

their  marriage strong so that they can provide a  stable

and  supportive family environment for their children  to

benefit  from educational opportunities offered to  them.

This  will provide the best chance for these families  to

break out of the negative poverty cycle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMP Mrs Fang Ai Lian commented specifically on the

educational criteria - that a poor family with 4 GCE  'O'

levels  would  not  qualify for  HOPE.    Currently,  the

criterion  is  2  GCE 'O' levels.  The 2 GCE  'O'  levels

criterion  is meant to target couples whose opportunities

for  skills  upgrading are potentially limited  by  their

lack  of  educational qualifications.   The  entry  level

requirement for polytechnic courses as well as higher ITE

Nitec  courses is 3 GCE `O' levels.  Hence, those who  do

not  meet  this  requirement, ie, 2 GCE  `O'  levels  and

below,  are  likely to face difficulties advancing  their

training and education in post-secondary institutions and

therefore need additional help.  That is how we  set  the

criterion at 2 GCE 'O' levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received suggestions to extend HOPE to cover

poor  families  with more than two children  as  well  as

divorcees.   Ms Braema Mathi has also made an appeal  for

HOPE  to  cover single parent families.  I would like  to

reiterate the objectives of HOPE, ie, to encourage  young

couples  to keep their family strong and intact  so  that

the children can grow up in a stable environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policies should not encourage behaviour that

goes against our family values.  Notwithstanding this,  I

agree  with  Ms Braema Mathi that some of these  families

are  genuinely in need and not all can be assisted  under

HOPE  and  WAP.  For example, there are Singaporeans  who

are  unable to work because of old age, illness or  care-giving responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from WAP and HOPE, there are, in fact, many

existing schemes to help people in need.  My Ministry has

compiled a list of social assistance schemes provided  by

the  Government.  I am requesting the Clerk of Parliament

to  distribute the list for Members' reference.   [Copies

of  list  distributed  to Members.]   This  is  just  for

Members'  reference  because many of  these  schemes  are

public information.  Many Members already know about many

of these schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These schemes cater to Singaporeans with different

needs   -  those who require long term assistance,  those

who  need interim help with rental and utilities arrears,

and those who need support with child and student care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi may be pleased to know that single

parent families may be eligible for the interim financial

assistance  scheme,  the  rent and  utilities  assistance

scheme  and the centre-based financial assistance  scheme

for  childcare.  Single mothers who are not ready to seek

employment  due  to  care-giving responsibilities,  could

also be given some short- to medium-term help.  Those who

are  ready to seek work will be placed on WAP.  They will

also receive financial support to place their children in

childcare  centres.  This is to ensure that the  children

are taken care of while the mother may be working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have expressed concern about those who

are not covered by the financial assistance schemes.   Mr

Zainul  Abidin  Rasheed mentioned the middle  income,  Mr

Iswaran highlighted the `sandwiched groups' who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3018</b></font><br><br>



marginally above the income ceiling criteria, and Mdm  Ho

Geok  Choo even referred to those earning between $3,000-$6,000 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We empathise with the struggles of these families

and  recognise  that  they too need help  when  the  main

breadwinner   is   retrenched.    For   this   group   of

Singaporeans, work is still the best form of welfare.  In

the  process  of seeking re-employment, one main  barrier

faced  by  this  group is their expectations.   If  these

Singaporeans   are   prepared  to  make   the   necessary

adjustments  and  moderate their expectations,  and  some

Members of the House have indicated that many of them are

willing to do so, we will do our best to facilitate their

job seeking efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned earlier that the CDCs have beefed

up  their employment service capabilities with more  than

80  additional employment officers.  I believe that  with

this  enhanced capability, we can help more Singaporeans,

including  those from the middle income  group,  to  find

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind the House that the

Government  schemes  are  not the  only  source  of  help

available  to  Singaporeans.   The  CDCs  and  grassroots

organisations have also come up with their own programmes

to  complement the Government schemes.  Singaporeans  who

are  genuinely  in  need can find help  either  from  the

Government or in the community.  This is in line with our

'Many Helping Hands' approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mdm Cynthia Phua have raised

concerns over the increase in fees for sports facilities.

Frankly, I am a little bit surprised because this has not

been formally announced yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) heavily

subsidises  the use of sports facilities.   For  example,

the  average cost of operating the swimming pool is $3.50

per  user, excluding depreciation cost.  But today,  each

adult  pays  only $1.00 per entry with no  limit  on  the

number of hours used.  So, that is a subsidy of $2.50  or

71%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3019</b></font><br><br>



Children and senior citizens pay even less, ie, 50 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy for all the SSC sports facilities

amounts  to approximately $18.8 million a year, excluding

depreciation costs.  This level of subsidy is,  in  fact,

very  high, and is a significant proportion of  the  cash

grant  given by MCDS to SSC, which stands at  about  $117

million  this year.  So, more than 20% goes to  subsidise

sports  facilities.   It is not  right  for  MCDS  to  do

nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the two-phased increase, including the

second   increase  in  July  2004,  SSC  will  still   be

subsidising  some 60% of the total cost of operating  the

sports   facilities.   We  will  formally  announce   the

increase  soon.   But  let  me say  that  even  with  the

increase,  we will still be subsidising 60% of the  total

cost of operating the sports facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC last revised fees and charges for its sports

facilities  in  1997, six years ago.  The  increase  that

time  was  about  10%.  SSC actually considered  revising

fees  in  2000  and  2001.  But on both  occasions,  MCDS

decided  against  it  because of the economic  situation.

Sir, increasing fees is not something that we do lightly.

In  fact, we do it very reluctantly.  Our problem is that

there  is  really no good time to increase fees. However,

if we continue to defer doing so, the quantum of increase

will be greater when we eventually have to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the impact of the fee revision on the

public,  SSC  will be implementing the revisions  in  two

phases.   The  first  phase will  take  effect  from  1st

October  2003  and followed by a second revision  on  1st

July  2004.   The details will be announced in  the  next

few days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will continue to be concession rates for

children, senior citizens and schools.  Furthermore,  SSC

has  introduced stored value cards for the swimming  pool

users   which   will  allow  some  savings  for   regular

customers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option to control costs is to close

facilities  that  are under-utilised.  Mdm  Cynthia  Phua

mentioned  the closure of swimming pools.  In  June  this

year, we closed six swimming pools, including one in  Mdm

Cynthia  Phua's constituency.  We did bring  forward  the

closure  because of SARS which had resulted in  a  severe

drop  in  attendance.  The grassroots organisations  were

notified one month in advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should cut costs and increase

revenues from other sources.  In the past few years,  SSC

has   cut   manpower  costs  by  employing   part-timers,

installing ticketing machines and coin-operated  lockers.

It  has  also reduced utility costs by cutting  down  the

number  of  pumps  running during  the  night  and  using

rainwater for backwash at swimming complexes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has also tried to increase other sources of

revenues  from  its sports facilities,  such  as  renting

parts of the premises to retail shops.  We recognise that

we  may not be enterprising enough and, therefore, we are

open  to explore other ideas to increase revenues.  I  am

happy to explore further with Mr Ong Ah Heng his idea  of

rearing fishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia said that he had

moderated  his  speech  after  listening  to  the  relief

measures that had been announced.  He said that at  least

the Government was aware and was in tune somehow with the

feelings  and aspirations of our people.  Let  me  assure

him  -  he has left  -  that the Government is always  in

touch  and  in tune with the feelings and aspirations  of

our  people.  Otherwise, it would not be possible to come

out with all these well-targeted relief measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that our days ahead are going to

be  brighter.  Our people are united with the Government,

partly  because  we are in touch with  the  feelings  and

aspirations  of the people.  The Government was  able  to

mobilise the whole nation to defeat SARS.  If we talk  to

the workers and the grassroots leaders,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3021</b></font><br><br>



all of them acknowledge that the CPF cut is very painful.

But, on the other hand, all of them understand why it has

to  be done.  Nobody likes to receive less money in their

accounts.  But if it is necessary to preserve jobs,  they

will do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why I said that the days are going to

be  brighter  is, I do agree with Mr Steve Chia  that  we

have  talented people and we have got financial reserves.

After I came to Ministry of Education, I went to NUS  and

NTU  to  visit the laboratories to look at the  R&D  work

that is being done.  They introduced me to many projects.

To  be honest, the projects are so complex that I did not

understand  them.  But I fully understand one thing  that

our  universities told me.  They said  that  top  US  and

European  universities, after looking at their  projects,

have come out with proposals to work together.  To me, it

means three things.  Firstly, our R&D initiatives are  on

the  right  track; secondly, the quality of our  research

workers  is  high;  and,  thirdly,  there  must  be   the

possibility  of breaking through.   Indeed,  with  world-class universities coming in, the probability of breaking

through  will be even greater.  And if there were  to  be

significant breakthroughs, then the investment  that  has

gone into promoting R&D will pay off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago, I went to give away prizes to some JC

students on a programme called the Science Talent Search.

They  presented their proposals and projects.   Again,  I

could not understand.  They are JC students.  I did study

Science  up to "A" level. Yet, I cannot understand  their

projects.  But one thing I heard from the chief judge,  a

young  American  Professor, and he was  very  clear.   He

said, "You ought to be proud of your young people.  These

projects are simply fabulous.  How I wish my chaps  would

also do the same."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have talented young people. These talented

young  people have been given space to grow.  I  have  no

doubt that they will be able to find their feet and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3022</b></font><br><br>



we  will be able to do well.  How can this be achieved if

we  are not in tune with their feelings as well as  their

aspirations?  I do not understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the fact that every cent

counts  and, therefore, we have established a  Cut  Waste

Panel.   We have also talked about reviewing salaries  of

civil  servants.  All these will be put in place  in  due

course.  I will urge Mr Steve Chia to look at the results

before  coming  out to accuse us of having  an  expensive

Government.  In fact, if he has any specific proposal for

the  Cut Waste Panel, I think he should put something out

more clearly so that we can take a look at it.  This is a

time  for  us  to  be united to face the challenge  as  a

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am somehow surprised by Mr Chandra Mohan who

suddenly  talked about merger.  I may not  have  got  him

totally   right,  but  I  think  he  talked   about   the

possibility of making merger easier.  I do not  know  why

he  feels we should look at merger just because  we  face

some  setbacks.  In fact, I raised his comments  with  my

grassroots  leaders yesterday.  All of  them  were  quite

shocked.   This is the time to be united as a  nation  to

overcome  the  current difficulties.  So  my  message  to

Singaporeans is this: Together we shall overcome.   There

is  a  Chinese proverb that says that the moon is  there,

except  that  it is covered by dark clouds.   The  clouds

will  disappear.  We will see the moon again.   The  moon

has always been there and the best is yet to be.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I want to make a

clarification.   I  think  there  has  been  a   briefing

conducted  by  the  Singapore  Sports  Council   to   the

grassroots   leaders,  as  well   as   members   of   the

Constituency Sports Club, regarding the increase  in  the

entrance fees for the sports facilities.  So I think  the

Singapore Sports Council has not briefed him properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  want  to say the same thing.  Why did the SSC  officer

not tell him the truth that they did conduct a briefing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3023</b></font><br><br>



The  second  clarification I want  to  make  is:  is  the

Minister giving the message to all Singaporeans that  the

swimming  pool admission fees will increase  with  effect

from 1st October despite DPM's call on Ministries to  cut

cost  and  not to increase fees?  I just want to  make  a

clarification whether the increase in admission fees will

be implemented with effect from 1st October.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members  for the clarification.  Our plan is to implement

the increase with effect from 1st October 2003.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for letting me join in the debate.   At  this

stage, where so many speakers have spoken, I just want to

highlight a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister identified the critical cause of

this  slack  growth in Singapore last  week  as  that  of

demand.  He said that we have to cut costs in order to be

competitive  with  the other growing economies  in  Asia,

such   as  China  and  India,  and  in  the  neighbouring

countries.   Assuming  that wages for  SMEs  and  smaller

businesses  constitute  50% of business  cost,  I  think,

overall  in Singapore it is nearer 30-40% for the average

business unit in Singapore, which includes a lot of MNCs,

a  3%  reduction in the CPF rate by employers as proposed

will  only  lead  to  about 1-2% of overall  savings  for

businesses.   Hence, it is not likely to be the  solution

for  employment generating growth in the economy that  we

have to tackle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, other costs - rentals, statutory costs,

transport  - have to be adjusted downwards as  well,  and

many  of  these  cost packages and reductions  have  been

mentioned  by DPM a few days ago.  As my colleagues  have

argued,  no  doubt these have to be reduced significantly

to  have  any  major  impact, but it  is  only  half  the

solution.  The other possibly more important half has not

been  addressed in this debate, and it is how to generate

more employment growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the current measures as proposed can do is to

buy us some time.  There is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3024</b></font><br><br>



window of opportunity for us to adjust and to retune  our

economy.  And we have to make good use of that time  that

we  are  buying for companies to postpone giving  up  and

closing  down  and  moving  overseas  to  China  or   the

neighbouring countries, or even moving some processes  to

India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had actually visited the Tata Consultancy Services

Company  of  India  four years ago  in  Chennai  (Madras)

India,  and  knew  that they were doing back-end  process

work  for a certain Western European airline there.   The

Western European airline company is still around.   There

were  rows of tables for young Indian men and women, some

of  them,  not  all, are graduates.  I did  not  get  the

impression  of  active  productivity,  but  it  was  very

cheaply done.  Cost advantage was evident to me.  That is

why  competitive airline companies and others move  there

to do their labour intensive and routine work.  I am sure

by  now  they  would have made a few good notches  up  in

productivity because companies from other industries have

also moved there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can hope from this exercise is a window of

opportunity to readjust our costs and to generate  demand

in  the economy so that more growth can take place in the

economy,  especially  employment generating  growth.   We

cannot  talk  glibly  about the  jobless  growth  in  the

economy  and  pretend the problem, like  the  poor,  will

always  have to be with us.  We have to solve it with  so

many talented people that we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This window of opportunity we have to battle is a

passing  window.   If  what we  can  achieve  with  these

proposed  CPF cuts is to buy time, then we must seriously

ask what we must do to raise demand.  It may be that some

of  our economy's investments in the past few years  have

been   in   sectors  that  are  slackening   away,   like

electronics and construction, and we have to raise demand

across  the board.  For demand to be raised, in order  to

generate  growth, consumer spending must  be  raised,  as

well as investments, local or foreign.  Tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3025</b></font><br><br>



burden accordingly, including statutory costs, have to be

lowered.  I believe many of the investments we have  been

attracting in the past few years are very sizeable plants

employing  few  workers.  Have we  forgotten  to  attract

perhaps  less  lumpy, high-tech investments,  or  smaller

firms  who  may  have niche processes  and  have  special

technologies which need not necessarily be in big billion

dollar plants?  Such medium-size investments may use more

labour and have more linkages with the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we may not have so well-educated older

workers,  we  must not forget that they were the  workers

during the period we made the most rapid growth.  We  can

still  employ our older workers usefully and it would  be

wrong  to  think  that  they  cannot  contribute  to  the

economy.   Of  course,  there  has  to  be  training  and

retraining, which should be specially tailored for  them.

For  example,  have we asked ourselves why  and  how  our

shipyards,  ship-repair and offshore  sectors  are  still

doing fine in spite of all similar problems of wage costs

and  demand they have been faced with for so many  years?

Of  course, there had been consolidation in that industry

earlier.   Which  industry does not  face  this  kind  of

consolidation  problem  of  players  at  some  stage   or

another?  But they are still hiring now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need business investments from more diverse

sectors  with  their  own  special  niches.   But   these

investments  we  need  must help  us  in  employment  for

workers.   Diversity in investments in size and  industry

sectors will give Singapore an added insurance and buffer

in  its  future growth strategy.  Because we are a  small

open  economy and a nation-state, we need this  diversity

to  balance  off  sectoral risks.  We are  unlike  a  big

country  or any economy where they can aggregate out  the

risk  by  different  regional developments  within  their

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are always looking at how we compare in wage

costs  with  other countries, whether it  is  the  United

States,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3026</b></font><br><br>



China  or  India,  we  are missing  out  the  other  more

important half of the picture of economic growth.   Costs

alone  cannot determine business and prosperity.   It  is

the  creation  and  the  unlocking  of  values  from  the

conjoining  of  ideas, technologies and entrepreneurship,

whether  high-tech  or low-tech, that lead  to  business,

employment and prosperity for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister identifies the problem faced by

the  economy as demand.  The CPF and other reductions  in

costs  affect demand for investments.  As we have lowered

costs,   the   demand  for  investments  will   increase.

However, the demand that is necessary for addressing  our

economic  growth  and employment in a  competitive  world

economy must be raised by other efforts and other  policy

changes.   It  is  the  typical 101 economic  problem  of

discriminating  between  a slide  along  the  demand  for

investment  schedule versus a shift  of  the  demand  for

investment schedule.  The tools for the job are different

and  not  quite the same.  What we need now  is  a  shift

upwards  of  the demands for investments.  We  must  have

sufficient  policy  instruments to  tackle  the  required

policy objectives and we must assign them correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight two important concerns by

many  ordinary Singapore people.  The first concerns  the

adequacy  of  the  CPF savings for the future  when  they

retire.  Many of them are quite worried that they may not

have  enough.   One suggestion, as proposed  to  me,  was

whether  the Government would allow employees voluntarily

to  contribute  more  into their CPF.   There  is  a  tax

benefit for them as well.  The second is whether red tape

in   the  bureaucracy  can  be  minimised  in  order   to

facilitate more entrepreneurial activities for  business,

either in starting up new business from novel ideas or to

speed  up  existing requirements for approval, which  can

really  be  trying as many of us running businesses  have

all  experienced.  Perhaps we should have a Cut  Red-Tape

and Waste Committee, which will really be more productive

- killing two birds with one stone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to share some anecdotal experience with

Members.  Two weeks ago,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3027</b></font><br><br>



I  was  in  China  in Henan Province.  Henan  is  in  the

central  part  of China, with a population close  to  100

million,  more  than  the population  of  France,  UK  or

Germany.   The  people are engaged mostly in  agriculture

and  in primary production.  It took about 12 hours  from

Singapore  to  reach  this place,  including  inter-modal

transport  and  transfers.  I was in the  area  bordering

Shanxi Province, with the Yellow River flowing in between

Henan  and  Shanxi.  You cannot get more  provincial  and

heartland in China than there, which is the fons et orgio

- the fountain and origin - of the Chinese people.  There

are  people who live there in caves today, dug out of the

yellow-earthed hills, which are supposed to  be  warm  in

winter and cool in summer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not there for a vacation but I was there

looking  for  business opportunities for NTUC  Fairprice.

The  people  were  mostly farmers, and  poor  by  Chinese

standards.  But, in this provincial heart of China I  saw

no  hunger.  I saw no idle people on the roadside or  the

villages, and I was travelling for four days.  I was  not

staying  in  a hotel room and having meetings.   Everyone

seems  busy, planting and harvesting, digging  roads  and

canals  with hammers and shovels, transporting things  or

doing petty hawking.  I have almost forgotten the meaning

of petty hawking in agriculture until I saw it again -  a

few  pieces of vegetables and fruits from a garden  patch

by  the  village path.  I mean a few pieces.  I also  saw

European  traders there in this, I thought,  god-forsaken

place.  This is globalisation at work on its feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have read in newspapers and journals

about  the  extent of rural poverty and  unemployment  in

China, I am convinced, now it is full steam ahead for the

Chinese.  From the Central heartland of China -  and  the

Chinese call this place the Tang Yuan area - perhaps they

need  to  rely on us for capital, some skills and  modern

management for about five years or less - that is, if  we

are  fast enough.  An expressway runs from this heartland

of China to the port of Lianyungang, on the Yellow Sea, a

distance  of  more than 1,000 km.  Chinese trucks  filled

with goods ply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3028</b></font><br><br>



this  route day and night.  Very soon it will  be  trucks

with  international containers.  This tide is  inexorable

in spite of the many problems in the Chinese economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anecdote is to underline my concern that we

must  address  the larger issue of employment  generating

growth urgently.  This passing window of opportunity  for

us to retune and catch on to the mainstream of employment

generating growth is a very short one.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak  on

the   statement.   Being  the  last  person   among   the

backbenchers,  after  almost four days  of  parliamentary

sittings,  obviously has its drawbacks.  Much of  what  I

had  in mind to include in my original speech has already

been  well  covered by hon. Members earlier.  I  am  also

aware  of  the  pressure  to keep  my  speech  short  and

succinct.  Therefore, I shall be brief and focus only  on

the  CPF  issue, in the interest of time, although  I  am

just  as  interested  with the other  social  safety  net

measures discussed in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retuning the CPF actually provides a silver lining

among  the  dark clouds.  The CPF reforms need not  bring

about  unnecessary  insecurity over the  social  security

changes.   In  effect,  we  are  really  undertaking  the

retuning  of the psyche of Singaporeans in the  light  of

dynamically  changing times.  How so?  In my observation,

there  are four related practices leading to the  present

predicament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have over-relied on the CPF scheme as the

main lever to fulfil a number of social objectives;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are not happy with the past high overall CPF

contribution  rates as they reduce the cash component  of

our salaries for discretionary use;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We have over-estimated our ability to use CPF

funds to become affluent through speculative property and

other  investments, at the expense of building sufficient

capital for our retirement years;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We make incremental changes to the CPF scheme

or  tinkering with it, as some say, when in fact a  major

overhaul  of  our social security system  is  needed  and

overdue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers before me have explained these factors, so

I  need  not  elaborate on them.   Instead,  I  have  the

following suggestions, most of which were also brought up

by  Members of this House.  The suggestions are  intended

to  bring about are mindset change for every Singaporean,

especially for younger CPF members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Modify the proposed CPF-based model of social

security  to  include a mixed model of  CPF  and  private

sector  arrangements, as recommended again by  my  fellow

MPs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In addition to having pre-assigned contribution

rates  and  maximum  ceilings for  the  Minimum  Sum  and

Medisave  scheme,  introduce a separate  category  called

Home   Financing   Scheme,   with   appropriate   maximum

contribution rates also.  This would prevent CPF  members

from   over-using  the  Ordinary  Account   for   housing

purchases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stress to CPF members that their CPF retirement

funds  are meant for minimum sum of expenditure and  that

they  should  supplement them with  additional  means  of

financial support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Moderate our expectations about our own

standard  of  living,  be  realistic  about  them,   have

financial planning for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Review our life priorities, be less

materialistic and less obsessed with making money as main

goal in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Strengthen our relationship with our families

and  community  for therein lies our real  strengths  and

resilience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a major remake of our social security system,

we  should  be  able to move forward with renewed  trust,

hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3030</b></font><br><br>



and  having  the warmth of the sun with us  again.   This

requires  us collectively - Singaporeans, the Government,

the  unions, the corporate sector and the community -  to

stand  side by side with each other at the crossroads  of

change  to  meet the challenges of globalisation  and  to

fulfil  a  new Singapore Dream together as a  nation.   I

believe that this is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Sir, we do have a credible

and  competent Government that will not let us down.  And

to  paraphrase the Acting Health Minister  in  his  press

releases and speeches, however, the Government cannot  do

so  on its own.  We Singaporeans must also be willing  to

cooperate and do our part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's

Statement.

<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it has been a long four days.  I might not have been

in  the  House physically, but I can assure hon.  Members

that  I listened in quite regularly to the debate in  the

House.



<br><br><i>The fate of nations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the MPs for contributing to the debate on

"Retuning  the  CPF".  I believe all of you  support  the

changes,  even  the opposition MPs, and if  I  am  wrong,

please  let  me know.  You may not fully agree  with  the

extent  of the changes, but you concur that we cannot  go

back  to  a CPF rate of 40%.  You accept that we must  do

something  about  the  Minimum Sum,  salary  ceiling  and

withdrawal rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee and the Minister for Manpower have answered

the  questions on the CPF changes and the help  measures.

I  shall  not  repeat their points.  This  afternoon,  in

summing  up the debate, I will go beyond the CPF changes,

as  I believe our present difficulties are temporary.   I

will  talk about the basic factors that will make  for  a

sustained recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of you who said that the CPF changes alone

would not do the trick are absolutely right.  The changes

are  not  a  miracle cure.  They are necessary  and  will

bring down our wage costs.  But, by themselves, they  are

not sufficient.  We need to do more, to make a difference

to   our   cost  competitiveness.   As  many   MPs   have

emphasised,  we must and will keep taxes and other  costs

down.  And we will tighten up the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We run an efficient civil service, comparable to the

best  in  the world.  But because of many years  of  good

growth and strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3032</b></font><br><br>



budget  surpluses, we might have been a little  indulgent

in our spending.  I support, therefore, the setting up of

the Cut Waste Panel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh said that this is not enough, and

that we must go beyond cutting waste.  But let us get  on

with  the  Cut Waste Panel first.  We welcome suggestions

from   Mr   Inderjit  Singh,  the  general   public   and

businesses,   MPs,  as  well  as  from  public   officers

themselves.   The  more  ideas  the  Panel  receives   on

wasteful  expenditure, the more effective the Panel  will

be.  I do not think the civil service is fat.  But if  we

find that there is fat beneath the waste, we can set up a

Cut Fat Panel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, 38 years ago, we had no waste, no fat.

We  were  a  lean and hungry Third World  country.   But,

today,  we  are a First World country enjoying plenty  of

creature comforts, McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken  and

other  fast  food.  Thirty-eight years ago, many  of  our

mothers   worked   as   maids  or  washerwomen.    Today,

Singaporeans not only refuse such jobs, but one in  seven

households  employs  foreign maids.  Another  example  is

overseas travel.   I took my first plane ride at the  age

of  25,  and  that was to Kuala Lumpur for a  scholarship

interview.   Today, thousands of infant Singaporeans  fly

before they can even walk!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us want this good life to continue. But is

it   guaranteed?   Thirty-eight  years  from  now,   will

Singapore  still be in the First World?  Or  will  we  be

back in the Third World?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an idle question. I ask myself this

question  time  and again.  Nations may be  endowed  with

rich natural resources, or none at all, but that does not

destine  one  to be rich and the other,  poor.   We  must

understand  what it takes for the nation to  succeed,  so

that we can make Singapore endure.



<br><br><i>Thirty-eight years ago</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ng Eng Hen has cited the examples of China,

Japan,  Ireland  and  Finland  to  show  the  fluctuating

fortunes of nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3033</b></font><br><br>



Let  me  elaborate on the same theme, but from a personal

perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, I went to Williams College in the US to do

a Masters programme in development economics.  This was a

special  course for government officers from Third  World

countries.   I was then working in the Economic  Planning

Unit under the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 20 of us in the class. We came from 16

Third  World  countries.  Besides  Singapore,  the  Asian

students  came from Malaysia, the Philippines, India  and

Pakistan.    The  African  students  were  from   Uganda,

Tanzania,  Kenya, Liberia, Ethiopia and  Egypt.   Mexico,

Honduras,   Bolivia  and  Colombia  represented   Central

America.  And from Europe, we had Yugoslavia.  We were 20

young,   eager  beavers,  with  great  dreams   for   our

countries.  But,  unfortunately, 38  years  later,  those

dreams have disappeared for many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the political and social developments in

each of the 16 countries represented in my class, and how

much  their  peoples' lives have improved  from  1966  to

2002,  I think only three of the countries have succeeded

beyond a doubt.  They are Malaysia, Mexico and Singapore.

They  have  brought about development,  and  given  their

people  a  better future.  Perhaps I should add India  to

this  list, now that it has begun to open up its  economy

and some results are showing.  The remaining 12 countries

have   either  made  little  progress  or,  worse,   gone

backwards.   Some  have really fallen into  a  valley  of

gloom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Yugoslavia. In the 60s and 70s, Yugoslavia was

a  beautiful  country and a popular tourist  destination.

My friend from Yugoslavia told me that you could actually

go bear hunting in Yugoslavia and, if you want to be sure

you  can kill a bear, you just pay the tour guide for  it

and  the  bear  will be killed.  I visited Belgrade,  the

capital,  in 1978.  I went there with Foreign Minister  S

Rajaratnam to attend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3034</b></font><br><br>



a  Non-Aligned Movement meeting.  The conference was held

in a new part of Belgrade.  The streets were wide and the

buildings were new.  It was a pleasant neighbourhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Josip Tito, Yugoslavia's Head of State,

hosted a reception for the conference participants.  When

he  walked  in,  his charisma filled the  room.   But  he

looked  old  and  frail.  He did not stay  long  for  the

reception.  I wondered then how long he would  remain  in

charge of Yugoslavia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S Rajaratnam, as you know, had a curious mind,

especially  when  it came to politics.  In  Belgrade,  he

asked  to  meet an imam, a Muslim spiritual  leader.   He

wanted  to know how Islam was practised in Yugoslavia,  a

predominantly Orthodox Christian country.  The  imam,  an

oldish man, seemed happy and secure.  Of course, he spoke

through  an interpreter.  He lived in a small but decent-looking two-storey house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tito died in 1980. And, soon after, Yugoslavia

began   to  break  up.   Today,  Tito's  Yugoslavia   has

splintered  into  five  countries:  Slovenia,  Macedonia,

Croatia,   Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,   and   Serbia   and

Montenegro.   And  I am sure that the old  imam  did  not

expect the horrors that befell the Muslims of his country

- the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. In 1966, Pakistan

comprised West Pakistan and East Pakistan.  At  a  dinner

discussion  during  my  studies in  Williams  College,  a

Pakistani  student, who had graduated one  year  earlier,

held  forth  that  the  trend in the  world  was  against

separatism.   He  said that nowadays,  the  states  in  a

country  preferred to stay together.  He could not  think

of  any  country  having broken up in  recent  years.   I

reminded  him of Malaysia and Singapore.  "Ah," he  said,

"that is an exceptional case."  Five years later, his own

country  also  proved him wrong.  In 1971, East  Pakistan

fought  to  separate from Pakistan.  The East  Pakistanis

felt that the Government in Karachi had squatted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3035</b></font><br><br>



on  them.   So,  East Pakistan, with a little  help  from

India, became Bangladesh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also wondered what has happened to the

handsome, young Egyptian from my class.  I had planned to

visit  Egypt, after my course, on my way home.   At  that

time,  I thought that I would never travel again.  So,  I

actually  planned  my journey from the  US  to  Montreal,

London,   Paris,  Rome,  Cairo,  then  to   Bangkok   and

Singapore.  So, my Egyptian friend gave me the  names  of

some  hotels in Cairo.  But a few weeks before my  course

ended,  war broke out between Egypt, Syria and Jordan  on

the  Arab  side, and Israel on the other side.   The  war

lasted six days.  Egypt lost Sinai and the Gaza Strip  to

Israel.    My  Egyptian  friend  was  shell-shocked.    I

cancelled my trip to Egypt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other five African countries, I am sad to

say  that none of them made it.  You may recall the names

of  Jomo  Kenyatta of Kenya, Julius Nyerere of  Tanzania,

and Milton Obote of Uganda.  I have met Jomo Kenyatta and

Julius Nyerere.  They were larger than life, the hope  of

Africa.  But they could not deliver development to  their

countries.  President Milton Obote came to Singapore  for

the  Commonwealth  Heads of Government Meeting  in  1971.

While  he  was here, Idi Amin deposed him.  You know,  of

course, the damage Idi Amin then inflicted on Uganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ethiopia and Liberia, they have gone through

countless civil wars.  In 1993, a part of Ethiopia  broke

away  to  become  Eritrea.  And Liberia  today  is  still

suffering  from  internal strife.  My Liberian  classmate

worked  in the central bank.  I used to play table tennis

with him.  What central bank is there in Liberia today?



<br><br><i>Which country was most promising?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of my classmates and their countries has a

sobering effect on me.  It could well have been  my  fate

and the fate of Singapore.  Fortunately, as of now, among

the  16 countries represented in my class, Singapore  has

come out on top.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1966, if my professors in Williams College

had  done a ranking of the 16 countries - which ones were

most likely to succeed by the end of the 20th century - I

think  they  would have got the answer wrong,  especially

with regard to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in the 1960s, many pundits wrote off

Singapore  because  we  were an artificial  country.   We

were,  and still are, only a dot on the map.  We  had  no

natural  resources, no hinterland.   We  were  a  migrant

society  with no sense of nationhood.  There was communal

tension and distrust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have never taken our prosperity for

granted,  or  assumed that what we have  today  will  get

better  and  better in the years to come.  For  the  same

reason,  I am unfazed when we are besieged with problems.

Given  our  natural  limitations, we  should  expect  the

occasional  problems.  I have seen what have happened  to

my  classmates.  I have seen how countries have  gone  up

and  come down.  In fact, we should be surprised that  we

have far fewer problems than well-endowed countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When confronted with problems, I go for the basics,

the fundamental qualities that make a country successful.

CPF changes, lower Government fees, lower land and rental

costs,  lower taxes - all the things that MPs  raised  in

the House today and the days before - they are necessary,

but they are not sufficient.  If the basics are wrong, we

would not be debating any CPF changes.  We might well  be

fighting  for our lives in the streets.  Or we  might  be

paying some snakeheads to smuggle us to another country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the basics? For me, they are, first,

the  quality  of  a  country's  leadership;  second,  the

character  of the people - whether they are sensible  and

practical; and third, the trust the people have  in  each

other  and in their government.  These basics, they never

taught  them  in my course at Williams.   I  learnt  many

useful lessons there.  But the real lessons I learnt only

after I joined the PAP.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3037</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Quality leadership</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the quality of the leadership. As Prime

Minister,  I  have to receive Chairmen and CEOs  of  MNCs

from time to time.  Very often, they have investments  in

Singapore  or are thinking of investing.  EDB  recommends

that I see them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they just courtesy calls? No. The Chairmen and

CEOs  are trying to confirm for themselves that Singapore

is  a  good and safe place in which to invest.  They  are

sizing up the leader of the country.  They want to  know:

is  he  pro-business?  Is he competent?   When  difficult

problems demand a solution, will he be a populist or will

he  take tough actions?  Can he carry the people with him

if he has to make tough decisions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when I was the Minister for Defence, I received

investors.   The  meetings had nothing  to  do  with  the

Defence Ministry.  The investors wanted to meet me simply

because  I was the designated successor to Prime Minister

Lee.  They wanted to know whether their investments would

be safe with Singapore's future leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, investors will now want to see how

the new team performs.  I am confident of the new team.



<br><br><i>Sensible and practical people</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the second fundamental factor for a

country   to  succeed  -  the  people.   What  is   their

character?   Do  they have skills and capabilities?   Can

they learn?  Are they sensible and practical?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, I think, have a reputation for all

that, and more.  Listen to Mr Nithiah Nandan.  He is  the

Executive  Secretary  of  the  Union  of  Gas  and  Power

Employees, a union leader.  I was very impressed  by  the

tone  and  content  of his speech the other  day.   Union

leaders in many other countries would have berated  their

governments for cutting workers' wages.  They would  have

taken to the streets,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3038</b></font><br><br>



like  the French and the Koreans.  But here, we have far-sighted and realistic union leaders.  Mr Nandan supported

the  CPF changes because he understood the gravity of the

situation.  At the same time, he urged the Government  to

help the workers adjust to the changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just Mr Nandan but other union leaders as

well.  I meet them from time to time, so I know what they

think  and  how  they  think.  They are  a  sensible  and

practical  lot.  They listen to reason.  They  understand

facts and figures.  They know what is going on around the

world  and  how  their jobs are affected.   If  they  are

convinced of the need for tough measures, they  have  the

courage to sell them to their members.  They are the true

leaders  of the workers, not the politicians in  the  so-called Workers Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of people who have been

instrumental in our industrial harmony.  Many  of  us  do

not  even  know  they  exist.  They  are  the  Industrial

Relations Officers or IROs, in NTUC.  There are about  50

of them.  They are the link between the union leaders and

the  workers.  They may work unnoticed, but they are  out

there in the direct line of fire of unionists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IROs, union leaders like Mr Nandan, and NTUC leaders

like  Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng  give investors  confidence  in

Singapore's labour situation.  Do other Singaporeans have

the  same  common sense and pragmatism as  our  IROs  and

union  leaders?  I ask because I see the CPF changes  not

just  as  measures to improve our competitiveness.   They

are a test of the adaptability of our people.  They are a

test of the character of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback I have received, I believe

Singaporeans have passed with flying colours.   They  may

not  be happy with the CPF changes, but they accept  that

the measures are necessary.  They are not arguing against

the  measures, but rather, they are asking the Government

to  cushion the blow for less able Singaporeans.  This is

a legitimate request.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3039</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should also be practical about jobs.

If  the  market  is  not so rosy, we should  not  be  too

choosy.  We should be prepared to take on less attractive

jobs, rather than stay unemployed for long periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are enough jobs for all Singaporeans even now.

There are 85,000 unemployed Singapore residents.  But  in

the  manufacturing and services sectors alone, there  are

200,000  jobs held by foreign workers.  This  means  more

than  two  jobs  per  unemployed Singaporean.   If  these

Singaporeans  are  prepared to lower their  expectations,

and  work  shifts  or in the sun, all  85,000  unemployed

residents can be gainfully employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you actual examples of job vacancies

that Singaporeans do not want to fill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam told me that ST

Microelectronics tried to recruit 400 workers last  year.

The  company offered a starting pay of $1,150  for  wafer

fab  operators and $1,500 for technicians.  This was  for

working  only  15  days  a month,  and  did  not  include

overtime  allowances.   Quite  an  attractive   deal,   I

thought.  But Singaporeans did not think so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how many Singaporeans turned up for

interview?  Only 87, for 400 vacancies.  Do you know  how

many  walked  away when they found out they had  to  work

shifts,  and in a clean room?  23.  Of the 64 who  stayed

for  interview, 35 were offered jobs.  But only 20 turned

up for work on the first day.  One quit after a few days.

In  the  end,  the  company managed to  recruit  only  19

Singaporeans for 400 vacancies.  The company  was  forced

to  turn  to  its Malaysian recruitment contractor.   The

contractor promptly produced 360 candidates.  The company

hired  151  of them.  That was last year.   I  asked  EDB

whether   the   company  was  doing   better   recruiting

Singaporeans  this  year. EDB reported  it  still  had  a

problem.  Let me add that if ST Microelectronics had  not

been allowed to recruit the 151 Malaysians, it would have

shelved its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3040</b></font><br><br>



plans  to  expand in Singapore.  And the 19  Singaporeans

would not have a job today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also jobs available in the marine

industry.   Last month, the President of the  Association

of  Marine  Industries, Mr Heng Chiang Gnee,  sent  me  a

letter.    He   wanted  me  to  convey   a   message   to

Singaporeans.   He  wanted them to know  that  there  are

still  many  jobs available in the marine industry,  from

tradesmen and engineers, to supervisors and managers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is, there are jobs available in Singapore.

If  we  change our mindset and move away from our comfort

zone, we need never be out of work.



<br><br><i>Trust between people and Government</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third quality a nation needs in order to

overcome its challenges is trust between the people,  and

between the people and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Nandan urged me not just to feel for the

people, but to act on my feelings.  Do not fear.  That is

what  we  have done and what we will do.  You have  heard

DPM   Lee.   He  has  announced  many  measures  to  help

Singaporeans  cope with the CPF changes and our  economic

difficulties.   We  will not break our  promise  to  help

Singaporeans adjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes, if we cannot fulfill a promise, like

restoring  the  CPF  rate  to  40%,  it  is  because   of

compelling reasons.  To keep the promise, we might  cause

more  harm than good to Singapore.  Even the people would

not want us to keep the promise.  In short, circumstances

must have changed so drastically that only a naive person

or a knave would argue for the promise to be kept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang is neither naive nor a knave.

But  he made a fierce speech attacking the PAP and me for

breaking  our  election promise to create  jobs  for  the

people.   He  said that instead of doing so, we  are  now

cutting workers' wages by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3041</b></font><br><br>



lowering  the CPF rate.  I was not in the Chamber  but  I

heard his bark from outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do Mr Low and I respond differently to

Singapore's economic plight?  The difference is: he is  a

politician;  I  am not.  I regard myself as  a  political

leader.   Let  me explain the difference.   When  we  are

faced with a grave problem, I explain the problem to  the

voters,  and work out the options to solve it.  I  choose

what,  in  my view, is the best option after  a  thorough

discussion  with  my colleagues, with MPs  and  sometimes

with  grassroots leaders, even if that option means  pain

and  discomfort in the short term.  If necessary, I  give

some  anaesthesia or painkillers.  And if I have a little

money in my pocket, I hand it out to give a little cheer.

I never duck an issue even if it will cost me some votes.

I let the results speak for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low, on the other hand, sees a fire in a problem

and, instead of putting it out, looks for the biggest fan

to  fan the fire.  And when he sees a wound, he looks for

a bucket of salt to rub into the wound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our current plight, does Mr Low Thia Khiang offer

constructive suggestions to help Singapore recover?   No.

On  the  contrary, he accuses me of having total amnesia,

of  having forgotten my election promise to create  jobs.

Total  amnesia is a medical condition.  If I  have  total

amnesia,  the  people will sympathise with me,  at  least

that is what I hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Low's case, he has selective amnesia. When he

accused  me of not keeping my promise to create jobs,  he

conveniently  forgot to tell this House  that  since  the

general  election in November 2001, the  world  has  been

threatened   by  terrorism,  destablised   by   wars   in

Afghanistan  and  Iraq,  and  frightened  by  SARS.    He

conveniently  forgot to tell the House that these  events

were  beyond  our control.  He forgot to tell  the  House

that  if  the events had not happened, our economy  would

have grown by at least 3% this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3042</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selective amnesia is not a medical condition. It is

a  political condition, to be admonished, and not treated

with  sympathy.  In case Singaporeans miss my punch  line

again, the common name for Mr Low's selective amnesia  is

"opposition politics".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you briefly the employment situation

since the 2001 election.

Despite   the   external  events  that   shook   investor

confidence in our region, we continued to attract a  high

volume of investments.  In the manufacturing sector,  EDB

attracted  $9  billion  of investments  in  2002.   These

investments will create 14,000 jobs when fully  realised.

EDB  also  attracted  $2 billion of  investments  in  the

services sectors they promote.  This will create  another

7,000  jobs.  The 7,000 jobs are in addition to  jobs  in

other  services sectors that are being promoted by  other

Government agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a net basis, we lost 23,000 jobs last year. But

Singaporeans  actually  gained 19,000  jobs.   Foreigners

lost 42,000 jobs, hence the overall loss of 23,000 jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent some time dismissing Mr Low's

allegation because his tactic is a corrosive one.  He  is

trying to corrode a fundamental pillar of the PAP  -  the

trust  between the people and the Government.  This trust

has  been  built up over many years, since the  PAP  came

into power in 1959.  Mr Low knows that his party will not

make headway in elections, so long as the trust is there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP MPs must therefore never squander this trust nor

allow  anyone to undermine it with selective  amnesia  or

other political trickery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is not here today. But does Mr Chiam See

Tong  also  suffer from selective amnesia?  I  think  his

condition  is  a variant of this.  It is called  "quoting

out  of  context".  He shows a shift in the  Government's

position,  without explaining the context of  the  shift.

The  objective  is the same as selective  amnesia.   Used

repeatedly, and if not countered, it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3043</b></font><br><br>



erode the trust the people have for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Chiam made a "washy-washy"

speech.   Yes,  I  said "washy-washy", not "wishy-washy".

It  is  not amnesia, I assure you.  I remember very  well

Indranee's  speech  on "wash-wash".  I say  "washy-washy"

because  Mr Chiam made another attempt to wash in public,

past  speeches by Ministers.  He wanted to show  that  we

had  changed our position and therefore, were not men  of

our  words.   But his tactic does not work,  because  the

Government has no dirty linen for him to wash!   We  keep

our PAP shirts and pants very white.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, DPM Lee said in 1985 that the CPF was part of

workers'  wages and should not be cut.  That was  over  a

decade  ago.   Our  competitiveness situation  has  since

changed.  So we have to make corresponding changes to the

CPF to suit the new environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, however, does not seem to change his view

of  the world even when the world has changed.  In  fact,

the  only  change I have seen Mr Chiam make was  when  he

changed political parties!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does Mr Chiam stand on the CPF changes? Is he

in  favour  of the CPF rate cut?  Or is he in  favour  of

status  quo?   What ideas does he have  for  solving  our

economic difficulties?  He is another politician,  not  a

political leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia is another politician. He tried to

hunt with the hounds and run with the hares.  In girl-boy

relationship, I call this two timing.  You have to decide

which party you want.  You cannot try to go with one girl

and then behind her back, go with another girl.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs must remember this distinction between a

politician  and a political leader.  To be a leader,  you

have   to   lead,  not  win  support  by  making  popular

statements,  or  fan  the fire of discontent.   To  be  a

leader, you have to analyse problems, explain them to the

people, work out the options, choose a solution that  you

believe is right,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3044</b></font><br><br>



and  sell it to the people.  Singaporeans are discerning.

They are not ungrateful.  If you are sincere and work for

them, they will support you.  Of course, you must produce

results and improve their lives.  The results do not have

to be immediate.  But they must come over time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retuning the CPF is an example of leadership.

Together  with our other measures, it will make Singapore

more  competitive,  bring in investments,  and  save  and

create jobs for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also advise PAP MPs not to unwittingly erode the

trust  between the people and the Government.  Yesterday,

in  her speech, Amy Khor said that some Singaporeans felt

betrayed  by  the CPF cut.  She used the word  "betrayal"

twice.   Mr  Low Thia Khiang used the same  word  in  his

attack on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betrayed" is a very strong word. I know that Amy

Khor supports the CPF changes.  She said so.  And she was

only echoing the views of some of her constituents.   But

PAP  MPs  should be careful not to broadcast such  strong

words,  when there was no betrayal.  They must  not  sing

the  same  tune as opposition MPs unwittingly.   Instead,

they  should stand their ground and debunk this  betrayal

nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy Khor also mentioned that she knew of unhappy

Singaporeans who were contemplating selling their assets,

and  migrating.  Perhaps, in these difficult times,  this

is a sensible thing to do, from their perspective.  And I

understand  that  they feel disappointed  and  frustrated

because  of  the poorer job situation.  But  they  should

remember  who created the conditions for them to  acquire

their  valuable  assets, which  they  can  now  sell  and

migrate  to  Australia or New Zealand as  men  of  means.

Where  did  they receive their education,  and  how  much

subsidy have they enjoyed?  They have done well in  their

lives,  and  have the resources to migrate, because  they

were in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore had not nurtured them, would they have

any  assets  to  sell?  Do they think  Australia  or  New

Zealand would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3045</b></font><br><br>



welcome them if they were not well-educated?



<br><br><i>More than just CPF cut</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut the CPF by 3%. Ang Mong Seng told the

House  that employees said "Heng ah!"  Well,  I  am  glad

that they heaved a sigh of relief, because some employers

howled  with disappointment.  That is Singapore for  you.

You cannot please everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the 3% cut work? Is it too little? Nobody can

tell in advance whether 33% is the right rate.  But in my

considered  judgment, it is the most appropriate  in  our

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans accept the rate cut and the other

changes  to the CPF, this will send a powerful signal  to

investors that we will go all out to compete. This is the

real  value of the rate cut.  Later, if 33% proves to  be

still too high, we will lower the CPF rate to 30%.  But I

do not think we have to do this for some years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the MPs who said that our economic

recovery  strategy cannot be CPF cuts alone.   They  will

not be sufficient to make Singapore competitive.  We must

cut  costs  in all other areas.  As DPM Lee explained  on

Friday, we have done this, and continue to do so.  Office

and  industrial  rentals have come down by  39%  and  46%

since  early 1997.  Our income tax rates too  are  coming

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy does not focus only on cost

cutting.  We cannot possibly compete on costs alone.   If

we   try   to  match  the  wages  offered  by  lower-cost

competitors, we are engaging in a downhill race.  We will

all end up at the bottom, with lower standards of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy must, therefore, go beyond

cost   competition.   Inderjit  Singh  claims  that   the

Government has no strategy for economic recovery, that we

have no plan.  But I remind him that in December 2001,  I

set up the Economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3046</b></font><br><br>



Review  Committee to comprehensively review policies  and

propose strategies to promote the further growth  of  the

Singapore economy.  In February this year, the  ERC  came

up  with its recommendations.  The recommendations set  a

clear direction for Singapore's economy over the next  15

years,  while addressing the current slowdown.  So  I  do

not   understand  why  Inderjit  Singh  said   that   the

Government  did not have an economic plan.   Has  he  not

read the ERC report?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind. I shall now outline for him five of the

key thrusts of our economic strategy.  First, we have  to

offer  something valuable that our competitors cannot  do

as  well.  This is why we are continuously improving  the

capabilities of our workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we have invested heavily in our

education  system.  Our schools equip our  students  with

strong  foundations  in  Mathematics,  Science  and   the

Humanities.   And  our post-secondary  education  already

ranks  amongst  the  world's  best.   But  despite  these

achievements,  we are not sitting still.  We  are  moving

towards  a  more  diverse  education  system  to  nurture

talents   in   different  fields.   The  junior   college

curriculum  is being revised to focus more on  developing

thinking skills and multi-disciplinary perspectives.  The

polytechnics have adopted an inter-disciplinary  approach

to  learning.   And  our ITEs provide  opportunities  for

their  students to engage in problem solving, independent

learning  and collaborative work.  In addition, over  the

next  few  years, NTU will be transformed  into  a  full-fledged,  comprehensive university.  NUS  will  become  a

multi-campus  university system, with new  campuses.   We

will  also consider allowing private universities  to  be

established in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes will equip the young generation of

Singaporeans  with  the flexibility,  inventiveness,  and

ability to cope with rapid change.  They will enable  our

young  to  pick up easily technical skills and  knowledge

once they join the workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts at human capital development are not

limited to the schools and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3047</b></font><br><br>



universities.   We  are  also putting  high  priority  on

workers'   training  and  skills  upgrading.    The   new

Workforce Development Agency will help Singaporeans  find

and  keep jobs.  It will spearhead new programmes to  re-skill unemployed Singaporeans to fill job vacancies.   It

will  also drive the skills upgrading of employed workers

in a more systematic and targeted way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust of our economic strategy is to

expand  our economic pie by going global.  We  have  been

successful  in going regional.  Now, we must  go  to  the

Four   Corners   of   the  world,  wherever   there   are

opportunities.  To do so, we are weaving a  web  of  Free

Trade  Agreements  (FTAs).  To-date, we  have  agreements

with the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, ASEAN and the

European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA).   These  FTAs

provide  our companies tariff-free access to  a  combined

market of one billion consumers, among other advantages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, with the US-Singapore FTA, Singapore

food  in the US will be cheaper.  Singaporeans and  their

friends  in  Silicon Valley will save 4-5% in  cost  when

they  eat Tee Yih Jia's popiah and roti prata, and  Thong

Seik's fishballs.   They will eat more of such food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an FTA with the US, American-flagged ships

have  to  pay  the US government a levy of 50%  of  their

bills,  for  repair work done outside the US.   Now,  the

ships  will  save on this levy when they are repaired  in

Singapore.    There  will  be  more  business   for   our

shipyards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only Singapore companies that benefit from

our FTAs.  Consumers too.  The Senior Minister went to  a

function  for former PAP MPs recently.  He was  surprised

to  see  Kirin, a Japanese beer, being served.   He  took

one.   I  told  him it could be because of our  FTA  with

Japan.  I did not know the price of Kirin beer, but I had

checked  on  the price of Asahi beer.  It had  come  down

from $20 per six-pack to $17.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, selling to customers all over the world must

become a way of life for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3048</b></font><br><br>



our  companies, given our small domestic  market.   I  am

glad  that our companies are venturing further afield  to

less familiar territories, beyond our traditional markets

in East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG George Yeo led an economic mission to Kazakhstan

recently.   He  was  surprised to find that  a  Singapore

company  has  a large market share in 3-in-1 coffee,  not

just  in  Kazakhstan,  but also in  Ukraine  and  Russia.

Also,  Keppel  Offshore & Marine has set up shipyards  in

Kazakhstan and in Azerbaijan.  And a Singapore consortium

recently won a bid to provide ground-handling services at

Baghdad International Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consortium must do a good job of it, and make

luggage collection at Baghdad Airport "safe".  I  was  in

Baghdad  in  1979  for  a trade exhibition.   I  lost  my

luggage  at  the airport.   Four or five other delegation

members  also lost their bags.  Our bags were  stolen  at

the  airport.   The  SIA station manager  had  personally

ensured  that all the bags and luggage which belonged  to

the  Singapore delegation were put on the plane that flew

to  Baghdad.  I regretted because before I left, Mr Ngiam

Tong  Dow,  who was then the Permanent Secretary  of  the

Ministry  of  Finance, told me that the Arabs  were  very

sophisticated and urbane people, and so I packed my  best

suits, shoes and ties and put them in the luggage, and  I

never saw them again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help more companies succeed overseas, IE

Singapore,  the  former  Trade  Development  Board,  will

support them in building international capabilities.   It

will  provide on-the-ground facilitation.  It will double

the  number  of  overseas fairs and trade  missions.   IE

Singapore  will  also launch a $10 million "International

Partners  Programme" to encourage Singapore companies  to

hunt in a pack.  Our GLCs and larger firms will lead  the

smaller  ones  in  consortia  to  secure  overseas   jobs

together.  This is the demand part.  I heard Mr Chay  say

just  now  that we also need to create demand,  not  just

attack the cost side alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will continue to climb up the value chain

in manufacturing. We can no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3049</b></font><br><br>



longer compete as a low-cost manufacturing base.  But  we

retain  a  competitive edge in higher-end  manufacturing.

We  have, therefore, upgraded our industries to  keep  up

with the latest technology.  We have and will continue to

build up our R&D capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seagate, a disk drive manufacturer, is building a

new  extension in Singapore.  The extension houses state-of-the-art  equipment  and  new-generation  technologies.

When the new plant reaches full capacity, it will provide

2,000   jobs   for  our  people.   The   best   days   of

manufacturing are still ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we are growing our services sector.

Singapore is already well established as a hub for  info-communications  technology, trading  and  logistics,  and

financial services.  We will strengthen our hand in these

industries.   At the same time, we will grow new  service

sectors  like  education,  healthcare  and  the  creative

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In healthcare, for instance, our handling of the

SARS  outbreak has enhanced our reputation.   The  Genome

Institute  of  Singapore is now  working  with  Roche,  a

pharmaceutical giant, to commercialise its SARS test kit.

In  the  private sector too, our capabilities  are  well-known.    Overseas   patients  come  here   for   complex

operations  such  as the separation of  conjoined  twins.

Each  hospital bed requires at least four staff  to  man.

If  we  have another 500 private hospital beds  to  serve

overseas  patients from China, Indonesia and  the  Middle

East,  that  would create another 2,000 well-paying  jobs

for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we are seeing a blossoming of entrepreneurs.

These  companies are not necessarily start-ups,  or  from

the   high-tech  sector.   A  traditional  SME  that   is

constantly renewing its products is Bee Cheng Hiang,  the

company  that makes ba kua.  In addition to  its  classic

range of ba kua, or barbecue pork, the company now offers

crispy  ba  kua,  made from pork loin,  for  the  health-conscious consumers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3050</b></font><br><br>



It  also  has  gourmet ba kua for the  connoisseurs.   It

sells  ba chang with ba kua filling.  And it collaborates

with  Pizza Hut and BreadTalk to offer pizza with ba kua,

as well as ba hu in the bread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will ensure that

Singapore is pro-business, and conducive to starting  and

growing a company.  We have reduced business registration

and  renewal  fees.  We have now allowed  people  to  run

businesses  from  their homes.  The  Government  is  also

improving  access to financing, especially for  SMEs  and

start-ups  with  little or no track record.   Yes,  there

could  still be red tapes, and, perhaps, if our  MPs  can

point  out  where the red tape is, we will be  more  than

happy to give them a pair of scissors to help us cut  the

red tape.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by putting our current difficulties

and prospects in perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last six years have been extremely uncertain and

painful  for the world and for Singapore.  We encountered

crisis  after crisis, which severely dampened the  global

economy.  In 1997 and 1998, the loss of confidence in the

Thai   baht  sparked  off  the  Asian  financial  crisis.

Indonesia  was  the  most badly  hit.   It  plunged  into

several  years  of  instability  and  uncertainty.    The

financial  crisis  also  damaged other  economies:  South

Korea,   Hong   Kong,  Malaysia,  and  the   Philippines.

Singapore, too, was hurt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th September 2001, Al Qaeda terrorists

shattered  America's sense of invulnerability.   A  month

later,   America,  supported  by  international   forces,

declared  war  against  the  terrorists.   They   pounded

Taleban and Al Qaeda positions in Afghanistan, and rolled

into  the  country.  Throughout 2002 and  2003,  security

forces across the world cracked down on terrorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the terrorists struck back. In October 2002,

Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists killed several hundred people

in Bali.  Last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3051</b></font><br><br>



month,  they  claimed more lives in  the  Marriott  Hotel

bombing in Jakarta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2003, President George Bush went to war

against Iraq.  The war was over quickly.  But even as the

US  worked  to restore order in Iraq, we were hit  again,

this  time by a health crisis.  SARS struck Singapore  in

March.   Travellers returning from Hong Kong  unwittingly

brought  the  virus  home.  Thus began  the  outbreak  in

Singapore that caused several months of anguish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no control over these external events, which

badly  affected the confidence of investors and  tourists

in the region.  Unfortunately, these crises are not over.

The international terrorist network is still functioning,

and SARS may make a comeback.  So we must be prepared for

more  shocks,  and  maybe another sudden  plunge  to  our

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also prepare for a permanent change in the

external  competitive  environment.   Before,   we   were

competing  in  the league of emerging economies,  without

China  and  India.  We did well.  Now, these  two  giants

have  joined  the  games.  India  is  a  rising  star  in

services  sectors  such  as  IT,  accounting  and   other

backroom work.  China joined the World Trade Organisation

in   2001  and  since  then,  has  dominated  the  global

manufacturing market for lower-end products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these external developments - the crises and the

stronger  competition  -  have  slowed  down  Singapore's

economic  growth.   This  is  because  ours  is  a  small

economy,  very  much  dependent on external  markets  and

foreign  investments. External demand accounts  for  more

than  two  thirds of our total demand.  Trade  is  nearly

three  times the size of our GDP.  And 80 cents of  every

dollar  invested in the manufacturing sector  is  foreign

money.   As  for jobs, 50 out of every 100  jobs  in  the

manufacturing  sector, and 20 out of  every  100  in  the

services sector, are in foreign companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are like a sailboat, dependent on the wind to

move.  If the wind is behind us,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3052</b></font><br><br>



we  can  sail very fast.  But if the wind dies, our  boat

will crawl.  If the wind is against us, it requires a lot

of  skill  just  to  stay in the same  spot  and  not  go

backwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this difficult global economy, you will find

that  we  are  moving  slowly.  But when  the  conditions

improve,  and I believe they will by next year,  we  will

pick up speed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the external environment is brightening.

The  US  economy picked up momentum in the second quarter

and  has continued to accelerate.  It is expected to grow

by 2.3% this year and 3.7% next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good news. Stronger US growth will benefit

the  EU and Japanese economies.  Already, Europe has seen

sustained  improvement  in  business  sentiments.   Clear

signs of stronger growth are also visible in Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economies too, should improve their

performance.    Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand   are

expected to grow by a higher 4% to 5% next year.  China's

growth  will likely remain at more than 7% this year  and

next.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the global electronics industry

continues  to recover.  Worldwide sales of semiconductors

are likely to grow by 11% this year and 21% next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in the external economy will have an

uplifting  effect  on Singapore.  Already,  visitors  are

returning.  The manufacturing sector is seeing signs of a

pickup.   Our  businesses too, are more optimistic.  Many

analysts,  therefore,  expect the  Singapore  economy  to

rebound  by  between 4% and 5% next year.   MTI  is  also

confident of stronger growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a further reason why we should not delay the

changes to our CPF system.  When global demand picks  up,

we  want to be there to catch the wind.  We want  to  put

ourselves  in  the most advantageous position.   In  this

regard, cutting CPF costs is like throwing overboard some

of the weight in our sailboat.  Then when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3053</b></font><br><br>



winds  blow again next year, we are lighter and  will  be

able to go much faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply appreciative that MPs have supported the

changes to the CPF.  I hope fellow Singaporeans will also

stand  solidly behind the changes.  Let us show the world

our  solidarity  and  our  firm resolve  to  recover  our

competitiveness.    If   we  reinforce   our   hardheaded

reputation,  we will give investors even more  confidence

to invest in Singapore for the long-term.  They will know

that  rain or shine, wind or no wind, they can  count  on

the  people of Singapore.  They will know that  here,  we

have a people who will never give up, who will never give

in,  and  who  will always pull together  as  one  united

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the music stopped for Singapore? Is the party

over?  No.  We are merely changing the Elvis Presley  and

Jailhouse Rock records, to something more modern on  CDs.

The  songs may be slower, and you may have to change your

dance steps.  But you can still enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will Singapore be in 38 years' time? No one

can tell for sure.  But if I have to bet, I would put  my

money on Singapore remaining in the First World.  Because

I  know  that a nation's destiny lies in its people,  and

here, in this little nation, we have a great people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I have your

permission to clarify something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I believe that our CPF

should  not be cut below 35%, more so after listening  to

the Prime Minister's speech.  Neither am I convinced that

the  proposed 3% cut in CPF to 33% would help much in our

economic recovery.  With job creation or saving jobs,  PM

has  rightly pointed out that the key factor is  actually

external environment.  He said that he wanted to  send  a

strong signal to investors.  What I want to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3054</b></font><br><br>



is:  how many signals do we have to send?  In 1998,  when

we  cut  the CPF, we said we wanted to send a  signal  to

investors.  How about PAP's resolve to be lean - to  send

a  signal as well?  How about cutting red tapes, waste or

the  Ministers'  salaries  - to  send  a  signal  to  the

investors?  Why must he always choose to cut the workers'

CPF  and  wages  in  order to send  a  signal?   That  is

something  which I do not understand.   I  hope  PM  will

clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the CPF cuts do help in some way, I am

of   the   view   that  the  suffering,   the   long-term

implications ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, you are making a speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am clarifying because

the  Prime  Minister asked me whether the Opposition  MPs

have  all supported the cuts.  It is not correct,  and  I

have  to let him know.  So I am now letting him know.   I

am not supporting and clarifying why I am not supporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suffering and the long-term implication of

the  CPF cuts on the people do not justify the short-term

benefit, which I think PM has outlined.  The PM has  also

in  his speech said that there are sufficient jobs to  go

round,  and he lamented that Singaporeans do not want  to

take them up.  In that case, what is the problem?  Why do

we  need  to cut the CPF further?  To save jobs, as  what

many people have said?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to clarify the Prime Minister's speech

on  the question of amnesia or selective amnesia.  I hope

PM  will  clarify.  Did the PAP not promise  jobs  and  a

secure  future  at  the  last  election?   And  he   also

mentioned  in his speech that, to be a political  leader,

you  have to show results, albeit at a slower pace.  Yes,

I  agree.   But  could he tell us then,  since  the  last

election until now, what were the results compared to the

promise  given  to the people and the people's  trust  by

giving the PAP 75% of the votes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3055</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has also criticised MPs and

said  that he objects to the word "betrayal" which  is  a

very  strong  word.  But would he offer some suggestions?

How  does he describe the situation in which the PAP  had

promised and committed to restoring the CPF to 40% at the

last election?  Many Ministers, including the unions, had

said,  loud and clear, before the election, that we would

restore  CPF.  And now, after the election, you  cut  the

CPF.   There  is  no return to 40%, and it  is  going  to

fluctuate.  How would the people square with  that?   How

does the Government square with that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been

debating this issue in the House for the last four  days,

and  Mr Low is raising the same questions again.  We  can

have another four days to go through the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that Mr Low agrees with us that we must

make  some  changes  to the CPF.  I say  33%  is,  in  my

opinion, the best rate.  As I said, nobody knows  in  the

long  term which is the appropriate rate.  He again,  for

the  sake of playing opposition politics, says  35%.   We

have thought of that.  35% is neither here nor there.  We

might  as  well stay at 36%.  But if we want  to  make  a

change,  we make one which is sizeable enough,  which  is

3%,  or  go right down to 30%.  But we have gone  through

all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why we are in the current

economic  situation, and I, for one, believe that  demand

is  a  very important factor in the equation.  So I would

not myself support going down to 30%.  Once we go down to

30%  and, later on, if we want to go up to 33%, or  more,

it is difficult.  So let us settle for something which we

think is doable, which is 33%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few years from now, if our wages go up because

the  demand for workers has shot up suddenly  and  it  is

high, we can then adjust the CPF upwards, not necessarily

to  36%.  When we do that, we would put the funds for the

new  rates  into  the Special Account, not  the  Ordinary

Account, and Singaporeans should plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3056</b></font><br><br>



on  the basis when they are buying a house, on 33%.   But

if we are wrong, and indeed we need to cut costs further,

then  we  have room to move down by 3%.  But the crux  of

the matter is that Mr Low is not in disagreement with  us

that we must tackle the CPF as one of the instruments  to

bring about economic competitiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for amnesia, I have gone through this just now.

Yes,  we  made  a  promise.  I  made  a  promise  at  the

elections.  But the difference between the Member and  me

is  that I tell the people the truth.  When the situation

has  changed, I told them that these are the setbacks  we

have  suffered, these are the problems, let us move  from

40% to 36% to 33%.  Whereas here, as I said, even at this

stage, after my speech, he is still fanning the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he seriously recommend that we go back to 40%?

I  made the promise that we should go back.  I am telling

the  people  now  that if we go down to  33%,  would  the

Member stand up and tell the people that 40% is right for

Singapore now?  Would he?  Would he answer me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is for the

Prime Minister and the PAP, who had made the promise,  to

stay  with the promise.  I did not make the promise.   He

and the PAP have failed by not going back to 40%, and  it

is a fact.  Let us face it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained

why, when there are compelling reasons, we should not  be

so  stubborn as to stick to 40%.  We had made  a  promise

and I have said, yes, and I have got to pay the price for

this.  And there could be a price because there could  be

people   who  will  say,  "You  had  made  the   promise.

Therefore, I will not support you."  But I can  tell  you

that,  when  the  results  are there,  more  people  will

support us for being practical, adaptable and realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Yes, I took strong objection to

the use of the word "betrayal".  So when I heard Amy Khor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3057</b></font><br><br>



used  the  word twice, I said, "My God, she is  repeating

the  same word as Mr Low Thia Khiang which was quoted  in

the  Straits Times that the PAP has betrayed the people."

These  are very emotive words.  I would never let such  a

word  pass  me, which was why I took some time to  debunk

him.   But he is not naive, he is not a knave.  So I have

therefore  decided to debunk him in a light-hearted  way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.58 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities and Futures Act (SFA) was passed in

October  2001.  In October 2002, the Company  Legislation

and  Regulatory Framework (CLRF) Committee completed  its

comprehensive  review of the company law  and  regulatory

framework   in  Singapore  and  suggested   measures   to

modernise  our  regulatory framework and  make  Singapore

more globally competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA will be amended in two phases. The current

Bill    implements    12   of   the   CLRF    Committee's

recommendations  aimed at reducing the  cost  of  raising

capital  in  Singapore, by rationalising and  simplifying

the  requirements in the SFA for offers  of  investments.

We  are also taking this opportunity in amending the  SFA

to  incorporate some technical amendments to the  SFA  in

the light of industry developments and feedback on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3058</b></font><br><br>



implementation of the Act over the last two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase of amendments, targeted for the

second   half  of  2004,  will  implement  the  remaining

recommendations  of  the  CLRF Committee,  and  introduce

changes  to  the regulatory framework for the  securities

and  futures  industry requiring more substantive  policy

review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) invited

feedback  from the industry and the public on  the  draft

Bill  in  April  this year, and has posted  its  detailed

responses   to   the   comments  received   during   this

consultation on its website.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the main

amendments in the Bill, beginning with those implementing

the CLRF Committee's recommendations.



<br><br><i>Facilitating capital raising</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory framework for capital raising has to

balance  the  needs  of issuer companies  with  those  of

investors.  This is achieved by imposing requirements  on

the conduct of public offers, such as requiring offers to

be  accompanied  by a prospectus.  The Bill  rationalises

the  provisions  for public offers of  investments.   The

thrust  of the amendments is to make it easier  and  less

expensive   for   companies  to   raise   funds   without

compromising investor protection.



<br><br><i>Exemption from prospectus requirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA already exempts several classes of offers

from prospectus requirements.  These exemptions cater  to

offers  where it would not be prejudicial to  the  public

interest to dispense with a prospectus, such as when  the

offer  is  not available to the general public, or  where

information  in the prospectus is already available  from

other sources.  Clause 76 exempts three further types  of

offers of investments from the prospectus requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there will be a new exemption for offers made

in  connection  with a takeover of a foreign-incorporated

company,   if  the  offer  complies  with  the   relevant

requirements  of  the  country  where  the  company   was

incorporated.   This  extends the current  exemption  for

offers  that comply with the Singapore Code on  Takeovers

and   Mergers  to  foreign  companies  subject  to  other

comparable regulations, and allows Singapore shareholders

of  such  companies  to  participate  in  these  takeover

offers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, issues of units of securities, including

covered  warrants, to be listed on a securities  exchange

will  be  exempted,  if  the  underlying  securities  are

already  listed.  Information on listed companies  should

already  be  readily available to investors, given  their

obligations  to  disclose  material  information   on   a

continuous basis.  Further, as the listing rules  of  the

Exchange  require that the terms and conditions  of  such

listed units be disclosed, there is therefore no need  to

require a fresh prospectus for the offer of such units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the exemption for offers by a corporation

pursuant  to  an  employee investment  scheme,  which  is

currently  restricted  to  current  employees,  will   be

extended.   The  amendment  will  allow  all  bona   fide

employees  and former employees to participate  in  these

schemes.   There  are no strong reasons to  restrict  the

scope  of  such employee investment schemes to  just  the

current  employees.   The  changes  will  give  companies

greater  flexibility in responding to market  conditions,

and  in  structuring  their  incentive  and  compensation

packages.



<br><br><i>Resale of securities exempt from prospectus requirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SFA, offers made only to sophisticated or

institutional investors are exempted from the  prospectus

requirements.   To  prevent  the  circumvention  of   our

prospectus   requirements,  any  resale   of   securities

purchased pursuant to such exemptions to persons who  are

not sophisticated or institutional investors will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3060</b></font><br><br>



be regarded as a public offering requiring a prospectus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction does not apply for the resale of

listed  shares  and debentures, if the transactions  take

place six months or more after the initial acquisition of

the  securities.  However, the resale of unlisted  shares

and  debentures requires a prospectus, whether or not six

months  have elapsed.  This is restrictive and  does  not

accord  with  the  practice in other major  international

financial centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 78, therefore, aligns the practice for listed

and unlisted shares and debentures.  Resale of shares and

debentures,  whether listed or unlisted,  acquired  under

the  institutional or sophisticated investor  exemptions,

will  not  be  deemed a public offer, if six months  have

elapsed since the initial purchase.  Unlisted shares  and

debentures   may   be  resold  to  persons   other   than

institutional  or sophisticated investors  after  the  6-month  period without a prospectus, as long as  the  sale

does not amount to a public offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For collective investment schemes, the CLRF

Committee  recommended allowing the secondary trading  of

schemes    purchased   under   the   institutional    and

sophisticated investor exemptions.  Clauses 91, 92 and 93

remove the requirement that units in such schemes be non-transferable   and   allow   subsequent    sales    among

institutional and sophisticated investors.



<br><br><i>Replacing  certain  offer documents with  an  information statement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn next to

replacing  certain  offer documents with  an  information

statement.   When a listed company makes  a  renounceable

rights  issue, clause 68 replaces the current requirement

for the company to issue an abridged prospectus with that

of an offer information statement.  The offer information

statement will be a shorter and more relevant document in

such circumstances.  As mentioned earlier, information on

such  listed issuers would be publicly available, as they

already    comply   with   the   continuous    disclosure

obligations.  Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3061</b></font><br><br>



clause  79  provides  that  a listed  company  may  offer

additional  issues  of shares using an offer  information

statement.



<br><br><i>Repeal of reporting requirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several provisions in the SFA have been repealed to

further  streamline the fund-raising process.  Clause  77

removes  the  need  to  lodge, with MAS,  an  information

memorandum  used  for offers to sophisticated  investors.

Clause  80  dispenses with the need to lodge a notice  to

invoke  exemptions from the prospectus requirements,  and

repeals   the   requirement  for   Singapore-incorporated

issuers to maintain a register of securities issued under

an exemption from the prospectus requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no countervailing public interest to

be  served in requiring MAS to be the depository of  such

exempted   offering   documents,  such   as   information

memoranda   and   notices  invoking   exemptions.    Such

requirements  only add to administrative  and  regulatory

costs.   The  CLRF  Committee also found  no  reason  why

Singapore-incorporated issuers should maintain a register

of exempted issues, when foreign-incorporated issuers are

not subject to this requirement.



<br><br><i>Repeal of requirements on trustees for debentures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA currently requires issuer companies to

appoint   trustees  and  to  include  certain  prescribed

covenants  in  the  trust deed for  public  offerings  of

debentures.   These requirements are not  stipulated  for

share  offers,  even  though the  risks  associated  with

debentures  are  generally lower than those  for  shares.

Clause  72,  therefore,  repeals  these  provisions   and

removes the current differential treatment between  share

and  debenture  offers.  The differential treatment  also

does  not  accord  with the prevailing practices  in  the

international  bond  market and increases  the  cost  for

debenture issuers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the other amendments that

address industry feedback and market developments in  the

last two years.



<br><br><i>Regulation of clearing facilities for OTC derivatives</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the long title and expands the scope

of  the  SFA to include clearing facilities for Over-the-Counter  (OTC) derivatives.  MAS' oversight  of  clearing

facilities  under  the  SFA is  currently  restricted  to

facilities  that  clear securities and futures  contracts

that  are traded on exchanges or other organised  trading

platforms.   This  has  worked well  in  the  past,  when

clearing facilities were largely limited to clearing  for

exchange-traded instruments.  Trades in  the  OTC  market

were  negotiated and settled bilaterally, usually between

financial institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the increasing use of sophisticated

OTC  contracts,  clearing facilities for these  contracts

have  emerged.   These facilities pose risks  similar  to

those    of   facilities   that   clear   exchange-traded

instruments.  It would, therefore, be prudent for MAS  to

have  the  power  to  regulate such  clearing  facilities

operating in Singapore or targeting Singaporean investors

where they pose risks to MAS' regulatory objectives.

<br>5.10 pm



<br><br><i>Temporary licensing regime</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of MAS' ongoing review of the licensing

regime,  and  in response to feedback from the  industry,

MAS  will be introducing a temporary licensing regime for

individuals.  Clause  36 allows MAS  to  issue  temporary

licences  to  individuals residing outside Singapore  who

plan  to engage in regulated activities in Singapore,  on

behalf of a locally-licensed entity, but for a short-term

basis.   The  application process will be simplified  and

processing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3063</b></font><br><br>



time   will  be  shortened.   This  will  give  financial

institutions   flexibility   in   deploying    specialist

expertise on a short-term basis.



<br><br><i>Flexibility of administration</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Bill will seek to give MAS greater

flexibility  in  carrying out its duties.   For  example,

clause 45 will empower MAS to issue rules on the training

and  qualifications  of representatives  through  written

directions rather than subsidiary legislation.   MAS  may

change  these requirements without needing to go  through

the  process of promulgating subsidiary legislation,  and

any changes can then come into effect immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 100 will empower MAS to appoint its senior

officers   to   grant  or  revoke  specified   regulatory

exemptions on a case-by-case basis.  Such exemptions need

not  be  published in the Government Gazette.  MAS  needs

only  notify the exempted entity in writing.   This  will

shorten  MAS'  response  time to  applications  for  such

exemptions.   For  example, time-sensitive  requests  for

exemptions  from prospectus rules are quite common.   The

result  is  that  MAS  will  then  be  able  to  be  more

responsive to the needs of a rapid changing marketplace.



<br><br><i>Reduction in regulatory and compliance costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to reduce regulatory and

compliance  costs, where these do not afford commensurate

protection  to the investors.  Clause 49 will remove  the

requirement  for  licence holders to sign  circulars  and

other written communications sent by them, and to shorten

the retention period for such materials from seven to six

years.    This  is  in  line  with  the  record   keeping

requirements  in other parts of the SFA,  and  consistent

with  the statutory period of limitations for contractual

actions under the Limitation Act (Cap. 163).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other changes aimed at cutting regulatory and

compliance costs will be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3064</b></font><br><br>



in the subsidiary legislation promulgated by MAS, as part

of  MAS'  ongoing review to ensure that its rules  remain

relevant and business-friendly.



<br><br><i>Opportunity to be heard</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, MAS has been vested, under the SFA, with

administrative  powers, including  powers  to  revoke  or

suspend    licences    of    corporations    and    their

representatives, approve markets and clearing facilities,

and  issue  stop  orders on offers of  investment.   Such

powers will be exercised judiciously by MAS to pursue its

statutory  objectives.   In line with  rules  of  natural

justice,  the SFA provides for opportunities to be  heard

to  parties  who  are  aggrieved by  MAS'  administrative

decisions.  The Bill extends the opportunity to be  heard

to a wider range of MAS' decisions that could potentially

affect an applicant's interests adversely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA currently provides a list of exceptions to

the  opportunity  to be heard.  The intent  behind  these

exceptions  was  to dispense with the opportunity  to  be

heard  where the original decision was based on objective

facts  and it would be improbable for MAS to reverse  its

decision as a result of new information introduced  at  a

hearing.   An example would be when the aggrieved  party,

or  a  related entity, was insolvent or near  insolvency.

The  Bill further narrows the list of exceptions  to  the

opportunity  to  be  heard to cases where  the  aggrieved

party  is already insolvent, or has been convicted of  an

offence  involving fraud or dishonesty.  These exceptions

constitute  a  small  and  unambiguous  subset   of   the

circumstances under which MAS would want to exercise  its

administrative powers in protecting the interests of  the

investing  public.  Nevertheless, parties who are  denied

an  opportunity to be heard will still have the right  to

appeal to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the capital markets are constantly evolving,

and the regulatory framework must therefore keep pace  to

remain  responsive and relevant.  But we must be  mindful

that  the  SFA  is a relatively new piece of  legislation

that both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3065</b></font><br><br>



MAS  and the industry are still growing into.  Thus, only

minor  changes  have been introduced  in  this  round  of

amendments and other more substantive policy reforms have

been deferred to the second half of 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives us a chance to improve and clarify

aspects  of the SFA. Many of these amendments, especially

those to implement the Company Legislation and Regulatory

Framework  Committee's recommendations, will help  reduce

business costs in Singapore.  MAS will continue to engage

in  discussions with industry practitioners and  to  take

more  of their suggestions on board for the second  phase

of amendments in 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ADVISERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Advisers Act (FAA) was passed

concurrently with the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) in

October  2001 as part of the major revamp of  Singapore's

capital markets regulatory framework.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3066</b></font><br><br>



The FAA consolidates in a single piece of legislation the

rules  for  financial advisers and their  representatives

when  giving  financial  advice on  investment  products,

marketing  collective  investment schemes  and  arranging

contracts  of life insurance policies.  These rules  were

previously  found in separate legislation -  the  Futures

Trading  Act, the Insurance Intermediaries  Act  and  the

Securities  Industry  Act.  These  Acts  have  now   been

repealed.  The  FAA  establishes a consistent  regulatory

framework  for  financial advisory  services  across  the

financial services industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the FAA will also be amended in two phases.

This  will  parallel the legislative review of  the  SFA.

The first phase has culminated in this Bill where MAS has

proposed some technical modifications. The second  phase,

which involves more in-depth policy reviews, is scheduled

to be completed in the second half of 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS conducted a public consultation review in April

2003.   MAS'  detailed reply to the comments received  in

the course of the public consultation is published on its

website.   Madam, let me now highlight the key amendments

that are proposed in this Bill.



<br><br><i>Exclusion of life reinsurance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the definition of "life policy" in

section  2(1)  to  exclude  any contract  of  reinsurance

because life reinsurance activities are already regulated

by  MAS under the Insurance Act (Chapter 142).  With this

amendment,  a  person conducting any  activity  involving

contracts   of  reinsurance  is  only  subject   to   the

requirements  of  the Insurance Act.  The  FAA  will  not

apply.



<br><br><i>Representatives  of financial advisers  must  be  natural persons</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill clarifies that only natural persons can act

as  representatives of financial advisers.  This  ensures

proper accountability by the principal for the conduct of

the representative.  Corporate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3067</b></font><br><br>



entities  will not be permitted to act as representatives

of financial advisers.



<br><br><i>Greater scope for MAS to issue written directions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General or specific written directions are legally

enforceable.  Clause 19 amends section 58 to empower  MAS

to  issue written directions to representatives of exempt

financial  advisers. This amendment  will  harmonise  the

application of section 58 for representatives of licensed

financial   advisers   and  representatives   of   exempt

financial  advisers.  While  representatives  of   exempt

financial   advisers   are  not  required   to   hold   a

representative's licence, the business conduct  rules  of

the FAA will apply to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable MAS to respond quickly to time-sensitive

industry  developments  or  requests  from  the  industry

participants,  the amended section 58  also  expands  the

scope  that written directions can cover.  I have earlier

noted  a  similar amendment in the Securities and Futures

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the following are also amendments that are

common to the SFA Bill and this Bill.



<br><br><i>Communications containing recommendations on securities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial advisers will no longer be required to

sign  circulars  or  other  communications  that  contain

recommendations on securities.  MAS has received feedback

from the industry that the requirement for a signature is

administratively  difficult.  MAS has  decided  that  the

requirement   can   be   removed   without   compromising

investors'  interest  because  financial  advisers   will

remain  accountable for their recommendations. The number

of  years that such documents have to be retained will be

reduced from seven years to six years.



<br><br><i>Opportunity to be heard and appointment of officers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill's proposed amendments to the provisions

relating to "the opportunity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3068</b></font><br><br>



be  heard"  and "MAS' powers to appoint its  officers  to

grant or revoke exemptions" mirror those proposed in  the

Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, the Bill draws on MAS' operational

experience in administering the FAA and feedback from the

industry to make a few technical refinements to the  Act.

To ensure that the FAA remains responsive to the industry

and investors, MAS has started work on the policy reviews

for  the  second phase of amendments to the FAA and  will

begin consulting with the industry later this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br>5.22 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, section 126 of the Evidence Act safeguards

confidential   official   communications    from    being

disclosed,  when disclosure would be detrimental  to  the

public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, this protection is only applicable with

respect  to confidential official communications made  to

"public officers".  The term "public officer" as used  in

the  Evidence Act does not include officers and employees

of  statutory  bodies,  even  when  they  are  exercising

official   functions  similar  to  those  of   Government

agencies and receive confidential communications  in  the

course of discharging their functions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 126 was drafted at a time when almost all

governmental   functions  were   performed   within   the

Government.   Over the years, however, many  governmental

functions  have increasingly been devolved  to  statutory

bodies.   There  are  merits to such devolution.   A  key

benefit is the flexibility of statutory bodies to  better

harness  their professional capabilities and  concentrate

on developing their core competencies.  This ensures that

the   public  sector  continues  to  remain  nimble   and

responsive to challenges of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with the devolution of functions from

Ministries to statutory bodies, officers in the statutory

bodies   would   receive   such   confidential   official

information  in  the course of their work.  They  require

such  information in order to discharge  their  functions

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to conversion into a statutory body, the same

information would have been protected by section  126  of

the  Evidence Act because the officer would have received

such  information  as  a  Ministry  official.   With  the

conversion,  these  officers  are  no  longer  considered

"public  officers" within the scope of the Evidence  Act.

They  will not be protected under the Evidence  Act  from

disclosing confidential official communications in  court

proceedings  even  if this would be  detrimental  to  the

public interest.  Madam, this is not satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this Bill seeks to extend the protection of

section 126 to confidential official communications  made

to  officers  in selected statutory bodies.  In  essence,

the  effect  is to restore the position to  what  it  was

before the formation of the statutory body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to assure the House that

safeguards  are  in place to ensure that  this  amendment

will  not  lead  to  information being  unduly  withheld.

Firstly, this protection is not extended to all statutory

bodies,  but  only  to  those that  are  covered  by  the

Official  Secrets  Act.  Currently,  there  are  23  such

listed entities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3070</b></font><br><br>



out of about 70 statutory bodies.  Hence, we have avoided

a  wide  blunderbuss  approach, adopting  a  focused  and

calibrated one instead.  These statutory bodies that  are

listed  handle  official information  vital  to  national

security  or  national  interest.   Let  me  mention  two

examples  as  illustrations. The  Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore  (MAS) handles information that can impact  our

economic  security and that contain market sensitivities.

The  Defence  Science and Technology  Agency  (DSTA)  has

access   to   information   on  the   SAF's   development

infrastructure,  defence plans and weapons  capabilities.

Therefore, the protection against disclosure of  official

communications,  especially that between  the  Government

and  such organisations, is a logical extension of  their

coverage under the Official Secrets Act by virtue of  the

sensitive nature of the information they receive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new section 126(2) will not be

automatically invoked to prevent disclosure of all or any

information or communications that is reposed in a listed

statutory  body. It will only be invoked when  disclosure

of  the  information or communication  harms  the  public

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the track record on the invoking of section

126  should  give  some assurance.   The  Government  has

invoked  the existing section 126 sparingly thus far  and

only  after  careful consideration.  We  only  do  so  if

disclosure  will  harm the public  interest.   This  will

continue  to  be our approach under the expanded  section

126.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the courts will continue to play a role in

ensuring that the privilege under section 126 will not be

invoked to prevent all disclosures of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will ensure that official information

continues to be properly safeguarded and managed for  the

overall interest of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I rise in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3071</b></font><br><br>



support  of this Bill, but I have some concerns  which  I

hope the Senior Minister of State can address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fundamental principle of justice that

whenever  evidence is required of a case in  a  court  of

law,  such  evidence  should be  provided  unless  it  is

protected   by   well   established   privileges.    Such

privileges include legal professional privilege and state

privilege for affairs of state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this Bill extends the privilege, as explained

by  the Senior Minister of State, to officers other  than

public officers.  The Senior Minister of State says  that

it  extends  mainly to the statutory officers working  in

statutory  bodies  and  that,  currently,  they  are  not

covered  under  the original section 126(1).   Does  that

mean  that such officers are not to be regarded as public

officers  because of the devolution of statutory  bodies?

This is the first point I want to ask.  And if it is  the

case  then,  obviously, there is a reason to  extend  the

provision as suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on the discretion given to such

persons.   It is quite obvious, listening to  the  Senior

Minister  of State, that there would be about  70  bodies

that could be listed under the Official Secrets Act.   Is

it  a good idea to provide such a wide discretion to such

a  large  group of officers?  If we look at the  proposed

provision,  it says that the officer himself will  decide

whether  it is in the public interest or not to  disclose

the information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many jurisdictions, this is not the case. The

court  usually has the authority to go behind the  public

officer's  reasons or any officer's reasons, including  a

Minister's reasons, for disclosure.  They can examine the

official  communications before they allow such  evidence

to be withheld or order for disclosure.  So, I would like

to  ask  whether  it is intended, in this  provision,  to

provide such officers with the absolute discretion to say

whether  a  piece of evidence is or is not in the  public

interest  to  disclose.  If so, I think the provision  is

far too wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that

there are important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3072</b></font><br><br>



statutory  bodies  for  which such  provisions  are  very

critical for the proper working of such statutory bodies,

such  as the MAS.  But it has come to my notice that  the

schedule of the Official Secrets Act includes such bodies

as  the  National  Heritage Board.  If  such  bodies  are

included  in  the Schedule, I wonder why should  officers

serving  such  bodies,  firstly, be  under  the  Official

Secrets  Act and, secondly, be allowed to decide  whether

disclosure  of  historical  documents,  for  example,  be

regarded as detrimental to the public interest.  So,  the

question that I have for the Senior Minister of State is:

how do we ensure that when such an officer makes a claim,

there will be a check on whether such a claim is valid or

not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is that, as I look at the section, I

would like to ask the Senior Minister of State to confirm

that  any  officer  within this  provision  actually  can

consent to give evidence of such official communications,

and that even if the court were to disagree with him that

public  interest  would suffer but  if  he  decides  that

public  interest would not suffer by such disclosure,  he

would  be allowed to give the evidence.  I think this  is

implicit in the section.  Perhaps the Senior Minister  of

State can clarify on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mdm Deputy

Speaker, for allowing me to participate in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with concern the proposed amendment in the

Evidence Bill.  The Bill, in its original form and in the

proposed  amendment,  gives too much  discretion  to  the

person called to give evidence in court.  First, how  can

any  person, whether a member, officer or an employee of,

or  is  seconded to, any organisation under the  Official

Secrets Act or otherwise by his own consideration  refuse

to  give evidence and not be compelled by the court to do

so  to give evidence?  There must be a better determinant

than  the personal feeling and consideration from such  a

person.   The law should provide for a clearer  and  more

specific  determinant than a subjective phrase  "when  he

considers".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the meaning of "public interest" is not

defined,  explained or elaborated.  Who and what  defines

public interest?  What is of interest and concern to  the

public  may  be  pronounced  as  State  secrets  to   the

Government,  and  not in the interest of Singaporeans  to

know.  Abuse of power and official positions could set in

if  anything that is not in the favour of the  Government

or  officials is then classified as State secret and  not

publicly disclosed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current definition of "public interest", like

the OB markers, is subjective, evasive and free floating.

I  hope  the  Senior Minister of State can  give  a  more

specific meaning and definition of "public interest" and,

at  the  same time, give a better determinant to a person

called  to  give  evidence  how  and  when  not  to  give

evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the proposed

amendment  would allow more information  to  be  withheld

from the courts.  This will have the effect of increasing

secrecy  and make more organisations less transparent  to

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing section 126, Government officials

already   have   the  right  not  to  disclose   official

communication if they feel that it is not in  the  public

interest to do so.  "Public interest" is not defined  and

there is no requirement that the public official needs to

be  of  any rank.  Anyone in the public service can  make

this decision.  It can be subjective and arbitrary.  If a

document  is potentially embarrassing for the Government,

could  it be also under public interest to cover  up,  so

that people will still have confidence in the Government?

If  releasing  the document may result in the  Government

losing  a case, should the Government be the one deciding

whether it should be released?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts in Singapore have already said that under

section 126, the public officer's assessment that  public

interest  will suffer is conclusive, and the  court  will

not  question it.  This already places a heavy burden for

anyone who sues the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3074</b></font><br><br>



Government and wants to get access to the documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, by extending such a privilege now to 19 more

organisations, some of which are statutory boards, we are

putting more blindfolds on the eyes of the court.   I  am

concerned that such an amendment may render the court not

being  able to ascertain the facts of the case and  allow

justice  to slip away under the guise of public interest.

For  example,  if an employee of the CPF  Board  believes

that  he was unfairly dismissed, CPF Board officials  may

be  able  to resist disclosing communications surrounding

his  dismissal,  and he will be hampered in  proving  his

case in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scenario could be that a death occurs at the

premises of one of these organisations.  At the Coroner's

inquiry  into  the circumstances of the death,  even  the

Coroner will not be able to compel production of official

communications if the officials feel that it  is  not  in

the  public interest to disclose it.  This could lead  to

either an open verdict or even a verdict which is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, staff of these organisations are already

bound  under  the  Official Secrets  Act  not  to  reveal

official    communications   to   unauthorised   persons.

However,  what  the  Government  wants  to  do  by   this

amendment  will  deprive the courts of information  which

may  be  critical  in order to come to a  fair  and  just

decision.  We should protect the court's rights  to  have

all relevant information, as its decision will affect the

parties  and  also  the  public.   Moreover,  all   these

organisations    are   financed    by    public    funds.

Accountability   to   the  public   will   be   seriously

compromised if we allow the officials to decide  what  is

or is not in the public interest to disclose in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, in his speech, said

that there would be some safeguards on when to invoke the

provision.   May  I know what safeguards are  there,  who

decides  when  to  invoke  and when  not  to  invoke  the

provision?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I am not making a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3075</b></font><br><br>



speech.   I  just  want a clarification  on  a  practical

point.    How   does   an  employee,   in   a   protected

organisation,  know which documents are  subject  to  the

protection of section 126(2) of the amended Evidence Act?

There  are so many documents floating around.  And if  it

is  by chance that an employee takes out a document  from

the  office,  he  may be charged under  the  new  section

126(1).   In  case an employee takes out a document,  how

does  he  know that the document is protected  under  the

Act?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Madam, first, I think I

can deal quite quickly with Mr Chiam's point.  If we look

at  the  amendment under discussion, it  is  a  situation

where  a  person has been asked to participate  in  court

proceedings to either give information on the  stand,  or

through  interrogatory or discovery, to produce documents

before  the  court.  But if, in his view, the  disclosure

would  harm  public interest, then he will  say,  "No,  I

can't  do it."  What the provision says is that the court

would  then  not  be able to compel him,  because  he  is

exercising  a  privilege.  That is  the  context  of  the

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three general points that I want to make

first.   The  first  point  is that  the  thrust  of  the

speeches  of  the  Members who have spoken  is  that  the

section  is  too wide, either because public interest  is

not  defined or on the question of who is to decide.  But

the  backdrop  to this whole amendment  is  that  we  are

restoring  the  former  position, before  a  Ministry  or

department  is  converted to a statutory board,  eg,  the

Land  Office in the Ministry of Law, which was  converted

into the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).  The SLA is  one

of  the  bodies  listed  in  the  Schedule.   Before  the

conversion, the officers who were part of the Ministry of

Law would have handled confidential information as public

officers.  And in the case of the Land Office,  it  would

be  information  that  can impact,  for  example,  market

sensitivities  and  policy decisions on  how  we  acquire

land.   After the conversion to a statutory board,  these

officers who join the statutory board would be doing  the

same  thing.   They  would  still  have  access  to  such

information.  So, we are saying, "No, this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3076</b></font><br><br>



is  not a satisfactory position."  We have to continue to

protect  this  information from compulsory disclosure  in

court  if  it  is against public interest.  That  is  the

first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is these 23 statutory bodies have

been  carefully selected.  If you look at the list, which

is  set  out  in the Official Secrets Act, there  are  23

bodies  listed there.  So it is not 70 bodies.   I  think

Prof. Chin mentioned 70 bodies.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> You mentioned that

there  were 70 bodies.  With the possibility  of  all  of

them on it, that would make 70.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Correct. But to the

Ministries' credit, a careful analysis has been  done  to

ascertain  which  are the statutory  bodies  that  handle

information that is vital and disclosure of which, if  it

is  not  controlled, would be detrimental to the national

interest.  So, for example, you will see statutory bodies

there such as MAS, Defence Science and Technology Agency,

Singapore  Land Authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority,

Jurong Town Corporation and others.  So it is a carefully

selected  list,  showing that we have  taken  a  targeted

approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach we take in the new section 126(2) is

really  based on the existing approach in section  126(1)

or  the current section 126.  That is an important  point

because  we  are  basically taking an approach  that  has

worked.   The section has been there for many years,  and

how section 126 has been operated will give an indication

as to how new section 126(2) will be operated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we need section 126(2) because, and this is in

answer  to  Prof.  Chin's  point,  the  officers  in  the

statutory  boards will no longer be public officers.   So

they  are not covered under the current section  126  and

that is why we have a new section 126(2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though, prima facie, on the wording of the

section, the officer himself decides - if you look at how

section 126 has been operationalised over all these years

-  if  and  when an officer receives, as Prof. Chin  will

know, an application for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3077</b></font><br><br>



interrogatories or discovery of documents or information,

or subpoenaed to give evidence in court, or subpoenaed to

produce  documents,  he  will,  of  course,  consult  his

superiors  because  he  is doing  it  on  behalf  of  his

organisation.  And he will then decide whether or not the

disclosure will harm public interest, with the benefit of

legal  advice,  which  will include  the  advice  of  the

Attorney-General's  Chambers  who  after   all   is   the

custodian  of  public  interest.   So,  that  is  how  in

practice  this process will continue, both under  section

126,  as  it has been for many years, and under  the  new

section 126(2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is public interest? Mr Low Thia Khiang gave

certain  examples of whether or not if the officer  feels

that disclosure will harm his own interest, would he then

say  it  is  public  interest?  As I have  described  the

process, this will never happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public interest is certainly not the interest of the

officer  concerned.  It is not even the interest  of  the

organisation itself.  It is not even the interest of  the

Government  because  public  interest  really  means  the

national  interest,  ie, the interest  of  Singapore  and

Singaporeans,  like  you  and me,  and  Singaporeans  out

there.   So that is the context in which section 126  has

operated  for  many  years and as I  have  said,  it  has

operated satisfactorily.  It has not been invoked  willy-nilly,  but  only  after careful consideration,  in  good

faith, and only with regard to information, disclosure of

which will harm public interest.  In other words, not all

information  that  reposes in the 23  selected  statutory

boards  will be subject to this section.  There  will  be

careful consideration whether or not this privilege  will

be invoked.  So there are safeguards, both in the process

as well as in the courts playing a role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin mentioned the role of the courts in other

countries.  In Singapore, in fact, there have been  cases

where the courts have shown how they will play a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3078</b></font><br><br>



role.  For example, the court will decide whether or  not

the  communication or information has been given  to  the

officer in official confidence.  That they will do.  And,

secondly,  the determination of whether or not disclosure

will  harm  public interest, as Prof. Chin rightly  said,

will be for the person to decide.  But it must be made in

good   faith.    I   do   not  think  Parliament   should

circumscribe  how the courts will decide the  application

of  the  section.  But from the decided cases,  it  shows

that the courts do play a role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point is that Prof. Chin mentioned the

National Heritage Board.  I am sure he knows the National

Archives is part of the National Heritage Board.  In  the

National   Archives  will  be  found   many   unpublished

Government documents and other Government documents which

need  the protection. I think I have covered most of  the

points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A clarification from the Senior

Minister  of State.  At what level would the decision  be

made  whether to disclose a certain piece of  information

and  to decide whether the piece of information, when  it

is  disclosed,  would be harmful to the public  interest?

At what level of the organisation would such decisions be

made?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Low understands the

process.   The  trial  will take some  time  and  so  the

officer involved will receive, like I say, an application

for  discovery of documents or interrogatories.  When  he

receives  that,  of  course, he will surface  it  to  his

superiors  -  head  of  department,  probably  the  legal

officer  in  the  statutory body would be  involved,  and

inputs  would  then be sought from the Attorney-General's

Chambers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> So it is the Attorney-General's

Chambers  that will decide whether to disclose,  and  not

the  organisation  concerned.  Is  that  so?   The  final

decision will be made by the Attorney-General?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> With guidance and advice

from AGC.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3079</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, a

point  of  clarification.  The Senior Minister  of  State

said  that the current practice is that when the  officer

is  being  called, he will check with his  superiors  and

officers  whether he can give the information.  But  that

is  a practice and practice can change, and this practice

is not documented in words.  Should it not be better that

the  practice be put into words, in law, to make it clear

that  the  determination  in  this  case  would  be  more

concrete than the personal feelings of his consideration?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me explain why the

flexibility is needed as worded in section 126.   In  the

vast  majority of cases, there would be time  to  consult

because  there  would be interrogatories  and  discovery.

But  section 126 is framed in this way - and new  section

126(2) is based on the current section 126 which has been

there  for many years, and it works very well - to  cater

to  a  specific situation, rare though it may be, but  it

may  happen,  when  an  officer  is  actually  in  court,

involved  in a court case, and he is asked on  the  stand

certain  questions  which  may require  him  to  disclose

information which, in his view, may harm public interest.

The  section  must  be  wide  enough  to  allow  him  the

flexibility to say "no".  As far as I know, this has  not

happened,  but I think in the wisdom of the  drafters  of

the original section 126, and the section has worked well

all these years, it is better to keep it like that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, what

has  worked  in the past may not represent that  it  will

work  in the future.  The Senior Minister of State  said,

on  the  one  hand, that there is consultation  with  his

officer, but on the other hand, if he is asked,  then  he

has the flexibility.  That is where I am contending.  How

much  flexibility  should we give to the  person  by  his

personal  consideration?  I think  we  have  to  be  more

specific   in  that  determination.   Would  the   Senior

Minister  of  State  agree with  me  that  this  original

position  that was crafted 30 years ago is already  vague

and  unclear?   And  should any amendments  be  made,  it

should be made to be more specific than to make another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3080</b></font><br><br>



amendment to restore the Government's power back to  this

original position.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Madam, I thought I

explained  very  clearly  why  we  need  to  retain  this

flexibility.  The track record speaks for itself.  So,  I

am  not just talking in vacuum.  The practice has worked,

as  shown  by all these cases that have come  before  the

courts.   I  think we should retain it.  But  as  I  have

explained,  it is not a personal decision.  I think  that

is  his main concern.  It is not a personal decision.  It

does not happen that way.  When he receives an order from

the  court  by  the other party to produce documents,  he

just does not hide it himself.  He will consult the other

people I have mentioned.  So I think Mr Chia should  rest

assured.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get further clarification

from  the  Senior  Minister  of  State?   I  believe  the

practice  in  England is for the judge  to  decide  which

document  is  of national interest.  I think  that  is  a

better practice.  Because if you leave it to the head  of

the Government department and it goes to the AG to make a

decision, it cannot be seen publicly that this  is  going

to  be an unbiased decision.  What happens if there is  a

decision that is going to embarrass the Government if  it

goes  in  one  way?   Can  the AG  or  the  head  of  the

department still decide with impartiality?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First of all, let me say

that  different jurisdictions will have to find different

approaches to questions like that, which involve national

interest.   We  cannot  just pluck  examples  from  other

countries   and   say  they  must  apply  in   Singapore.

Secondly, as I have said, the courts actually do  have  a

role.  It is not as though they do not play a role.  And,

indeed,  there  have been cases which show  there  is  an

established test as to how the courts would look  at  the

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just briefly say that, from the cases, the

courts  would apply a two-stage test to determine whether

the  privilege can be claimed.  First, the court must  be

satisfied that the communication in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3081</b></font><br><br>

question was, in fact, made in official confidence.  And,

second, while it is for the person claiming the privilege

to  determine whether the public interest would suffer by

the  disclosure,  the court must be satisfied  that  such

determination  was,  in fact, made  in  good  faith.   So

ultimately it is not a matter of the court not  having  a

role.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Would the Senior

Minister  of  State agree with me that if there  was  any

claim  that any party can think unjustified, their  claim

that  public  interest has suffered, was  an  unjustified

claim,  such  a party can actually bring a constitutional

action  to say that the public officer or the officer  in

the  statutory board had acted either capriciously in bad

faith  or  otherwise?  Is that not  true?   So  there  is

actually  a legal remedy for such instances even  if  the

discretion is subjective.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Of course, there are

these administrative actions and judicial review.  If you

can  satisfy  the  court that you have locus  standi,  as

Prof.  Chin says, there are other actions which  you  can

pursue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, can

the  Senior  Minister of State give us an assurance  that

such flexibility as required will not lead to an abuse of

power or privileges?  I just need an assurance.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Madam, this Government

stands  on its record, as I have said.  The integrity  of

the  system is at stake.  If the AGC is involved  in  the

determination,  why  should I  give  an  assurance  here?

There have been no accusations of bias or wrong-doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Senior Minister of State has

been  talking  about deciding whether  a  document  is  a

secret document, but I think the more important issue now

we  are  discussing is whether that document  contains  a

public  interest.   So who is to decide  what  is  public

interest?  I think that is the issue.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3082</b></font><br><br>



words  "public  interest" mean a lot of  things  to  many

people.   For a defendant, if his life is at stake,  this

is  an  important  issue, and you cannot  go  and  get  a

manager  of  a  statutory board or the AG to  decide.   I

think the judge should be deciding.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Madam, I think I have

answered  the points already.  If Mr Chiam looks  at  the

specific section, it is not a matter of the production of

documents, the consideration is whether the disclosure of

communications made to him in official confidence will be

detrimental  to public interest.  And he decides  not  in

isolation, but in consultation with his superiors in  the

organisation  and  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers.   I

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House seeks to revise the law

in   respect  of  building  control  for  the   following

objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Introduce a performance-based regulatory system

to  allow for design flexibility and encourage innovation

in the construction industry;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Facilitate Design and Build (D&B) methods of

procurement in the construction industry; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Streamline and improve the regulation of

buildings   and   the  architectural   and   professional

engineering services.

<br><br><i>Performance-based regulatory system</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me explain the proposed amendments in

detail.    Currently,   our  building   regulations   are

prescriptive in nature.  They are time-tested  and  well-proven  design  practices  and solutions.   However,  the

weakness  of such a system is that it does not allow  the

Qualified  Persons (QPs) to propose alternative  building

design solutions.  QPs have also told us that this system

does  not  promote  innovation and may  create  technical

barriers to designers who are creative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-based building codes, on the other hand,

require the QPs to comply with objectives and performance

requirements   for   the  design  and   construction   of

buildings.  It is not mandatory that the QP must follow a

specific  design  solution.   Design  QPs  are  free   to

exercise  greater  flexibility and  creativity  in  their

design   solutions   so  long  as  the   objectives   and

performance requirements are met.  In this way,  QPs  can

be  more  responsive to market requirements  and  propose

more  cost-effective  solutions  which  best  meet  their

clients' needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-based building codes are not new. They

have been adopted in developed countries, like the United

Kingdom  in  1987, New Zealand in 1992 and  Australia  in

1994.  However, it is a significant change in the concept

of building control in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has

consulted  extensively with the industry in  working  out

the  performance-based  regulatory  system.   A  Building

Control  Regulations (BCR) Committee comprising  industry

representatives was formed in the year 2000 to study  the

implications of this new regime to industry practice, and

to   review  the  scope  and  contents  of  the  proposed

performance-based building regulations.  Proposed changes

were posted on BCA's website for public feedback and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3084</b></font><br><br>



comments.   BCA  also organised a forum  last  year  with

representatives   from   the   Singapore   Institute   of

Architects, Institution of Engineers Singapore and  other

relevant  professional bodies to clarify queries  in  the

new system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me elaborate on the specific amendments

to  the Building Control Act.  The Bill amends section 49

to   provide   for   the   objectives   and   performance

requirements to be specified in the building regulations.

It  also amends section 9 to provide two options for  the

design   QP   to   comply   with  the   performance-based

regulations.   First,  the  QP  can  continue  to   adopt

acceptable  solutions  set out  by  the  Commissioner  of

Building Control and be deemed to have complied with  the

performance  objectives.   The  QP  can  also  adopt   an

alternative design solution so long as he certifies  that

his  solution  satisfies  the  specified  objectives  and

performance requirements.  He can also engage a second QP

to  jointly certify his design.  This allows a design  QP

to  collaborate  with a specialist QP on the  alternative

design solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current regulatory framework places

responsibility on the QPs for their work.  This continues

to  be the underlying regulatory philosophy under the new

system.  The amended section 9 requires the design QP  to

take all reasonable steps in ensuring that building works

are designed in accordance with the provisions of the Act

and  the  building regulations.  Greater  flexibility  in

design   solutions  comes  with  the  responsibility   of

ensuring  that the alternative design is safe  and  meets

the  specified performance objective.  If the  design  QP

proposes  an  alternative  design,  he  should  be  in  a

position  to take responsibility for his design.   If  he

engages  a  second  QP,  that second  QP  must  take  all

reasonable  steps  to exercise that the  design  complies

with the requirements of the Act before certifying it.



<br><br><i>Design and Build (D&B) methods of procurement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I shall now move on to the

amendments to facilitate Design and Build (D&B).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the traditional "design-bid-build" (DBB)

system,  the  design  QP will complete  the  design  with

little  input  from  the builder.   Once  the  design  is

finalised,  it  is  difficult for  the  builder  to  make

changes  or  to suggest alternative construction  methods

without major redesign works upstream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1999 Construction 21 (C21) Report on Re-inventing Construction, one of its key strategic thrusts

is  to adopt an integrated approach to construction.   It

identified  the Design and Build process as  one  of  the

procurement  methods for construction which  can  achieve

closer  integration.   In a D&B arrangement,  the  client

enters into a single contract with one entity.  And  this

entity  is  responsible  for both the  architectural  and

engineering   designs   as   well   as   the   subsequent

construction  works.  The inputs of the  various  players

can be integrated upfront at the design stage.  Incidents

of re-works will be minimised.  And the result is savings

in cost and time for the client.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&B is being practised in some projects today.

Builders   can   approach  architects  and   professional

engineers  to  work on projects as a team  on  an  ad-hoc

basis.  In these projects, the client pays and treats the

builder  and  professionals as different  entities.   The

drawback  of such arrangements is that the D&B teams  are

not  permanent.  Any synergy and experience will  not  be

accumulated and built upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also legal impediments to other types of

D&B  arrangements.  The Architects Act  and  Professional

Engineers   Act  do  not  allow  any  person   to   offer

architectural  and  professional  engineering   services,

unless   he   is  a  registered  architect,  professional

engineer  or  licensed  corporation.   An  architect  and

professional  engineer  also cannot  supply  professional

services in respect of any project in which he is  acting

as a builder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C21 Report recommended reviewing the relevant

legislation  to remove any legal impediments against  D&B

projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3086</b></font><br><br>



BCA  therefore  set  up  a committee  in  2000  involving

representatives   from   the   Singapore   Institute   of

Architects, Institution of Engineers Singapore, Singapore

Contractors   Association  Limited  and  other   relevant

professional  bodies  to  review  the  legislation.    It

recommended  several  amendments  to  be  made   to   the

Architects  Act, the Professional Engineers Act  and  the

Building  Control Act.  The Board of Architects  and  the

Professional  Engineers Board were also  consulted.   The

proposed amendments have been incorporated in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, without the amendments in this Bill, D&B can

still  carry on the way it has always been done with  the

builders  and professionals working together, but,  as  I

said, on an ad-hoc basis and as separate entities.   With

the  amendments, there are more avenues for D&B  to  take

place.   Architects or professional engineers  can  offer

D&B  without tying up with a builder firm.  Builders  can

offer   D&B   packages   jointly  with   architects   and

professional engineers.  Licensed corporations can  offer

D&B services.  The amendments will provide a single point

of  contact for the client.  The industry will have  more

choices  of D&B arrangements to meet its needs.   Let  me

now elaborate on the specific amendments.



<br><br><i>Facilitate  builders and professionals to  undertake  D&B projects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new subsection is added to section 10 of both Acts

to  allow  a  builder  to offer to the  developer  all-in

services jointly with architects and engineers as  a  D&B

team.  The Regulations of the two professional Acts  will

also  be  amended  to allow an architect or  professional

engineer to supply the professional services in the  same

project in which he is acting as a builder.



<br><br><i>Facilitate licensed corporation to undertake D&B projects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations licensed by the Board of Architects and

Professional Engineers Board are currently not allowed to

provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3087</b></font><br><br>



design  services and be the builder for the same project,

unless   specifically  requested  by  the  client.    The

Regulations of the two professional Acts will be  amended

to allow licensed corporations to provide D&B services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage builders to form licensed corporations

to  offer  a  full  range  of  services  from  design  to

construction, the Bill proposes to relax the requirements

on  the  chairman  and directorship control  of  licensed

limited  corporations  in  the  two  professional   Acts.

Directorship  control  by  registered  professionals   in

licensed  limited corporations will be lowered from  two-thirds  to a simply majority.  The need for the  chairman

of  the  licensed limited corporation to be a  registered

professional is removed.



<br><br><i>Corresponding changes in Building Control Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding amendments are made to the Building

Control  Act to facilitate the D&B arrangement.   At  the

same time, sufficient safeguards are maintained to ensure

building safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends section 6 of the Building Control

Act  to allow the builder in a D&B project to appoint the

design  QP and supervising QP for the project.   However,

the  supervising QP for a project that is required to  be

checked  by  an  accredited  checker  (AC)  has   to   be

independent  of  the builder.  Hence, the supervising  QP

cannot  be a partner, officer or employee of the  builder

or  any  of  the  builder's  associates.   Projects  that

require  checks  by ACs are usually the bigger  and  more

complex projects.  The independence of the supervising QP

is  necessary in such projects to minimise situations  of

conflict  of  interest.  This will also ensure  that  the

building  works  can  be  constructed  with  proper   and

impartial supervision.



<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my Ministry is also proposing other

amendments  to  streamline and improve the regulation  of

buildings and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3088</b></font><br><br>



the architectural and professional engineering services.



<br><br><i>Streamlining building work process</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, after obtaining approvals for building

plans,  owners  are  also required to obtain  permits  to

commence works from the Commissioner of Building  Control

before they can start construction.  This is to allow the

Commissioner to revoke the permit and stop works,  should

the  construction  works pose danger  to  the  public  or

neighbouring properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as non-structural building works usually do

not  have safety issues, clause 5 amends section  7  such

that  only  structural  works are required  to  obtain  a

permit  to commence work.  This will allow non-structural

building works to commence immediately after approval  of

plans.   As a safeguard, a new section 7A is inserted  to

empower  the  Commissioner  to  stop  any  non-structural

building  works,  if  they pose a  danger  to  public  or

neighbouring properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, amendments are made to section 49 to

allow  the Commissioner to require additional information

and  documents to be submitted during the application  of

Temporary  Occupation Permit and Certificate of Statutory

Completion.   This will enable better evaluation  of  the

applications.



<br><br><i>Recovery of cost of engaging an expert</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, there had been cases in the past where

building  works were constructed in such  a  manner  that

rendered   the  works  unsafe  or  likely  to   lead   to

instability.   In  such incidents,  BCA  had  to  put  in

additional  manpower and resources to monitor the  safety

of the affected building or building works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation into the causes of the building's

instability  is  highly technical  and  complex.   It  is

prudent  for  the Commissioner to engage  an  independent

specialist  consultant to give him an independent  second

opinion.  However, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3089</b></font><br><br>



Commissioner  had to bear such costs in the  past,  which

far  exceeded the plan fees collected.  The problem could

be due to either design or construction inadequacies.  As

such, instead of paying such costs with public funds, the

owner  or developer of the project should bear the  costs

of  engaging  the specialist consultant.   To  this  end,

section 23 has been amended to enable the Commissioner of

Building  Control  to  recover  the  costs  incurred   in

engaging  the expert from the developer or owner  of  the

building works.



<br><br><i>Review  of  penalties  for  offence  under  the  Building Control Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my Ministry has also reviewed the penalty

provisions for the different types of offences under  the

Building Control Act.  I shall now explain these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the collapse of the roof of

Compassvale  School in 2001, which was  attributed  to  a

structural  design flaw, section 9(5A) was introduced  to

require the QP responsible for structural design to  take

reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in  complying

with  the Act and the building regulations.  The  maximum

penalty  for a design QP for structural works for failing

in  this duty is a fine of $100,000 and/or a jail term of

not more than 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a QP fails in his professional duties,

it   should  not  matter  whether  he  is  dealing   with

structural design or non-structural design.  He should be

subjected  to  the same penalty provision  for  the  same

offence  of not exercising due diligence in carrying  out

his professional duties.  Lapses in non-structural design

could also result in serious consequences.  Section 9(5A)

is, thus, amended to extend the same duty and penalty  to

the QP for non-structural designs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A builder's responsibility to carry out building

works in accordance with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3090</b></font><br><br>



approved design and under the supervision of a QP  is  as

important  as the design QP's responsibility in  ensuring

the  safety  of his design.  If the design is robust  but

building  works  are not carried out  according  to  this

design, then the result could be an unsafe building.  The

amendments  in  sections 8(2), 9(5A) and  11(5)  set  the

maximum penalty for a builder who fails to discharge  his

responsibilities to be on par with that of a  design  QP,

ie, $100,000 fine and/or 12 months' jail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervising QP and Accredited Checker (AC)

perform  similar check-and-balance roles  in  supervising

the  builder's  work  and checking  the  QP's  structural

design,  respectively.  The Bill, therefore, proposes  to

set  the  maximum  penalty for  the  supervising  QP  for

failure  in  carrying out his role at the same  level  as

that  of the Accredited Checker, ie, $50,000 fine  and/or

12  months'  jail.  The relevant amendment  is  found  in

section 9(4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend section 5 to increase the

maximum   penalty  for  any  person  who   commences   or

authorises the commencement of any building works without

approval  or  permit.  The increase is from  the  current

$50,000  fine  and/or 12 months' jail  to  $100,000  fine

and/or  12  months' jail.  The upward revision underlines

the severity of the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the changes which I have mentioned are the

maximum penalties for the various parties involved in the

construction process.  It is for the courts to  mete  out

the  appropriate  penalty,  based  on  the  severity  and

circumstances of the offence.



<br><br><i>Introduction of continuing professional development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the Architects Act and

Professional  Engineers  Act  to  require  a   registered

architect   or  professional  engineer  to  comply   with

prescribed    requirements   relating    to    continuing

professional development as part of the criteria to renew

his  practising certificate.  This is to ensure that  the

architects and professional engineers continue to stay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3091</b></font><br><br>



abreast  of developments in their respective fields.   It

emphasises  the  importance of training and  professional

development   to   maintain   the   high   standards   of

architectural and professional engineering  practices  in

Singapore.



<br><br><i>Streamlining of requirement for licensed corporations and partnerships</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill proposes to remove the requirement

for  the  director  overseeing the professional  services

offered  by  a licensed corporation or partnership  under

the Architects Act and the Professional Engineers Act, to

be  resident  in Singapore.   This is in  view  that  the

Building Control Act is already holding the appointed QPs

responsible   for   the  certification   of   plans   and

supervision of building works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this Bill proposes changes that will

enable the construction industry to be more efficient and

integrated.   D&B  arrangements will be  facilitated  and

building  processes streamlined.  It will also allow  for

greater  design  flexibility and innovation.   Continuous

learning   amongst   our  architects   and   professional

engineers is encouraged through implementing performance-based    regulations    and    continuing    professional

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.  Let me highlight

three  key  areas of the Bill, which I hope the  Minister

will clarify.



<br><br><i>Performance-based regulatory system</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries have implemented performance-based

building regulations but found that most designers  still

follow   the  prescriptive  solutions.   In  fact,   many

designers  have  developed a strong  dependence  on  test

methods  that  do  not  clearly  demonstrate  real  world

performance.    This   situation  occurs   because   many

designers are not familiar with performance-based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3092</b></font><br><br>



regulatory  system.  Some do not have  the  expertise  to

implement the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the initiative to move towards a

performance-based regulatory system in Singapore.  But  I

wish  to seek clarifications from the Minister concerning

the  desired outcomes of such a proposal, and what is the

state  of  readiness  of  our  construction  industry  to

implement the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, a performance-based regulatory system

should achieve three desired outcomes, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) It should provide more flexibility in design



and construction solutions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) It should encourage more innovation in the

industry; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) It should reduce the total life cycle costs of

a building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must clearly define these desired outcomes

and   quantify  them  to  monitor  the  success  of   the

performance-based  system.   With  the  performance-based

approach,  designers  and builders  will  now  have  more

flexibility to propose more innovative solutions to their

clients.   This  will encourage the use of more  building

materials and systems, thus facilitating more trades.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may be good to give a boost to the

economy,  we  must  make sure that the industry  has  the

necessary expertise to evaluate the performance of  these

building  materials  and  systems.   In  Singapore,   the

building  booms  in the 80s and 90s had  resulted  in  an

influx  of a wide range of building materials and systems

in our built environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, town councils, management corporations and

building  owners  are  faced with a host  of  maintenance

problems,   such  as  high  maintenance,  operation   and

replacement  costs  of all these materials  and  systems.

While  some  of these innovative solutions  have  worked,

others have failed, due to various reasons, such as  poor

design, poor selection of materials, poor workmanship  or

wrong usage.  For example, town



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3093</b></font><br><br>



councils  have  to  maintain so many different  types  of

lighting   systems  in  our  estates  due  to  innovative

designs.     This   has   increased   maintenance    cost

drastically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am indeed concerned about the repercussions

of   a   performance-based  system  in   our   "immature"

construction  industry.   I  would  like  to  seek   some

clarifications from the Minister on the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How will the performance-based system change

the industry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What are the key benefits of the system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How will it affect the laws?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) How will it impact upon our building standards,

ie, Singapore Standards, and Codes of Practice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) What are the liabilities and risk transfers

between the authorities and building practitioners?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Are the authorities and practitioners equipped

with the expertise to implement the system?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to adopt a holistic approach to

ensure  that the performance-based regulatory  system  is

complemented by expertise, accountability and responsible

allocation  of  risks.  We must clearly set  quantitative

performance  measures  to facilitate  the  fulfilment  of

contractual  obligations.  Experience in New Zealand  has

shown  that one of the key reasons that led to  the  slow

embracement of performance culture is that the  benchmark

of  skills  is  too  low.  Thus, we  need  to  conduct  a

thorough  evaluation to ensure that we have the expertise

to support a performance-based system in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Design and Build procurement arrangements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the amendments to facilitate the

Design   and  Build  procurement  arrangements   in   the

construction industry.  This arrangement will facilitate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3094</b></font><br><br>



teamwork among the designers and builders in the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the perennial problems faced by the

construction industry is the separation of the design and

construction processes, which are undertaken by different

parties,  namely, the designers and builders.   This  has

led  to the development of an "adversarial culture" among

the  design  and building teams, which often  results  in

much  unproductive and abortive work.  To  aggravate  the

situation, standard contract forms for building  projects

are  usually  not  drafted with fair  contract  terms  to

allocate the risks and responsibilities among contractual

parties.   Under such an operating environment,  building

projects   usually  encounter  lots  of  problems,   thus

affecting productivity and quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to address this undesirable state of

the  construction industry and make changes to facilitate

a  "teamwork" approach in carrying out building projects.

The adoption of Design and Build procurement arrangements

is  one  way  in  which  we can "house"  the  design  and

construction teams under one roof.  It provides a  single

point  responsibility,  and  facilitates  teamwork  among

designers and builders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful completion of a building project

depends on many parties, namely, the architect, engineer,

quantity  surveyor and the builder.  Therefore,  we  must

adopt   an   integrated  approach  to   encourage   joint

responsibility among the parties involved in the project.

Instead  of appointing a qualified person who  is  either

the architect or engineer, we should appoint qualified or

licensed  corporations which have a team  of  architects,

engineers,  quantity  surveyors and builders  to  provide

design and construction services.  Thus, I would urge the

Government to take the lead in promoting Design and Build

construction in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Powers of Commissioner of Building Control</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the Commissioner

of Building Control can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3095</b></font><br><br>

recover the cost of engaging an expert to investigate and

advise on rectification works from the developer or owner

if  the  Commissioner is of the opinion that the on-going

construction  works  are,  or  are  likely  to  lead   to

instability or collapse of the building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, section 23 of the Building Control Act

clearly  states that the Commissioner of Building Control

may  make an order to require building owners to take the

necessary measures for dangerous buildings, and  penalise

the owner accordingly for non-compliance.  As such, I  do

not  see  why the Commissioner needs additional power  to

engage an expert for investigations and tests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the liabilities of the Commissioner, if the

expert  whom he commissions makes omissions  or  acts  of

negligence in the investigations or tests?  Can the owner

challenge  the  findings of the  expert  engaged  by  the

Commissioner?  Are the findings final?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I do not think it is the responsibility of

the  Commissioner  to investigate and conduct  tests  for

dangerous buildings. This should be the responsibility of

the  developers  or  owners.  I hope the  Minister  could

clarify  on  the need for the Commissioner to  have  such

powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Madam, I would like a

clarification  from  the Minister.  Not  that  long  ago,

somebody complained in the local newspapers that  he  had

to  pay  about  $2,600  for  his  building  plans  to  be

approved.  My question is: why should such an application

be  so costly?  I also understand that if the applicant's

plans  are  rejected, all his application fees  shall  be

forfeited.  Why should this be so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first of all,

let  me  address the points which Dr Teo Ho Pin made.   I

would like to thank him, first of all, for supporting the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made three very pertinent points. I would

address them in turn. First of all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3096</b></font><br><br>



on  the  performance-based regulatory system.  As Dr  Teo

said,  and  I agree with him, even though many  countries

have implemented these performance-based regulations,  it

does  mean  that  they  will automatically  follow  these

regulations.   In fact, I understand most  designers  and

design  qualified  persons still follow the  prescriptive

system.  It is quite understandable because it is a safer

route  as  it is well-established.  Why should  they  try

something  different?  But this is precisely  the  point.

Even  though it is a safer route, the prescriptive system

does impose certain restrictions.  This is why we want to

try   to   implement  the  performance-based  system   in

Singapore to encourage innovation and flexibility.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not saying that with this implementation of

the performance-based system in Singapore, we want design

qualified  persons  to  move away from  the  prescriptive

solution.   What we are saying is that you can  do  both.

You  can either stick to the prescriptive solution if you

wish  to, or now you are given this flexibility  to  look

for  more innovative solutions, something which hopefully

can  cut costs and give more flexibility. That is  why  I

agree with Dr Teo that the three desired outcomes of more

flexibility, more innovation and cost reduction  must  be

borne in mind when we implement this system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also concur with Dr Teo's point that the system

must  be  complemented  by expertise  accountability  and

responsible allocation of risks.  I think the  amendments

that  we  are going to make in this Bill have  adequately

taken   these   into  consideration.   The   duties   and

responsibilities  of  the  design  QPs   are   adequately

defined.   The  engagement of  a  second  QP  to  certify

alternative solutions is meant to address this  issue  of

expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of transfer of risks and

liabilities  between  the authorities  and  the  building

professionals,  I  wish to assure him that  there  is  no

transfer  of  risk.  Currently, the  design  QP  has  the

statutory  duty to comply with the prescriptive solutions

under  our  current  building  regulations.   Under   the

performance-based  system,  his  statutory   duties   are

unchanged. They remain the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3097</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Dr Teo has rightly pointed out, this is

something new for the local industry.  I expect that  the

local industry and the local professionals will take time

to  get  used  to  the idea, and also  to  build  up  the

expertise, experience and the confidence to try out  this

new  system.   What  BCA can do will be  to  promote  the

system  by organising seminars, answering queries through

workshops, explaining the implementation details  to  the

professionals.  Hopefully, if we can allow  some  of  the

professionals  to  take this performance-based  approach,

and   in  the  process,  come  up  with  more  innovative

solutions which will give them more flexibility  and,  at

the  same  time,  reduce costs for  them  and  for  their

clients, then it will have been worth it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On design and build, Dr Teo has reiterated the point

that  this is a good approach, ie, the teamwork approach,

that  all  professionals involved must work  together  in

order  to  achieve the desired outcome and for Government

to  take  the  lead. Certainly, he would know  that  many

public  sector agencies have actually taken  this  design

and  build approach - the HDB, the old PWD, MINDEF.   The

design  and build approach has produced results.  It  has

shown  itself to be a good way of doing things.  What  we

are doing now is to facilitate this and to make sure that

we  remove any impediments in the Acts which currently do

not allow design and build arrangements to be carried out

in  the private sector.  I would like to thank Dr Teo for

his   support  for  this  amendment  to  facilitate  this

arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point he made was about the powers of the

Commissioner of Building Control.  He asked why there  is

a  need  to  engage an expert for investigation  and  for

testing  major buildings.  As I mentioned in  my  speech,

this is mainly for investigation and testing on major and

complex  structures  and  buildings  which  show  serious

design  or structural faults or distress, which may  lead

to    catastrophic   consequences.    It   is   in   such

circumstances that we reckon that the investigations  can

be highly complex and technical in nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3098</b></font><br><br>



This is why we are providing for the Commissioner to have

the  ability  to engage another expert to seek  a  second

opinion.   Not  only that, it is to make  sure  that  the

costs so incurred do not land with the public sector, but

with  those who are responsible for such an investigation

to  be  conducted  in the first place.  What  the  expert

would do is to be an adviser to the Commissioner. He will

assess  the  situation.  He will  investigate.   He  will

check  on  the  adequacy of the works, both  the  current

works and also the proposed rectification works and  will

give  an  expert advice to the Commissioner.  Of  course,

the  owner or the developer can also similarly engage  an

expert but, ultimately, what the Commissioner would  have

to  approve  are  the qualified person's recommendations.

It is an important provision because, as I have said, the

consequences  of  such distress or  shortcomings  may  be

catastrophic.   It is erring on the side  of  caution  to

seek  this  second opinion.  I hope I have  answered  the

questions raised by Dr Teo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked two questions which are unrelated to

the  Act  in question but, nevertheless, I would try  and

explain.  There is a fee that is levied on the submission

of  building plans.  Mr Chiam mentioned $2,600.  I am not

exactly  sure  whether this is a flat  fee.  I  think  it

varies,  depending on the complexity of the plans.   This

fee is to compensate the authority, ie, the public sector

agency,  for the costs incurred in processing the  plans.

As  he  may  know,  a building plan is a  highly  complex

document.   In  fact,  it can be  quite  voluminous.   It

involves many different agencies, from roads to drainage,

to  fire  safety, to structural safety, conformance  with

environmental requirements and so on, and so  forth.   It

involves many different agencies, although we have  tried

to streamline the process by having a one-stop submission

facility.   Nevertheless, even though it  is  a  one-stop

submission, many different experts and professionals  are

involved in processing the plan.  So, the costs that  are

incurred are not insubstantial.  In fact, if you  add  up

all  the manpower costs involved, you will find that  the

fee barely covers the costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the fee still levied, even if the plans are

rejected?  It is because the work has already been  done.

When  the  plan  is processed and it does  not  meet  the

requirements, ie, it is rejected, it does not  mean  that

you  return  the plan.  If that were the case,  everybody

just  submits any plan and just hopes for the plan to  be

rejected,  or, worse still, for the agency to  point  out

where the shortcomings are in the plan, tell them, return

the  plan  with the notes as to how to rectify  them  and

then  after that, get its feedback as well.  I think that

is really asking a bit too much.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you seeking a new

clarification on the last point because that is  not  the

substance of the Bill?  You may want to file a Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. Just a clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION ON PARLIAMENT STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Deputy Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the

Commission  on  Parliament Staff as  contained  in  Paper

Misc.  5  of  2003,  accepts the  recommendation  of  the

Commission  as  contained  in paragraph  10  thereof  and

resolves in accordance with such recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in accordance with Article 51(6) of the

Constitution of Singapore, a Commission consisting of the

Speaker,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  and  Minister  for

Finance, the Leader of the House, the Acting Minister for

Education   and  the  Chairman  of  the  Public   Service

Commission was set up to consider a proposal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3100</b></font><br><br>



to  adopt  a new Parliamentary Scheme (2003) for officers

in the Parliamentary Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has presented its Report to

Parliament  on  15th August 2003.  The  Commission  noted

that the Management Executive (MX) Scheme was implemented

in  the  civil service on 1st January 2002  to  meet  the

challenges  of new technologies and innovations  emerging

every  day and rising public expectations.  The MX Scheme

was  introduced  to carve out a meaningful and  rewarding

career  in  the  civil service, as an officer  can  enjoy

performance-based pay, clear and timely progress and self-directed career development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Senior Officer Scheme, the salary

scale  comprises an annual fixed increment together  with

the  basic  salary, the monthly variable component  (MVC)

and  the  non-pensionable component (NPC)  and  does  not

include the non-pensionable variable payment (NPVP)  (NWC

wage  adjustments) and non-pensionable  variable  payment

(salary  revision).   Whereas under  the  new  Management

Executive Scheme (MXS), the salary range, which  is based

on  performance, includes all the above components,  thus

showing  the  gross  salary that an officer  draws.   The

conversion to the new Scheme would not give rise  to  any

increase in salary of the five incumbents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also following the other schemes in the civil

service by dropping the reference to "superscale" grades.

All  the  staff  under the new scheme will  be  known  as

Parliamentary Officers.  They will be eligible for annual

merit   increments  if  their  performance  exceeds   the

requirements  of their grade.  Any Parliamentary  Officer

can go up to the apex of the scheme, ie, Grade 7, but  he

will  not automatically be the Clerk of Parliament unless

he is so appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, having considered the Parliamentary

Scheme  (2003),  has  advised that  this  new  scheme  be

applied to officers in the Parliamentary Service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3101</b></font><br><br>



which is at present pegged to the Senior Officer Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the Commission is contained in

paragraph 10 of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is asked to accept the recommendation of

the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the

Commission  on  Parliament Staff as  contained  in  Paper

Misc.  5  of  2003,  accepts the  recommendation  of  the

Commission  as  contained  in paragraph  10  thereof  and

resolves in accordance with such recommendation.





<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be

fixed. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="right">Fourteen Minutes to Seven o'clock pm</div>
