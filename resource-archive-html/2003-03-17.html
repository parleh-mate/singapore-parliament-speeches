<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [15th March, 2003],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of

the  Main  Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Yeo  Guat

Kwang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that

the  amount  of time allocated for each cut includes  the

reply  by the Ministers.  Therefore, what it really means

is that Members actually have much less time than the 4.6

minutes allocated for each amendment. Dr Amy Khor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  applaud  the  MOM  for  aggressively  and  tirelessly

launching a slew of programmes to help retrenched workers

and  groom Singaporeans into an adaptable workforce  with

portable skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one of my grassroots leaders with business

in  China and Australia, recently remarked, half in jest,

that compared to other governments in the region,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>

we  may  have taken skills upgrading and retraining  much

too  seriously.   He  mused cynically  that  perhaps  the

Government  has  done  too much, so  much  so  that  when

workers cannot get a job after retraining with Government

funds, they blame the Government who kept nudging them to

go for retraining in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on a more serious note, despite the plethora of

skills upgrading and retraining programmes launched, some

Singaporeans at the ground have the impression that  what

had  been  done  so far are ad hoc and disjointed.   Some

feel  that  the large number of schemes, as well  as  the

multiple  agencies organising these schemes, is confusing

and  that  there  is  also  some degree  of  duplication.

Rightly  or wrongly, the suspicion is that all the  money

on  retraining  may  not have been  well  spent  and  the

results less than sterling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, are there enough job opportunities for

the   course   participants  after  they   complete   the

programme?   Otherwise,  some  could  become  even   more

dejected.    This  calls  for  a  programme   of   career

counselling  to  help  workers  match  their  skills  and

interests with the job opportunities available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the most relevant and useful training

programmes been organised?  Has the training helped  them

find  employment?  What is the job retention rate of  the

trainees  after they complete the programme?  I hope  the

Minister can enlighten us on these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to these issues, I am pleased that a body

to  further  develop,  promote and coordinate  Continuing

Education  and  Training for adults and  their  placement

will  be  formed.  The new CET body should  work  closely

with all relevant private and public sector organisations

in  identifying, planning and organising the  appropriate

CET  programmes  and inculcating the  habit  of  lifelong

learning  in  a  Singaporean  workforce  at  all  levels,

including the professionals and executives who  have  not

been spared from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>

redundancy  and  retrenchments.   The  CET  body   should

confine  itself to policy and promotion and champion  the

involvement  of the private sector to supply services  to

realise its mission.  It should try to outsource as  many

courses  as  possible to the private sector who  has  the

capability  to  conduct these courses  and  not  directly

compete  with them in course delivery. This would prevent

the  CET  body from becoming another behemoth  that  some

members  of the public are wary of.  It would  indeed  be

ironic  if  there  comes a day when the CET  body,  which

oversees training and placement of the unemployed, has to

retrench employees themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CET body should ensure that minimum standards

are  complied  with. Finally, it should  also  track  the

success  and effectiveness of all programmes implemented,

benchmark itself against an internationally accepted  set

of  educational  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPI)  and

report these periodically.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Gan See Khem is not here. Ms

Irene Ng.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, let me

start  by  relating the experience of a man who has  been

retrenched three times and he is only 39 years  old.  His

first  retrenchment was in 1982.  He  worked  as  a  pipe

fitter  and  he  got retrenched after about  11/2  years.

Then,  he  worked as a marine assistant in Jurong  Island

and   after  13  years,  he  was  retrenched.  His  third

retrenchment was last week, from a paint factory where he

worked as a warehouse assistant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would think that, after being retrenched twice,

he  would have been better steeled for his last one.  But

no.   For  him,  his  last  retrenchment  was  the   most

traumatic.  This was because of the way the exercise  was

conducted.   He went to work, like any normal day.  Then,

after  lunch,  a dozen of them were asked to  go  to  the

boardroom,  and they were told that they were retrenched.

Just  like  that.  They were given their cheques  on  the

spot,  told  to pack up, return anything that belongs  to

the office and leave that very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>

day.   He  was so upset that he threw his company uniform

into the dustbin in front of his supervisor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his experience holds some lessons. No, not

only  that  you  have  to be prepared  to  be  retrenched

several  times in your working life, but also  that  some

companies just lack the experience and knowledge  on  how

to conduct retrenchments in a humane and proper way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With retrenchments on the rise in Singapore, I feel

that  it is necessary to lay down some guidelines on what

constitute   good   industrial  relations   practice   on

conducting retrenchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want to make it so hard for companies

to  retrench  in  so  hard a way that  would  affect  the

flexibility  of  our labour market and our attractiveness

for  investment.  But  we  cannot  allow  it  to  be   so

freewheeling that companies can discard workers  like  so

many expired canned food on a shelf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a good retrenchment practice is that

conducted  by Beecham Pharmaceuticals in 1996,  where  it

gave  about  one year's notice to staff of its  impending

retrenchment  exercise.  The time allowed  them  to  make

alternative  plans regarding their financial  commitments

and to look for a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Beecham and the union, the Chemical

Industries Employees' Union, arranged for staff to attend

courses   during   their  working  hours.    Nearer   the

retrenchment  date, the company provided counselling  and

even   allowed  its  workers  time-off  to  go  for   job

interviews.   By  doing  this, it treated  the  departing

employees with dignity and respect, and kept morale  high

among the remaining employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that arises from the recent PSA

retrenchment  is  that  it  is  an  example  of  a   good

retrenchment  exercise  or a  bungled  one.   People  are

divided  on  this issue. Some say yes,  this  is  a  good

example,   because   PSA  management   made   a   general

announcement on the estimated numbers to be retrenched on

17th February and gave a notice period

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>

of  about  one  month so that unions could  start  formal

negotiations with management to work out a fair  package.

This  was better than to spring it suddenly on the unions

and  workers,  which would then have no time  to  consult

each other and to find ways to help the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, including some in the media, say no. The

media reported that many workers had been anxious to know

who  would be retrenched and that morale was down because

of the uncertainty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng, you are nearing the end

of your speaking time.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> This led PSA to expedite

the  process  and conclude the negotiations  as  soon  as

possible.   But it raises the question of  what  makes  a

good   practice   in  terms  of  giving   a   notice   of

retrenchment.  How long should it be?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify the matter, I would urge the Manpower

Ministry, together with its tripartite partners, to  work

out   guidelines  on  how  to  deal  with  retrenchments,

including  the matter of giving appropriate notice.  This

could   form  a  Code  of  Practice  on  good  industrial

relations for retrenchment exercises.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b>

Sir,  I  would like to add on to what hon. Member,  Irene

Ng, has said.  As retrenchment is generally a painful and

traumatic  experience for affected employees, it  is  the

manner in which employees are retrenched and the attitude

of some employers that I wish to raise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ms Irene Ng has informed us, some organisations

are   very   caring.  They  go  beyond  their   statutory

responsibilities   in  providing  whatever   retrenchment

benefits  are  required of them to the  employees.   They

take  pains  to  inform and prepare  the  workers.   They

arrange for MOM and the trade union to be present at  the

workplace  during  the  period when retrenchment  notices

were   served,   to  help  with  alternative   employment

opportunities  and  to offer comfort and  support.   They

make  referrals  to  social  service  organisations,  for

example, Family Service Centres, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>

those  who  need counselling and advice on  personal  and

family matters.  A few conscientious employers would even

invite  Family  Service Centres or other  social  service

organisations  to  the workplace during  that  period  to

offer  on-site  information,  referrals  and  counselling

service to their retrenched staff. Unfortunately,  as  we

have  just  heard, the majority of retrenchment exercises

do not go that smoothly.  Only a handful of the employers

bother to provide such an arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the anxiety and despondency of being

retrenched,  especially for those who have  heavy  family

responsibilities to worry about, can affect their social,

psychological health.  .Hence, bringing in the assistance

of    professionally   qualified   social   workers   and

counsellors, for instance, as part of the overall process

during  their  retrenchment exercise is  to  be  strongly

encouraged. The helping professionals can listen  to  the

employees and offer them comfort.  They can work out with

the  retrenched  employees  on  how  to  mobilise  social

support and community resources and how to make necessary

changes and adjustments in their lives. In this way,  the

unwelcome  blow  of retrenchment can be mitigated  and  a

heavy  burden lightened.  This would also help boost  the

psychological  state  of mind of retrenched  persons  and

help   provide  the  necessary  motivation,  among  other

matters, for them to press on with finding jobs or to  go

for training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my query to the Minister then is: how can MOM

encourage  more  employers  to  provide  counselling  and

social  service  assistance to  their  retrenched  staff,

either through their own human resource department or  by

inviting  Family  Service  Centres  and  the  CDCs,   for

example, to be on site at the workplace, during the  time

when the retrenchment exercise is on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I am concerned

that  our  structural unemployment is on a rising  trend.

According  to  the  World Development  Report  2001,  our

structural unemployment stands at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

17.7%, as compared to Korea's 2.5% and the United States'

8.7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of structural unemployment is rising

among  the  highest educated segment of the workforce  as

well.   According  to  the  IPS  report,  the  share   of

secondary  educated structural unemployment increased  to

nearly 30% as at 2001.  What is more worrying is that the

share of the higher educated, which means post-secondary,

diploma   and   degree  holders  who  were   structurally

unemployed, increased by more than three-fold, from 7% to

nearly 24% between 1986 and 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is partly due to our education system

being  too rigidly or artificially designed to  meet  the

needs  of  MNCs in the past.  Many graduates cannot  find

jobs  that  match their training as those MNCs  who  need

their  knowledge have left Singapore. It is  ironic  that

while our Government is constantly stressing on producing

high-value added products and services, high-value  added

human resource could not find any jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who think that the foreign

talent policy is another factor contributing to the  high

rate  of  unemployment.  These so called foreign  talents

are  merely  cheap  replacements  for  our  high-educated

workforce.   Many people also started to  wonder  whether

they  have been short-changed by these so-called  foreign

talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been talking about training and

retraining.   My  question is:  how successful  has  this

strategy  been  in  solving the  structural  unemployment

problem?   Maybe the Government should be  reminded  that

skilled  workers  are  also  facing  a  rising  trend  in

structural  unemployment, from 10% in 1986 to  more  than

30% in 2001, as shown in the Institute of Policy Studies'

report.   Just blaming workers for not accepting jobs  of

lower  pay or status will not help in the long  run.  The

social   and  economic  cost  of  workers  having   their

potential under-utilised will be huge in the long run for

a small resource-scarce economy like Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the social and

psychological    impact    of    prolonged     structural

unemployment.    I  would  like  to  know   whether   the

Government has commissioned any studies on the social and

psychological    impact   of   structural   unemployment.

According  to statistics, again provided by  IPS  report,

the  percentage  of older workers, from age  40-49,  rose

from  17%  in  1984  to  40% in  2001.   The  social  and

psychological  impact  on  this  group  of  workers,  who

probably  has the most heavy burden of their  life  cycle

with  children  to  support,  would  be  great  and  far-reaching.    It  would  lead  to  problems  like   mental

instability  due  to  stress, stress on  marital  status,

marital relations, social polarisation between the  haves

and have-nots, reduce social cohesion, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the Government's

assessment of the seriousness of structural unemployment.

Besides urging people to lower their expectation, to sail

through  the rough waters, training and retraining,  etc,

are  there any other plans to help mitigate the  pain  of

those   suffering  under  the  situation  of   structural

unemployment?

<br>11.15 am

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,

I  thank  the  many hon. Members who have spoken  on  the

manpower challenges, employment market and job assistance

measures and also on continuing education and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before addressing the specific queries raised by

hon.  Members, I would like to make some general comments

to  put  in  perspective  the  situation  and  challenges

confronting  us  today.   First and  foremost,  the  poor

employment  market  reflects  the  weak  global  economy.

Major  economies  such as the US, the European  countries

and  Japan are down.  We cannot expect to be immune  from

the  global downturn.  There is also a radical  shift  in

the global environment.  Globalisation and the relentless

pursuit   of   corporate  competitiveness   are   pushing

companies  to be more mobile.  They scour the  world  for

locations that can offer them a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

competitive   edge   in  terms  of  cost,   productivity,

infrastructure  and talent.  Previously, labour-intensive

operations such as manufacturing of toys, radios and  TVs

were transferred to the less- developed countries.  Later

on,  more sophisticated products, such as disk drives and

computers,   followed.    But  the   current   round   of

globalisation  is seeing even skilled and knowledge  type

of  jobs  moving  offshore as well.   This  is  not  just

happening in the United States or the European countries,

but also affecting Singapore, with the emergence of China

and  India  as  major  economic  competitors.   With  the

Internet,  knowledge  tasks can  be  undertaken  or  done

almost  anywhere  in the world.  Many MNCs  are  shifting

their  back-room  operations and  even  call  centres  to

India.  Others are shifting to China and eastern European

countries  which have ample highly skilled, well-educated

workers willing to work at competitive salaries in  areas

like  chip  design, software engineering,  even  auditing

financial statements and drafting architectural plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to compete for investments and jobs in

this  global environment.  To remain competitive, we have

to  move up the value-added and technology ladder.   This

is  not  the first time that Singapore has had to  change

gear.   From  making  shoes and garments,  we  went  into

making hair-dryers, typewriters and radios.  Later on, we

went  into  printed  circuit boards, disk  drives,  semi-conductors  and precision-engineering.  Today,  Singapore

continues  to  attract investments in  growth  industries

such  as  specialty  chemicals,  high  value  electronics

products   such  as  network  storage  devices,  advanced

display devices, photonics, digital media, and biomedical

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, we have stayed ahead and remained

competitive  because  we  have successfully  adapted  our

economy  to suit global trends.  What is different  today

is  that the pace of restructuring is accelerating and so

we  need  to  adjust faster than before.  And this  time,

Sir,   there   are  more  competitors  in   the   market.

Displacement, or job losses, is also affecting the entire

spectrum   of  workers,  from  lower-skilled  blue-collar

workers to professionals, managers and executives.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we address the concerns of those who are

vulnerable  to  economic restructuring and to  structural

unemployment,  as Mr Low had just mentioned?   First,  we

must  have  more  investments, so that new  jobs  can  be

created.  To do this, we must transform Singapore into an

even  more  attractive location for businesses that  come

here  because they can leverage on our excellent economic

infrastructure.   That  is the strategic  thrust  of  the

Economic  Review Committee's Report.  And, Sir, Singapore

is   attractive.   Despite  the  gloomy  global  economic

environment last year, EDB attracted $9 billion worth  of

fixed  assets investments in manufacturing and $2 billion

worth  of  business spending in services.   And,  as  the

Minister  for  Trade and Industry told  us  on  Saturday,

these   investments  will  add  20,000  new   jobs   when

operational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EDB's investment promotion efforts will receive

a   boost   with  our  network  of  FTAs  with  different

countries,  especially the upcoming FTAs with the  United

States.  For example, recently ST-Microelectronics  -  by

the  way, "ST" is not "Singapore Technologies", it  is  a

European  company - just announced that it  would  invest

S$436  million  over the next three years to  expand  its

semiconductor production capacity in Singapore.  ST Micro

expects  this  to  create some  800  new  jobs.   Another

company, AFPD's Liquid Crystal Display plant, launched at

the  end  of  last  year, is an example of  the  advanced

display  industry which we believe has growth  potential.

AFPD's investment of some S$3.14 billion over the initial

two  years  is expected to generate 700 jobs.  These  and

other investments will create many skilled jobs and  also

some unskilled ones along the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, IE Singapore is helping our

companies   to   seek   out  new   markets   and   export

opportunities.   As our companies grow  their  businesses

abroad,   they   will   have  to  build   up   management

capabilities at home to help to run the business  in  the

region.  This will create

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>

more jobs for our professionals and managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring more investments here, we need workers with

the  right  skill  sets for the jobs.   If  workers  lack

skills  or  if  they cannot pick up the relevant  skills,

they will not be employable.  Then we will suffer growing

structural  unemployment.  So, the answer  is  in  skills

upgrading.  Many hon. Members - Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Heng Chee How,  Mr

Ong  Ah Heng and Dr Amy Khor - have spoken in support  of

Government's effort to upgrade the skills of our  workers

or  retrain them for the new jobs.  I thank all the  hon.

Members for their endorsement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, skills upgrading is not new to our workforce.

It  is  not  new to Singapore.  As all Members know,  the

Government  has  been  promoting  skills  upgrading   for

decades.  Over the years, we have, in fact, established a

very   strong   system  of  employer-based  training   in

Singapore.  Members will recall that we set up the Skills

Development  Fund  in  1979.   Since  then,  the   Skills

Development  Fund  has supported some 8 million  training

places  for  our  workers.  That  has  kept  our  workers

productive and competitive in the past two decades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang pointed out that we should use the

present slack period to prepare our workers for recovery.

I  agree  wholeheartedly.   In FY  2001,  the  Government

contributed  $500  million as a one-off  payment  to  the

Skills  Development Fund (SDF) to sustain its  effort  to

train the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Plan launched in 1999 highlighted

the  importance  of promoting lifelong  learning.   Since

then,  we  have achieved some success with new programmes

introduced to build up skills in various segments of  the

workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, and I believe Dr Amy Khor, also

asked   how   many  workers  were  helped  through   this

programme.  We have exceeded the 5-year target of 100,000

training  places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme

administered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

by the NTUC.  Over 150,000 people have been trained in IT

skills under the National IT Literacy Programme and  also

the  Infocomm  Competency Programme.  Over 20,000  people

have   been   trained   under  the  WorkSkills   Training

Programme.   And,  over  4,800  professionals  have  been

trained under the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme

and  Self-Employment Training Programme.  This  does  not

include    professionals,   managers,   executives    and

technicians  who were trained under different  programmes

run  by  EDB, MAS, Infocomm Development Authority and  IE

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the annual Lifelong Learning Festival has also

reached  out  to  some 75,000-100,000  Singaporeans  each

year.   But  more  can  be  done.   The  Economic  Review

Committee  recommended  that a Continuing  Education  and

Training  statutory  board  be  formed  to  provide  more

comprehensive and effective national Continuing Education

and    Training.     Government   has    accepted    this

recommendation.  The Ministry of Manpower will  establish

a   statutory  board  to  focus  on  CET  and  employment

facilitation  by the end of this year.   The  mission  of

this new statutory board is to enhance employability  and

competitiveness of Singaporean workers.  It is to prepare

our  workers,  young  and  old,  skilled  and  unskilled,

professionals  and  blue-collar,  for  the   restructured

economy.   I  thank  the many hon. Members  including  Mr

Ahmad  Magad,  Mr Seng Han Thong, Mdm Halimah  Yacob  and

others  for  their comments and suggestions for  the  CET

statutory  board.  We will be considering  all  of  these

ideas  and suggestions in the months ahead as we go about

setting up the statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Miss Irene Ng seem particularly

worried   that  when  the  ERC  Report,  or  my  Ministry

officials,  or  even myself mentioned "workers",  we  are

only thinking of blue-collar workers.  Let me assure  all

of  them,  once and for all, that when we  use  the  term

"worker" or "workforce", we use it in the broadest sense.

We use it in an all-embracing manner.  We are all workers

- working for our families, for Singapore - regardless

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>

of  the  actual job that we are engaged in.  However,  we

will  still  need to prioritise and target  our  training

assistance.  As Mdm Halimah pointed out on Saturday,  the

lower-skilled  workers are more vulnerable to  structural

unemployment.     Yes,   we   are    seeing    structural

unemployment,  and growing unemployment  even  among  the

professionals,  managers and executives, but  the  lower-skilled   and   lower-educated  are  by  far   the   most

vulnerable.  So they needed a little extra help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, briefly, I see the statutory board doing the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) promote workforce skills upgrading;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) build a comprehensive Continuing Education and

Training infrastructure;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) enable sustained Continuing Education and

Training with employers' involvement and support;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) develop the Continuing Education and Training and

Human Resource industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) last, but not least, regulate the standards of

Continuing Education and Training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statutory board's objective is very

specific  -  the employability of our workers.   But  its

mandate is broad because it will serve the mainstream  of

adult  workers,  not  just  the  lower  skilled  or   the

unemployed.  It will reach out to our workers,  including

the  professionals, managers and executives.   I  see  it

helping  these groups to meet their skills and job  needs

through:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) continuing skills upgrading for all levels of

the workforce, including professionals and executives;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) helping our workers to develop new skills so

that they can get jobs in growth industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) providing employment assistance programmes

which will be packaged together with skills training  for

new jobs and, in some cases, with some career counselling

and guidance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo, Mr Ahmad Magad and several other hon.

Members have highlighted the need to strengthen the nexus

between  training and industry needs. In particular,  Mrs

Yu-Foo would like to see better planning to train workers

for  incoming industries so that jobs would not be  taken

by   foreign   workers  because  Singaporeans   are   not

available.   This  will  be the statutory  board's  modus

operandi.   This will be how we will approach  the  task.

The statutory board will collaborate closely with the EDB

and  all  industries  to ensure that training  programmes

will  meet the industries' needs, including the needs  of

the  new  investments  coming  into  Singapore.   It   is

important  that  we identify the current skill  gaps  and

future  skill  needs of the industries, so that  training

programmes   are  industry-relevant.  Besides   providing

appropriate   pre-employment  training   in   our   ITEs,

polytechnics  and  universities,  we  should  also   have

continuing  education and training for workers  to  equip

them  with job specific skills for the new jobs that  are

being created.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address Mr Ong Ah Heng's concern about training

that  is  not  recognised by employers, we  have  already

established the National Skills Recognition System, which

provides   for   portable   skill   certification.    The

Continuing  Education and Training statutory  board  will

certainly promote skills certification and recognition to

enhance  workers'  portability and also employability  of

our workers who have undergone such training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng suggested that we should make sure that

trained  workers  are given jobs.  She suggested  getting

employers  to guarantee to employ the workers after  they

have  gone for training.  I understand the disappointment

suffered by a diligent worker who had invested much  time

and  effort to upgrade himself but, at the end, could not

get  a  job.   It is very disappointing.  No doubt,  this

has   happened,  especially  when  our  job   market   is

shrinking.  I agree with her, and that is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>

why  we have already started to introduce Place-and-Train

programmes.   In  other words, the unemployed  is  placed

with  a company and after the company signs him on as  an

employee,  that is when we send him for training.   After

the  training, he goes back to the job.  Examples are the

Aerospace  Reskilling  for  Operations  Programme,   Call

Centre  Programme, Hospitality Programme  -   hospitality

in  our  hotel industry  -  and, the recently  announced,

Intellectual Property Professional Programme.  All  these

programmes are place-and-train programmes.  This requires

participating  employers to sign up  the  worker   before

they are sent for training.  My Ministry pays for most of

the cost of training and also provides full-time trainees

with allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with the best of intentions, we still

encounter   disappointments.   For   instance,   in   the

Hospitality Programme in the hotel sector, in  one  case,

62  out of the 81 who were offered jobs accepted.  Out of

those  who  accepted, a full 40% left their  jobs  within

three months after training.  They cited unwillingness to

work  shifts, dislike for working on public holidays  and

even  dislike  for the place of work.  We have  spent  so

much  money  to train them, paid for the training  course

and, in some cases, even gave them allowances.  So, maybe

I   should  take  Ms  Irene  Ng's  suggestion  seriously.

Members may remember that on Saturday, she suggested  the

"money   back  guarantee".   Maybe  I  should  take   her

seriously.  In other words, those who have been  trained,

placed in a job, and did not stay on the job will have to

pay back.  I do not know if she will support that idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Ong Ah Heng spoke of

the   need  for  enhancing  adult  training  methods  and

curriculum.  This is indeed a very important  area.   The

statutory  board will certainly strengthen our continuing

education  and  training  system  based  on  professional

design  of  adult  curriculum  and  also  adult  teaching

methods.   It  is not quite the same as getting  a  14-16

year olds into our ITE and train them in trade skills  or

into our polytechnic and train them in a discipline.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>

After  they have worked for 10-15 years and they have  to

come back to the classroom, the whole approach is totally

different.   The CET statutory board will be  looking  at

how   to  improve  the  methodology  of  providing  adult

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked, in this connection, what

happened to the idea of a Centre for Adult Learning which

was  suggested in the ERC Report. We have considered this

idea  and concluded that, for the time being, we  do  not

need  to set up a specific institution for research  into

methods of training adults.  The CET statutory board will

develop  in-house expertise in this area by working  with

researchers  in our universities, polytechnics  and  also

international experts in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng stressed the importance of regulating

the  quality of the CET industry.  I believe Dr Amy  Khor

also  touched  on  this.   I  agree  totally.  Since  the

Government  is investing large sums of public   money  in

training, we will establish training standards and assess

more critically and more rigorously the effectiveness  of

the  national CET programme.  Private training  providers

that participate in our CET effort and receive Government

subsidies  for their programmes will also be  subject  to

the same rigorous standard of assessment.

.     Mdm  Ho  Geok Choo asked how will the CET statutory

board   relate   to  SPRING  Singapore.   Human   capital

development  programmes under SPRING  and  several  other

economic  agencies  -  I mentioned some earlier on,  EDB,

IDA   -   will complement the effort of the CET statutory

board.  Of course, we will not want to duplicate or waste

resources.  We will improve coordination and cooperation.

She  also asked whether the statutory board will encroach

on  the  private  sector's training providers'  role  and

compete  for  business opportunities or, as Dr  Amy  Khor

mentioned, it becomes a behemoth swallowing up the  small

private sector training providers.  The answer is no.  We

expect  private sector continuing education and  training

providers  to  continue  complementing  training  to   be

provided by industry-led entities, like industry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>

groups,   and   also   the  public   sector   educational

institutions.  We will, in fact, work harder to encourage

more  private  sector participation and facilitate  their

entry into the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the statutory board does

not  intend  to  take  on the role  of  a  sole  training

provider  in  Singapore.  We will work with  the  private

sector  providers.  We want to encourage  a  vibrant  and

dynamic  training industry to grow. Where  the  statutory

board will undertake training, this will be very specific

instances under very special circumstances where it needs

to  be involved.  One that comes to mind could perhaps be

the  training of the trainer type of programme, where the

board may, in order to ensure quality control, want to be

involved in the training of the trainers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tackling unemployment, several Members have

spoken on this.  I like to add that a statutory board  is

not  on  its own going to be the magic bullet  that  will

solve  all our employment problems.  If we have a  highly

skilled,  highly productive, disciplined and  hardworking

workforce,  more investors will come to Singapore.   Yes,

our  wages may be a little higher or may be a lot higher,

for  instance, compared to places like China  and  India.

But we offer value for money.  And the investors who come

here  make  more  money  by locating  their  business  in

Singapore.   Hence,  Mr Jean-Claude Marquet,  ST  Micro's

Corporate   Vice-President  and   Chief   Executive   for

AsiaPacific  said  "We are satisfied  with  the  way  the

Singapore team is making use of the investment and see no

reason to relocate".  Mr Hiroshi Kawai, Managing Director

of Matsushita Refrigeration Industry, said "It is cheaper

for  us  to produce here than in China, at least for  the

next  five  years". So, it is not a simple chicken-or-egg

conundrum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, a skilled workforce comes first. With a

skilled  workforce and a good supporting  infrastructure,

the EDB will have greater success bringing investors here

and  more jobs will be created for Singaporeans.  But  we

must also heed what Mr Hiroshi, Managing Director of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>

Matsushita Refrigeration Industry, said.  He had a caveat

when  he said, "at least for the next five years".    So,

we must make good use of the time for us to resharpen our

competitive  edge  and restructure the economy,  so  that

when  the  time comes, we will be in a new  and  stronger

position.  We will not be left stranded high and low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Singaporeans must make the effort. The

statutory  board  will help, but it takes  two  hands  to

clap.   Through the statutory board, the Government  will

provide opportunities for skill upgrading, but our people

must  be  willing to learn and take jobs  at  competitive

wages.   It remains the personal responsibility  of  each

job  seeker  to  seek  out a job and  to  keep  the  job.

Otherwise,  we  will  not be able to overcome  structural

unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah suggested on Saturday that it is time to

tighten the foreign worker quota.  She thinks that if  we

send   the  foreign  workers  back,  all  our  unemployed

Singaporeans will immediately have a job.  She  may  have

seen   the   numbers,  and  sometimes  numbers   can   be

misleading.  So, they say there are statistics and  there

are  statistics.   We  have  more  than  200,000  foreign

workers  in the key manufacturing and services  industry.

I  will  discount the domestic workers and those  in  the

construction  workforce   Let  us  assume  we  send  back

100,000  of them.  Then, obviously, the 89,900 unemployed

Singaporeans at the end of December 2002 should  have  no

problem  getting  jobs.  Right?  If  only  it  were  that

simple,  I would have fewer white hairs on my head!   Not

only  are we lacking jobs for Singaporeans today, we also

have  a  very  serious  mismatch  in  skills,  wages  and

expectations.   If we tighten access to foreign  workers,

can  we  be  sure that the 89,900 unemployed Singaporeans

will  go  out there and take on the jobs that  are  being

done by all these foreign workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members a personal example. I used to

go to a hairdresser long before I became an MP.  When she

first started out her business, I was one of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>

early  customers and saw the business grow.  She used  to

cut  my  hair  very  efficiently, 20-25  minutes  at  the

utmost, minimal waiting, very well done.  It went on  for

more  than  10 years.  Even when I became an MP,  I  went

back to her.  It was still 20-25 minutes.  Then, in 1991,

the  Prime Minister appointed me Minister for Labour.   I

went  back  to her for a haircut.  It went on  for  35-40

minutes.  It was not just for a hair cut.  I kept getting

ear bashing besides having my hair trimmed.  Her business

had  grown.   She  needed  more workers.   She  recruited

Singaporeans.  They worked for a week and they went  away

-   high  turnover.  They asked for higher  pay  all  the

time.  She said, "Can I have more foreign workers?  Can I

have  work  permits?  You are the Minister  for  Labour",

seated  there  in  the chair.  And she snipped,  snipped,

snipped.  Then one day, it was more than a year  after  I

became  Labour Minister, the same thing happened.   Snip,

snip,  snip.  I do not think it was her fault.  I do  not

think  it  was  intentional.  She was perhaps  getting  a

little  excited,  arguing for more work permits.   "Chk",

she  snipped  my  ear.  I told myself, "This  is  getting

dangerous."  I stopped going to the hairdresser.  My wife

does the job for me and I have to thank her for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying is that not only are we lacking

jobs  for locals, we have this mismatch.  We cannot  just

assume   that  if  we  fire  all  the  foreign   workers,

Singaporeans will take on all the jobs.  If we  send  all

the  foreign workers who are in the hairdressing industry

in  Singapore, many hairdressing salons may have to close

down.   All  our  people will have bigger  problems  with

their  hair grooming, especially our ladies.  So,  it  is

better not to work on that assumption.

<br>11.45 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members a more serious example. If we

tighten  the  foreign worker quota, can  we  assume  that

locals   will  take  on  the  job?   Last  week,  Members

mentioned  in the debate on the Budget Statement  one  of

the  famous Singapore brands, Tee Yih Jia, famous for its

popiah-skin and roti-prata.  Do you know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>

that, today, they cannot run their factory 24/7; in other

words, 24 hours, 7 days a week.  Why?  Is it because they

do  not  have enough orders or business to run  it  24/7?

No.   They  have  good orders; they have  good  business.

Business is booming.  But they cannot run it 24/7 because

they  lack  workers.  Instead of running  the  production

plant  into  the night, they have to shut  down  some  of

their  lines  and  machineries because Singapore  workers

want  to  go  home  and will not work  the  late  shifts.

Without   foreign  workers,  there  will  be  even   more

difficult  problems.  They may even  have  to  shift  out

completely  from  Singapore, if they  do  not  have  some

foreign  workers to help them to run the late shifts  and

to moderate their wage costs downwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they shift out, who lose? More Singaporeans will

lose,  not just the foreign workers.  And not only  those

who  work  for  Tee  Yih  Jia  but  also  all  the  other

supporting   industries,  service   providers,   material

suppliers,  the ones who send the spices,  the  oil,  the

flour that they need to make their popiah-skins and roti-pratas,  the  transport companies that  carry  all  these

things  around, the equipment maintenance companies  that

come  and fix up all the machineries in the factory,  and

even  PSA  Corp,  because of the  dozens  and  dozens  of

container  loads  of their products that  they  ship  out

every  month.  All these will lose business.   And  there

are,   in  fact,  many  other  companies  facing  similar

problems.  So, let us not believe that the problem can be

solved  by just telling the foreign workers to  go  home,

and Singaporeans will take on the jobs.  We will not just

lose  the  foreign workers; we may well lose the  company

and   the   remaining  jobs  that  are  being   held   by

Singaporeans.    In  administering  the  foreign   worker

policy,  we  have  to  maintain a  very,  very  judicious

balance  between  Singaporeans, foreign workers  and  the

needs  of the employers.  My Minister of State will  have

more to say on this subject later on in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must develop an enterprising attitude and a

determination to learn new skills.  We must adapt quickly

to the changes that are taking place around

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

us.    Mdm  Halimah  and  Mrs  Yu-Foo  asked  about   the

employment prospects and where are the growth areas.   At

the   end  of  December  2002,  72%  of  those  who  were

retrenched  in the first three quarters were already  re-employed.   That  is  an  improvement;  some  good  news.

Because, last year, it was, I think, around 65%.  It  has

gone up to 72% this year.  We also have about 12,900  job

vacancies with the service sector accounting for  59%  of

the  vacancies.   These came mostly  from  transport  and

communications, wholesale and retail trade, business  and

real estate services and community and personal services.

Manufacturing  contributed a smaller proportion,  34%  of

the   vacancies  mainly  from  transport  equipment   and

electronic    products.    Vacancies   for   professional

managers,  executives and technicians  were  30%  of  the

total  vacancies; for production operators and labourers,

45%;  and  another  26% for clerical, sales  and  service

workers.  But, in view of the uncertainties gripping  the

global economy, we should prepare for some worsening  and

deterioration of the labour market.  This  year  may  not

see  sharp  recovery  in  jobs  and  improvement  in  the

unemployment rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these difficult times, workers must be

even  more  determined to compete  and  fight  for  jobs,

especially older workers.  Mr Heng Chee How urges MOM  to

start  the  Continuing Education and  Training  statutory

board as soon as possible.  We will try our best to speed

up  the process, but we think six to nine months is  what

it  will take to get an organisation of this scale up and

running.  But I should clarify that while we are  in  the

process  of  setting up a statutory  board,  we  are  not

sitting around doing nothing.  All our programmes are on-going,  and  we  will  continue to add  to  the  existing

programmes  and  build  up  new capabilities  within  MOM

instead,  so that as and when the statutory board  is  up

and  running, these programmes can be passed  on  to  the

statutory board.  It will be a seamless transition.  As I

have  said, the programmes that are already on-going will

continue.  We do not need to wait for the official launch

of the statutory board to initiate new programmes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo suggested working with the community

organisations.   I  fully agree.  My  Ministry  has  been

working  very  fruitfully with the Community  Development

Councils  and  self-help  groups and  other  professional

groups, like SHRI through SPEC, to bring skills upgrading

and  job  assistance  closer to the  people.   This  will

remain  our  strategy.  The statutory board will  explore

new   avenues  for  cooperation  with  all  our  existing

partners and interested parties.  She also suggested that

we  should  pay more attention to career counselling.   I

agree  too, and we will explore ways of providing  career

counselling especially to the lower educated who may  not

be able to get the job and training information that they

need.   And I think this is very relevant to the  remarks

made  by  Prof.  Ngiam earlier about the  plight  of  the

retrenched workers.  Some career counselling,  some  more

concerted hand-holding to get them through, help them  to

navigate  the  intricacies of job  change  and  also  the

intricacies of the changing job market, would  be  useful

and helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong pointed out that despite the

Government's  effort to promote lifelong learning,  there

is  no  queue  or  mad rush for our training  programmes,

unlike  when  McDonald's was selling  Hello-Kitty  dolls.

Yes,  he  is  right,  and this is a disappointment.   For

instance,  in  the People for Jobs Traineeship  Programme

for older workers, we have, till today, already more than

a  year from its launch, about 9,000 older workers signed

up  for  this  programme.  We had originally targeted  to

help 20,000 workers when the programme was launched.  But

up  to now, only about 9,000 workers have signed up.  And

this programme is a very generous programme.  It provides

jobs  with on-the-job training and up to 50% wage support

for  the  employers.  Yes, the CET statutory  board  will

have  to work harder to motivate workers to go for skills

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked how we could help the

"untrainable"  workers.  I do not think  we  should  call

people "untrainable".  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

disagree with that approach.  That would not help  us  to

address Mr Seng's concern of getting more people to  join

the  queue.   We want to create a buzz for  CET,  and  we

cannot  go around saying, "You are untrainable.  You  are

out  of  the action."  No.  I would take a more  positive

approach  and  try to look for appropriate training  even

for  the lowest educated and lowest skilled workers.   As

long  as they are willing to make the effort, as long  as

they  are  willing  to go and try, as long  as  they  are

realistic in their job expectations, we should be able to

help   them.   For  instance,  the  Centre  for  Cleaning

Technology - I think it was in the newspapers last week - started    with    MOM's   financial    assistance    and

encouragement.   It  has proved  to  be  very  useful  in

training many older and lower skilled workers for gainful

employment  in the growing commercial cleaning  industry.

Many  of their trainees went in without much expectation.

But  when  they  left,  they were  snapped  up  by  these

cleaning companies.  And because of their training,  many

have  also  progressed  beyond just  trainees  to  become

supervisors,  earning much higher than they had  expected

in the first instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, admittedly, all of us involved in job placement

- whether it is MOM, NTUC, Community Development Councils

with  their  Distributed Career Link network -  have  had

numerous  disheartening encounters with workers who  turn

down  job  offers  or refuse to go for skills  upgrading.

On  the other hand, we hear stories of workers in Vietnam

and China enthusiastically learning new skills to get  on

in  life.   They  sign up for night or  weekend  classes.

They  rush  from work to their night classes,  be  it  to

learn  English  or  some new computer  skills.   That  is

lifelong learning in action.  That is what we should have

in  Singapore  -  a  buzz on lifelong learning.   In  the

Philippines,  I was told that doctors move into  nursing.

Why?   Because they recognise that the worldwide shortage

of  nurses  opens  up  many new  opportunities  for  them

overseas   where,   perhaps,  maybe  their   professional

qualifications may not be recognised.  But, at least,  if

they  take  up nursing skills, they can go overseas,  and

they get better jobs.  We need to be equally flexible and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>

adaptable.  As the labour market changes, we have  to  be

flexible and adaptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that it is not an answer to

tell  people  to be prepared to take on a job,  any  job,

even  if  it  is at a lower pay, to solve our  structural

unemployment problem.  But if there is scarcity of  jobs,

a  realistic solution must be to take what is  available,

make  the best out of it, until better times come around.

Fortunately,  not all Singaporeans are totally  apathetic

to  retraining or skills upgrading.  We do have some fine

examples.  Streats, on 17th January 2003, reported a  Mrs

Karen  Wong who lost her job as a HR executive at  an  IT

consulting  company.  She recognised  that  she  was  not

likely to find a job in the same field and enrolled in  a

childcare  training course under the Skills Redevelopment

Programme.  Today, she is happily teaching children at  a

PAP Community Foundation kindergarten.  Likewise, Mr Chen

Guo  Hua,  who  was  retrenched from  his  salesman  job,

decided   to   sign   on   for  MOM's  Place-Train-Adjust

programme,  one of those programmes where we assign  them

to  an employer first.  The 52-year old Mr Chen completed

his training and is now a commis cook in Ritz-Carlton and

enjoying  his  job.  So, I thank the media for  featuring

such stories of enterprising, adaptable Singaporeans  who

are  learning  new skills and trying their  hand  at  new

ventures  or  new jobs.  I am sure there are  many,  many

more such examples out there waiting to be highlighted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must reiterate that it takes two hands to

clap.  I agree with Mdm Halimah that employers also  have

to  play  their part.  I therefore call on  employers  to

change  their  mindset.   Nominated Member,  Dr  Jennifer

Lee, gave the example in last week's Budget debate of how

KK  Women's  and  Children's Hospital was  successful  in

hiring   older  workers.   I  commend  Dr  Lee  for   her

willingness to give older workers a chance and urge other

employers  to follow her lead.  In my Ministry's  efforts

to  place  older  workers, we have  found  that  many  HR

managers  in  various companies are not receptive.   Some

have  become used to hiring foreign workers in  the  days

when we had a tight

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>

labour  market.  They refuse to consider new options  and

just  want  to  carry on doing things the  way  they  are

comfortable with - just hire foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah was concerned that employers will lay

off  workers  hired under the People for Jobs Traineeship

Programme after the wage support period, which can go  up

to  nine  months,  has ended.  Under this  programme,  we

provide very generous wage support for employers to  take

in older workers.  The wage support can amount to $12,000

or more.  Participating employers should not just lay off

workers  at  the  end of the wage support  period.   They

should  continue to employ these trained workers and,  in

fact,  help them to continue to upgrade their skills,  so

that  they  can make bigger contribution to the  company.

Otherwise, these companies or employers will continue  to

lay  off workers after training and they will not be able

to participate in the programme and derive the benefit of

the  wage subsidy that Government is giving.  So all  our

companies must also adjust their mindsets, starting  with

the Chief Executive Officers.

12.00 noon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, to round up all the remarks made

by  the  Members and my response, we are facing difficult

times but there is no need to be despondent.  There  will

be  an economic rebound.  We are not sure when this  will

be.  If the US economy picks up, if a war between the  US

and Iraq erupts,  when and how will it end.  If there  is

a  war,  what  will be the impact on the  price  of  oil.

There  are so many "ifs" and all of these "ifs" are  well

beyond  our influence.  But what we can do, and must  do,

is  to make preparations for the rebound.  As Mr Yeo Guat

Kwang  pointed  out  right  at  the  beginning  of   this

discussion,  take  advantage  of  this  slack  period  to

prepare  our  workers for the future.   So  we  can  make

preparations for the rebound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the resources to revamp the economy. The

ERC  Report has pointed out what we can do to advance our

competitiveness.  But we have more than just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

resources to revamp the economy - we have the people with

the  gumption  to face challenges directly and  make  the

changes  that  are necessary for survival  and  continued

prosperity.   In  this  way,  when  the  global   economy

rebounds, we will be in a good position to take advantage

of  the  new  opportunities.   Let  us,  therefore,  work

together  and  turn  today's  adversity  into  tomorrow's

advantage.   Our parents had laboured to build  Singapore

from  scratch  since 1965 with much less  resources  than

what we have today.  We owe it to them to make the effort

to   transform   our  skills  and  capabilities   through

Continuing Education and Training to provide the  impetus

for future economic growth.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. I

would  like to ask whether or not the Minister will agree

that the foreign workers quota was set at a time when the

economic growth was good, structural unemployment was not

an  issue  and the long-term unemployment rate  was  much

lower.   Now, with the changed environment, higher  long-term  unemployment, slower economic growth and structural

unemployment,  whether  or not  the  quota  ought  to  be

revisited.   I have never asked for the large  number  of

foreign  workers to be sent back because it is completely

unrealistic.   But  I  did  ask  for  the  quota  to   be

revisited, the issue to be relooked, and not to send back

the  hundreds  of thousands of foreign workers,  just  to

provide jobs for 90,000, because that is not possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It was a rather lengthy

clarification, Mdm Halimah.  Would you like to reply,  Dr

Lee?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I am grateful to Mdm Halimah

for  her clarification that she does not see the need  to

send  large numbers of foreign workers back deliberately.

The   foreign   workers  quota  operates   in   different

industries.  There are different quota levels.   We  have

found  it  useful to balance the needs of  employers  and

creating  employment for local workers using  this  quota

mechanism.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

instance,  in  the  construction industry,  we  are  very

liberal  -  1 local to 5 foreign workers.  We are  slowly

adjusting that.  We are bringing that down now because of

the   over-dependency   and  low  productivity   in   the

construction industry.  In the marine sector, we  have  a

quota   of   1:3.   And  despite  this  adverse  economic

situation,  the  marine industry is  one  of  our  bright

spots.   They have lots of vacancies.  And if we were  to

lower the quota for the marine industry today, we will be

causing the companies enormous difficulties, not just  in

competing  for  jobs, they actually  have  obtained  jobs

already,  but they need the workers to do the  work.   So

since  Singaporeans are still reluctant to take on  these

vacancies  in  the  marine sector, I think  it  would  be

foolhardly  for  us  to revise the quota  in  the  marine

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing service industry, as I have

explained   just   now,   many   companies   still   face

difficulties operating within the present quota.  But  we

will  continue  to  review all  of  these  mechanisms  to

regulate  the entry of foreign workers.  And the  Minster

of  State will reply on this subject.  Could you  refresh

my memory on the last point?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> I asked whether there is a need

to   revisit   the   quota   because   of   the   changed

circumstances.  That is all.  I am not suggesting that we

send back the foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Whether we have to revisit the

question on quota, I have to say that we do that all  the

time.  We review the quota.  We look at the needs of  the

industry  all the time, and we will do what is necessary.

But  I  just  want to point out that we must  maintain  a

judicious balance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members not to

ask  questions or make lengthy speeches in the  guise  of

clarifications.   Mr Inderjit Singh is not  present.   Dr

Wang Kai Yuen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I have been

wondering why Singaporeans are so despondent, to use  the

word of the Minister, about the economy when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

our  unemployment rate was 4.2% in December 2002,  having

dropped from a high of 4.6% in September 2002.  This  has

translated  to  about over 80,000 unemployed  workers  in

Singapore,  bearing in mind that even in boom  time,  the

unemployment rate was about 2%.  So based on unemployment

figures  alone, our economy should have been much  better

off than Hong Kong with its unemployment rate of 7%.  But

in  terms of the people's psyche, I believe our people do

not seem perkier than those of Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is whether the statistics tell the

full  story.  I browsed through the published figures  of

MOM,  paying particular attention to the table of  change

in  employment  in the Government press release  on  31st

December 2002.  Change in employment, Sir, refers to  the

change  in the number of jobs in our economy compared  to

the   previous  period.   This  figure  shows  that   the

Singapore  economy has had five consecutive  quarters  of

net  job  losses from third quarter 2001 to third quarter

2002,  totalling 63,000.  However, I was unable to  match

this change in employment figure with the employment rate

of the corresponding period.  If we were to add 63,000 to

the  number of workers already unemployed at the  end  of

second  quarter 2001, which was 60,000,  or  3%,  of  the

total  workforce of close to 2 million, the total  number

of  unemployed workers should be around 123,000 by  third

quarter  2002.  But we have a lower number.  So it  seems

that  some  40,000 workers who have lost their jobs  have

simply disappeared from our radar screen.  I really could

not  reconcile these numbers and would like the  Minister

to elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the reason could be that those are foreign

workers.   If,  indeed,  this  is  the  case,  then   the

unemployment  rate figure is not giving a  true  picture.

So  we  might be lured into a false sense of  comfort  if

policy makers were to just look at the unemployment  rate

alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the unemployed workers, I am

particularly  concerned about those with little  hope  of

finding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>

a job after being unemployed for nine months or more.  To

help  these  people  back to the job  market,  would  the

Minister consider changing the CPF contribution rate  for

these  structurally unemployed people?  For those  facing

long-term unemployment, it is indeed futile for  them  to

plan  for retirement when they cannot even take  care  of

their current needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you finish with your question,

Dr Wang?



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to find out whether

for  those who are unemployed for one year or more, would

the  Minister  consider phasing in the  CPF  contribution

rate  starting  from zero to the full  contribution  rate

over, let us say, nine months or so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, during the good

years in 1995 and 1996, what we heard was the problem  of

workers  job hopping and employers unable to  get  enough

workers.   Since the financial crisis in 1997, the  table

has  turned  against the workers.  Now is the  employers'

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general elections, the PAP had promised

to  give top priority to providing jobs for Singaporeans.

The  trade unions even showed its support to the  PAP  by

taking  UOB  to task when it announced its  intention  to

retrench its workers due to merger and restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have passed, but unemployment remains a

problem.   It  is  a clear fact that the  PAP  Government

could   not   create   enough  jobs   for   Singaporeans.

Ironically, Government controlled entities, like GLCs and

statutory  boards, are the ones now starting a new  round

of  retrenchments.  This time - I suppose it  is  because

this  is  not an election year - Chartered Semiconductor,

PSA and HDB had already done their bit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to add salt to injury, the Singapore Government

is  still putting out Contact Singapore advertisements on

CNBC   to  attract  foreign  talents  to  find  jobs   in

Singapore.  If the PAP Government could not create enough

jobs for its own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

citizens,  how could it offer Singapore jobs  to  foreign

talents?   I  would like to ask the PAP  Government  what

types of jobs it could offer to foreigners that our local

talents could not do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, you are asking the PAP

Government, or you are asking Dr Lee?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am asking Dr Lee. The last

check  on  Contact Singapore website showed that  SIA  is

putting   up   advertisements  for   the   positions   of

Administrative Officer and Business Development  Manager.

The  question  to the Minister is:  do our  citizens  not

have  the talents to take up jobs, such as Administrative

Officer and Business Development Manager?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it does not make sense at all to keep

recruiting  the so-called foreign talents for  jobs  that

Singaporeans  can do, especially in this period  of  high

unemployment.   We have some Singapore graduates  selling

noodles,  taking up part time jobs and giving tuition  to

make  ends meet.  But our Government is offering jobs  to

foreign talents.  I want to remind the Government that it

is  Singaporeans  who  have voted them  into  power,  not

foreigners, talented or not.  I think it is only fair and

right  that  the Government puts Singaporeans'  interest,

jobs and welfare as its top priority, and not foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just said that, not so long ago,

EDB  has attracted new investments.  But I would like  to

know  specifically what is the number and nature of  jobs

that the Government, or the investments, have created for

Singaporeans as well as foreigners.  And what  jobs  have

been offered to foreigners that our locals could not do?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi is not speaking. Mr

Nithiah Nandan.



<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

unemployment  is expected to hit the highest  level  this

time and this is further aggravated with retrenchments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>

During  such a time, what we should not do is  to  create

confusion on the ground or, worse still, instill fears in

the  minds  of the workers with loose talks.   Such  acts

will  only  lead  to the loss of morale  and  confidence.

Then   half  the  battle  is  lost  in  the  process   of

repositioning  Singapore.   Employers  should  not   take

retrenchment lightly.  Retrenchment should be carried out

only  when  it  is absolutely necessary, that  too  after

exhausting  all  other avenues.  I say this  because  the

current  unemployment situation is bad and it should  not

be further aggravated as far as possible.  The social and

psychological impact caused by unemployment could lead to

other negative and sometimes tragic circumstances.  So we

should  exercise  care  and,  at  the  same  time,   help

retrenched workers to find new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during this bleak unemployment situation, the

hardest hit are the old and the less educated.  These are

the  workers  who have contributed immensely  during  our

formative  years of nation building.  I am glad  to  hear

the Minister saying earlier that they are trying to do  a

lot  to help these workers.  I hope the Ministry will  do

more  in helping them get jobs, especially by helping  or

giving  a  certain amount of subsidies to  employers  who

hire   them.    We  could  also  create  some  employment

opportunities or reserve certain categories of  jobs  for

such workers besides training them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should also encourage more employers to

use  the  People  for  Jobs  Traineeship  scheme.   Would

greater   incentives  be  introduced  to   enthuse   more

employers?   Sir, I do agree that workers should  not  be

choosy.   But, at the same time, more should be  done  in

the  area of redesigning jobs and multi-tasking, so  that

locals  could do jobs, such as cleaning and others mainly

done  by foreigners, and earn decent wages.  I am pleased

with  MOM's joint efforts with NTUC in helping retrenched

workers,  but more needs to be done during this difficult

time.

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to dwell further on placement and

training schemes, as the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>

Minister for Manpower has adequately covered it.  But one

other  area in training which I need to highlight is  the

training   of   shift   employees.    They   have   great

difficulties  attending  training  programmes,  and  this

needs to be addressed by CET.  Today, the challenges  are

different and daunting, and it needs more efforts.  I  do

agree  with Mdm Halimah Yacob that we should monitor  the

situation very carefully.  We are not suggesting that all

the  foreign  workers  should be sent  back.   A  lot  of

concerns  have  been raised.  Workers are  interested  to

carry on with their jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Nithiah Nandan, can you end your

speech soon, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan:</b> So we should take extra effort

in monitoring the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern which needs to be addressed is that

the  unemployed  are  told  that  there  are  still  jobs

available,  some  of  which  are  reflected  on  the  MOM

website.   Unfortunately, this does not square  with  the

perception on the ground.  A number of unemployed workers

have  indicated  that after many tries,  they  are  still

unable  to get jobs.  MOM needs to identify the  reasons,

whether it is skills mismatch, employers' preference  for

certain  age  groups of workers, or other  reasons.   MOM

should put in place appropriate measures to resolve  this

issue of perception.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Magad, you have three cuts.

You can take them all together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, we

have  heard during the previous three days and also  from

the Minister for Manpower a moment ago about unemployment

which  is  currently affecting Singaporeans,  there  were

also  calls  by  some to slow down the  flow  of  foreign

workers,  so  that Singaporeans can be given priority  to

bid for the scarcer jobs available in our job market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, too, am sympathetic to the plight of

unemployed  Singaporeans, we need  to  be  pragmatic  and

think about the needs of employers too.  Notwithstanding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>

the  weak employment market, there are in fact many  good

high  quality jobs available in the job market. But  many

of these jobs require intense training and application of

thinking skills on the job.  Regrettably, I dare say that

many  Singaporeans shun such jobs.  They are still hoping

for  the high-paying routine-type easy-to-do jobs  coming

on  to their laps.  Unfortunately, such jobs are few  and

far between, and many of these are gone forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I led a group of unemployed

residents to consider employment in the Wafer Fab Park in

Pasir Ris.  After being explained the nature of the  job,

only about 30% said they would consider applying for  the

jobs.  The primary reasons are the requirements to put on

clean-room  attire and 12-hour shifts.  I  later  learned

that,  of  the 40 people or so who attended the briefing,

less  than  10  actually applied.  I have a  similar  sad

experience   in  my  own  organisation  where  clean-room

technicians'  jobs requiring operation  of  sophisticated

thin-film high vacuum systems and application of thinking

skills are refused by Singaporeans.  As a result, 70%  of

my employees working in this department are Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question is: where do we go from here? I

believe,  Sir,  employers do want  to  give  priority  to

Singaporeans to fill vacancies.  But, often, they  cannot

wait for the right candidates to come by.  I ask that MOM

and our labour movement continue to drum into the ears of

Singaporeans  that  these jobs have to  and  must  go  to

foreigners, if they continue to refuse them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What choices do employers have? The multi-billion

dollar  factories and expensive equipment  needed  to  be

manned   to   recover  investments.   Singaporeans   must

therefore  understand  that we  have  no  choice  but  to

maintain a barrier-free employment system, and that  they

have  to  face  competition from foreigners  and  foreign

talents  who  are  more than willing to grab  such  high-paying  and  stable jobs.  Unless they  wake  up  to  the

reality  of  the situation, we are going to  continue  to

give away such high-quality jobs to foreigners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my next cut, it is an established fact that

as  an  economy matures, such as what is observed in  the

United   States   and   many   European   countries,    a

corresponding   contractual  manpower   supply   industry

typically  evolves with it.  Organisations  operating  in

such  economies need to be lean and trim in order  to  be

competitive  on  costs.   A  readily  available  manpower

supply   industry  fills  the  gap  whenever  there   are

temporary surges in work.  We are inching towards such  a

stage  as  we restructure and position ourselves  into  a

knowledge-based  economy.  Although there  is  already  a

skeletal  presence of a contract manpower supply industry

to supply contract manpower to serve industry needs, most

companies  doing so operate as job matching agencies  and

earn  commissions  from successful  matches  rather  than

maintaining   staff  on  their  payroll   for   immediate

deployment  whenever  there is  a  need.   I  see  it  as

beneficial  if  we  could formalise  the  presence  of  a

contract manpower supply industry to supply manpower  for

professional   assignments  as  well   as   satisfy   the

requirements of an evolving service industry,  and  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister to take a hard  look  at  my

proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two advantages I see in such an approach.

First  is  the  creation  of  additional  employment,  as

companies  in  such industries will maintain  a  pool  of

professionally trained employees and have them  ready  to

be  deployed  for  contractual assignments.   The  second

advantage  is  the  enhancement  of  professionalism   of

individuals which companies are expected to invest in, in

order to project a professional image of their respective

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on now to my third cut. I am glad that

the  ERC, among others, has also placed emphasis  on  our

growing  services  sector, recognising our  potential  to

become  Asia's leading services hub.  A key consideration

to  realising  this  vision is to first  ensure  that  we

develop  and  fully  understand what  service  excellence

means.   While  I  believe Singapore is  quite  ahead  of

regional countries, such as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>

Thailand,  Malaysia and, to some degree,  Hong  Kong  and

Taiwan,  in terms of service excellence ranking, we  pale

considerably when compared to more sophisticated markets,

such as the US, UK and Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To differentiate ourselves from our neighbouring

countries, we need to carve out a strategy to develop the

ability   to   provide  differentiated  or   high-contact

service.   Our  domestic enterprises must learn  to  work

around the disadvantage of limited labour supply and high

labour  cost, and turn this into a competitive advantage.

As  a  cosmopolitan city, we have many people  with  high

purchasing  power  who are constantly  looking  for  such

differentiated  services.  I am  confident  that  we  can

succeed to position ourselves as a leading services  hub,

if  we  can master the art of showering service upon  our

customers and make them a satisfied and happy lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond customer satisfaction and customer delight,

Sir,  we should learn to romance the customer.  We should

ride on Romancing Singapore and propagate this message to

all   local  service  providers.   The  imagery  of   the

Singapore Girl immediately comes to mind when one  thinks

about  service excellence.  The great service one  enjoys

on  board  a Singapore Airlines flight has not only  made

the airline one of the world's leading airlines, but also

impressed  upon the world that Singapore has the  ability

for service excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIA experience shows that setting and processes

are  as  important  as the employees of an  organisation.

The   secret   is  to  take  the  customers'   experience

seriously,  create  an  emotional  connection  with   the

customers,  and  ensure  that  the  right  experience  is

delivered to the customers.  It is this interaction  that

counts,  and this is what companies renowned  in  service

excellence have put in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that apart from creating a service

excellence movement to instill among Singaporean  service

providers the importance of service, we should also  seek

out effective training models of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>

companies with outstanding service and develop affordable

programmes  for  the  service  industry.   In  regard  to

training,  there are a few local organisations,  such  as

Singapore Airlines, the Raffles and Ritz-Carlton  hotels,

which  provide  outstanding service, from which  training

models  could be crafted and initially used as kick-start

training   programmes.   Upon  laying   the   appropriate

foundation,  each industry should develop an  academy  to

raise the professionalism of its workforce, such as  what

the  hotel industry has done in Shatec.  With an enhanced

service  profile,  workers can  acquire  the  appropriate

service skills standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ultimate goal should be the creation of a

Singapore  brand service that is unique and where  people

will  rave  about.  We already have some form of  service

excellence, such as the Excellent Service Awards.  We now

need to make it more widespread and universal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, much has been said

about   the   concern  of  unemployment   and   long-term

unemployment in Singapore.  The increasing trend of long-term  unemployment actually stood at 1.4% as of  December

2002, compared to about 0.3-0.5% in the early half of the

1990s.  This is very worrying, because mainly those  with

below  secondary education and those 40 years  and  above

are the most affected group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, employment prospects are not very

good.  With 28 jobs for every 100 job seekers, even  when

we  fill up all the vacancies, many of them will still be

out  of  job.  I agree with the Minister that  attracting

more  investments is the way to create jobs. But with  28

jobs  for  every 100 job seekers, what are the Ministry's

specific   plans  to  boost  the  number  of   jobs   for

Singaporeans?  Has the Ministry actually considered maybe

promoting  and  facilitating employment creation  in  the

informal and semi-informal sectors of the economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that it is the individual's

responsibility to look for a job, retrain himself and try

to  keep  the job, we must also know that many  of  them,

after

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>

retraining, still could not find a job.  So, what are the

Ministry's specific measures to help this group of people

who  are  willing to change but are unable to find  jobs?

For  those who still refuse to change their mindset, what

are the specific measures that the Ministry is taking  to

help to change their mindset so that they will be willing

to  take  up  different  jobs  and  have  more  realistic

expectations, and so on?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking into the longer horizon, I think that

structural  unemployment would be a problem that  we  are

going  to  face.   What steps is the Ministry  taking  to

prepare ourselves for that challenge?

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, as the Minister has explained earlier, many older

workers  are finding it hard to retain their jobs.   Many

are  getting  retrenched  as their  companies  resize  or

relocate.   Once  jobless,  they  are  likely  to  remain

jobless  for  a very long time.  Retaining jobs  is  thus

more  important than creating new ones.  To retain  jobs,

we need to look at the two biggest components of business

cost:  wage and land costs.  Since this pertains  to  the

Ministry of Manpower, I will just touch on wage cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have high CPF contributions from employers,

the  fight  to  retain  jobs will  be  hard.   While  the

Government  takes the ERC proposal to cut the  employers'

contribution  by  4%, it is not going  to  help  much  in

retaining jobs.  It is also unfair to those aged  workers

who are still highly valued by their companies.  Instead,

the  Government  can  be more flexible  and  stop  micro-managing,  and  free  up the CPF contribution  rates  for

employers   and   employees   to   negotiation    between

themselves.   If he is a valuable employee,  the  company

would  be  more  than  willing  to  offer  him  a  higher

contribution  rate.  But if the wage cost  is  still  too

high,  the  employer would have the option  to  negotiate

with  the  employee  for  a lower  or  even  no  employer

contributions at all.  It is still better to have  a  job

than  going jobless for a very long time.  Some employees

would  be  more  than willing to forgo  their  employers'

contributions,  if  they can retain their  current  jobs.

So, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>

Government  should not make it mandatory for them  to  be

retrenched by forcing a standard contribution rate.   Let

the employer and the employee negotiate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, as Singapore's

economy  restructures,  workers with  higher  skills  and

enterprising  attitudes  would  be  more  able  to   stay

employed or to move on to new employment should  they  be

displaced. But the key challenge socially is to help  the

lower skilled workers, many of whom are older workers  as

well,  to earn a living, because there is a segment among

such workers who would not be able to upgrade fast enough

or  adapt fast enough in tandem with the requirements  of

economic  development. So, even  if  we  have  the  lower

skilled or semi-skilled type jobs coming in with the  new

investments, there is a segment that might find it  quite

difficult  to  access  those  kinds  of  jobs.   In  this

connection, I hope that concerted efforts can be put into

identifying  and  highlighting  suitable  job  areas  and

opportunities and on creating areas of work suitable  for

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, one good area to look at is in the non-export sector, on the services side, where the areas of

work tend to be more labour-intensive. When I say labour-intensive  here,  I  do  not  mean  that  you  have  many

headcount  within  the company, but rather  that  in  the

content of work, it is labour-intensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest some areas for

consideration.  I consider the life cycle area,  such  as

those  relating  to birth, and that would include  infant

care  as well as childcare, eldercare, healthcare or even

services relating to death.  Those are necessary services

that  any  society and every society would need  all  the

time and certain areas within that would offer prospects.

Recurrent everyday needs in the areas, say, retail, food,

housing,  transport, again, there might be certain  areas

within  that  that can be designed for  workers  in  this

category  to  take  on;  public  needs,  such  as  public

cleanliness, hygiene, public health, security.  Then,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>

there  could be areas of status needs, such as home care,

housekeeping, errand running. And there would be informal

sector activities, including home-based work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open up opportunities in these areas to such

workers require new and different ways of organising them

because  these workers are individually unlikely to  know

how  to organise themselves. Sir, in this regard, I  hope

that  more  encouragement can  be  given  to  efforts  to

organise them for full-time, part-time and contract work,

and  in  this way, to render them competitive as a  group

with, say, foreign labour.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I fully support the

Manpower   Minister's   emphasis  earlier   on   personal

responsibility on the part of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key responsibility must be on the worker to find

jobs,  to  identify the right training and  to  make  the

necessary adjustments.  I know the Manpower Minister  has

tried very hard to help older workers to stay employable,

but  no matter how much personal responsibility the older

worker  takes  in  applying  for  jobs,  those  above  50

continue to find it hard to get a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the latest labour market survey shows, more than

half of the retrenched, aged 50 and above, could not find

re-employment  within  six months  last  year.   This  is

really quite alarming. Even the employed, those who  have

jobs, above 45, are now beginning to feel insecure.  They

are worried about losing their jobs because they know  it

would  not be easy to find another job again.  They  feel

that  they are at the mercy of employers and of the harsh

market  which  discriminates against older workers.  They

have  to fight the battle of proving that they are  still

productive  workers,  capable of giving  many  more  good

years of service, and that they are worth their salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to help employers understand that older

workers can be a plus in their operations. If I may  cite

an   example.  One  of  my  grassroots  leaders  runs   a

restaurant business , the Village Wok.  One restaurant is

in Thomson, the other in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>

Geylang.   In his recruitment advertisements for workers,

he  would always state that he prefers workers above  40.

So I asked him why.  He cited three reasons and these are

based on his own experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they have a good attitude to work. They are

more committed to the employer and they will not leave at

the whiff of a better opportunity. Second, they have more

experience in skills that the employer does not  need  to

spend  too  much time or money to train them. And  third,

they  have more realistic expectations when it  comes  to

wages.  This is his own experience because he finds  that

the  older  workers have gone through a lot in  life,  so

they know the value of a secure job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to highlight more of such enlightened

employers  who hire older workers, not because  of  good-heartedness or charity, or because there are so many  out

there that need to be absorbed for the nation, but it  is

because it makes good business sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government said that the move to lower the

employer's CPF contribution rate for those in  the  50-55

age  group  is to enhance their employability.   I  would

like  to ask the Manpower Minister to conduct a study  to

find  out if this would indeed help older workers  to  be

more  employable.   If  not, we might  want  to  consider

reviewing  it.  If they only just reduce the pay  of  all

those  above  50  without any effect on their  employment

situation,  as  the  experience of my  grassroots  leader

highlights,  the affected older workers will  learn,  can

learn   and  must  learn  how  to  adjust  their   salary

expectations, without the Government giving a blanket pay

cut  via  the  CPF for all workers above  50.  This  will

indeed    hammer   home   the   message    of    personal

responsibility.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo, you have got two

cuts.  Take them together, please.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, there are two

issues  that  I  would  like  to  raise  with  regard  to

preparing for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>

self-employment and nurturing entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on preparing for self-employment. I would

like  to  submit  some suggestions to facilitate  a  more

ready  mindset and to help these unemployed  to  be  more

self-reliant.   Experience of the  last  two  years  have

woken  up several jobless among the PMEs that their  once

corporate career life is never to return again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help the unemployed continue to feel a

sense  of usefulness and purpose?  To be suddenly  thrown

out  of  work, one can be very disorientated and  feel  a

sense  of  loss. One way is to enable them an association

with  a  surrogate  employer who can then  nurture  their

confidence  and equip them with skills and knowledge  and

connect them to potential project work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare at this point that I am

the  founder  member of SPEC and serves as  the  Honorary

Deputy Chairman. SPEC was set up two years ago as a self-funding   cooperative  to  provide  a  mutual   self-help

environment  for these people. SPEC has a mindset  change

and  career counselling module under WSTP and  more  than

3,000  Singaporeans have benefited from  this  programme.

Both  employers and employees, who have gone through this

module,  are better prepared for the parting of ways.   I

would encourage employers to tap on the services of  SPEC

and   these  include:   employment  and  small   business

advisory, job and business counselling, writing  business

plans  and  proposals.   On  a  regular  basis,  it  runs

seminars,  showcasing  the success stories  of  self-made

Singaporeans.  This is to encourage economically inactive

PMEs to learn from others and take on self-employment and

entrepreneurship in the portfolio economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: will the Government be disposed

towards  the  idea of encouraging employers  to  consider

SPEC membership as a step-down caretaker benefit for  the

employees?   MOM can encourage via endorsement statements

in their publicity materials.  My second

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>

question  is:   at  the  same time, will  the  Government

consider  a  tax rebate for such step-down care  benefits

that employers take up for their PMEs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is the idea to set up a community of

learning and sharing so as to better transfer, manage and

retain  knowledge.  This is particularly so for  projects

that  are  given to foreigners. There have been calls  by

several  MPs  for civil servants to be less  bureaucratic

and to be more customer-centric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can say that it is all perception issues but

perception,  we  know, is reality.  I wish  to  highlight

another perception which reinforces that anything foreign

seems  better. Such perception undermines the  experience

and  expertise of our local Singaporeans.   It  has  been

observed  that  often  times, our  Ministries,  statutory

boards  and  GLCs award contract for services to  foreign

service providers and bring in overseas speakers at hefty

fees.  This is desirable where locals lack the experience

and  expertise.  In many instances, foreign entities pull

out  when  the going gets tough.  Neither  do  we  see  a

transfer  of  knowledge or expertise  and  experience  to

Singaporeans.   We   all  know  for  Singapore's   longer

development, capabilities, knowledge and experience  must

be managed, captured and retained for the KBE.  This is a

sure   way   to   go   to  nurture  self-employment   and

entrepreneurship. We should therefore facilitate the set-up of a community of learning and sharing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, I would like to propose that in the

award  of  contract  for services, a  Singaporean  entity

should  be  included to work with the foreign  entity  as

partners.   In this way, Singapore will begin to  develop

specific icons in the area of knowledge management.  This

will  then further spur the entrepreneurial spirit  among

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On PMEs, Sir, I would like to raise two issues. The

first issue relates to job match for PMEs. The retrenched

are having a tough time getting back to work.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>

economy picked up a little bit last year but jobs  coming

back and new jobs created were mainly for blue-collar and

lower skilled workers.  FTAs concluded will create 20,000

jobs, so EDB said.  But EDB also said that it would  take

about three years to materialise for each investment. And

where high job skills are created, they appear to be  too

highly skilled for many Singaporeans. For example,  there

are jobs created in the biomedical sector which require a

PhD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible industry in which this group may be

able to find gainful employment is with MOE.  But we know

that  even  in polytechnics, contracts for lecturers  are

not  renewed.  The truth of the matter, Sir, is that even

with new jobs created, it is likely the graduating cohort

and  the  younger ones who are going to fill up  the  gap

first.   This  is  because, all things being  equal,  the

potential employer will prefer to employ a younger one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I would like to raise are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can the Minister enlighten the House on the

extent  of job mismatch among the PMEs, ie, they  do  not

have  the  right skills for the jobs available?   Second,

how  many  have gone through the job conversion programme

at  MOE  and  gained a foothold as their teaching  staff?

And  third,  how  can  we ensure  that  given  the  right

attitudes,  skills and qualification, PMEs above  40  can

gain equal opportunities for employment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to an endowment fund for

PMEs.  Last year, I have asked for such a fund.  I called

it  the  HEED  fund  as  I  was trying  to  persuade  the

Government  to heed the need for such a fund.  Since  the

Government  has  paid  no heed, again  this  year,  I  am

bringing it up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need to reskill and retrain this group of

PMEs  is  also important.  In time to come, we know  that

this  cohort  of  employees will  constitute  the  bigger

workforce.    Sir,  this fund will  help  the  retrenched

PMEs, or those who are to be retrenched, to pursue higher

skills and education. This will help to increase their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>

employability and also enable them to fend for themselves

through self-employment, part-time work and flexible work

arrangements. This group is growing by the day.  Yet,  we

seem  to  put  our  own mindset that they  can  fend  for

themselves - they do not need help at all. The  likes  of

Olivia Lum are testimony that they should be able to make

it  if  they try hard enough.  But, Sir, how many  Olivia

Lums can there be? For every one Olivia Lum who makes it,

there  are hundreds out there who just need that booster.

Call it luck or providence intervention.  It only touches

a  few  out of the hundreds. And when they are in  droves

out  there,  a  civic  cautious  society  would  want  to

mobilise and organise some form of assistance. This is to

ensure  that we contain the possible energies  that  they

are  capable  of  generating back to the  economy  if  we

organise and harness them well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the set up of the endowment fund can develop

and equip PMEs for the future economy.  Otherwise, we may

face  the  same sort of structural unemployment  for  the

sandwich PMEs as we are facing today for the workers.  My

question  is:  will Government be disposed to  facilitate

the  set-up  of  such  a  fund by encouraging  employers,

employer groups and professional bodies to start  such  a

fund and the Government will match such donations, as  it

has done for the endowment fund for workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, many jobs are

lost  during the current difficult economic crisis.   One

reason  is  the  global economic slowdown.   But  a  more

profound  reason  is  a change in the  structure  of  the

Singapore  economy.   The  new  economy  jobs  require  a

different  set of skills and competencies. Do our  people

understand  this?  Do our people understand the  dynamics

of  the new economy and implications that it will have on

us?

Despite  the  economic  slowdown,  many  jobs  are  still

available in the market.  At first, Singaporeans were not

prepared  to  take them.  They made many  excuses.   They

were  reluctant  to  take on new, difficult,  unfamiliar,

lower  paying  jobs.  They were reluctant  to  learn  new

skills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>

However,  today,  many of the same  people  have  changed

their  minds.  They have taken on these jobs.  They  have

gone  for  training  and to learn new  skills.   But  not

everyone has done so. Some are still waiting for the  old

jobs  to come back.  What is really important is not that

merely  everyone takes the new jobs offered to them,  but

they  need to understand why they have to do so.   Hence,

more  needs to be done.  People change more readily  when

they  are faced with a problem.  We must turn the present

difficulties  into an opportunity to get  our  people  to

understand the new economy and accept the needed changes.

We  must inform and educate them.  We must convince  them

to accept and adapt to the new economic environment.  Our

future  prosperity  depends on successfully  making  this

transition.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to ask the Government what has

been done to change the mindsets of our workforce for the

new economy.  What progress has been achieved?  What more

can be done?  What are some of the future plans?  We must

not stint on time, money and effort, in this vital task.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, let me thank Members for their suggestions to assist

retrenched and unemployed Singaporeans as well as  cogent

recommendations  to  improve our unemployment  situation.

Sir,   the  points  they  have  brought  up  are   indeed

important,  as  many  analysts  predict  that  this  more

disruptive  economic climate may persist for  some  time.

In  other  words,  how globalisation will  pan  out,  the

backlashes,  how our economic conditions would  be,  even

following  the  impending war if  there  is  one,  remain

uncertain.  These are fundamentally turbulent  times  and

we  are  not quite sure when visibility will improve  and

what   the  climate  or  the  scenarios  will  be,  after

visibility   has  improved.   Therefore,  it   would   be

important  for us to examine our fundamentals for  policy

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responses to existing challenges are underpinned

by prevailing principles

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>

and,  if  you  like, philosophies.  Through our  meetings

with other Government officials and comparison with other

systems, we consistently subject our beliefs to scrutiny.

Singapore, if you believe in equal commiseration, is  not

the only country facing unemployment.  Others have had it

much  tougher and for a longer time.  Recently, I  led  a

delegation  to  some European cities to  study  how  they

address  their  problems of unemployment and  assistance.

The trip shed much light and I will share some main take-away lessons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lesson is that temporary assistance

schemes,  indiscriminately applied and started  with  the

best   of   intentions,  degenerate  very  quickly   into

permanent  schemes and hurt the overall economy.   Please

note that these are systems in developed countries run by

seasoned bureaucrats with their armies of think-tanks and

policy   makers.   Even  with  their  vast   intellectual

resources and the realisation that change has to be  made

urgently,  they find it a stupendous task to  ameliorate,

let alone reverse, the increase in spending on assistance

related to unemployment.  So, in some countries, they end

up  spending  as  much  as  3% of  their  GDP  on  social

assistance schemes.  This is more than three-quarters  of

our  Education  budget, which caters for 550,000  people,

but  they  spent it on social assistance schemes.   Their

corresponding  cost of government is about  40%  of  GDP,

compared with 19% in Singapore currently.  GST, in  these

countries,  is  in  the double digits  and  corresponding

marginal personal and corporate tax rates twice  that  of

ours,  as  they  have to raise by taxes and  revenues  40

cents   just   to  generate  one  dollar   of   turnover.

Predictably,  these countries lose their  competitiveness

and  the negative spiral begins, and continues.  Sir,  if

we  ever choose to follow suit, this will be a load  that

will  sink us all.  Perhaps, some MPs might say  that  we

can  benefit from the wisdom of hindsight and  avoid  the

excesses that these economies have been encumbered  with.

Are we so certain?  Should we venture into the water when

there are many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

signs telling us to beware of the strong undercurrents?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of suggestions, both from

the  speakers  during the Committee  of  Supply  and  the

Budget    debate,   in   terms   of   Government   loans,

retrenchment, endowment, and `heed' funds.  Sir, they are

well-meaning,  but I would caution, eg,  loan  funds  and

retrenchment   funds,   how  would   Government   enforce

repayments  if  we use their houses as collaterals?   For

borrowers  who are at default, Government  would  not  be

keen  to  repossess their houses.  Alternatively,  if  we

allow members to use their own or future CPF funds,  they

would  deplete their retirement savings.  I would caution

us moving that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like MPs who have weekly meet-the-people sessions, I

share  Members'  concern over the  plight  of  retrenched

workers, and our more targeted approach to assist them is

the  right  one.  We have many benefits as enumerated  by

Deputy Prime Minister Lee as well as financial assistance

schemes in our CDCs and CCCs.  Deputy Prime Minister  Lee

spoke  on the sensitivity of our grassroots schemes.   We

should not underestimate the effectiveness and value that

our various grassroots schemes have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My CCC welfare committee, like yours, I am sure, is

a  veritable  fount  of  local  knowledge.   I  have  one

particular lady who has lived in the estate for  over  20

years.  Sometimes, I almost believe that she knows  every

elderly  or  down-and-out constituent.   She  knows,  for

example,  in detail what cars their children drive,  what

they  eat and how much they eat.  Occasionally, she  will

bring  hardship cases to my MPS with specific details  of

family  feuds and how the appellant has suffered.   Other

times, she will disagree on certain persons that we  have

chosen  to  help.   "They use the money  to  treat  their

friends  at  coffee shops", she tells me.  Or,  "her  son

drives   a  big  car  and  they  are  still  getting   PA

allowance."  Their local knowledge in our community-based

assistance scheme is invaluable.  They serve as brakes or

lubricants, to be appropriately applied.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

And, these schemes are better than any other bureaucratic

schemes I have seen today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should be prudent that in our efforts

to help those retrenched, we do not unwittingly undermine

the  efforts  of the willing. What do I mean?   Yes,  the

unemployment  rate was 4.2% in the last quarter.  Let  us

not  forget  that  96%  of  those  that  have  jobs  will

themselves  to work.  Sir, work is not fun and  glamorous

every  day.  There are days for every person,  and  I  am

sure  for all Members in this House, where you choose  to

work  whether you feel you like it or not.  There  is  no

fanfare or stardust outside your door.  It is a conscious

choice we make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned my study trip and the lessons learned,

and one particular poignant vignette was obtained from  a

senior  official who has been helping the unemployed  for

decades.  He has lots of experience as their unemployment

rates  were in the teens for many years.  Those requiring

employment  assistance, he has concluded  from  years  of

experience, fall into three groups.  The first group  has

skills and attitude, and are self-starters.  Many of them

get  information  on their own and need  little,  if  any

help,   to  get  re-employed.   The  second  group  needs

training  indeed for new skills to get jobs.   The  third

group, he graphically portrays, needs to be reminded that

they have an interview the next day.  Indeed, officers in

his  agency actually call on the day of interview to wake

this  third group of members to remind them!  He did  not

recount   his   conclusions  with  bitter   cynicism   or

disillusionment.   He said so with a matter-of-fact  tone

and  with  a  sense  of acceptance and  equanimity.   His

realistic  appraisal would help his  organisation  to  be

more effective in their role, he added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked what has Government

done  to  create enough jobs.  He has said  whether  they

were  the  right types of jobs.  Sir, other Members  have

expressed,  despite jobs being present, as  Dr  Wang  Kai

Yuen has said, whether Government has underestimated  the

extent  of  the  problem.  In these times,  it  would  be

prudent for us to look

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>

inwards  as  well  as  outwards.  Our  figures  are  very

robust.   They are from figures that we take  from  about

25,000 households and they are trend lines as well  which

convince  us that they are indeed robust.  In fact,  last

year,  our  local employment grew by 1.3%.   It  did  not

shrink.   Yes, there was a net loss in unemployment,  the

amount of which was due to foreigners leaving, both  with

Work Permit and Employment Pass, but our local employment

grew by 1.3%.  Should we start saying that there are  not

enough  jobs,  that  the situation is  imperfect?   Where

should we place our efforts and resources?  Do we deprive

those who have a good attitude or do help those who place

themselves  `furthest from the job  market'  -  this  was

another  term we learned on this trip?  Do we  pile  even

higher  the  table for those who feel that  the  existing

food  on their table is not appetising?  Do we take  away

food  from  the table for those who by their own  efforts

feed  themselves?   There are no  easy  answers,  but  we

cannot be naive.  It will undo us.  In all our asking and

angst, we should first get wisdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third lesson was that those who fail to plan and

provide  for the future have planned to fail.  I know  it

sounds   axiomatic   but,  nonetheless,   remains   true.

Governments all around the globe are grappling  with  the

adequacy  of  pension funds as life-expectancy  increases

and  populations age. First generation Singaporeans build

up   substantial  reserves  which  have  created   stable

conditions  and  a  strong currency.   In  October  2001,

Deputy  Prime Minister Lee indicated that the  Government

would consider the withdrawal of CPF in extremis, but now

is  not the time.  The recent ERC has concluded that  the

CPF  system should be refocused on the three basic  needs

of  retirement,  housing and healthcare.   And,  the  CPF

system stay focused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are jobs available. Yes, workers have to

adjust  their  mindsets and expectations but  it  can  be

done.   My Minister mentioned that for year 2002, 72%  of

those retrenched in the first three quarters of the  year

found   employment  by  December.   Seven  out   of   ten

Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>

proved  that  it can be done by finding work  six  months

after  retrenchment.  Therefore, our  approach  has  been

that we should enable those who want to remain employable

through   reskilling   or  to   counsel   them   in   job

opportunities.  But let us not mistake and  say  that  we

need  to give guarantees.  There are no guarantees.   The

only  person  who  can guarantee success  is  the  worker

himself.    All  schemes  come  to  nought  without   the

determination and effort of the individual.  So I welcome

the  endorsement and the support of Members for  the  CET

board which is the right direction we are taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fully agree with other Members that we should

facilitate more the take-up of jobs.  Mr Steve Chia asked

whether  we  should  allow  employers  and  employees  to

negotiate their CPF contributions.  Sir, the ERC recently

recommended  that we should raise the employee  CPF  wage

bands  for lower income workers from $200-$363  to  $500-$750,  so  that lower income employees, especially  part-time  workers,  will be able to take home  higher  salary

while   their   employer's   CPF   contribution   remains

unchanged.   This would increase the incentive  for  more

people to re-enter the workforce, particularly to do part-time  work.   However, we would not  want  to  completely

waive  the  contribution requirement for this group,  nor

waive the employer's CPF contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to strike a balance between building

up  sufficient  CPF funds for old age, on one  hand,  and

encouraging more people to enter the workforce.  However,

I  agree that there is room for review, if need be, as to

where the base salary level should be.  And I am also not

keen  on  this idea because I think there is more  to  it

than  just fundamentally CPF contributions.  For example,

our  PJTP  scheme that my Minister spoke  about  provides

very  generous wage adjustments, if you like.  We sponsor

50%  of those salaries in the first six months and,  even

with  those generous schemes, people are not  hiring.   I

suspect that many employers are reluctant to hire because

of the uncertainty.  First came September

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>

11,  then  the  current  Iraq crisis.   Until  visibility

improves, we will have to stick to this situation and not

adjust precipitously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has suggested that we increase

efficiencies  by  formulating  or  formalising   contract

manpower industry.  He will be happy to note that  indeed

it  has already happened without any of our measures  and

that there is flexibility in our labour market.  In 2002,

70%  of  contract workers found employment  through  this

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members, among which Mr Heng Chee How, Mr

Nithiah,  Dr Ong Seh Hong, who have given suggestions  on

how  we should help those with lower skills and at higher

risk  of structural unemployment.  I know that they speak

from experience, having personally helped the retrenched,

and  they  are realistic proposals.  They have  suggested

the  potential of non-tradable jobs. MOM agrees.  Several

sectors - healthcare, hospitality, infantcare, eldercare,

public  cleaning,  domestic  cleaning,  restaurants   and

retail  -  have already been identified by MOM,  EDB  and

SPRING because they have either good growth prospects  or

great  propensity to absorb local workers.  These sectors

have  existing  vacancies, but locals are  generally  not

keen to consider them for a variety of reasons, like  low

wages,  perceived poor image, long training  periods  and

structural   impediments  like  shift   work   and   work

conditions.  We will slowly tackle the problems,  one  by

one, deliberately.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these sectors, MOM is currently looking at the

whole value chain of the workforce development.  We agree

that  there is potential here and, therefore, we want  to

focus  on  this.  This is one of the efforts of  the  CET

board.   The  aim  is  to ensure better  coordination  of

industry development with manpower development strategies

and,  hence,  better  match between  the  skills  of  our

workers and industries' needs, as some Members have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as of December 2002, there were some 5,000

job vacancies in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>

goods-producing  industries,  while  there  were  another

8,000 job vacancies in services industries.  All in  all,

MOM,   EDB   and   SPRING   have  identified   employment

opportunities in 12 sectors that we will focus on, and we

will engage key stakeholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad suggested that we should focus on the

service industry  -  he indeed has a point  -  and we are

doing  that.   We have sponsored NTUC Fairprice training,

and  we  are working with the Retail Academy as  well  as

some healthcare providers like HMI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo has asked what aid is given to

professionals,  managers  and executives.   We  have  not

neglected them.  For workers who are keen to set up small

businesses  and  be  self-employed,  the  existing  Self-Employment  Training  Programme, which  was  launched  in

April  last year, will equip them with the knowledge  and

pre-requisites.  In fact, 4,000 places were taken up last

year.     And  56%  of  the  participants  who  completed

training  indicated that they would like to  start  small

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to provide job matching services to

retrenched   executives  complemented  by  industry   and

community  job  fairs.   There  are  nearly  1,000   jobs

available  in  MOM's  job  bank  for  professionals   and

executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what are the programmes in terms of the

strategic manpower conversion programmes.  Indeed,  there

are  many.   We  have  started  training  in  sectors  of

infocomm,   logistics,  community  and  social  services,

healthcare    nursing,    intellectual    property    and

internationalisation sectors.  It is not that we did  not

heed.   We  did heed.  It is just that the  fund  is  not

called  by  the  name she suggested.  It  is  called  the

Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme.  We may  try  to

think of how we can change it to suit her acronym, but it

might take us some time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other economic agencies such as EDB, MAS,

IDA  and IE Singapore have also provided training support

to professionals.  In 2002, these agencies helped

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>

train over 13,000 executives and professionals to support

the industry capability and developmental thrusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Ong Seh Hong

on  the  need  to  change  mindsets.   We  need  to  help

Singaporeans  transit their mindshifts, and  we  will  do

that.  We have had 15 good years.  It takes some time and

we  will continue to emphasise this.  Many Members  would

have  come  across our Jobs Task Force's public education

programme.   It  is  a  9-month programme,  and  we  will

continue to spend time on it.  Has it worked?  Yes.   The

fact  that  72% of retrenched workers found re-employment

in  2002  indicates that we have some limited  but  early

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng spoke about the mature workers. To

encourage and incentivise employers, we talked about  the

People-for-Jobs  Traineeship  Programme   (PJTP).     The

Minister said that as at February 2003, the programme has

some  4,000  participating companies.   In  other  words,

employers  are  responding and this  has  benefited  some

9,000  mature employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry understands and appreciates the

difficulties faced by older workers.  Together  with  the

employer  organisations and trade unions, we are stepping

up our efforts to assist Singaporeans who have difficulty

seeking employment, including the implementation  of  the

tripartite    guidelines   on   Non-discriminatory    Job

Advertisements  and  the  Code of Responsible  Employment

Practices  jointly issued by NTUC and SBF/SNEF to  change

the mindset of employers on older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Members. I think the elderly and

the  mature workers, which Members here also fall in  the

group,  are getting a bad rap.  Many employers,  I  feel,

will  rue  the day they did not capitalise on  this  soft

labour  market to employ such workers.  And I agree  with

Ms  Irene  Ng  that  this is a business  aspect,  not  an

altruistic  bent.   There are some enlightened  employers

like  Jennifer Lee and Ms Irene Ng's example of an  owner

who understood that mature workers have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>

cachet  of experience and networking and they are  likely

to  stay with the company longer.  The image and fear  of

mature  workers  falling  ill more  compared  to  younger

workers is over-rated.  Statistics show that the majority

of  medical  consumption occurs in the last 10  years  of

life,  ie,  it occurs in the majority after our mandatory

retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang tells us not to forget that

Singaporeans  voted the Government in and, therefore,  we

have  a  responsibility  to  find  them  jobs.   I  would

reiterate to Mr Low that we have never forgotten.  It  is

particularly because of that that we have created schemes

that will help us to be competitive in the long run.   He

implies  that  if we only restrict work opportunities  to

Singaporeans our economy would do better and the  problem

solved.   My Minister dwelt on that a long time,  but  it

seems that the point needs reiterating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which nationality would he exclude? In every

industry, there are ample examples, without me having  to

name them, of luminaries  -  there are many in this House

-  that the vitality, the verve, the competitiveness, the

ability  to attract investments is because of our  multi-national  representation.  Would we be better  served  by

having  a  company full of Singaporeans  with  a  limited

talent  pool diminishing the pie, equal misery?  The  pie

shrinks, salaries drop and more are unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a quote from The Wealth and Poverty of Nations

will  be  suitable at this point.  This is a book written

by  David  Landes,  Emeritus  Professor  of  History  and

Economics at Harvard.  For those who want to refer to it,

it is in pages 225, 229-230. He was trying to compare and

ask  himself why some countries progress and  others  did

not.  In this particular chapter, he asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why no industrial revolution in India? After all,

India had the world's premier cotton industry in the 17th

and  18th centuries, unbeatable for quality, variety  and

cost."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many reasons, one which was a closed mind,

he cites one particular poignant example and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British engineers who built the Indian railways

understood that Indian labor, cheap as it was, would move

earth  and  rock by hand; but they also took for  granted

that the Indians would use the wheelbarrows.  Not at all:

the Indians were used to moving heavy burdens in a basket

on  their  head and refused to change.  We even have  one

report  of Indian laborers placing barrows on their  head

rather  than  wheel  them.   Presumably  such  resistance

reflected  a  desire  to  spread the  work  and  increase

employment  [to their locals], especially  to  women  and

children."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is self-serving; this is self-diminishing.

Among  all our efforts, there is one thing that we should

not  do and, indeed, would prove futile, ie, to hold back

barriers  and erect barriers.  We are in an open  export-driven  economy.  We depend on free trade to thrive  and,

with that, we expose ourselves to international standards

of  productivity,  processes  and  practices.   Mr  Low's

suggestion that we keep our markets closed would diminish

us all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must ride this wave of progress and

globalisation,  and  we will come  on  top,  as  we  have

before.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am not saying that we

should  close and we should not welcome foreign  talents.

My question really is:  are there jobs which Singaporeans

are  talented  enough to do that are offered  to  foreign

talents, instead of Singaporeans, especially with  a high

unemployment rate?  Is that fair?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, in direct answer to Mr Low

whether  Singaporeans can do the job, my answer  is  that

Singaporeans can do any job they chose, and they have the

ability.   But we will let the markeplace decide  and  we

will  not erect barriers to distort the market.   Because

example  after  example have shown  that  when  countries

close their doors, whether it is the celestial empire  or

the Ottoman empire, they ended up losers in the long run.

Is it fair

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>

in  the long run?  Indeed, it is, because it creates jobs

for our economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

DPM,  in his Budget Speech, announced that the Government

had  accepted  the  various ERC  recommendations  on  CPF

changes.   Specifically,  they  are:   deferment  of  CPF

restoration for two years;  progressive lowering  of  CPF

ceiling    for   employer   contribution;    lower    CPF

contribution  for  workers  aged  50-55;  and   increased

contribution rates to Medisave and Special Accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are major changes that impact workers. I know

that  much has already been debated on these CPF  changes

in  public,  the media and in Parliament.  But  I  wonder

what  will the Government do to help Singaporeans  adjust

to the impact of these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans understand that the CPF is

fundamentally  for  old age, medical expenses  and  basic

housing,  and that the Government will continue  the  CPF

system  around  these core objectives.   But  with  these

changes,  Singaporeans'  savings  for  old  age  will  be

eroded.   We  must ensure that our workers'  CPF  savings

will  have stable and reasonably good returns.   Allowing

individual CPF members to invest their savings seems  not

a  preferred  choice these days where the  stock  markets

world-wide are underperforming.  There have been on-going

discussions that the Government is considering privately-managed  pension funds as an alternative to CPF  savings.

I would like to ask the Minister whether he could provide

the House greater details and insights.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

long  economic recession all over the world has  resulted

in our unemployment rate remaining very high.  I think we

have   about  100,000  people  who  are   unemployed   in

Singapore.   Now,  with our economic restructuring,  even

the higher educated are affected.  The Minister has given

some  examples  of  how  jobs were  created  in  the  new

economy.   But  for those older workers who  are  50  and

above,  if  they  are  unemployed,  they  are  unemployed

forever. It is very difficult for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>

them   to  get  another  job.   Our  economy  has   grown

significantly   since   our   independence.    We    have

transformed from an old village into a cosmopolitan city.

It  shows  that  we  have moved in the  right  direction.

Otherwise, we would not have progressed.  But  there  are

some  who  are unable to cope with the changes, they  are

entangled in a trap and they cannot help themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old kampong days, when people were

unemployed,  they   could  just  plant  some  tapioca  or

potatoes,  and still survived.  But now if you  do  that,

you  will  get a summons from the authorities.  Nowadays,

if  you  are  unemployed, it would not  be  easy  to  get

another  job.   Some  residents  came  to  see   me.    I

introduced them to a job.  One week later, they came back

and said that they wanted to work but the employers would

not employ them.  This is an employers' market now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the pay is $1,000 and after CPF

deduction,  the take-home pay is only $800.   It  is  not

enough  to  maintain the family.  The Teochew people  say

tan  chiak,  which means to earn and eat.  After  eating,

there  is nothing left.  The only saving you can have  is

in  your CPF, but you cannot get the money until you  are

55.   It  is  like in a desert, you see the water  in  an

oasis;  you want to drink the water but you cannot  reach

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether, in

this  difficult time, special consideration can be  given

to  those who are 50 and above, unemployed for more  than

two  years,  with  no  savings and no financial  support.

They  look seriously  for jobs but could not get  a  job.

Under  such  circumstances, can they  make  some  advance

withdrawal  from  their  CPF  accounts?   If  they   have

$50,000, let them withdraw, say, 5% a year or about  $200

a month, just to tide over this difficult time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, first, please allow me to

quote the CPF Board's mission statement:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We aim to provide our members in a cost effective

manner the widest range of quality services possible.'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the size of our CPF members' reserves as of

December 2001 was over $90 billion.  Our CPF members  are

allowed  to invest their savings in a range of  financial

instruments   including   shares,   bonds,    gold    and

professionally managed products.  Here, I feel  that  the

CPF  Board  may not have discharged its duties adequately

in   providing  its  members  cost  effective  investment

options to enhance their long-term savings.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since most of the average Singaporeans are not

investment  savvy,  many  got their  fingers  burnt  when

investing  their  CPF savings in the markets  themselves.

Why  are  they  not  investing through professional  fund

managers  who will provide them portfolios, reduce  their

investment risks and enhance their returns?  One  of  the

biggest obstacles is the high management fees imposed  by

the fund managers.  On average, you have to pay about  3-5% front-end fees plus an annual fee of between 1-1.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 2001, a total of $44 billion of CPF

members'  monies  were invested.  If  they  all  invested

these  monies through fund managers, a mere 3% fee  would

be $1.3 billion.  This is enough to build, I think, a new

MRT line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whichever way you look at it, this is a huge

amount of money.  But as individual account holders,  our

average  CPF members are like ikan bilis.  They  have  no

bargaining powers.  It is just like when you  go  to  the

bank,  you have to queue up if you are an average  retail

market  customer, and you have to pay all the  fees  that

they ask you to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we want to attract foreign fund managers to be

based  here,  we  must also make it  attractive  for  our

citizens to park their money with them.  In this  regard,

I  feel  that  the  CPF Board must do its  part  for  its

members.   It  is in the best position to  negotiate  the

best deal for its members.  Size in business does matter.

As a big fish, you are more likely to be wined

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>

and  dined than an average guy on the street.   With  the

clout  of  over 40 billion investment dollars potentially

there, the CPF Board should negotiate and even dictate ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is almost up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> --- terms favourable to its

members.  This would be a win-win-win situation  for  all

three  partners.  If the management fee could be lowered,

more   CPF  members  would  be  persuaded  to   let   the

professionals manage their money and enjoy better returns

in  the  long  term.  The fund management industry  would

have  the boost of extra monies for them to manage.   The

CPF  Board, in the end, would have fulfilled its  mission

to  provide  a  cost-effective  quality  service  to  its

members.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, even as we

are dealing with the implications of not providing enough

finances  for  old  age,  we  have  every  motivation  to

increase  the  rate of return on CPF  savings.   Also,  I

disagree  with  Mr Steve Chia's proposal  to  render  CPF

contribution  rates  negotiable for certain  workers.   I

think  there  is some evidence, say, in the  US  for  the

401K,  that  there  will  always  be  a  reason  not   to

contribute  at  all.  We should, therefore,  not  be  too

quick to dispense with the forced savings feature of  the

CPF scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has recently stated that the Board is

studying  ways  of assisting in the establishment  of  an

appropriate  pension plan within the CPF framework.   The

objective  is  to achieve a higher, longer term  rate  of

return through a well-diversified portfolio to be managed

by  one  or more reputable pension plan providers.   Sir,

diversification is the right strategy.  But I would  like

to raise a few questions regarding this initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of the CPF Board. Unlike the

administration  of  mandatory pension schemes  elsewhere,

the  role  of the CPF Board has hitherto been limited  to

the collection and disbursement of members' monies within

a  well-prescribed framework, ie, ensuring that employers

have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>

made  the  required contributions on the  one  hand,  and

making sure that members meet mortgage instalments on the

other.   The  Board does not explicitly  manage  members'

funds.  Yet it guarantees a minimum interest rate of 2.5%

on  Ordinary  Account  and  4%  on  the  Special  Account

balances.   This is, in essence, an offer of a  risk-free

rate  by  an institution, ie, the CPF Board, familiar  to

all CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this deposit-like facility, it is therefore

conceivable  that  we would need a huge  dose  of  public

education  to  convince members to  buy  private  pension

plans.   The  ability of these providers to  quote  lower

management  charges is linked directly to  the  scale  or

size  of the aggregate amounts under management.  So,  it

is  a  bit  of a chicken-and-egg situation that  we  have

here.   Short  of  mandating  that  all  funds  must   be

allocated to providers which incidentally is the scenario

elsewhere  where  there is no CPF  rate  alternative,  it

could  be a real challenge to get enough takers.  I would

like  to ask the Minister how the Board will ensure  that

there is sufficient scale for a meaningful outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the accountability for performance. I

would also like to ask the Minister what are some of  the

reservations  for  the Board itself to  be  the  manager,

instead  of  the facilitator.  As it is,  it  is  already

providing  a risk-free return for balances.  Furthermore,

in  the  event that the take-up rate by members  is  such

that  the scale allows for the selection of only  one  or

two managers, the accountability of the Board will extend

beyond that of a facilitator anyway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh is not present.

Mdm Ho.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, there are two main issues

that  I would like to raise with regard to the CPF funds.

The first issue refers to the use of a portion of the CPF

funds  as an advance loan for a limited period.  We  know

that  in  households where the sole breadwinner has  lost

his  job and where the spouse is sick and unable to work,

and where they have children to support and bills to pay,

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>

financial  burden can be a very heavy one.  I would  like

to  know  whether  the  Minister  would  be  prepared  to

consider the release of a portion of the CPF funds as  an

advance   loan   to  help  tide  over   the   period   of

unemployment,  especially if it is  a  prolonged  period.

Sir,  such amounts are to be treated as temporary  loans,

which  the unemployed will have to return when they  have

found jobs subsequently.  The CPF loan should be used for

living expenses and meeting financial obligations such as

study  loans  for themselves or their children,  and  for

payment  of  the insurance premiums covering medical  and

hospitalisation eventualities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to reviewing the

restoration  of the CPF for those above 50 years  to  the

same  rate as those below 50 when the recession  is  well

behind us.  The main concern behind the policy of a lower

CPF  rate  for those who hit 50s will ensure that  mature

Singaporeans  are able to find jobs in the future.   Most

of  these  concerns  centre around the  observation  that

employers perceive mature workers to be more costly  than

their  younger counterparts and less productive as  well.

Sir,  we have yet to obtain data to show that the  mature

workers do not represent value for money when compared to

their  younger  counterparts.  A lower  CPF  contribution

rate  for  this  group would insignificantly  reduce  the

overall  cost of doing business in Singapore.  Therefore,

it  will  not help to increase the employability  of  the

mature workers.  The point is how many mature workers who

have  lost  their jobs have gotten back into  employment,

because  their  CPF rate has gone down.  The  problem  of

employability  may  have  its cause  elsewhere.   It  is,

therefore, a double whammy blow for this group of people.

Adopting  a measure of reduced CPF contribution  rate  to

increase the employability of mature workers has not been

effective.   It may be more prudent to educate  employers

to change their perception concerning mature workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can appreciate the difficulties that many

among  this group of workers face in ensuring  that  they

have  sufficient funds in their CPF for their  retirement

and do not have to depend on the state for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>

their upkeep.  While it is laudable to try to enhance the

employability  of  this  group of  workers,  it  is  also

important  that we keep other objectives in  mind  before

implementing  the  policy.  This is to  ensure  that  the

mature workforce does not suffer undue hardship in  years

to come.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, starting from 2004, the

contribution  rates  for  the  Special  Account  and  the

Medisave Account will be increased, in line with the  ERC

recommendation  to  refocus our CPF  to  meet  the  basic

financial  needs of Singaporeans.  I support  this  move.

But in implementing the new rates, I urge the Ministry of

Manpower  to be mindful of the needs of Singaporeans  who

are  between  the ages of 50 and 55 years.  This  is  the

group  that will have their CPF capped at 36%.  When  the

CPF  is restored for Singaporeans below 50 years of  age,

they   will   be  affected  the  most,  as   the   higher

contribution   rate  to  these  two  accounts   will   be

transferred from their Ordinary Accounts.  By  2006,  for

instance, their Special Accounts will increase  from  the

current  rate  of  6% to 9%, and their Medisave  accounts

will  increase from the current rate of 8% to  9%.   This

means  that by 2006, Singaporeans between the ages of  50

and  55  years will have a total amount of 4% transferred

from  their  Ordinary  Accounts and  deposited  into  the

Special and Medisave accounts.  Many Singaporeans in this

age  bracket are still paying for their homes and so will

feel  the pinch.  The situation will be particularly hard

for those earning more than $5,000, as the salary ceiling

would also be reduced in 2004.  They will suffer a double

whammy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has recommended that we allow CPF members

aged 50 to 55 to continue using their Special Accounts to

meet  shortfalls  in  mortgage repayments  for  a  longer

transition period.  I urge the Ministry to heed this call

and  exercise flexibility in implementing the new  rates,

so that older Singaporeans will not suffer undue hardship

as a result of the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry to

monitor the situation of the low wage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>

earners.   With  the recent change, those  earning  below

$500 do not have to contribute to the CPF.  While this is

a  good  idea  as  it  gives  them  more  take-home  pay,

nevertheless,  the flip side is that they  may  not  have

enough savings to purchase a house or retire.  So,  I  am

concerned  about this group and I ask MOM to monitor  the

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a final point, I also hope that the Ministry

can throw some light on this issue of the retirement age.

Many  calls  have been made in this House to abolish  the

retirement  age.  This has given the impression  that  we

have  a mandatory retirement age forcing people to retire

at  62  years.  The Retirement Age Act, to my  knowledge,

does no such thing.  On the contrary, what it does is  to

create  a  right for people to work until 62 years,  that

is,  they  cannot be retired before 62,  but,  by  mutual

agreement with the employer, there is nothing to prohibit

them  from  working beyond this age.  Sir, a confirmation

on the part of the Ministry on this point will be useful.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, as I said during the

Budget  Statement  debate, Government  must  correct  the

perception - it may not be a statutory requirement but  a

perception  - that one must retire by age 62  or  65,  as

what  Mdm  Halimah  has said earlier.  Otherwise,  people

like  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Chief Justice Yong

Pung  How  are way overdue for retirement.  But this  has

not  been the case, and will not likely be the case  with

an increasingly knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, one can only retire if one has money

and can afford it.  We read of successful individuals who

decided  to  retire at the age of 40  or  so.   They  can

afford it.  But for many others, life will need to go  on

after  65,  and to continue working helps  to  keep  them

mentally  alert and to keep illness away.  As  such,  the

concept of retirement at age 65 needs to be dropped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Government not to force compulsory

retirement  on  those who can, who want or  who  need  to

work, especially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>

those in the civil service.  This can be done by adopting

a   flexible  wage  structure  and  moving  away  from  a

seniority-based  wage  scheme  to  one   that   is   more

economically  viable.  And if this proposal  is  adopted,

the  concept of CPF savings for retirement can be revised

to  CPF savings for rainy days, where members can draw on

their  savings  on  difficult days, no  longer  just  for

retirement  purposes.  This will allow the Government  to

free up the compulsory CPF contribution for older workers

to  something that is negotiable between the employer and

employee, as I have explained earlier in my speech.   The

objective  is  to  help save jobs for older  workers  and

reduce  the  unemployment rate.   If  the  Government  is

prepared  to  free up car loans totally for  consumption,

then it should not worry unnecessarily about the problems

of  retirement savings or 401K, as highlighted by  Deputy

Speaker,  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  Remaining employed  is  more

important than having enough retirement savings  for  the

moment.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, many of my

colleagues have already spoken on various aspects of  the

CPF  system.   I would like to touch on just one  current

deficiency  of  CPF  as the primary means  of  addressing

financial needs of Singaporeans in their old age, namely,

it  does not cover homemakers whose contributions in  the

home  and  in  attending to their family  needs  are  not

attributed economic value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC on the Aging Population recommended in 1999

that  this be addressed.  But sadly, the ERC, in all  its

studied modifications proposed to the CPF system, did not

follow up on this particular aspect.  Although the female

labour  force participation rate is currently 54%,  there

are over 700,000 women who are homemakers - not holding a

CPF  account, not holding a job that draws a salary  and,

therefore,  either having an inactive  CPF  account  with

minimal  amount  in their balance, or not  having  a  CPF

account at all.  As these women will, in all probability,

outlive their spouses,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>

their  financial situation will be precarious  as  it  is

uncertain  what  their husbands will have  left  them  as

remaining balances in their CPF account, or other savings

or, indeed, if they will have left their CPF balances  to

them at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work women do in attending to the

responsibilities  in  the  home  are  what  enable  their

spouses to be productively and gainfully employed in  the

workforce  and  the upbringing of children  prepares  the

next  generation of citizens.  It is surely then not  too

much  to  ask  that this contribution be acknowledged  by

factoring  into  the system measures that  will  help  to

protect the women's financial situation in their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask that, as we proceed to refine

the  CPF  system, as recommended by the ERC, we consider,

in  addition,  dividing the Special Account  contribution

into  two,  one half being in the name of the non-working

spouse  in a single income household.  Women in Singapore

are  very  fortunate in that the strong  protection  that

family  law  here  provides  them  in  acknowledging  the

contribution of a non-working spouse in the  division  of

matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce.   There  is

no  such  provision in inheritance law and  we  have  sad

stories  of widows left high and dry when their  deceased

husband's  assets, including any CPF savings, are  willed

to other parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our promotion of strong family units

and  both partners in a couple, working together, raising

children  together  and preparing for old  age  together,

could  we therefore consider, in addition, that,  on  the

death  of an account holder, the balances in the  Special

Account   and   the  Medisave  Account   be   transferred

automatically  to the surviving spouse  since  these  two

accounts are particularly meant to cater for one's  basic

needs in old age?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I thank all the Members who

have  spoken  on the CPF system.  Before I  go  into  the

specific  response,  I would just  like  to  remind  hon.

Members  that the CPF system was exhaustively studied  by

the Economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>

Review Committee.  They picked up the stone, they gave it

a  good dusting.  They looked at the top, they looked  at

the side, they looked underneath.  At the end of the day,

the  ERC  concluded that the CPF system serves  us  well.

One  of those stones they decided not to throw away,  but

put  it  back.  Yes, they did not put it back in  exactly

the  same position.  They repositioned the stone a little

bit.   The repositioning was to enable us to better  meet

the  future challenges.  The details of the repositioning

were  covered by DPM Lee, both last year and also, again,

in the Budget Speech.  So I would not go over them again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the basic point I want to make is that the CPF

system  has  served  us  well, and  it  continues  to  be

relevant  to  the needs of Singapore and to Singaporeans,

if  we  refocus it on the key or core objectives  of  the

CPF,  namely, retirement, savings, housing and healthcare

expenses.   I do not think there is any question  in  the

minds  of hon. Members that we should do away with it  or

to  make even more radical surgery.  I think there is, of

course, room for improvement as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that we will continue to

see  how  we can provide better service, make improvement

to  the  system,  make  it even more  responsive  to  CPF

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's question. He

mentioned that the idea of allowing CPF members to invest

money in the share market has not turned out to be a good

idea  because,  as a result of the fall  in  the  various

share  markets, CPF members have lost money.  Yes, it  is

true.  CPF members who have gone into the share market on

their  own  have  lost money as a result  of  the  market

conditions.   Let us remember also that  if  we  had  not

liberalised,  if  we  had  not  enabled  Singaporeans  to

utilise   some  of  their  CPF  savings  for  their   own

investment,   we  will  also  stand  accused   of   being

unreasonably rigid and of unfairly locking up hard earned

savings of the workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we did liberalise and created a CPF

Investment Scheme, we cautioned all CPF members that they

invest   at   their  own  risk.   They   have   to   take

responsibility.  They have to learn how to  invest  their

retirement savings so that they do not get caught.   Over

the years, we have also refined the investment system  to

better adjust for this risk exposure.  We started out,  I

believe,  by  allowing them to use 80% of the  investible

savings  to  make  personal investment.   This  was  then

reduced to 50% and, currently, only 35% of the investible

savings  can be invested personally.  Whereas  the  rest,

they  can  invest  in unit trusts or managed  by  a  fund

manager.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in fact, we are responding, we are adjusting, we

are learning from the experience.  But, at the end of the

day,  when  you  make  investment, everybody  must  know,

including  CPF  members, that there  will  always  be  an

element of risk and you have to do your calculations,  do

your sums and make sure that the risks are acceptable  to

you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong was concerned with the high

management  fees levied by fund managers on  CPF  members

who  place  their  CPF savings in these  fund  management

accounts.   It is correct to say that the fees  are  high

and,  in  a  sense, it does discourage CPF  members  from

going into such fund management accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that these high management fees

apply  both  to cash investors and CPF Investment  Scheme

members  who are investing in unit trusts or  other  fund

management accounts.  I think it is not right for Dr  Ong

to  say that CPF Board has not discharged its duty or  to

provide effective services to CPF members.  The fact that

fund  managers charge a high fee applies to both the  CPF

Investment   Scheme  investors  and  also  cash   account

holders, and it is also related to the small fund size of

the  Singapore  market.   We  are  a  very  small  market

compared   to   the   global  fund   management   market.

Therefore, with a small market, the overheads tend to  be

higher.    So   the  fees  will  be  higher.    That   is

unavoidable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Board will continue to look for ways

to  bring  down the cost of investment for members.   For

instance, in September 2002, last year, the Board allowed

foreign  unit trusts, registered under the CPF Investment

Scheme,  in other words, approved for investment  by  CPF

members, to be offered directly to CPF investors  without

the  need  to go through an additional feeder  structure.

So  we shorten the retailing chain.  We do not have to go

through a further intermediary.  Foreign unit trusts  can

be offered directly, once they meet certain criteria.  So

that  will  help  to  lower the cost for  CPF  Investment

Scheme members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked some questions with regard to

the proposal for a private pension plan which is intended

to  help CPF members get a higher rate of return  over  a

longer term.  This was one of the recommendations of  the

Economic  Review  Committee  -  to  study  an  option  by

introducing low-cost privately-managed pension  plan  for

CPF  members.   The belief is that with  this  privately-managed pension plan, investment cost could be lower  and

it  could  also, over the longer term, achieve  a  higher

rate  of  return  for  CPF members.   The  Board  is  now

studying  how  best  to  operationalise  this   idea   of

privately managed pension plan within the CPF framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our preliminary studies, scale is a

critical factor - I think Mrs Lim mentioned this too - to

ensure  low  cost.   The pension plan  design  should  be

simple  and  low risk.  This will attract  more  members,

including those who are not investment savvy and  who  do

not  want to take unnecessary risks with their retirement

savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other desirable features would be globally well-diversified portfolios and reliability of the pension

plan  operators themselves so that CPF members  can  have

greater  confidence  that they will  be  able  to  return

higher  interest over the longer term.  Members would  be

able  to invest their savings in both their Ordinary  and

Special  Accounts  in approved privately-managed  pension

plans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board recognises that, under the current CPF

Investment Scheme, agent bank's charges add to  the  cost

of  investing  and this will be taken into  account  when

designing the pension plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also asked what will be the Board's role in

this  privately-managed pension plan.  This  is  an  area

that  the  Board is also studying, ie, whether the  Board

should  act  as  an  intermediary, or  be  more  actively

involved.  In this connection, I overlook Dr Ong's  other

point  about the Board negotiating on behalf of  all  its

members  to invest, or to place funds with fund  managers

or  unit trusts.  I had addressed this question before in

this House.  This will put the Board in a moral hazard of

having  to make the investment decision for and on behalf

of  individual CPF members.  If the Board makes the right

decision,  of course, all will be well.  But, as  I  said

earlier,  all investments come with some risks.   And  if

the Board were to make a wrong decision, then I think  it

would  be  held  accountable.   I  do  not  think  it  is

desirable,  in  the way the CPF Board is  structured,  to

impose this responsibility on the Board.  We would prefer

very  much  that,  when it comes to  the  CPF  Investment

Scheme,   the  Board  would  act  as  a  facilitator   or

expeditor, rather than making the decision on  behalf  of

the members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Steve Chia and also Mdm Ho Geok

Choo  would like the CPF Board to consider releasing some

of  the  CPF savings for workers, particularly those  who

are  out  of job for quite some time and are in financial

hardship.  We sympathise with all workers who are out  of

job  and who are facing financial difficulties.  That  is

why  the  Minister  for Finance, in  his  Budget  Speech,

announced  measures  to  help particularly  lower  income

Singaporeans with additional rental rebates, service  and

conservancy  rebates and extension of the Utilities  Save

rebates.   We have also granted the New Singapore  Shares

and  Economic  Restructuring Shares.  All these  measures

will  provide some financial assistance to those who  are

hard   hit   by   the   economic  downturn   and   rising

unemployment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we turn to the CPF savings for early relief,

we may be barking up the wrong tree, I would say.  We may

be  taking a wrong turn because, with the CPF,  it  is  a

zero-sum game.  The more we take out today to spend,  the

less we have for our retirement, the less we have to  pay

for  healthcare needs in our old age.  Even  if  it  were

considered  as a loan that would have to be put  back  in

future, we would have imposed greater difficulty  on  the

worker  to  repay CPF savings that had been  consumed  in

advance.   It  would not help him to accumulate  what  is

needed.   Already  today there is concern  that,  at  our

existing contribution rates, a significant proportion  of

the workers would have difficulty accumulating sufficient

cash savings when they finally retire.  So, if we open up

the  CPF  to  allow  people to use  it  to  meet  current

financial  difficulties, we are  guaranteeing  that  they

would  have much less savings in their old age.  Yes,  we

may  be  alleviating their hardship now, but we  will  be

imposing  massive difficulties for these people  and  for

the Government in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think it is unwise to do so. But, of course,

as  we  have  always  said, if we  go  into  a  prolonged

recession,  eg,  a depression where we have  hundreds  of

thousands of Singaporeans who are completely out of  work

and  there is no light at the end of the tunnel, then  we

will  have to consider.  It is the last option.   But  we

are  not in such a parlous state yet.  So, we should  not

rush into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also referred to a point which I

think Ms Irene Ng touched on earlier, ie, cutting of  the

CPF  for  those who are aged 50-55 by freezing employers'

CPF  contribution  at  16%.  She asked,  if  the  economy

should  turn around, whether we would restore  it.   This

was  the  recommendation from the ERC  study,  to  reduce

employers' CPF contribution rate for older workers, as  a

way  to  moderate  and overcome rigidities  in  our  wage

structure, which presently is based on seniority, ie, the

older the worker is, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>

more he gets paid, regardless of whether his productivity

has  improved  year  by year.  And it  is  a  measure  to

enhance the employability of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho asked whether it has created the result or

not, and how many older workers have been re-employed  as

a  result of this measure.  I would say that we have just

introduced it and it is too soon to give numbers  on  the

impact.  But what we know for a fact is that, through our

labour  market  survey - in fact, the  report  of  labour

market  survey for 2002 was released last Friday  -  last

year,  72%  of those aged below 30 managed to secure  re-employment within six months after retrenchment, compared

to  47%  for those aged 50 and over.  So, obviously,  re-employment  rate for the younger workers  is  far  better

than  that for those who are older.  We believe that part

of  the  reason is the seniority-based wage scale,  which

works   against  the  interests  of  the  older  workers.

Therefore, we have made this adjustment to the employers'

CPF  contribution  for  the older  workers.   It  is  not

related  just to the state of the economy and  I  do  not

think  that we should look at it as a temporary  measure.

The  idea  here  is  to  reduce the  mandatory  statutory

contribution of CPF for this older group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that does not mean that older workers are, in

the words of Mdm Ho, not value for money.  I do not think

that  she  is  suggesting that.  She is just  questioning

whether  this refinement implies that older  workers  are

not  value  for money.  Certainly not.  We want  to  help

them  to  get  jobs and stay in jobs.  It does  not  mean

that,  because  we  have reduced their CPF,  they  cannot

deliver or perform.  In fact, I would encourage employers

to  reward  the older workers who do well or  make  great

contributions to the companies through the variable  wage

system.  There are many ways we can reward a good worker,

both young and old.  We can give them additional bonuses,

we  can  give them a higher performance bonus,  and  that

would  more  than make up for the loss in  the  statutory

contribution.    As   far  as  the  mandatory   statutory

contribution  is  concerned, what we  need  today  is  to

reduce this cost item.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob was concerned with the impact of

the  changes on the increasing contribution rates to  the

Special  Account  and  to Medisave  introduced  recently,

especially  for  those in the 50-55 age  group.   Let  me

explain  that we are also concerned and we are  aware  of

the  possibility  that this transfer  from  the  Ordinary

Account  to  the  Special Account and to  Medisave  would

impact adversely on those workers, particularly the older

workers  who  are  still  servicing  mortgages  and  with

outstanding  loans to repay.  That is why we  are  making

this  adjustment  gradually  over  several  years.    CPF

members  who purchase their properties before 1st January

2004, when these measures take effect, will be allowed to

continue to have access to their Special Account to  help

top  up  the shortfall in their mortgage payments to  the

extent  these payments are affected by the transfer.   In

other  words, if they have a shortfall, we will  open  up

access  to the Special Account.  But, remember,  for  the

vast majority of others, this refinement will immediately

mean  that they are putting aside more money for Medisave

and  their  Special  Account, which  is  their  long-term

retirement  savings.  So, it has its advantage,  although

we are also able to accommodate the concerns of those who

have to service their mortgage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob also made this point about

retirement  which  Mr Steve Chia touched  on  also.   Mdm

Halimah  Yacob is absolutely correct.  There is  a  gross

misunderstanding  over  the  Retirement  Age  Act.    The

Retirement  Age  Act does not compel workers  to  retire.

The  Retirement Age Act provides workers with  additional

protection  by  imposing on the employer a responsibility

and  a  duty  to  employ  the person  until  the  minimal

retirement  age.   We  must  remember  that  without  the

Retirement  Age Act - I think it was before 1994  or  so,

when  we did not have such a legislation - employers were

retiring  their workers at the age of 55.  But  with  the

Retirement Age Act in operation, the retirement age first

went  up  from  55  to 60, and then to 62.   So,  workers

gained  another seven years of work as a  result  of  the

operation of the Retirement Age Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>

The  Act does not say anywhere that a worker cannot  work

beyond the age of 62.  So, I think Mr Steve Chia is quite

mistaken.  We have never said that you cannot work beyond

the  age  of 62.  We welcome everybody to work.   In  the

civil  service, even those who are 62, if they are  doing

well,  can  contribute, are in good health  and  able  to

discharge  their duties, I would expect that  they  would

continue  to be re-employed even though they  can  retire

and may already be retired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the connection between freeing

up  car  loans and freeing up CPF for negotiation between

older workers and their employers.  As far as the CPF  is

concerned,   while   we  should  reduce   the   statutory

contribution to provide a minimal level of protection,  I

do  not think freeing up the CPF for open negotiation  is

the  way  to go.  What we have done, though, is  that  we

have   gradually,  over  the  years,  reduced   the   CPF

contribution for the older workers, to reduce the  burden

on  employers and to make older workers more  employable.

That is why when we introduced the Retirement Age Act  to

raise  the  retirement age from 55 to 60, we lowered  the

CPF  contribution for those aged 55 and above,  and  they

still  continue to contribute much lower CPF than others.

Of  course,  more  recently, we are now saying  that  for

those aged 50 to 55, the employers' CPF contribution rate

will  remain  at  16%.  I think that is the  way  to  go,

rather than to open up a free-for-all in this sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee is worried about the homemakers who

have  been  left  out.  I am afraid that  while  we  want

everybody   to  participate  in  the  CPF   system,   the

homemakers do have a difficulty, although we do  open  up

the CPF system for voluntary contributions.  So, there is

really  nothing to stop homemakers to have an account  to

contribute  to CPF to build up a nest-egg for themselves.

It  is with this in mind that we have allowed the topping

up  of  the Minimum Sum scheme under the CPF Minimum  Sum

Top-up  Scheme to encourage CPF members to top  up  their

spouse's  or  parents' CPF account through  transfers  of

their  CPF savings into the latter's retirement  account,

if they have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>

more  than  twice the current Minimum Sum  in  their  own

account.   Members can also opt to use cash  top-ups  for

their family members' CPF accounts, and the amount of the

top-up  in  the  CPF account will then  be  paid  to  the

recipient  by  monthly instalments from age  62  onwards.

The  recipient can also choose to buy a life annuity with

the  Minimum  Sum  which has been  topped  up  by  family

members.  Spouses and children who contribute to the  CPF

accounts of homemakers would be allowed tax relief on the

cash amount that they contribute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, whenever the Government is able to

provide  for CPF top-ups or New Singapore Shares and  the

Economic  Restructuring Shares,  for  instance,  we  have

always  required  co-payment and the  opening  of  a  CPF

account.   So, homemakers who do not have a CPF  account,

we would expect that their spouses would immediately open

up  an  account and put in the co-payment,  so  that  the

Government  can credit the contribution to this  account.

Over  the  years,  we  hope that they  will  continue  to

voluntarily  make  such contributions and,  in  the  good

years when the Government has surpluses, we will top  up,

and this will help them to build up a small nest-egg.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we should legislate to ensure that, upon the

demise of the CPF member, a certain amount should  go  to

the spouse, this was an issue that was studied some years

ago,  and debated in this House.  The conclusion was that

we  should not interfere with the nomination system  and,

in  fact,  by  and  large, most CPF  members  already  do

nominate  their spouses and children as beneficiaries  of

their CPF savings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the case about

$41,000  and  the  car  loan  is  about  empowering   the

individual to be responsible for their decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on now to the role of NTUC. I speak

with  concern regarding the role of NTUC.  It is a highly

respected national institution, and receives funding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>

from  taxpayers  for its work, through  the  Ministry  of

Manpower.   Yet,  it  engages in politics,  and  publicly

declares  its symbiotic relationship, not as a  principle

with  the  Government of the day, but with the  governing

political  party,  the PAP.  This symbiotic  relationship

implies that, if the ruling PAP party were to lose  in  a

general  election,  the NTUC will set  itself  up  to  go

against  the  government of the day, and go  against  the

express  wishes of the citizens in a democratic election.

This is terrible.  This is political subversion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of NTUC is to care for union workers, elect

good people who can represent them to negotiate with  the

employers   and  not  to  play  politics.   By   removing

democratically elected leaders who are not with the  PAP,

it  is  playing politics.  It is shameless  of  NTUC  for

being  unprofessional in carrying out its charter.  Until

it    repents   and   retracts   its   stated   symbiotic

relationship,  it  should  not continue  to  receive  any

financial  aid from the Ministry of Manpower.  Also,  our

motion  on the role of GLCs last year, when it was agreed

that  the Government and GLCs should not set up companies

that can be found in the Yellow Pages, should be extended

to  all  NTUC  cooperatives.  We have  NTUC  cooperatives

running  coffeeshops, casket agents,  contractors,  print

media,  sound  systems, entertainment business,  property

development, etc, other than the more commonly known  and

accepted NTUC Fairprice, Comfort taxi and bus services.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the last three mentioned, the Government

should  rein  in these business cooperatives before  they

start  killing our smaller local businesses and  increase

the unemployment figure.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, first, I would like to

comment on what Mr Steve Chia had said.  I must say  that

I  am  quite  disappointed in the  use  of  his  language

because  I  think  they are extremely  unparliamentary  - words like "political subversion", "shameless" and so on.

I think those are highly ---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, that is for me to

decide.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir. I want to address the

point  that  Mr  Steve Chia said that  we  are  receiving

funding.   The  funding that we receive is very  nominal,

but  the  purpose of that funding is actually to  address

the  imbalance  between  the  employers  and  the  labour

movement,  in terms of ensuring that the labour  movement

can  continue to employ professionals and credible people

to serve the members and to serve the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the issue of the symbiotic

relationship, I think that is an open relationship.  That

is  an  open secret, everybody knows about it.   And  the

reason why we have a symbiotic relationship is also known

to  everyone  and,  that is, we share  common  objectives

between  the PAP and the NTUC. That objective is to  take

care  of the welfare of the people and workers.   Sir,  I

think  the workers are not stupid.  Every worker  in  the

labour movement, right down to the shop floor level, gets

to  elect his leaders once every three years.  And if  he

does   not   agree,  he  does  not  think  the  symbiotic

relationship between NTUC and the PAP works, he will vote

out  the  people  who  support this policy  on  symbiotic

relationship.   I  would like to  say  clearly  that  the

symbiotic   relationship  is  a  purely   objective   and

practical  one which benefits the workers, and  there  is

nothing sinister in that relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, I thought you are

talking on flexible wages.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir, I am coming to that

point.   Just  one more point and that is on  the  NTUC's

involvement  in  cooperatives.   I want  to  stress  once

again that the NTUC Cooperatives gave out $52 million  in

the  year 2001/2002 to help workers who were affected  by

the   downturn  and,  therefore,  we  are  in  all  these

cooperatives   and  business  ventures   for   a   social

objective,  and that is very clear.  Even without  NTUC's

involvement,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>

the GLCs and the SMEs will be under severe competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now get to the issue of flexible wages.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At last!

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> The ERC has strongly endorsed

the  importance  of keeping our wages  flexible.  Sir,  I

strongly  support  this call as flexibility  is  the  way

ahead in ensuring greater job stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help jumpstart the setting up of the monthly

variable  component, ERC has recommended that  companies,

in  consultation with their unions, transfer a portion of

the  basic  wage  into  the MVC. This  recommendation  is

timely.   Up  to  2001,  only  4.8%  of  companies   have

implemented  MVC, although in the unionised  sector,  the

figure  is close to 34%.  Since the announcement  of  the

ERC's recommendations, I am glad to note that the banking

sector and the Singapore Press Holdings have set aside  a

portion of their basic wage to build up the MVC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call upon companies to do their part in

implementing the MVC.  Instead of cutting jobs,  this  is

certainly a better way to weather the uncertain  economic

times.  With the MVC, we have another means to  make  our

wage  system  more flexible to deal with future  business

downturns.  We have seen some promising moves  after  the

ERC's recommendation, but more can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies should not give examples, such as adopting

a  wait-and-see attitude or that it is too complicated to

implement.  I suspect quite a number ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is almost up, Mdm Halimah.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir, let me just wind up on

this  point.   Most  companies  are  not  making  serious

efforts  to implement it in the hope that when  there  is

another downturn and they need help, they can get another

CPF  cut.  I  am afraid that this will not be simple  the

next time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>

round  as  workers will be reluctant to have another  CPF

cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sorry, your time is up, Mdm Halimah.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Let me just ask a question. My

question is: what more can be done?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, let

me continue where Mdm Halimah has left off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we tackle the current unemployment problem,

we must not lose sight of the long-term strategic move to

deal  with the fundamental issue of wage structure.    It

has  been argued on many occasions, including Mdm Halimah

just  now, that the need to revamp the present seniority-based  salary  system  is  fundamental  to  our  economic

restructuring   efforts.   I  shall  not   repeat   these

arguments.   I  would just like to ask  the  Minister  to

elaborate on the Ministry's plan to push ahead with  this

revamp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly variable component, for example, was

first mooted some two years ago and progress to date,  as

I understand it, has been painfully slow.  My own company

has  introduced the MVC, with some modifications, and the

scheme  has  worked well. Today, about 5%  of  our  basic

salary is in the form of MVC.  We hope to achieve 10%  in

another year or two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we do not forge ahead with wage reform

quickly,  I  am  afraid  that  it  will  become  a  major

bottleneck   in   our  economic  restructuring   efforts.

Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to  consider

launching   a  major  campaign  this  year  to   persuade

employers and employees to do away with the fixed  annual

increments  and replace them with the reward system  that

is  linked  to  productivity  and  performance.  We  must

convince the employers that this is good for them, as  it

provides   greater   flexibility   and   enhances   their

competitiveness. We must convince the employees that this

is also good for them as it improves their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>

employability and helps them to save jobs in bad times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the residents who came to me for help to

find  jobs  are willing to take as much as a 50%  cut  in

their  salary.  It would be unrealistic to hope for fixed

increments year after year.  The Ministry should draw  up

a  clear schedule with specific milestones and targets so

that we can monitor our progress and achievements in this

respect.  Other  than  providing  assistance,  will   the

Ministry consider offering some carrots or incentives  to

employers  and  employees to help them to overcome  their

inertia?   For  example, if we want to promote  the  MVC,

could  we consider exempting certain portions of the  MVC

from  tax  or CPF contribution for a limited  period  of,

say, 2-3 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is imperative that we do not waste valuable

time  in  reforming  our wage system.   A  flexible  wage

system  tied  to  productivity rather than  seniority  is

integral  to our economic restructuring programme.  Given

the  weak job market, Sir, this is perhaps the best  time

for us to persuade people to accept it.  We must not miss

this opportunity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, while all workers face

retrenchment  and  unemployment in an economic  downturn,

the   older   workers  bear  the  heaviest  brunt.    The

statistics clearly show that the older workers are likely

to be retrenched during an economic downturn. At the same

time,  employers  are  also less willing  to  hire  older

workers.  Why is it so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key reason besides the seniority-based wage

system is higher medical cost.  Employers are not willing

to  incur higher medical costs associated with the  older

workers,   particularly  those  who  may  have  developed

medical  conditions  as  they change  jobs.  The  way  to

address  this  problem  is the portable  medical  benefit

system (PMBS).  Under the PMBS, a worker can get portable

and  continuous seamless medical coverage during his work

life  and  even  extend into his retirement.   Under  the

scheme,  the  worker does not lose out  when  he  changes

jobs, even if he develops a medical condition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>

At  the same time, it will also not unnecessarily add  on

to the cost to the employers as he gets older.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for PMBS to firmly take root, I see a

compulsory basic national insurance scheme as  the  clear

way to go. The national scheme can be a multi-tiered one.

It  provides a compulsory basic level of coverage for all

workers  at the national level with affordable  premiums.

Then,  it can allow optional enhancement coverage  to  be

added on later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many companies

in  the  private sector have implemented PMBS.   I  would

also  ask  the  Ministry to step up its  drive  for  more

widespread implementation of PMBS in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> The Economic Review Committee has

given  its support to the portable medical benefit scheme

and I thoroughly welcome that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It advocated that for a start, at least, that it be

left to negotiations between companies and the unions and

there are also further studies to be done with respect to

the  portable  medical benefit scheme which  was  earlier

proposed,  as  well  as a transferable medical  insurance

option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst all these further studies are going on, I

would  like to share my views as to how I would  like  to

see  a  portable medical benefit system taking shape  for

Singapore  and Singaporeans.  I would like  it  to  be  a

national system covering all workers because that is  the

best  way to ensure that, as a worker moves between jobs,

there is true portability from employer to employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like it to be compulsory because that would

ensure  that we have the biggest possible base, and  that

would  keep  the  premiums payable  to  the  minimum  for

everybody.   I would like it to be basic, so  as  not  to

push   the   premiums  up  because  of  these  additional

features.   I would also like to see that the premium  of

the insurance under such a scheme be pre-funded so as  to

equalise the premium across the system, and in this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>

way, remove one more hurdle from the employers having  to

look at older workers as being more expensive to them  in

terms of medical cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say all these because I am really keen to see

the  portable medical benefit system implemented as  soon

as possible in Singapore, because of the increasing churn

in  our  labour  market. Every day of delay  exposes  our

older workers to greater risk.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I strongly support the

ERC's  recommendation on portable medical  benefits.   It

has  also  agreed  to raise the tax exemption  limit  for

additional  Medisave  contributions  for  private  sector

employees  from  1%  of an employee's monthly  salary  at

present  to  a lump sum of $1,500 per employee.   What  I

meant   is   that   Government   has   agreed   to   this

recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request that the Ministry of

Manpower  consider two refinements in order to  encourage

more  workers  to  opt into the scheme. Firstly,  Sir,  I

would  like  to suggest that the Ministry of Manpower  or

the  Government consider providing incentives  for  older

workers  to entice them into the PMBS.  This is important

as  older workers would otherwise not find the scheme too

attractive, as the PMBS is essentially a savings  scheme.

For older workers, because they have less number of years

to  work before retirement, they may find the scheme less

attractive as they would not be able to chalk  up  enough

savings  and  might  as well continue with  the  existing

scheme.   Having any support from the Government in  this

regard would therefore be very helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, I would also like to ask the

Government   to   consider  pegging  the  additional   1%

contribution to be put into the Medisave account  to  the

median wage.  This would ensure that lower income workers

have  a minimum floor.  Otherwise, the contribution  that

they  receive will not be meaningful enough to  encourage

them to adopt the portable medical benefits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a worker earning $1,000, for instance, will get

$10  a  month, whereas a worker earning $5,000  will  get

$50.  These are basic salary floors.  Low income  workers

will have greater incentive to opt into the scheme as the

amount  will  be  sufficient  for  them  to  purchase  an

insurance  policy to cover their medical  needs.  In  the

absence  of such a floor, Sir, many may prefer to  remain

on  the  existing medical benefits scheme and this  would

affect our effectiveness in adopting the PMBS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not present. Ms

Irene Ng is also not present.  Mr Arthur Fong?

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, it has already

been pointed out that our current unemployment rate is at

4.8%  and  is  likely  to get worse in  view  of  several

uncertainties, such as a war that may begin in  hours  or

in  days, and its impact on the global economies.  In the

event  that war breaks out, the price of crude  oil  will

skyrocket,  causing whatever economic  recovery  that  we

hope to see towards the end of this year, retard.  It  is

bad  enough  that we are experiencing high  unemployment,

but we also have to contend with structural unemployment.

When we view structural unemployment against the backdrop

of the profile of some 660,000 of our workforce having  a

Secondary  Two  and lower education, and  getting  older,

Sir, we have a serious problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted we have taken steps to help our unemployed

and  needy  through  these hard  times  with  a  slew  of

programmes,  like  the  New  Singapore  Shares,  ERS  and

assistance  programmes  availed  through  the  CDCs,  the

problems we are facing over the last two years or so have

never been experienced before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need an alternative that addresses both

these  problems, ie, create work opportunities such  that

more  people can be gainfully employed and, at  the  same

time, provide family-friendly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>

options  for the existing workers.  Sir, as the  Minister

for  Manpower has said, the Ministry cannot be the  magic

bullet  to  solve unemployment.  It takes  two  hands  to

clap.   Sir,  I  propose that we encourage  employers  to

explore  job  sharing  in  the workplace.   This  is  not

something new.  It has been successfully deployed in many

developed countries with problems similar to what we  are

facing now, with excellent results.  For example, the  US

Federal Government actively promotes job sharing  in  the

different agencies.  It had recognised the need  to  come

up  with a solution that took full advantage of personnel

flexibility and resources available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that we implement a one-year trial.

During  this  trial,  we  can  test  how  effective  this

alternative  is  in  providing continued  employment  for

those  who will otherwise be retrenched.  This will allow

some  of  these workers to spend some time at  home  with

their  children,  whilst still fulfilling  the  goals  of

their  station.  Indeed, teams comprising  two  or  three

workers  can  undertake a single job.  Firstly,  it  will

provide  employment to a team of workers  who  would  now

fulfil  the  functions of the job.   Secondly,  companies

would  be  able  to retrain workers they would  otherwise

lose,  as  job  sharing will allow flexibility  for  both

employees  and employers, or union-sponsored training  to

upskilling or retrain outside of the work time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the results of job sharing in countries like

the  United States and UK show that this flexibility  has

addressed  the growing problems of unemployment  and,  at

the  same time, created family-friendly workplaces.   Our

workers  should be given this option so that we can  keep

them  gainfully  employed,  albeit  at  wages  which  are

commensurate with the number of hours they work.  At  the

same  time, a family-friendly schedule would provide more

flexible working arrangements for those workers who  want

to  start  a family or have young children to  care  for.

This  may  even reduce dependency on domestic  maids  for

some  families,  as well as possible savings  from  child

minding  services.   Job sharing can  present  a  win-win

situation for everyone concerned.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Thank you, Sir, for exercising a

sharp knife, otherwise we will all be delayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take up the point raised by Mr Steve

Chia.  I notice that he has just stepped in.  It is  very

good  for him to be here to hear the response.  In  fact,

he  has  already got the response to his  question.   Mdm

Halimah  has  adequately  rebutted  his  unjustified  and

totally  unfair  allegations against NTUC.   That  is  an

example  of  NTUC  and the PAP Government  working  in  a

symbiotic  relationship.  The reason  why  we  should  be

supporting the NTUC is quite obvious, and Mdm Halimah has

made  it  clear that the funding that NTUC receives  from

the  Government is a small part of its total budget.   It

signifies Government's desire and concern in supporting a

strong  and  vibrant labour movement so  that  the  NTUC,

through  its  affiliate unions, will be  able  to  better

serve our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also questioned the benefits of having NTUC

cooperatives.  Mdm Halimah has also addressed that point.

I  just want to add that, in fact, NTUC cooperatives  are

doing  very  good work, serving members of the  NTUC  and

workers  in  general.   The  fact  that  they  have  NTUC

FoodFair is a measure to help moderate the price of  food

for many of our workers.  They set benchmarks.  If you do

not  have such a cooperative in the market place  setting

benchmark  prices,  you could have  runaway  prices,  and

workers  will suffer.  So what does he prefer?   I  think

having  the  NTUC  cooperative in the business  helps  to

moderate  price increases in many sectors,  and  they  do

serve a useful purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Mr Gan Kim Yong both spoke about the

importance  of the monthly variable component.   I  agree

with  them  completely.  This is a very  important  step.

The ERC has recommended that we push harder on this.   We

will  promote the monthly variable component to companies

and  we  will  move  away from the  seniority-based  wage

structure,  which is too rigid.  We should be adopting  a

more  flexible  wage system, where the  monthly  variable

component  could  form 10% or even  more  of  a  person's

monthly pay.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>

This  will  allow companies to make adjustments,  as  and

when  business environment changes and, in  the  process,

help  the companies survive and hopefully reduce the need

for retrenchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly variable component was first suggested

in 1999.  Yes, we have not made very dramatic progress in

the interim.  Overall, progress has been slow, except for

the  unionised companies, where in 2002, about 39% of the

unionised companies have already implemented the  monthly

variable component.  This is an increase from 29% in 2000

and  34%  in 2001.  However, in the non-unionised sector,

the  implementation has been rather slow, only about 3.9%

of  the  non-unionised companies are  using  the  monthly

variable component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speed up the implementation of the monthly

variable   component,  ERC  has  recommended   that   for

companies that have yet to implement the monthly variable

component,  or  where the monthly variable  component  is

presently less than 2% of the worker's basic wage, up  to

2%  of the basic wage can be set aside gradually to build

up  the monthly variable component of about 10%.  This is

a   very  significant  recommendation,  because,  if  you

remember,  in  1999  when the idea  of  monthly  variable

component  was first mooted, the assumption was  that  we

would  use  future wage increases to build up  a  monthly

variable component.  But since then we have gone  into  a

roller-coaster  ride in the economy,  up  and  down,  and

there  has  been very little wage increase.   So  it  was

difficult to build up a monthly variable component.   But

now  that  we  have decided, in the course of  the  ERC's

discussion, and we have also got the support of the union

movement to use the existing basic wage to help to  build

up  a monthly variable component, I am confident that  we

will be able to move faster on this implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong asked whether there are clear

schedules  to  achieve a widespread  application  of  the

monthly variable component.  As I said, with this change,

we  hope  to  move a lot faster than what we did  before.

But, nevertheless, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>

difficult to now state a deadline when we would  want  to

convert   all   the   companies  onto  monthly   variable

component.  He also asked whether we could exempt certain

portions  of the monthly variable component from  tax  or

CPF  contributions.  It would be unwise to introduce more

distortions   in   this  sense.   The  monthly   variable

component should still remain as part of the wages of the

worker, and that we should not treat it differently.  All

it  means  is that it is a portion that could be adjusted

in  times of need - easier to adjust - than to resort  to

CPF reduction or other tax cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng Chee How

spoke about the portable medical benefit system.  Mr  Yeo

asked  how  many  companies have so far  implemented  the

portable  medical benefit system.  From what I  have  got

here,  as  of  now, about 100 companies  in  the  private

sector  had  already  implemented  the  portable  medical

benefit system.  Of course, Members will remember that in

the  case  of  the public sector, the civil  service  has

already implemented this portable medical benefit  system

since  1994 because many civil servants, especially those

who were recruited post-1994 were placed on what is known

as the Medisave-cum-Outpatient Scheme, and that is a form

of portable medical benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of this portable medical benefit system is

that,  in  lieu of an employer-provided medical  benefit,

the  employer  will make additional contribution  to  the

employee's Medisave every month, which will allow him  to

purchase medical insurance to cover his in-patient needs.

The  ERC also recommended an alternative which is  called

transferable medical insurance scheme, whereby  employers

will sponsor group insurance for the employees.  But this

group   insurance  will  have  a  special   feature,   an

enhancement whereby even if the employee is retrenched or

laid off, the coverage will continue for at least another

year,  as  long  as the employee is able to  continue  to

service  the  premium  on  his  own.   As  far   as   the

transferable medical insurance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>

scheme  is  concerned, the insurance industry is  working

with  my  Ministry  and other agencies  to  develop  this

product to meet the needs of the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the portable medical benefit

system and the transferable medical insurance scheme,  as

Mdm  Halimah  has  pointed out, will be  voluntary.   The

Government  has  decided to encourage employers  to  take

this  route, instead of remaining with the present system

of  employer-provided medical benefit.  The way  we  have

done  it  is  to adjust or to refine the tax system  with

regard  to  employers' medical expenses.  From 1st  April

2004,  employers who implement either of the two portable

medical benefit systems will continue to enjoy a  2%  tax

deduction  on  their  expenses, in other  words,  on  the

contribution to Medisave or on their contribution to  the

transferable  medical  insurance scheme,  and  any  other

allowable  outpatient expenses.  However,  employers  who

choose to remain status quo, in other words, do not  join

any  of these schemes, do not adopt any of these schemes,

and  just  continue  to offer to their employees  medical

benefits,  they would only be allowed to make a deduction

of  1%  for their expenses.  We hope that, with this  tax

change, more employers will shift to the portable medical

benefit scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked whether we should have a

floor   with   regard  to  the  additional  1%   Medisave

contribution.  I agree with her.  It is a concern because

if  you say 1% and you earn $600, then it is only $6.  It

is  very  low.  So what should we do?  We should  provide

for a minimum amount that allows them to buy a reasonable

insurance  coverage.   These are  details  that  will  be

worked  out.   But you will note that in making  the  tax

refinements,  the  Minister for  Finance  has  generously

agreed  not  to fix it at 1%, but at a cap  of  $1,500  a

year.   With the $1,500 tax deductible cap, the employers

will  find  it  much easier to adopt  a  floor  wage  for

contribution to Medisave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Heng Chee How mentioned the

need for a basic medical insurance scheme that will cover

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>

all  workers.   We already do have such a  basic  medical

insurance  scheme operated under MediShield  by  the  CPF

Board  on  behalf of the Ministry of Health.  Already,  I

understand  about  90% of our workers are  covered  under

MediShield.   So,  once  we  move  towards  the  portable

medical benefit system, there is an opportunity for us to

enhance  the  MediShield coverage.  Of  course,  premiums

will  have  to  be adjusted accordingly.   But  with  the

additional Medisave contribution made by the employers, I

believe,  most  employees would be able  to  afford  this

enhanced MediShield scheme.  If we have 90% or so of  our

employees  covered by it, that would meet the requirement

of   having  a  broad-based  nation-wide  basic   medical

insurance to cover all our employees.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong suggested job sharing as an option to

deal  with  this present economic downturn  and  hardship

imposed by the lack of employment opportunities.  I agree

with  him.  Job sharing is one way.  Some companies  have

implemented such ideas of job sharing and part-time work.

It  is  not  new.   We have actually actively  encouraged

companies  to do so.  We have a group in the Ministry  of

Manpower which advises companies that have indicated that

they  may  have to downsize by retrenchment, to  look  at

alternatives.  One alternative is to put workers on part-time  employment  instead  of outright  retrenchment.   I

understand  that  some hospitals have already  introduced

job-sharing.   In fact, NTUC Fairprice is  another  major

employer who offers part-time or job sharing options  for

people who want to work in the supermarket retail sector.

So,  this practice is already in existence.  If need  be,

we  will, of course, publicise  it more widely,  so  that

more  employers are aware of the opportunities  available

to  have  workers  who can come in on a part-time  basis,

maybe help them to meet their demand for workers and yet,

at the same time, keep costs manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed the points raised by

the Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, a point of

clarification.  Can the Minister clarify

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>

whether  nominal funding is no funding at all or still  a

small bit of funding?  By his words, are GLCs not doing a

good  job too?  So, that is why the Yellow Pages rule  is

imposed  on  the  GLCs and not on the NTUC  cooperatives,

because the NTUC cooperatives are doing a good job.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the numbers

with  me  as to how much exactly we provide to NTUC  each

year  by  way  of funding, but the number  is  not  large

compared  to  NTUC's  annual  budget.   But  it   is   an

important,   and  not  insignificant,  gesture   of   the

Government's  support  to  our  workers'  movement.   Our

labour movement plays a very important part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, let me give Mr Chia an

example.  In  our negotiations for Free Trade  Agreements

with  many countries, the issue of labour standards comes

up  all the time.  In order to secure agreement, we  have

to  show  to  our  counter party that we  have  excellent

labour standards.  And what better way to show them  than

to  have  our  NTUC, the leaders of our labour  movement,

stand  up and speak to explain to our counter party that,

yes,  in  fact,  in Singapore, high labour standards  are

maintained,   and  this  Government  is   serious   about

upholding the rights and interests of workers.  For  that

little  investment of financial assistance  to  NTUC,  we

have  developed  a  group  that  is  very  capable,  very

articulate and able to explain the situation to important

parties  whom  we  are negotiating Free Trade  Agreements

with.   What is wrong with it?  I think it is the essence

of  the  symbiotic relationship.  We help each other  and

they   support  our  efforts  to  bring  in   even   more

investments,   so  that  our  workers  will   have   more

employment opportunities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Manpower has

plans to monitor and help the construction industry as  a

major  employer of foreign workers in Singapore to reduce

reliance  on  foreign workers.  I hope that the  Ministry

can   do  more  in  this  direction,  not  just  in   the

construction  industry  but also other  industries  where

there is high foreign worker dependency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share one experience I had in Australia. I

was  driving along a narrow two-lane two-way traffic road

where  one  of the lanes was closed for road  works.   To

control  the two-way traffic, I saw a worker  putting  up

two   mobile  traffic  lights.   He  could  control   the

direction  single-handedly.  But here  in  Singapore,  we

have  two workers on each side holding a stop-and-go sign

at each end.  There is  a third worker coordinating.  So,

altogether, there are three workers doing the job.   This

is  a  very  simple example of how simple technology  can

actually improve productivity and how it shows that  more

can  be  done  to  reduce the dependence  on  low-skilled

foreign workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the well-being of foreign

workers.  This House has debated previously the plight of

foreign  workers in Singapore.  I have asked the Minister

questions  on  housing for foreign  workers  and  actions

taken  against  errant employers who do not  pay  foreign

workers.   The  Minister has assured the House  that  the

Ministry will monitor the situation closely and  it  will

take errant employers to task.  I would like the Minister

to give us an update.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to ask the Minister about the problem of

maid  abuse today.  Although maid abuses get very  widely

reported in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

the media, often getting front-page news, I know that the

vast  majority of Singaporeans, however, are  responsible

ones and who do not ill treat their domestic maids.   Can

the   Minister  provide  statistics  on  the  number   of

employers involved in maid abuse cases against the  total

number of domestic maids in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, again, I must stress that each

case of maid abuse is one case too many.  I would like to

ask  the Minister on the outcome of such initiative,  and

what  is  the  Ministry's plan to do more to address  the

problem of maid abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister two additional

related questions on employment pass holders.  First, how

many  employment  pass  holders  were  affected  by   the

economic  downturn?  Second, what is the  impact  on  the

change  of  the minimum salary from $2,000 to $2,500  for

employment  pass  holders?  Does it  help  to  level  the

playing  field for our young graduates vis-a-vis  foreign

talents?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, over the last few days, we

have heard a number of comments that are very critical of

Singapore workers.  In fact, I think the tendency is  for

us to be too critical of Singapore workers.  I fear, Sir,

that  if  we continue to criticise Singaporeans  all  the

time,  this  will be counter productive.  In  this  House

alone,  over  the last few days of debate, I  have  heard

about  the need for mindset change among Singaporeans  so

many  times that I think if we were to patent  the  words

"mindset change", we will probably make  a lot of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate about Singaporean workers is similar to

what  we  had some years ago about Singaporeans  who  job

hop.   That debate went on for some time until it  became

clear  that it was not doing Singapore any good, and  may

even  affect  investors' perceptions about  our  workers.

Sir,  if,  indeed,  our  workers  have  such  a  terrible

mindset,  they  will  not be ranked  as  the  number  one

workforce  by  BERI.  Surely, that counts for  something.

So  I  do ask that when we talk about mindset change,  we

spare a thought for the effect this will have on investor

confidence.  I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

saying  this  because I came across  a  newspaper  report

where  even a foreign MD was making a comparison  between

local  and foreign workers, and repeating the same mantra

about  negative traits of local workers.  If  indeed  our

workers have such serious mindset problems, then we  will

never  have made the leap from a third world to  a  first

world  country  within  a  record  period  of  just  four

decades.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes, I wonder whether mindset problems

have  become  a  convenient excuse to  cover  other  more

significant underlying issues that need to be  addressed.

One  that  comes to mind is job redesign.  Our  workforce

has  grown  older, but if the jobs that our  workers  are

asked  to do have not changed, if it still requires  them

to  stand up to eight to 10 hours a day, or there are  no

equipment  to help move heavy objects so that  they  will

have  to  use  their physical strength, over time,  these

jobs  will be too onerous for them.  Even in the  service

sector,  there  are  jobs which over time  can  be  quite

onerous  for older workers.  For example, the  job  of  a

chambermaid  which requires heavy beds to be lifted  when

bedsheets  are  changed.  A 30-year old can  do  the  job

easily.   But a 55-year old may find it harder.  Sir,  we

need to have a closer look at this issue of job redesign.

And I call upon MOM to give greater priority to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another problem is, of course, pay. Many of

these  jobs  pay  low salaries, even  with  training  and

attempts  to upgrade cleaning jobs through training,  for

instance, the starting pay of $700 to $800 is not  likely

to  excite  Singaporeans.  I am not sure how far  we  can

further  upgrade  cleaning jobs so that  we  can  improve

productivity  and therefore our workers can  earn  better

wages.  But I am sure there are other jobs where this can

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, in the hotel industry, for

instance,  different persons do the cashiering,  ordering

and table cleaning.  But, today, all this can be done  by

one  person  - multi-skilling, multi-tasking and  working

across functions are the norms

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

now.    And  more  can  be  done  so  that  with   higher

productivity,  pay can go up.  Sir, the third  underlying

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you wind up your

speech now, please?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> The third underlying problem is

the  image of some jobs.  Certainly, there is a  need  to

change  image,  for  example, jobs in the  shipyards  are

relatively  safe  and you do not hear of  people  getting

injured or killed every day.  But nothing much is done to

counter the negative impression that jobs there are  very

unsafe.   So Singaporeans sometimes may not want to  work

there.   Sir, I would like to urge MOM to seriously  look

into these underlying issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to urge you to stop your

speech too.  Next speaker, please.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I support Mdm Halimah's

point  about  not just the workers need to  change  their

mindset  but,  at  the  same time,  would  like  to  urge

employers to also change their mindset.  The first  issue

I  would  like to raise is with regard to the retail  and

hospitality sectors where most Singaporeans are  shunning

these sectors.  I support that we take in foreign workers

and  talents  where  we are lacking  in  the  skills  and

expertise,  or we cannot find Singaporeans to fill  these

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the foreign workers or talents compare

better  than  our locals and make up for  what  we  lack,

there is no good reason for us to reject them.  But where

jobs  can be filled by Singaporeans, we must continue  to

educate  Singaporeans to be less picky and  employers  to

adopt  flexibility  in managing the needs  of  the  local

working population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would like to support what Mr Arthur Fong has

said earlier regarding job sharing.  I came across a case

recently.  An Indian beauty salon owner came to apply for

a  work  permit for an Indian national trained in  beauty

therapy.  The reason is that the foreign talent  will  be

willing  to  work on weekends, long hours, and  accept  a

lower salary.  I had to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>

convince the owner to explore job sharing which may  make

it  easier for him than to look for a local who needs  to

look for a job with normal work hours because of domestic

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers, as Mdm Halimah has said, have

carried  articles on the attitude of Singaporeans leading

to  eating  houses and the like, preferring  to  opt  for

foreign  workers.  The issues I would like to raise  are:

one, it would appear that the terms and conditions of the

job  offered  have  made  this  job  less  attractive  to

Singaporeans.  I would like to ask MOM whether  there  is

any  educational programme for employers with  regard  to

mindset   change  on  work  flexibility  and  terms   and

conditions of work for local Singaporeans in this sector.

Two,   in   order  to  encourage  businesses  to   engage

Singaporeans in jobs traditionally shunned in restaurants

and  hotels,  what  schemes does  the  Ministry  have  to

encourage more Singaporeans to join these sectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second issue concerns the recent change on foreign

workers policy in the construction industry.  The primary

consideration  in this change is to allow  multi-skilling

to  qualify for lower levy and to encourage businesses to

employ  Singaporeans.  Now, it is important that we  also

encourage  Singaporeans  to  be  multi-skilled   in   the

construction  sector.  This is survival for  Singaporeans

in  the  construction industry, otherwise they  may  find

themselves levelling down, while the foreign construction

workers  will  level  up with multi-skills  training  and

tasking.  My questions are: how does the Ministry propose

to  encourage  more Singaporeans to take up  multi-skills

training in the construction industry?  I would also like

to  know  why  the  recent policy on  the  rationale  and

criteria  for  the foreign construction  workers  is  not

extended  to  the  other sectors where there  is  a  high

demand for foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue, it concerns the lowering of

income tax for foreign talents.  Sir, one reason why  the

Government  has  lowered  the personal  tax  rate  is  to

attract

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

foreign  talents into the country.  I would like  to  ask

the  Minister whether there is sufficient reason to lower

the  income tax rate for this group of people, given that

the  personal  income tax in this country is considerably

lower  than  in other parts of the developed world.   How

much lower should we cut our personal income tax rate  in

order to attract foreign talents?  Are there other better

ways to appeal to them besides undertaking a measure that

may not be effective?

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

declare  my interest as the CEO of Hyflux Limited.   Yes,

we  do  need  to focus on creating jobs for  the  locals.

However, this should not be at the expense of enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also protect the interests of some promising

SMEs.  One of the sunrise sectors, for example, is in the

environmental technology sector.  Some of these companies

require   workers   with   specific   skills,   such   as

manufacturing of membranes, and assisting in research and

pilot  plant  trials  for  reclamation  of  waste  water.

Locals with such skills are very hard to find because the

demand   for   membrane-based  treatment  facilities   in

Singapore has taken a quantum jump only in recent  years.

If we succeed in grooming a group of people in Singapore,

then  in  that  case  this might  become  a  very  viable

alternative for Singapore being an environmental hub  for

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers with the necessary skills for such

jobs often do not have professional paper qualifications.

Instead, they acquire their skills through years  of  on-the-job  training  and experiences in overseas  projects.

At the moment, the Ministry of Manpower does not have the

appropriate  classification for this  group  of  workers.

Hence, this group of workers is normally brought in under

the  classification of construction industry and they are

subject  to rules relating to this classification,  which

can be quite irrelevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from next year, MOM requires new foreign

workers to obtain two trade certificates before they  can

qualify for lower levy.  Since there is no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>

appropriate  classification for  this  group  of  skilled

workers, and for the fact that they are brought in  under

the  classification of construction industry,  the  trade

certificate  must be from construction related  subjects,

such  as  tiling, water proofing, painting, piling,  etc.

While such skills are necessary for construction workers,

they  are  not relevant to this group of skilled workers.

As  a  result, the workers would choose courses, such  as

painting   or   brick  laying,  just  to   satisfy   this

requirement, though they have no need for such a skill in

their  jobs.   And  companies would also  have  to  incur

unnecessary business cost, just to qualify for lower levy

for the renewal of permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that it is difficult for institutions to

structure specific courses to suit the needs of  a  small

niche market.  In this regard, I want to ask if MOM would

accept  on-the-job training in place of  the  set  skills

test  for  such qualification.  Of course, one may  argue

that  we  will  train  our  local  workers,  instead   of

depending on foreign workers.  Yes, we can.  But changing

the  mindset  of the locals will take time  and  business

cannot wait.  Such skills also need time to develop.   If

these  businesses cannot survive because  of  a  lack  of

workers  here,  these companies will  relocate  and  more

Singaporean jobs will be lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would like to further ask if

the Ministry of Manpower would review the foreign workers

classification and terms of engagement so as to keep pace

with changing times and industrial needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, there are genuine

international talents and there are skilled and unskilled

foreign  workers.  Except for the high bonuses  paid  for

their early departures, our population generally has less

objection  to bringing in good international talents,  if

it  is  to  help build our economy, nor do they have  any

objection  to bring in the unskilled workers  to  do  the

jobs that most Singaporeans do not want to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most working citizens are having objections

to the entry of lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

paid skilled foreign workers.  The Government should make

an  effort to differentiate skilled foreign workers  more

clearly instead of lumping them together as international

talents, for they are not.  These skilled foreign workers

are  just  workers on a lower pay and come in to  compete

with  the  majority  of our Singapore workers  for  their

jobs.  In view of the high level of unemployment that  we

have,  the  Government must clearly  justify  why  it  is

advertising  aggressively  overseas  for  these   skilled

foreign  workers to come in and compete with our citizens

and allowing them to displace our workers in the process.

Will   the   Government  allow  and   encourage   foreign

politicians, like Bill Clinton, to come and compete  with

them for their political jobs?  I do not think so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any way, I hope that the Minister can address the

concerns   of  working  Singaporeans  on  the  aggressive

recruitment  of  skilled  foreign  workers  to  come   to

Singapore.   To reply to Minister Ng, it is  not  closing

our  markets  to  foreign workers, but about  proactively

recruiting skilled foreign workers, or talents  overseas,

to come here and compete with our locals.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, there are about 140,000 foreign

domestic  workers employed in Singapore.  Most come  from

neighbouring countries and have contributed significantly

to   Singapore's  growth  and  prosperity.   Without  the

foreign  domestic workers, it will be difficult for  many

Singapore women to work, and the economy will suffer as a

result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign domestic workers, work in Singapore is

attractive  as the remittances that they send  home  help

their  families  and  contribute significantly  to  their

country's  GDP.   According to ILO's  estimates,  migrant

workers'   remittances  represent  the   second   largest

international  monetary  trade  flow,  exceeded  only  by

petroleum.   But  US$600  million flow  through  official

channels  and another US$15 million in various unreported

ways.   So  foreign  domestic workers  serve  a  mutually

beneficial need both for the sending country as  well  as

the receiving country, such as Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have asked before whether there is a need for

some  regulatory  framework for foreign domestic  workers

as,  unlike  other foreign workers, they are not  covered

under  the  Employment Act.  I must stress  that  foreign

domestic   workers  are  not  singled  out  for  specific

treatment.   In  fact,  all domestic  workers,  including

Singaporeans,  are excluded from the  scope  of  the  Act

primarily because of the nature of their work.  Hence,  I

would  like  to  ask whether there are any  proposals  to

review  our current position on foreign domestic  workers

because   foreign  domestic  workers  tend  to  be   more

vulnerable  than  other  foreign workers,  as  they  work

within  the  confines of the home and are  more  isolated

compared  to  other foreign workers.  Is it  possible  to

consider providing some legal minimum standards for  them

and  a  mechanism  for  them  to  legally  enforce  these

standards?   For example, the standards can cover  things

like  rest  days, payment of salary, sick day and  annual

leave,  some  of  the very basic and core  benefits.   In

order  to  enforce these standards, the foreign  domestic

workers  can be allowed access to MOM's labour courts  to

make claims and to enforce these standards.  In this way,

they  have  access to a speedy and inexpensive method  of

dealing with their claims.  I am aware that MOM has  done

quite  a  lot  to help foreign domestic workers.   But  I

think  there  is  scope  for us  to  further  refine  our

existing rules to better protect them.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

thank  you, for allowing me to speak on this  topic.   As

employers  of  domestic workers, they pay  about  $345  a

month  to  the Ministry of Manpower as levy.   There  are

about 140,000 domestic workers today and this amounts  to

about  $47 million a month in levy.  I am here  today  to

ask  the  Ministry  of  Manpower to  consider  whether  a

portion  of  this levy could be used for three  purposes.

Firstly,  domestic workers do fall ill.   This  is  apart

from the accident insurance policy that employers do take

out.  A check with doctors in private practice as well as

hospitals does show that at least one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

domestic  worker needs hospitalisation and  sometimes  is

whisked away by employers who do not want to pay for  the

hospitalisation.   Is it possible then  perhaps  that  we

have  a premium with some insurance company to take  care

of hospitalisation for certain illnesses?

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another use of the levy that I am asking

is  whether it is possible to consider a certain  portion

to  be  set  aside,  such that domestic  workers  can  be

trained in basic skills.  This can be part of the  Skills

Development  Programme.  A check shows that some  of  the

courses that domestic workers take on their days off cost

about  $60-120 for 12 sessions of dress-making,  etc,  or

even using home appliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, can a portion of this levy be set aside in

a modified scheme, such that when the domestic workers go

home  they  get some little substantial amount  of  money

over  the months accumulated that they can take home  and

develop  their  own course of living back in  their  home

countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I think with $345 - I do not

know  what  the  calculations can be, if we  are  serious

about  these three schemes - if let us, say, we  were  to

keep aside $45, that amounts to $6 million a month to  be

kept  aside  for things that can benefit and improve  the

relationship   between  the  domestic  worker   and   the

employer.  As such, I would also like to ask the Ministry

of  Manpower  if it is possible to know what  exactly  is

this  amount of almost $50 million per month put  to.   I

have looked through the Budget Book, and I grant that  it

is  used  to  cover operational costs, the  investigation

processes  for  certain cases, and  to  maintain  a  very

efficient Work Permit Department.  But it would  be  good

to know where else the money goes to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang Mong Seng is not present. Mr

Yeo Guat Kwang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The number of

industrial   accidents  and  occupational   diseases   is

steadily declining

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

over the years. This is  primarily due to the efforts put

in by the Ministry of Manpower, unions and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the number is falling, each case is still one

case  too many.  We must do whatever we can to bring down

the  figure even further.  It saddens me to see that  the

number of fatal accidents and that of accidents which led

to permanent disability and injuries to hands and fingers

of  the  workers  over  the  past  three  years  has  not

improved.  On the average, there are about 60 fatal cases

per year, of which 60% occurs in the construction sector.

In  fact,  fatal  cases in the construction  sector  have

increased despite the industrial slowdown.  In  the  past

five  years, there were, on average, about 100  accidents

per  year, which led to permanent disability. Out of this

number,  35  were from the construction industry  and  30

from  the metal industry.  Has the Ministry any plans  to

step up efforts in this area?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the statistics in the past few years, two

trends are visible.  The most common type of occupational

disease  is  noise-induced deafness, and the most  common

type  of  industrial accident involves  hand  and  finger

injuries.   In  fact, if we add them  up  together,  they

account for 45% of the total. If something can be done on

these two areas, our industrial safety record could  have

been much better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to statistics, about 70% of accidents

were caused by the following three factors:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Fall from high places;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Struck by falling objects; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stepping on or hit by stationary objects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to focus on these key causes and

recommend effective measures to prevent such incidents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that

we  are rather behind time on this cut since Members  are

making such long speeches.  Mdm Halimah.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, on worker protection, I

have a specific concern.  It seems to be obvious that the

employment structure is changing very rapidly.  There are

more  part-time,  temporary and casual jobs.   In  short,

jobs have become more short-term.  But if we look at  the

Employment Act, most of the benefits are tied  to  length

of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is our sick leave, where we have to

work  for six months before we are entitled to paid  sick

leave.    Unionised   workers  are  covered   under   the

collective  agreements, where benefits are extended  from

the first day of work, but non-unionised workers have  to

depend on the discretion of the employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case in point is the retrenchment benefits,

where  we have to work for three years before we can  ask

for the benefits.  Even then, we will be paid only if the

benefit   is  stipulated  in  the  contract  of  service,

otherwise  payment  will  be at  the  discretion  of  the

employer.  For unionised workers, this is not a  problem,

as  the  union  will negotiate on behalf of the  workers,

regardless of whether this is stipulated in the  contract

of  employment or the collective agreement.  But  workers

who are not unionised are not so protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the changes that are taking place, I

would  like  to ask the Ministry whether it considers  it

feasible at this point of time to consider legislating  a

minimum   quantum  of  retrenchment  benefits   for   all

retrenched  workers.  I would like to  request  that  MOM

look  into  this  issue  to ensure  that  our  employment

legislation  keeps  in tandem with  the  changes  in  our

economic and employment structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, our labour standards are good and up

to  par with international standards.  As a member of the

ILO  governing  body, I am proud of  our  standards  and,

hence,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  whether  our

Government would consider ratifying more ILO conventions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Steve Chia asked whether we would

allow foreigners to come to Singapore to compete with  us

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>

political office.  We indeed do.  There are Mr Khaw  Boon

Wan, Ms Irene Ng and Ms Olivia Lum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of speakers have alluded to our

foreign  worker policies, and I think it is important  to

address  it,  because it is a fundamental pillar  of  our

labour market policies.  Many of the Members' comments  - and these are comments from Mr Steve Chia and Mr Low Thia

Khiang  - assume that the mathematical model for  foreign

workers and Singaporeans is one of displacement,  ie,  if

we  disallow one foreign worker into Singapore, we create

one  job  for  Singaporeans.  This  is  flawed  thinking.

Indeed,  on a net basis, the entry of foreign workers  is

additive, ie, it creates more jobs for Singaporeans  and,

correspondingly,  their exclusion would  result  in  even

more unemployment.  My Minister has touched on this but I

will elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers help to fill manpower gaps within

our  economy,  which locals are not willing  or  able  to

fill.   They  also help to moderate the cost of  business

and  improve  the  international competitiveness  of  our

companies  and allow them to function, win more contracts

and employ more Singaporeans.  For example, the transport

equipment  industry, which includes the marine  industry,

grew  rapidly in 2001, and saw an increase in  employment

of  over  20,000 jobs.  Given the sudden  upturn  in  the

industry,  the sector had to turn to foreign  workers  to

quickly ramp up its workforce.  Without this ready source

of  foreign workers, the companies would not be  able  to

take on new orders, thus losing the opportunity to create

jobs for Singaporeans as well as foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might ask why did the marine industry not

turn to Singaporeans.  Last year, many Members, including

many  of  the  Mayors  in the CDCs, profiled  the  marine

industry, together with me.  We went on a roadshow to say

that  it  had one of the best safety records, wages  were

decent despite what Mdm Halimah says about low wages.  We

said that in the marine industry they can earn up to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

about $2,000 with overtime and a stable career path.   We

donned hard hats, walked up ramps, got hoisted onto  ship

decks,   and   toured   their  shipyards.    Particularly

memorable  was Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon in a yellow  pantsuit

and  hoisted  up  onto the ship deck.  We  had  excellent

press  coverage.  We continued those efforts for about  a

year.   The result?  Less than 300 workers signed on  for

an  industry that has 2,000 vacancies even now.  We  will

and  we  must continue these efforts, but we need  to  be

realistic.   It  will  take  some  time  before  mindsets

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, hotels have had to hire foreign workers to

ensure  that they are able to operate smoothly over  peak

Christmas,  Hari  Raya  and  Chinese  New  Year   holiday

periods.   And there is no shortage of schemes  profiling

the  opportunities and the better image of workers in the

hospitality  industry.  If they do not have ready  access

to willing workers, customers like you and I complain and

may  not  patronise  their  restaurants  again.   Similar

examples  exist for technical jobs in the  aerospace  and

petrochemical industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in our present high unemployment

situation,  many  locals  are  not  willing  to  take  up

available jobs in industries.  It is not, as Mdm  Halimah

says,  that  we  are  castigating or selective.   I  have

already mentioned that the unemployment rate is 4%.   96%

of the willing take up jobs.  It is these select few that

we  must not allow to tarnish the whole industry.  If the

Government  makes  it  difficult for  companies  to  find

sufficient manpower, they will lose contracts  or,  worse

still,  may relocate their operations to other countries,

and  locals employed by them would end up losing jobs  as

well.   Supporting industries would see their  businesses

decline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Mr Steve Chia's definition of talent

is  an artificial one.  Would not an employer consider  a

hardworking worker, whether local or foreign, willing  to

learn,  helping  to meet deadlines, talent?   Restricting

access  to  foreign workers through stricter quotas  with

more  rigidities  to our labour market, as  suggested  by

some, would only hurt us in the long run.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>

Therefore,  the  Ministry takes a judiciously  calibrated

approach   in   balancing  between   helping   unemployed

Singaporeans to find jobs and meeting business needs  for

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, while we continue to manage this

inflow of foreign workers through an appropriate levy and

quota,  we  must  simultaneously  help  Singaporeans   to

compete.   And  this  is  the  gist  and  thrust  of  our

Continuing  Education and Training statutory  board.   We

must  help  Singaporeans to be more  competitive  by  re-adapting mindsets, retrain, re-deploy as well as redesign

industries, as Mdm Halimah has also suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that ultimately

it  is  the competitiveness of our industries, with their

mix of local and foreign workers, that will determine our

overall  productivity and value-add.  Indeed, the  recent

changes  in the construction manpower policies were  made

with  this  very  end in mind, and we  will  extend  this

policy and the measures to other industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the possible changes to the foreign worker

levy,  there  is  no need to increase the  levy  at  this

point,  as the numbers have not escalated.  Dr  Wang  Kai

Yuen  earlier  asked  whether we were  certain  that  our

figures were correct.  If we look at our figures  in  the

last  year, local employment actually rose.  There was  a

net   decrease  in  overall  employment  but,  for  local

residents,  the number employed went up by  20,000.   For

foreigners, there was a loss of 60,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with Members that the current $30

skill levy is too low to regulate inflow.  It was set  in

1999  when  the  Government  substantially  reduced   the

foreign worker levy to help business tide over the  Asian

financial  crisis and, as Deputy Prime Minister  Lee  has

announced, the Ministry will review this later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken about welfare of our

foreign  workers.  He has asked for the  number  of  maid

abuses.  I will give just two figures.  In 1997, it was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

157  offenders.  It has dropped to 43 last year,  on  the

back of an ever increasing population of foreign domestic

maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of housing, we have said that by mid-2004,

all foreign workers who are housed off-site would have to

be  accommodated in proper and authorised  accommodation.

We  will  continue  these efforts to  treat  our  foreign

workers with decency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Employment Pass holders, Mr Low Thia

Khiang  and  Mr  Steve  Chia implied  that  our  policies

disproportionately discriminate against locals.  The most

recent  change was in the raising of the salary criterion

for  Employment Pass holders from $2,000 to $2,500,  from

1st December 2001.  Since then, we have witnessed a sharp

decline in the number of Employment Pass holders over the

past year, from 90,000 in 2001 to about 70,000 by the end

of  2002, a 25% reduction.  I assure Members that we  did

not  have  a  similar  reduction in terms  of  our  local

graduates.   The  unemployment  of  our  graduate  degree

holders is still around 4%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this shows is that, under difficult conditions,

our   policies   were  not  weighted  against   our   own

professionals.    Indeed,   foreigners   have    suffered

retrenchments even more so, and were not spared from  the

adverse labour market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives us no joy for commiseration. When

expatriates leave, the service sector suffers  too,  even

though  the  expatriates  may  be  in  the  manufacturing

sector: rents, the restaurants they patronise, the  shops

they  buy from, there is a knock-on effect.  So, this  is

no  cause  for joy for any of us.  We need  to  view  our

global  workforce in its entirety: both local and foreign

workers   adding   value  and  competitiveness   to   our

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Olivia Lum that technological

changes  will blur industry boundaries, and she is  quite

right.   It  is  difficult to have  cut-and-dry  industry

classifications  or  qualifications  because   of   these

changes.   However,  there  must  be  opportunities   for

Singaporeans  to  fill these jobs  too  because,  if  the

sector does well, it is an employment creation sector

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

that  we  want  to  focus  on.  Therefore,  we  have  the

Manpower  Development Assistance Plan, which is a  scheme

that  helps companies and organisations develop  training

programmes,  project  forward  for  critical  skills   in

industries, and especially growth industries, where there

is a lack of training, to try to help Singaporeans become

competitive. 3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I have taken note of her concerns and

MOM  would  be happy to work with these industry  players

like  her  in  the  environmental  technology  and  water

treatment industry, to address the specific needs of  the

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked for better regulation of

foreign  domestic maids.  As I have said  in  this  House

before, it is not practical to regulate domestic work  in

regard to hours of work, rest day and overtime work in  a

home    environment.    It   is    difficult    to    do.

Notwithstanding  this, the Ministry encourages  employers

and  their foreign domestic workers to work out the terms

and  conditions of employment based on mutual  agreement.

With  the  help of their embassies or employment  agents,

most  foreign  domestic  workers do  enter  into  written

employment contracts with their employers, covering  core

employment  terms  such  as  salary,  rest  day,  medical

benefit  and a description of their duties.  The Ministry

of Manpower is happy to conciliate if there are disputes.

It  is not uncommon for employers to provide at least one

rest day in a month and to purchase the medical insurance

policies for their foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathiaparanam has spoken on foreign

domestic worker levy to be used for other purposes.   The

purpose of the levy is to regulate the demand for foreign

domestic  workers and should be used as  such.   However,

employers  who feel that their maids deserve  higher  pay

and benefits are encouraged to do so.  We would encourage

employers to reward them, including paying them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

bonuses,  air  fare, paying for their  courses,  if  they

choose to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what happened to the $50 million that the

Ministry collects and what it is used for.  My answer  to

her is that it goes into the consolidated fund and it  is

returned  to the public in terms of ERS, utility rebates,

rental rebates. There is not one-to-one correlation.   It

does  not  go  straight into the pockets of our  Ministry

officials  or Ministry members.  It goes back to  society

at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken on safety at

construction  sites.  We share his  concern.   There  are

about 38 fatal accidents in construction work sites  last

year.  MOM will continue its concerted efforts to improve

safety  and  we  will  continue to  launch  a  number  of

initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on enforcement and regulation, we

will  take  contractors who flout the rules to  task  and

those  with  poor  safety records  will  be  barred  from

employing  foreign  workers from non-traditional  sources

for one year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety training for personnel will be made

compulsory in a number of sectors and new regulations  to

address   safety   concerns,  such  as   poorly   erected

scaffoldings, will be implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about hand and finger injuries. He is

quite  right.  They are the most significant reasons  for

injuries - about 2,200 cases in 1993. But it has  dropped

to  about  1,600  cases  last  year.   The  metal-working

industry intuitively does indeed suffer more injuries and

we   have   introduced  new  provision  to  require   all

supervisors  and  workers  in this  industry  to  undergo

proper safety training. This will take effect on 1st June

2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On noise-induced deafness, it has declined in 2002

to  the  level  of  that  in 1998  as  a  result  of  our

enforcement and promotional efforts, including the  Noise

Control  Awards.  We  will set a new Singapore  Standard:

Code of Practice this month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked for retrenchment benefits. In

2002, a total of 18,900

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

workers  were  retrenched.  In  that  same  period,   193

retrenched  workers sought the Ministry's  assistance  to

secure  payment of retrenchment benefits.  Of these,  40%

was  successful  in  their claims and the  remaining  60%

settled  on  their  own.  In general,  companies  do  pay

retrenchment benefits to their laid-off workers. This  is

reflected  in  a  study  involving  58  companies   which

notified the Ministry of their retrenchments.  97% of the

2,405  affected  workers  from these  companies  received

retrenchment  benefits, the majority  receiving  benefits

about a month per year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification

from  the  Minister of State?  He said in his reply  that

the  definition  of foreign talent is an artificial  one.

He  also  said  that a hardworking person  valued  by  an

employer can be considered as talented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a bit confused about this. What exactly

is  the difference between attracting foreign talents and

the  foreign worker policy?  Does it mean that the policy

for  foreign talent is to attract foreign workers who are

highly  educated  and  skilled  and  thereby  introducing

competition to Singapore workers to depress their  wages,

as we are overpaid?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Low starts with an

assumption  of his own making and ends up to  a  position

that he himself makes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent is best decided by the employer and this has

to  be  so.  But he has said:  do we protect our  workers

enough?   Let  us take the point that we  are  making  in

terms  of  professionals. Indeed, the greatest protection

is the restriction we have already imposed on the market.

In  terms  of salaries, we have raised it from $2,000  to

$2,500.   That, in itself, is the industry's  nation-wide

measure  which  regulates  the  entry.   And  as  I  have

mentioned,  when the economy went down,  the  EP  holders

were  reduced by 25%, a dramatic reduction,  which  shows

that  it is enough of a protection for our local workers.

So  it  is not, as he has implied, that we do not protect

our professionals and that we use them to depress wages.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>

The  salary  criterion  of $2,500  is  a  very  effective

regulator.  And if you look at our job surveys, in  terms

of NUS and NTU graduates who have recently come out, they

suffer salary decrements of about 5%, and measured  on  a

global scale, in terms of this economic climate, that  is

not  something  that is way out in terms of international

benchmarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at our polytechnic graduates, some of

them  have  pay  rises.  I will dispute  the  point  very

strongly  with the facts, that we are not protecting  our

professionals.   But  I would also  say  that  protection

needs  to be calibrated because foreign workers,  whether

at the unskilled or skilled level or EP level, add to our

vigour, our vibrancy and our competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A further clarification. So

what is exactly the definition, or is there no definition

of  foreign  talent?   Is an EP holder  considered  as  a

foreign talent or just a foreign worker?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, "foreign" means not local, and

"talent" means the opposite of non-talented.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

answered   my   question  regarding  the   advertisements

that?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, we are doing it to attract

talent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, last year, the Lifelong Learning

Festival  was very eventful and very extensively  covered

by  the  media. The most spectacular event was the  fish-tossing  demonstration by the foreign  experts  who  were

specially invited to perform at the festival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our people are saying, "Why toss the

fish?  You  keep  tossing the fish  at  the  fishmonger's

stall, and you would end up tossing away your rice bowl!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in Singapore, we do not toss the fish, but

we toss durians. I often see some workers tossing durians

from the lorry to the people standing on the ground,  who

catch  the  durians  and,  in  turn,  toss  them  to  the

stallholder.  You need to be skilful to  toss  and  catch

these thorny fruits, because if you miss any one of them,

it  will hit you on the face. It is not only painful  but

shameful too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think this year, in our Lifelong Learning

Festival, we should have more local flavour in it.   Last

year,  we  awarded some scholarships to Singaporeans  who

exhibited  good  learning attitude.  Perhaps,  we  should

award  some  scholarships this year to  people  who  have

shown good results in acquiring new skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Lianhe Wanbao launched a new series called

the  "Roll  of Heroes" where they introduced a series  of

Singaporeans  who had been  unemployed but then,  because

of their determination and courage, they started to learn

a  new skill in a new territory and then created economic

miracles. According to the journalists in Lianhe  Wanbao,

there  are  in fact many, many people who deserve  to  be

featured  but  many  of them declined because  they  felt

embarrassed  to  be  featured as the so-called  "rags-to-richness" heroes.  Those who are courageous enough to  be

interviewed  and  featured are real heroes.  They  really

have the guts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present situation, with jobs being so hard to

get, people would say, "Well,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>

there is no choice.  Give me a job,  I will take it  even

if  I  have to work seven days a week. Even if the salary

is  halved, I will still do it.  If what I earn  is  just

enough  for  me to eat, that is good enough for  me.  The

Teochew  term for beggar is kit jia (beg to  eat).   Now,

you  beg  for  a job, earn your salary so that  you  have

enough to eat."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and MPs have asked the people to change

their mindsets. I think that is not good enough. We  need

to have the workers themselves to come forward and be the

spokesmen for this change of mindset. This will appeal to

the  workers  as  they can identify themselves  with  the

spokesmen. They are "fellow sufferers commiserating  with

each other."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think MOM should learn from the commercial

advertisements.   If you are advertising  a  hair-growing

tonic,  you would get some botak or bald guys to  promote

the  products, by saying how they have applied the  tonic

and how their hair began to grow again.  You do not get a

long-hair beauty to sell the hair-growing tonic.  She  is

better used in selling hair shampoo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can have more local characteristics

and  a  change of style in this year's Lifelong  Learning

Festival.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the new CET statutory board

will   also   work   more  closely  with  community-based

organisations,  such  as  the  CDCs,  to  bring  lifelong

learning  to the heartlands.  Nevertheless, I  think  the

only point that I, and probably this House, will want  to

take  home  from  Mr Seng's question is  that  we  should

incorporate   him   in  next  year's  Lifelong   Learning

Festival. We will invite him to be on our festival.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3). Mr Heng, you have

got about three minutes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code SO 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On individual-initiated training, I am happy that

the Government has accepted the ERC's recommendation that

individual-initiated   training   be   supported   as   a

complement  to  company-based training.  This  shows  our

Government's  recognition that companies  will  generally

not train workers for other jobs.  Companies may actually

prefer  to employ directly-trained people from the market

rather  than train their own, that SMEs will, over  time,

employ  a  larger percentage of the workforce,  and  that

SMEs,  generally  speaking, have a  lower  propensity  to

train  their  workers. In this connection, I  would  just

like to ask the Minister what are the specific plans that

we have in mind to initiate more specific support schemes

for individual-initiated training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on purposeful training, in a downturn, the

number of unemployed increases and you find that as  more

people go for training, some may not get jobs immediately

and  therefore, the question arises whether  training  is

purposeful. I completely support MOM's approach which  is

to target training that can help people find jobs as soon

as  possible. That is purposeful and, therefore,  schemes

like place-and-train is the way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to highlight that we also have got

to  prepare  for  the rebound.  Every  time  there  is  a

rebound,  we  will find that there are pockets  of  skill

shortages that will drive up costs.  Therefore, in  order

not   to  have  this  cost  rise  to  the  detriment   of

competitiveness and workers' employment prospects, I urge

that  MOM  continue  to work closely with  industries  to

anticipate areas of skill needs and be prepared to  train

in advance of recovery.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> While some Singaporeans are

facing  difficulties  in finding  jobs,  many  unemployed

Singaporeans  shun away from certain jobs available.  One

observation is that the moment a certain job is performed

by mainly the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>

foreign  workers, Singaporeans will see  it  as  jobs  by

foreign  workers. As such, it has become  more  and  more

difficult for employers to get local unemployed  to  take

up  a  job and the employers will press for more and more

foreign  workers.  I think one good example was mentioned

by  our Minister just now that when he has his hair  cut,

he has his ear cut, because the employer was pressing for

more foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether the Ministry will look into ways

to  come  up  with  an incentive scheme to  attract  more

unemployed Singaporeans to this kind of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fast ageing population and higher

aspirations  of Singaporeans, there is a need  to  review

the  role  of  HDB.   Over the last  30  years,  HDB  has

fulfilled  its  role  to provide affordable  and  quality

homes  to  Singaporeans.  Today, 85% of Singaporeans  own

HDB  flats.  If we were to achieve the long-term goal  of

having a 25:75 ratio of private and public home

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>

ownership,  we  need  to  restructure  the  HDB   housing

programme.   At  the  same  time,  we  must  allow   more

flexibility and options for some Singaporeans to rent HDB

flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the HDB upgrading programmes have

rejuvenated some older estates, there are some  setbacks.

Residents  were  inconvenienced for two  or  three  years

during the upgrading process and there are limitations to

improve  the design of the upgraded precinct.   There  is

also  less  intensive  use of the land  to  provide  more

housing units in these well-located precincts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications

from the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the rationale for restructuring HDB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the new roles of HDB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How can HDB continue to provide quality and

affordable homes for Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Will HDB review its Main and Interim Upgrading

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programmes?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>3.46 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Madam, since its

inception  in the 1960s, HDB's role and reach have  grown

far  beyond  the mere provision of low cost housing.   It

has  a  huge  multiplicity  of  roles  -  public  housing

authority,   developer,   financier,   lessor,   builder,

supplier,  estate  manager, and so on.   The  ERC  Report

called  for a review of the HDB's role in public housing,

but it stopped short of making recommendations.  Madam, I

deduce  that  unlike  streaming in  education,  the  home

ownership  policy  is not a sacred  cow  that  cannot  be

slaughtered.   As more than 85% of Singaporeans  own  and

live  in HDB flats, any change in public housing policies

stands to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>

wide ramifications on the private housing market and  the

economy  as a whole.  This has been witnessed many  times

over  in  the  past.  Reviewing the  role  of  HDB  is  a

tremendous  challenge and requires much  careful  thought

and consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that HDB has already begun to remake

itself  with the announcement to corporatise the Building

and Development Division.  Madam, I would like to ask the

Minister whether the HDB plans to become even trimmer  by

shedding   some   of  its  non-related   public   housing

functions, such as developing and managing industrial and

commercial  projects.   I would also  like  to  make  the

following  two  suggestions for HDB  to  consider  as  it

reviews its role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, increasing the ratio of private to public

housing.   Over the years, HDB has scope-crept  from  low

cost  to  middle income housing, and perhaps even  higher

middle income housing.  The recent economic downturn  has

shown that the demand for 5-room flats has dwindled to  a

trickle.   On the other hand, 4-room flats have  remained

the  most  popular.   There  are,  in  fact,  already   a

significant  number  of 5-room HDB  flats  available  for

sale, both in the new and resale markets, which can cater

to  those  who  wish  to upgrade to  such  flats.   HDB's

attention  is thus better focused at the lower  end  mass

housing  market, where the housing needs are  more  acute

because  of  lower affordability.  HDB should shrink  its

target  market  at the higher end completely.   It  could

stop   building  5-room  flats  and  instead  sell   more

executive  condominium sites as a step towards increasing

the proportion of housing types.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, low income housing and rental flats. HDB

should   make  more  rental  flats  available  to   allow

Singaporeans   the  option  to  separate  their   housing

investments and consumption decisions.  Increasingly,  in

line  with the call for more entrepreneurial spirit, many

Singaporeans  may not wish to be tied down by  a  housing

mortgage.   They  may wish to invest  their  money  in  a

business  instead of a house.  To allow this,  HDB  could

relax the qualifying criteria for renting flats,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>

by, amongst others, increasing the gross household income

ceiling,  which now stands at only $800 per  month.   The

present rules are too stringent and will not release  any

significant  amount of rental housing  into  the  market.

The  optimal  mix  of home ownership  and  rental  would,

however,  need  to  be  studied to  strike  some  balance

between  the effect of an entrepreneurial risk  appetite,

rate of family formation, and having a tangible stake  in

the nation.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Madam, with the

present  scenario of a built-up city, I just  have  three

questions.   What is the new role of HDB in view  of  the

already  high  build-up of HDB public housing?   And,  in

view  of  the proposed big set-up of 1,000 staff and  800

contract clerks-of-works, does the new HDB Corp expect to

play  any  role  in  the Singapore market,  although  the

stated  objective of HDB Corp is to foray  into  overseas

markets, like India and China?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support Dr Teo's call for a review of

Singaporeans' need of the interim, main, lift  upgrading,

and selective en-bloc redevelopment programmes, and their

cost  effectiveness and benefits to residents versus  the

inconvenience faced by residents.  Although  the  various

upgrading  works have served the objective  of  enhancing

the  living  environment  of the  older  estates  in  the

various phases, the residential development may still not

be  intensively built to take advantage of the plot ratio

of 3.5 for residential development in the new Master Plan

2003.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Madam, like

the  other speakers before me, I would also like  to  ask

the  Minister  about the new role of HDB.  With  the  HDB

Corp  now  taking over as the developer  and  builder  of

public housing, how will it be monitored in terms of  the

quality and cost of housing development?  The next  point

I  would  like  to ask the Minister is whether  he  would

review  what  I  have asked before, ie,  to  allow  older

Singaporeans a chance to monetise their flats.   Some  of

the  older  Singaporeans  have purchased  4-  and  5-room

flats.  Now their families have grown up and they do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>

not  need to live in such big flats, but they do not want

to  sell  their flats.  They want to rent them out.   But

because  they have bought them as subsidised flats,  they

are  not allowed to rent them out.  Perhaps, the Minister

could review this again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Madam, the

role  of  HDB now carries a different meaning.  HDB  has,

metaphorically  and  literally, been  a  household  word.

HDB's  role  has  been, for a long time, synonymous  with

public  housing.   With it come the social  sensitivities

connected with different public housing needs,  not  just

commercial  interest.   With  corporatisation,  and   HDB

farming  out more and more public housing to the  private

sector,  how  would  MND  and  HDB  ensure  that   public

interests  are  not  compromised?   Would  MND  and   HDB

consider   setting  up  an  advisory  board   to   handle

grievances  from  the  public,  especially  when  HDB  is

corporatised?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, today's Berita Harian highlighted some of the

predicaments  faced by HDB applicants following  the  new

rules  introduced  by HDB, eg, when  applying  for  loans

through  commercial  banks, they were  subjected  to  the

tightest  scrutiny,  so  much  so  that  those  who  have

problems  with credit balances, or loan repayments,  were

not  allowed  loans by the banks, although  they  claimed

that  they  had  cleared those loans or credit  balances.

Would  HDB  explain why the need for corporatisation  and

what  more  changes can the public expect following  this

major shift in HDB's position?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Madam, just a few quick

points.  Firstly, I would say that I welcome the move  to

corporatise  some  aspects of HDB's  functions,  which  I

believe will contribute to a leaner and more focused HDB,

allowing  other aspects of its work to be run on  a  more

commercial  and private sector basis.  Having said  that,

the questions that I would like to pose are these:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the residual HDB, which is the core

organisation,  continues to have certain aspects  of  its

functions,  which, it seems to me, logically belong  more

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>

the  private sector as well.  This includes,  as  Dr  Amy

Khor   has   also  mentioned,  the  areas  of  industrial

properties  and commercial properties, for example.   The

question  then  is:  are there plans to also  corporatise

these and subject them to private sector discipline?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is the

question  of  what will shape HDB's focus  in  the  years

ahead.   There  are many imperatives and  driving  forces

that  are  going  to reformulate the challenge  that  HDB

faces.   These  include not just the  reduced  volume  of

development   of  public  housing,  but   also   changing

demographics,   and  also  the  proportion   of   private

developments is increasing.  So is there a case for HDB's

focus to be sharpened, perhaps, to focus its planning and

development  efforts primarily on those Singaporeans  who

need  their first home, or those Singaporeans who are  in

financial need of a loan, and allowing the private sector

to  take  up the slack in other aspects of public housing

demands  in Singapore?  Madam, I would appreciate  it  if

the Minister could clarify.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, with a more mature public

housing market, building of new flats will gradually slow

down.   Thus,  there  is  a  need  to  restructure   HDB,

especially  the Building and Development Division  (BDD).

The  announcement of the corporatisation of HDB's BDD has

raised concerns both within HDB and the industry.   Those

affected  will  have  to consider whether  they  will  be

compensated  or  re-employed by the new HDB  Corporation.

This  has  generally affected morale,  especially  during

this   uncertain  market  situation.   Madam,  with   HDB

Corporation,  many  practitioners  are  concerned   about

losing market share in the future.  Many private building

consultants who are presently working on public  projects

have  put  in investments to satisfy the requirements  of

various Government agencies.  If the workload for  public

projects declines, they will suffer much loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the cost of corporatising HDB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the principal business activities of HDB Corp?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the estimated value of HDB contracts to be

allocated to HDB Corp for the next five years?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, HDB's revamp is

inevitable because the large bureaucratic organisation it

has  grown  into over the years is clearly not suited  to

the  rapidly  changing  economic  and  social  landscape.

However,  this has given rise to some concerns  from  the

private and people sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, scope of HDB Corporation. I would like to

ask  the  Minister what would be the scope of HDB  Corp's

business?   Would  it  extend  beyond  the  provision  of

professional  services and consultancy work  to  property

developers  when it is eventually allowed to  compete  in

the local non-HDB market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a level playing field. An increasing

proportion  of HDB's projects will be outsourced  to  the

private  sector from 2006.  This is, of course,  welcomed

by  the private sector.  However, there are apprehensions

from  them that the HDB Corp, being wholly-owned by  HDB,

will  not  be competing on a level playing field.   I  am

quite   certain   that  the  Temasek  Charter   will   be

religiously and fully applied to this entity and it  will

not  enjoy  special  privileges beyond  what  is  already

announced  by the Minister.  But the fact that overnight,

a  Government-linked behemoth, capable of  competing  for

the  shrinking housing pie, has surfaced is sure to  give

rise  to grave concerns over unfair competition.  I  urge

the Minister to consider, at least, a tentative timetable

for  HDB  Corp's divestment into private hands to  reduce

some misgivings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, focusing its energy on overseas

market instead of competing in the local market will help

to   allay   the   fears  of  the  private   sector   and

simultaneously help to achieve the objective of expanding

our second wing.  Madam, I notice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

that both these issues have already been mentioned by the

Minister.   But I urge the Minister to ensure that  these

thrusts  to minimise direct competition with the domestic

enterprises and to increasingly focus beyond  the  shores

of Singapore will not be diluted in any way.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some eyebrows raised by the press as

well  as  some members of the public who have written  to

the  press  regarding  the generous compensation  package

dished out by HDB to its staff, especially those who will

be transferred to HDB Corp.  In a reply to the press, HDB

has  noted that these HDB staff will not be automatically

given  a job in HDB Corp and that they will be on  a  new

pay  structure.   This is hardly convincing.   Could  the

Minister  let us know if some or all of the staff  to  be

transferred   to  HDB  Corporation  have   already   been

identified?   What  percentage  of  the  staff   in   HDB

Corporation  will not be former HDB employees?   I  know,

for  instance,  that HDB Corporation already  has  a  CEO

designate  who is presently a staff of HDB.  Also,  while

HDB  Corporation is technically a different  entity  from

HDB,  it is wholly owned by HDB and, hence, a job in  HDB

Corporation,  which if offered to an HDB employee,  could

very  reasonably be viewed as a transfer,  instead  of  a

retrenchment.  There is public outcry over what is deemed

to  be  an  unnecessary double bite of the  same  cherry.

This   matter  should  not  be  allowed  to  fester   as,

otherwise,   it   will  undermine   confidence   in   the

Government's wisdom to make such decisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, since its

establishment  in  1960, HDB has a  glorious  history  of

about  40  years.  Under the home ownership scheme,  they

have  already  built some 800,000 flats.   About  85%  of

Singaporeans are living in HDB flats, and about  96%  own

their  own flats.  I think this is the highest record  in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has already accomplished its mission, and many

of  its  staff  had  an  early  retirement  and  received

compensation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>

For  them, I think it is a good reward for what they have

contributed to our nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB is now going to set up a company. Many of

the   local  developers  are  worried.   Will  this   HDB

Corporation be competing with them for construction  work

in  Singapore?  With HDB's history of 40 years, it has  a

very  good  track record and famous brandname.   I  think

they should go into foreign markets, maybe in China or in

India.   They  should  venture  over  there  instead   of

competing with the local companies in our market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to ask the Minister what is the main aim of

the corporatisation.  Will HDB Corporation be leading our

local  developers and builders to venture and develop  in

the foreign markets?  If they can give this assurance, it

will  certainly boost the confidence and  morale  of  our

local developers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, as one of the advisors to the HDB

Staff Union, I know the HDB's corporatisation process has

created a lot of uncertainty and angst amongst the staff.

Having  said that, I think the management of HDB and  the

Ministry  have been very fair in their treatment  of  the

staff   affected,  and  I  would  like   to   record   my

appreciation on that score.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think the core issue today is:

what  is  the nature of the relationship between HDB  and

the  newly  established HDB Corporation?  As I understand

it,  based  on the releases made to the media,  it  is  a

wholly owned subsidiary of HDB.  What that means is  that

HDB  Corporation's  financial  performance  will  have  a

direct bearing on HDB's financial performance.  Then, can

we   expect   the  relationship  between  HDB   and   HDB

Corporation to be one at arm's length?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the outsourcing programme also creates

additional questions on this score.  For the first  three

years, all HDB projects will be given to HDB Corporation;

thereafter, 10% and then I understand it is  30%  in  the

fifth  year and 50% in the sixth year.  And the  pace  of

outsourcing, thereafter, will be reviewed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>

at the end of year six.  There are naturally questions in

the  minds  of  those in the private  sector  as  to  how

transparent and level the playing field will be  in  this

regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the staff in HDB Building Development

Division today will be divided.  Some  will be in the HDB

at  the  parent level, and some will be at the subsidiary

level.  Can these relationships truly be at arm's length?

Should  we not accelerate the process of outsourcing  and

decoupling  the relationship between HDB Corporation  and

HDB?   The  question  is particularly  pertinent  because

having  come out with a fair package, which is equivalent

to  a  retrenchment  package, the position  of  an  early

retirement  scheme,  we  are  now  endowing   the   newly

established HDB Corporation with the flexibility  to  set

terms and establish itself in a manner that it deems  fit

in  order  to  compete in the new environment.   I  would

appreciate it if the Minister could clarify this point.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, you can take the next two cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, on HDB branch office. With

the  delegation of the maintenance of HDB estates to  the

Town  Councils,  the functions of the HDB branch  offices

have been reduced drastically.  In the past, the HDB  had

adopted  a  decentralised approach to build area  offices

all  over  Singapore  to better serve  Singaporeans.   To

date,  these  branch  offices are providing  a  range  of

services,  such as purchase of season car  park  coupons,

and  lease  and  tenancy management  matters.   With  the

formation  of  the  five Community Development  Councils,

there  is a need to review whether the HDB branch offices

can  be better synchronised to provide a one-stop service

to residents.  Many of the CDCs are located at convenient

and  accessible  locations  to  residents.   As  such,  a

rationalisation of these branch offices may be  necessary

to  ensure better outreach of the branch office  services

to residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Ministry the following

questions: first, are there plans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>

to  rationalise the branch offices to better support  and

advise  CDC?   Second, will the HDB carpark  services  be

corporatised?   Third,  can  the  URA  and  HDB   carpark

sections be merged into a single entity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on Build to Order (BTO). The BTO

scheme  was  introduced to replace  the  Registration  of

Flats  system for HDB flats last year.  The main  purpose

is  to ensure a better match of demand and supply of  HDB

flats.   What  is more important is that it  allows  flat

applicants to choose specific locations when applying for

HDB  flats.  However, to achieve this, HDB must  allocate

more  sites  for BTO and provide a wider  mix  of  flats,

maybe from studio to 5-room flats, for each BTO site.  If

demand  for a particular mix of flats is below  75%,  HDB

must readjust the mix of flat types so as to attract  new

demand.   In  this  way, there will be  no  abortive  BTO

sites,  resulting in disappointment among flat applicants

and  wastage of resources.  Like private developers,  HDB

must be prepared to reduce the sale price of unsold flats

for  those with less desirable attributes, such as facing

bin centres or poor view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions: (1) does BTO provide better matching of demand

and  supply of HDB flats?  (2) can HDB consider providing

a better mix of flats for each BTO project?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, my concerns are with the

changing demography of the Singapore population.  The new

HDB  could  work  towards being more  responsive  to  the

public.   Many  of  the  post-war baby  boomers  will  be

reaching the senior citizens age group.  Many may need to

downgrade  their living standards in view of the  smaller

families  that  they  have, and  many,  in  view  of  the

economic  downturn,  may  just want  to  be  economically

independent and  free of their assets.  HDB should   take

an  active  review  in the provision of suitable  housing

types  for  the  future change in the demography  of  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the advancement of information and

communication  technology,  the  HDB  should  review  its

provision of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

basic  facilities within the flat, eg, the  provision  of

broadband and wireless network, to meet the future  needs

of  Singaporeans who are growing up with the computer and

Internet  world.   These facilities and  amenities  would

become  the basic necessities than luxuries.  This  would

also provide the backbone for the home office concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the small number of flats to be built and

sold  by  the  HDB,  HDB could relook  into  the  various

policies for the sale of HDB flats.  HDB, presently,  has

the  most complicated policies and guidelines in the sale

of HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a surplus of about 9,000 flats as at 31st

December  2002, HDB should look into the selling  of  the

flats  on  a daily basis, rather than on a monthly  basis

currently.   This is the standard in the private  sector.

I  am told that, recently, Wing Tai also sold their flats

and  houses during the Chinese New Year holidays and gave

away   ang  pows  to  prospective  buyers.   Would   HDB,

possibly, consider selling the 9,000 excess flats in  the

open  market at market price without subsidy and  without

the  usual HDB restrictive conditions for occupation  and

resale?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an incentive, HDB could do some accounting on the

holding  cost  of its built-up HDB flats.   For  example,

some  of  the  surplus flats under the SERS redevelopment

programme  are not let out to the public promptly.   Some

blocks  were ready at least for two years before take  up

by  residents,  and  many of these flats  are  in  superb

locations where demand is very high.  The timing for  the

occupation of the flats could be better scheduled if  the

holding cost of the built-up flats is taken into account.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee is not here. Dr Teo Ho

Pin.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, in order to encourage home

ownership,  HDB should review the resale levy, especially

for  3-room flats.  Many 3-room flat dwellers are working

class  families  and need more space  as  their  families

grow.  Today, some are living in congested flats and are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

unable  or  cannot afford to upgrade to  a  4-room  flat.

With  grown up children, some of their children  have  to

sleep  in  the  kitchen or living room, as there  is  not

enough  bedroom for them.  The crowded living  conditions

are  also  not conducive for their children to  study  at

home.  The 10 years time bar imposed by HDB for upgraders

has  further aggravated this problem, resulting  in  more

families staying in congested 3-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

(1)  can HDB consider reducing the resale levy for 3-room

flat  owners who wish to upgrade to a 4-room  flat?   (2)

can  HDB  waive the resale levy for those who sold  their

flats below their purchase price?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, on affordability of HDB

flats.    Presently,  HDB  policies  are  geared   toward

Singaporeans upgrading their flats. This is  natural,  as

most  Singaporeans,  when they  can  afford,  would  want

comfortable and bigger sized flats.  And most of us  have

also grown up with the aspiration of owning our flats, as

big  as  possible.  We are the only country that has  the

highest  home  ownership, and when the  economy  changes,

most  Singaporeans would be tied down  to  their  assets,

difficult  to  make  a vertical move for  their  housing,

unlike some who rent a house or a flat.  In view of  such

scenarios  present and in the future, HDB  should  review

its  present housing policy to allow for downgrading  and

the need to build smaller flats.  Presently, the purchase

of  3-room  HDB flats is only for first-time  applicants,

earning  an income of less than $2,000.  Will HDB  review

its  policy  to allow existing flat owners  who  need  to

downgrade to 3-room flats and meet the income criteria of

below $2,000 another chance to purchase directly from HDB

the  3-room  flats?  The reasons are that some  of  these

households  staying  in bigger flats just  simply  cannot

afford  to  buy  a 3-room flat in the open market,  since

they  still have large outstanding loans of their present

bigger  flats  and could not maintain the  present  flat.

Does the HDB have a sufficient supply of 3-room flats  to

cater to families who require them?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, Singaporeans are

indeed  very lucky to have the CPF scheme to  allow  home

ownership to be made affordable.  That is definitely true

for  the  first generation of homeowners in the first  20

years   of  our  independence.   Indeed,  following   the

significant  jump  of property prices, many  Singaporeans

sold  their flats ending up cash rich, yet upgrading into

a  second  flat, continuing to use the CPF  scheme  as  a

second  bite  of  the HDB cherry.  I was  told  that  the

number  of  Muslims who went on Haj, for example,  during

property prices boom time, showed a direct correlation to

sales in HDB flats.  But, unfortunately, no more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many of those who upgraded, while hoping to

sell  again  later, are now caught.  If  they  are  among

those retrenched or unemployed, their problems get worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of affordability of public housing

arises  in  the context of new flat prices, retrenchment,

the  passing  of  the  high wage  policy  and,  possibly,

reduced CPF contributions.  The question now is:  is  HDB

housing  still affordable?  How would MND  and  HDB  keep

public  housing  affordable, especially when  they  would

want to keep housing of first-world quality?

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Madam, the

new  HDB loan financing policy took effect on 1st January

this year.  The banks have reassured us that it will  not

be too quick to repossess the flats of borrowers who have

defaulted payment.  I am glad to note this and I hope  we

will  not face the problem later on.  While the issue  of

repossession  may  be  far  fetched,  other  issues   are

beginning to emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to discuss the plight of two

groups  of  people who may face difficulty with  the  new

financing policy.  One, is the failure to obtain loan  by

those  with  poor  credit standing.  The  banks  are  not

likely  to extend the loan to those who were assessed  to

have poor

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

credit  standing.   There are about  15,000  undischarged

bankrupts  as at September 2002, and thousands  more  are

waiting at the doorsteps of the High Court to be declared

bankrupt.   Some are trapped with credit card  and  other

bills.  These people will not stand a chance in obtaining

housing  loans from the banks.  Worse, what happens  when

they  cannot afford their current flat any more and  want

to  downgrade to a smaller flat but they are not eligible

for any more concessionary loans from HDB, thus forced to

borrow from the bank?  They are likely to be rejected due

to  their  poor credit worthiness.  What will  happen  to

these  individuals?  They probably cannot  rent  the  HDB

flat  either, as they would have to serve a 30-month ban.

If  they remain in the current flat, they are just  going

to  accumulate  more  arrears with  interest.   They  are

stuck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, they are the products of our own system.

When times were good, we encouraged them to upgrade.   We

are  proud  to  tell  others that  we  have  85%  of  our

population that own their own flats.  But when  they  are

stuck,  what do we do?  I would like to ask the  Minister

to  share  the  Ministry's position with regard  to  such

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group involves those whose composition of

family   nucleus   changes.   Madam,  many   Singaporeans

appreciate the Government's offer of concessionary  rates

to  their  mortgage  loans.  However,  sometimes,  family

circumstances change and render it necessary for families

to  have  to  change  the  names  of  co-lessees  due  to

different circumstances.  Quite unfortunately, when  such

circumstances   arise,  HDB  considers  the   next   loan

negotiated  as  separate  and  renders  the  family   not

qualified  to enjoy concessionary rates any longer.   The

new  policy  forces  them to get "refinancing"  from  the

commercial  banks as it would have been considered  as  a

"market rate" borrower with HDB previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, lay persons often find it difficult to

understand such processes.  How can changing a name of  a

co-lessee mean that their monthly instalments will have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

to  increase?   They  do  not understand  that  they  are

actually  signing a new lease agreement.  HDB will  argue

that  it  is  the  same as selling the current  flat  and

buying  another flat with different people as co-lessees.

Will  HDB consider on a case-by-case basis, depending  on

the    circumstances   of   each   case,   allowing   for

concessionary rates to continue even after the  names  of

co-lessees  were  to change as long as  the  main  lessee

remains?   Madam,  I think the problem is  that  the  two

concessionary  rates are granted to each family  nucleus.

But  the  problem is that the composition of  the  family

nucleus  may  change,  that is,  sometimes  circumstances

force  one  to change course and direction without  one's

own deliberate intention.  Such cases may be rare, but it

does test the flexibility of the system in its place.   I

would  like HDB to relook at this policy in the light  of

such cases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Madam, Dr Maliki has

covered my points.  I withdraw my cut.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng is not speaking. Mr

Othman Haron Eusofe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Madam, recently, the HDB

introduced  an  option  period to  enable  purchasers  of

resale  HDB flats time to reconsider their purchases.   I

would  like to ask how effective this will be, especially

when  some housing agents can impose conditions or manage

the transactions on behalf of the purchasers, giving them

little  room  to  reconsider  their  purchase.   This  is

particularly so for those who are not so well educated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just highlight an example which came to my

MPS which I have written to the HDB to investigate.  This

is  the  case  of a person who is a cleaner earning  some

$800  per month.  She sold her 3-room HDB flat and wanted

to rent a HDB rental flat but was not able to do so.  She

was  in  a  desperate state.  Therefore, when  a  housing

agent approached her, telling her that he could help  her

purchase  her  5-room  flat, she  took  the  bait.   What

happens  is  this.  The agent made her sign a declaration

that  her  income  was something like $2,500  per  month.

Then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

the agent made her sign documents to allow another person

to  be  her  power  of attorney, which means  effectively

taking  the  decision of the purchase  from  her.   As  a

result, she bought a 5-room flat and now she has seen  me

saying that she has difficulty servicing the loan.  I  am

wondering how this case was processed at the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should take steps to inform housing

agents  that they should be careful in the way they  help

in  the  purchase  of  flats  and  we  should  not  allow

unscrupulous housing agents and their associates to  take

advantage  of  poorly  educated  residents  who  can   be

unsuspecting of things.  I hope that HDB will  look  into

this  case  and  see how they can tighten up  the  resale

regulations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Madam, although the

local  residential market has declined over the last  few

years,  rental of premises from private owners  is  still

out  of  reach for many low income families.   The  going

rate  for  a single room in a HDB flat is about $300  per

month.  Families who have low income can hardly afford to

pay  this  kind  of rent and have enough to  sustain  the

household  expenses  of a normal family.   Such  families

naturally  look to HDB and its current stock  of  heavily

subsidised  rental  flats.   To  qualify,  at  least  two

eligible  tenants must come together, their  income  must

not exceed $800 per month and they must not have owned  a

HDB  flat  in the last 2 1/2 years.  However,  there  are

many families out there who fall between the cracks, that

is,  they cannot afford to buy and own a flat for various

reasons and yet do not qualify for a HDB rental flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families that fall within this category requiring

rental  premises are those who have to sell their  flats,

especially in divorce cases and financial hardship cases,

those  who  cannot afford to pay the 20%  cash  lump  sum

downpayment to purchase a flat, those who do not  qualify

for  housing loan from HDB or commercial banks, and those

who  have lost their income and need some temporary  help

to  adjust and sort out their financial commitments.   At

the same time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

I  understand  that HDB plans to scale  down  or  totally

withdraw from providing subsidised rental flats.  HDB has

just  renovated the interior of most of its present stock

of  rental  flats, upgraded them and will be offering  to

sell them to sitting tenants.  This is a one-off exercise

that  will benefit the existing tenants and help them  to

own their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these existing tenants are not, and will not, be

the  only  ones  needing affordable rental  flats.   Many

other families needing such help will emerge from time to

time  as the product of the circumstances at the material

time.  I would like to ask the Minister whether HDB  will

be helping to provide a roof over their heads.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, going by the appeals

I  get from my meet-the-people session, there seems to be

a  rise in the demand for HDB 1- and 2-room rental  flats

from  three groups.  First, the elderly who want to  live

apart  from their children for various reasons, chief  of

which  is  that  they could not get along,  causing  much

unhappiness  within  their family.   Second,  the  single

parents,  especially those who are recently divorced  and

need  a home of their own as their matrimonial flat  will

have  to  be sold.   And third, those hit by the economic

downturn and who have to sell their flats to downgrade to

rental flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, these are urgent cases requiring an

affordable  roof over their heads.  I would also  foresee

that, as more lower-educated men stay single and as  they

age,  they  too will look for rental flats.  As  we  know

from  statistics,  for the men, it is the  lower-educated

above  40  who make up the majority of men who are  still

single  and  who  are likely to remain single.   But  HDB

policy  for  rental flats is presently quite strict.   To

qualify  for  a  rental flat, the total household  income

must not exceed $800, and those who have sold their flats

in  the open market will be debarred from renting  a  HDB

flat  for  30  months from the date of the  sale.   Also,

there needs to be a family nucleus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that HDB exercises flexibility on a case-by-case basis, and I am grateful

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

for  the  occasional positive responses from  HDB  to  my

appeals, on behalf of my residents.  But I do think  that

there  is  a  case for reviewing the criteria, especially

the income ceiling which is presently I think too low.  I

would  suggest raising it to at least $1,000  to  capture

those,  as  my colleague Mr Ong Kian Min said,  who  fall

between the cracks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trends I cited stem from social problems, for

example, marriage break-ups or family problems, but  they

are  often  not  in the control of those  affected.   For

instance,  it  is no good telling the divorcee  that  she

should  have stayed married, or telling those hit by  the

recession  that they should not have bought  such  a  big

flat  in  the first place.  They need solutions to  their

housing problems.  The more readily the rental flats  are

available, the more it would help them.  We do not want a

society  where Singaporeans, especially those who  cannot

afford it, need to have their cash tied up with property,

leaving nothing for their old age.  If they want to  live

prudently  and if that means living in rental  flats,  we

should give them that option more easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge MND to review the criteria, especially

the  income  ceiling.  Also, can the Minister review  the

situation  of  rental flats to see if  there  are  enough

flats to meet the demand?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the Singapore Government has been very successful

in  implementing its "Home for Everyone"  policy.   There

are  now about 85% Singaporeans who own their own  flats.

However, I observe that there are still many flats in the

western  part  of  Singapore which are unoccupied.   They

have been completed but for more than two years, they are

still not being occupied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the HDB should make some good use of these

flats  by  renting  them  out to  those  who  need  these

apartments,  particularly those who  have  to  move  from

other parts of Singapore to the west in order to be  near

to  their work place.  This would make it more convenient

for them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fresh university graduates and young couples

have just joined the labour market. They cannot afford to

buy  their own flats because they have not enough CPF  to

meet  the downpayment.  Why should we force them  to  buy

the  flats?   Why  can  we  not have  more  rental  flats

available  to them near their places of work?   They  can

rent  the  flats from HDB and it would be convenient  for

them  to go to work.  If they were to buy a flat  in  one

part of Singapore and later on find a job in another part

of  the island, they would have to either sell their flat

and  buy another one nearby, or to pay through their nose

to rent an apartment from a private landlord.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, HDB has succeeded in providing some 85%

of  our citizens with their own flats, a record which  is

not achieved by any other country in the world.  In other

countries,  the  majority of their citizens  are  renting

their  accommodation.   Having already  achieved  such  a

remarkable  record, we should not insist that our  people

buy  their own flats.  If a worker lives in Tampines  and

works in Jurong, why can we not allow him to rent a  flat

in  Jurong?   Next  time, if his  work  is  relocated  to

Woodlands, he can give up the tenancy in Jurong and  rent

a flat in Woodlands. He does not need to sell one flat to

buy  another one, and then sell the second flat to buy  a

third one, just to be near his place of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many of my colleagues would agree with me

that  we  should raise the income ceiling for the  rental

flats.   I  think  the current ceiling  of  $800  is  not

realistic.   Imagine a worker earning  $1,000  gets  only

$800 take-home pay which is hardly enough to support  his

family, yet he is not qualified to rent a flat from  HDB.

I  suggest  that the Government should review  this.   We

have  already  been  successful  in  our  home  ownership

scheme.  It is time for us to build more rental flats  so

that the young couples would benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, current HDB rules allow

only households with income of not more than $800 a month

-  which  I  think is roughly the bottom  10%  or  so  of

households  - to rent flats from it.  For the segment  of

the population just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

above that level, the next cheapest option for them would

be to buy an entry level 4-room HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the proportion of average monthly

household   income,   including   the   employer's    CPF

contribution,  spent servicing a typical 4-room  mortgage

for  this segment can be large, ranging somewhere between

15%  and  34% by one estimate.  This results in pressure,

not  only felt by the worker, but also in his expectation

on nominal wages that he would seek from his company.  It

also  raises  the  reservation wage for those  unemployed

within this group.  Yet, as we know, the global wage  for

persons in this group would be low.  Therefore, this is a

cost  issue that we should help address in order  to  aid

the process of tackling structural unemployment.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from help with housing purchase subsidies, the

option of providing affordable rental public housing  for

a  larger  segment of the lower middle income  population

should   also   be  considered.   Besides  reducing   the

household   expenditure  for  this  segment   and   while

acknowledging  the  importance  of  the  home   ownership

programme,  it is beneficial, in my view,  to  allow  for

greater  flexibility  at  the lower  middle  end  of  the

market,  in  view  of  a more uncertain  future  economic

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To execute such a move, related administrative

policies defining eligibility for housing rental, such as

the  $800  income  ceiling, various  forms  of  debarment

rules,  as  well  as assistance that can  be  offered  in

facilitating  these kinds of moves and  transfers,  would

have  got  to be reviewed.  I hope that MND can  consider

these suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, HDB rental

flats have always been seen as a haven for our low income

families.  They are meant for those deserving,  and  thus

HDB  has  set out clear and stiff rules that  govern  the

operations that allow people to rent HDB flats.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of my colleagues before me, I would like

to  highlight one of the groups that is affected  by  the

current policy, ie, the plight of the single parents with

their  children.   Often  times,  these  are  the  single

mothers and their children who are affected.  Because  of

the  30-month debarment period, they have little  option;

often  times,  the woman is left with her  children  with

nowhere to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen several cases of my residents who live

like  nomads, moving from one relative's home to another,

sometimes squatting at friends' homes and, after a while,

they  would have just exhausted their options of informal

support  providers.  In fact, I just saw  one  last  week

when  I was doing my block visit.  She has three children

and  she has been moving from one place to another, often

relying on the sympathies of others.  The impact  on  the

children  is  negative and undesirable.  The irregularity

and instability will affect their development.  Can we be

more  sympathetic  to  the  plight  of  such  women   and

children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all know that they receive little or no

maintenance from their ex-husbands.  Because of the  lack

of  education and skills, they face difficulty in looking

for jobs and, even if they have jobs, these jobs pay very

little.   Certainly,  they will qualify  for  the  rental

flats based on their income.  But they are stuck, due  to

the 30-month debarment period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate HDB's response. It does not want

to  encourage  people  to abuse the  system  as  it  will

encourage  people  to see divorce as an  easy  option  as

housing  is readily available after that.  This  argument

will stand only if people's sole motivation to divorce is

to enable them to rent a flat.  Madam, divorce is complex

and  does  not happen overnight.  Social workers,  family

and marital therapists will tell us that sometimes it  is

better for an acrimonious couple to separate than to live

together.   While  we  want to strengthen  our  families,

sometimes  couples  are better off divorced.   I  do  not

think that making the rental policy more flexible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

to accommodate the single mothers and their children will

lead  to  higher divorce rates.  Certainly,  reasons  for

divorce  vary.   I am asking for some flexibility  to  be

exercised for the genuine cases who do not have any means

of purchasing their own flats.  The open rental market is

just  too  expensive for them.  Let us  do  a  little  to

lighten  the  burden of these families,  to  allow  their

children to experience some stability in their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure HDB will also say that the number of

rental flats is limited and that there is already a  long

waiting list.  As of March 2002, I understand that  there

were  more than 55,000 rental flats, most of which are  1

to  3  rooms.  This is not a small number.   One  of  the

criteria,  as  mentioned previously, is the  $800  income

ceiling.   Since rental flats are heavily  subsidised,  I

would like to find out what proportion of the tenants are

those  who really deserve these rental flats.  There  are

those  who earn less than $800 per month.  They may  have

qualified  initially,  but their  economic  circumstances

have  improved over the years and they are still  staying

in those rental flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does HDB check their incomes regularly and determine

if  they are still suitable tenants of the rental  flats?

If  the  supply  of  rental flats is considered  limited,

perhaps  HDB should do regular monitoring of  the  income

levels  of  its  tenants to ensure that  only  those  who

really are low income families are allowed to rent flats,

because  of the heavy subsidies, and encourage those  who

can  afford  to actually purchase their own  flats,  thus

freeing the flats for more deserving residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, there were five

speakers  on  rental  flats.  They have  raised  all  the

points  which I wanted to raise.  So I will join them  to

ask the Minister to review the criteria for rental flats,

especially  the  income ceiling,  and  also  to  ask  the

Minister   to  consider  providing  more  rental   flats,

especially bigger rental flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan:</b> Madam, I do agree with what Mr

Othman said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

Otherwise, I would be doing something totally unique.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do support all the other speakers. The number of

speakers  indicates the criticality and severity  of  the

problem on the ground.  I hope that the Minister, who has

rejected  it  earlier  on,  will  reconsider  again   the

eligibility  criteria and having more  rental  flats.   I

also  wish that he would give more flexibility  to  those

who still want to own their homes but have difficulty  in

paying.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Madam, I thank all the Members who have spoken on

the  topics under this cut.  Members have raised  a  very

broad  range  of  issues on HDB, and  many  of  them,  in

particular, have spoken on the restructuring of  HDB  and

its role thereafter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me, first of all, respond to their

concerns  about  the  role of HDB and the  restructuring.

Last  year,  during  the Committee of  Supply  debate,  I

announced  that, as part of our review of the  roles  and

functions of HDB, we were looking into the feasibility of

corporatising  HDB's  Building and  Development  Division

(BDD).   Last  month,  I  announced  our  plans  for  the

restructuring  of HDB, ie, from 1st July this  year,  BDD

will  be  reorganised and a new company to be called  HDB

Corporation Pte Ltd (HDB Corp) will be set up.  HDB  will

focus on its role as the public housing authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a major change for the organisation. The HDB

was  set  up in 1960 to tackle the acute housing shortage

facing  Singapore  at  that  time.   There  was  a   very

interesting  piece in yesterday's Sunday Times  by  Susan

Long,  entitled  "The HDB Story".  It was  a  fascinating

story  of HDB's early days as told by its first Chairman,

Mr Lim Kim San.  As Mr Lim recalled:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, when the HDB first came into being,

only  9%  of  Singaporeans lived in  low-cost  Government

housing.   The  rest subsisted in overcrowded  slums  and

squatter  colonies which were breeding grounds for  crime

and gangsterism."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this was not too long ago - in fact,

certainly within living memory - and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

I  am  sure  many  Members of this House would  have  had

personal experience of such conditions.  I myself  recall

at  various  times of my childhood sharing  a  room  with

eight  or  nine  others in a shophouse in  Bugis  Street,

later  on  in  an attap hut in Lorong Ah Soo  in  Hougang

without   running  water  or  electricity  and,  finally,

growing  up  in an SIT flat in Kim Keat Avenue.   By  the

way, all these three places have disappeared, replaced by

a  shopping  centre  in  the case  of  the  Bugis  Street

shophouse, and by new HDB flats in the other two cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the challenges faced by HDB were formidable

ones.  It had to build thousands of flats in record time.

It  had to acquire land for housing estates, making  many

landowners  very,  very upset.  In fact,  some  of  these

landowners were PAP supporters.  But, despite their loss,

many  of  them today still remain loyal to the  PAP.   It

also  had  to  resettle  people  from  squatter  huts  in

kampongs to high-rise flats.  Again, in this article,  Mr

Lim was quoted as saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When HDB first relocated 80 squatter families along

Kim  Seng  Road to brand-new flats in nearby  Queenstown,

more  than half of them moved back to their squatter huts

in  less  than six months because they were not  used  to

living in high-rise apartments."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Mr Lim, HDB overcame the

odds  and  succeeded in breaking the back of the  housing

problem.   The Senior Minister, then Prime Minister,  who

appointed  Mr  Lim as Chairman of HDB in 1960,  paid  him

this tribute:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was crucial, life and death. If we failed, we

would  not  be  re-elected.  This was the first  year  of

office of the PAP."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it was as much a tribute to Mr Lim as it was

to the many men and women who worked in HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, over time, HDB housing became more widely

accepted.   For the first time, many Singaporeans  became

proud  home  owners.  Older MPs recalled how  they  would

officiate  at  ballotting  exercises  for  allocation  of

flats,  and  residents who were successful in the  ballot

thanked them profusely for their good fortune.  With home

ownership, people began to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

a  tangible stake in this country.  Today, almost nine in

<br><br>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are HDB dwellers.  Almost all of them own

their own flats.  These are not tiny flats either.  If we

compare  the flats in Singapore with those in, say,  Hong

Kong  or  even in Tokyo or Seoul, our flats are luxurious

by  comparison.   Each  Singaporean  has  about,  on  the

average,  20-25 square metres of living space.   This  is

double what a resident would enjoy in Tokyo or Seoul,  or

three  times what a public housing resident would  enjoy,

say, in Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of HDB towns has also won international

recognition.   Among the many awards, I  am  particularly

proud  obviously because Tampines Town was conferred  the

UN World Habitat Award in 1991, and this was against very

strong competition from places like Vancouver and Boston.

We  received many, many foreign dignitaries.  They  visit

us,  our  housing estates and the HDB.   They  come  from

China,  India,  Mauritius,  Mozambique,  Pakistan,  South

Africa and the UK.  Without exception, they have all been

impressed by our public housing achievements.  By housing

the   large  majority  of  Singaporeans  in  quality  and

affordable  flats, HDB has contributed  significantly  to

our nation-building efforts.

Madam, Members may well ask: if that is the case, why are

we  tinkering with something that is not only not  broken

but  has  been extremely successful in what it  does?   I

think  this  is a valid question.  Let me assure  Members

that  this  decision to restructure  HDB  was  not  taken

lightly.   The fact of the matter is that the  world  has

changed,  and  Singapore  has  changed  with   it.    The

Singapore of today is different from the Singapore of the

60s,  70s,  80s or even the 90s.  Inevitably,  this  must

affect our public housing programme in many ways.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see three reasons why the HDB has to change.

Firstly, economic reasons.  We have seen dramatic  shifts

in the demand for public housing over the last 5-10

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

years.   For  example, in April 1997, at  its  peak,  the

waiting  list  for  HDB flats under the Registration  for

Flat  System (RFS) was 146,000.  About half of them  were

first-timers.  In January 2002, slightly over a year ago,

the  waiting list fell to 12,000, slightly less than 10%.

In  1997, HDB was building more than 13,000 flats a year.

Last year, its building programme was zero.  HDB did  not

build  any  flats  as it focused on clearing  the  excess

stock.   No  organisation which  faces  such  changes  in

demand  can say that it does not want to change, that  it

can  afford  to  stay the same.  The  volatility  in  the

demand  makes  it  difficult  for  any  organisation   or

developer, including HDB, to manage its staffing  or  its

resources properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this drop in demand temporary, one might ask. I

do  not think so.  The demand from first-timers is likely

to  remain  fairly constant, in tandem with the household

formation  rate.   But  the days of  hectic  churning,  I

believe, are over.  The demand from second-timers is  not

likely  to return to the levels of the mid-90s.  This  is

due  mainly  to the various policy changes that  we  have

introduced.  These include revisions to the  resale  levy

and  also the imposition of that 10-year time bar  before

households  can  apply for their second subsidised  flat.

Today,  the property market is more stable, generally  in

line  with economic growth.  And with the switch  to  the

Build-to-Order system which I will elaborate later on  in

my speech, it can be more responsive to certain shifts in

demand from HDB flat buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I believe HDB has to change is

because  of  social reasons.  As Members are well  aware,

HDB  is  already  housing 85% of Singaporeans.   We  have

already far exceeded what we first set out to do when HDB

was  formed in 1960.  Can we do more? Should we  aim  to,

say,  house  90-95% of the population in public  housing?

Such a target is not realistic.  We must expect that,  as

our  population  becomes better educated and  as  incomes

rise,  most Singaporeans will aspire to private  housing.

In  terms  of  housing  stock today,  the  public-private

housing  mix  has fallen from about 86%:14%  in  1990  to

about 81%:19% today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

It  could  fall even further to 75%:25% in the medium  to

long-term.   Even  for public housing, it  is  timely  to

consider  how  we  can allow the private  sector  greater

participation, provide more choices for HDB flat buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, political reasons. As our economy and society

mature,  we need to encourage entrepreneurship and  risk-taking.  We  need  to promote greater  self-reliance  and

responsibility  among those who can fend for  themselves.

This brings me to the third main reason for change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public housing is a significant part of the

Government's social safety net to provide a roof over our

people's   heads.   We  should  ask  ourselves,  however,

whether  we  have  created  too  big  a  safety  net  and

inadvertently encouraged a dependency mindset amongst our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get worried when I come across cases, either at my

own  meet-the-people  sessions or when  other  MPs  bring

their cases to me, of elderly parents who are thrown  out

of  their homes by their children and told to go and look

for  HDB to solve their problem.  It is not because  that

there is not enough space in their flats.  In some cases,

the  children  are  staying  in  4-  or  5-room  or  even

Executive  flats.  There are some in financial difficulty

who can help themselves but, again, insist that HDB break

the  rules for them. Then, there are those who expect and

demand  HDB  to  repair the spalling  concrete  in  their

flats,  even though their flats are 20 years  old.   When

ceilings  leak after 10 years, flat lessees  insist  that

HDB fix it free-of-charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall a resident who bought a flat from the

resale market and then demanded that HDB rectify all  the

defects  in his flat, even though they were due  to  wear

and  tear.  I read the letter twice to make sure  that  I

had  got  it  correct.  He had actually bought  a  resale

flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, HDB has developed a culture of

compassion and concern and it instinctively seeks to help

its  residents whenever it is required to do so.  Members

of this House have acknowledged this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

Last  year, Mr Ahmad Khalis told this House, and I quote,

"We have the HDB bending backwards, sideways, forward, in

all directions, to help accommodate the awkward positions

that the HDB flat owner is in".  Even Mr Low Thia Khiang,

in   one   of   his   questions  during  Question   Time,

acknowledged  that HDB does, on compassion grounds,  help

residents who are in financial difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that every MP's appeal is

successful.   Indeed, I still remember Ms Indranee  Rajah

telling this House that it is easier for a camel to  pass

through the eye of a needle than it is for her appeals to

succeed.  The truth is somewhere in between. The issue is

how  to  distinguish between the genuine appeals and  the

not-so-genuine.  HDB will continue to hone its  instincts

in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must ask ourselves: is it healthy to have a

safety net that catches everyone regardless of need?  Can

we  afford  this  in future when increasing  demands  are

placed on our resources by an aging population? What does

it do to our drive for self-reliance and risk-taking?  We

need  to change this mindset among Singaporeans.  It will

take  time,  but  we  must  start  somewhere.   It  is  a

fundamental part of our remaking of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to provide a public

housing social safety net. We will help Singaporeans  own

their  first home.  We will make sure that it is  a  good

home,  a quality home. We will make it worth their  while

to  upgrade to new homes, or else, we will upgrade  their

homes for them.  But this safety net should be refined at

the edges to focus on those who are in genuine need.  For

those  who can look after themselves, they must start  to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the restructuring of HDB.

Going  forward, we need to make HDB more focused  on  its

core  functions and also make it more flexible in meeting

the  changing housing needs of our people.  The HDB still

has  a  major role to play in planning and executing  our

home  ownership policies.  It has to ensure  that  public

housing subsidies are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

disbursed  equitably.  It has to ensure that quality  and

affordable flats are built, even though it does not build

it  itself.  It has to make sure that leases are properly

administered   and  that  towns  with   good   supporting

amenities  are  planned  and developed  to  meet  demand.

Finally,  it  has  to make sure that  older  estates  are

systematically renewed and revitalised so  that  cohesive

and vibrant communities will continue to evolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, when I announced plans for restructuring HDB

last year, I had two main concerns. First, the quality of

service  must  not  suffer.  If anything,  it  should  be

enhanced.  And second, the morale of the staff  must  not

suffer. The two are inter-related.  The quality of  staff

service will suffer if staff morale is poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered various options in the restructuring

of HDB.  The first option was to do the minimal, to carry

on  with  HDB's present structure but to retrench surplus

staff  in the Building and Development Division (BDD)  to

match  the building programme.  But this option is not  a

long-term solution.  HDB staff will need to be retrenched

each time the building programme slows down. When private

sector  participation in public housing  is  stepped  up,

there will be further retrenchments. There will be a  lot

of uncertainty. Staff will be thoroughly demoralised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option was to corporatise BDD, turn it

into  a  company,  unlock  its value.  BDD  has  talented

people,  with years of experience, whose skills would  be

in demand in many other countries.  It has a track record

that  few  organisations  around  the  world  can  match.

Corporatisation of BDD will allow it to leverage  on  its

strength  and  capitalise  on the  HDB's  brand  name  to

venture  overseas, especially in rapid growing  countries

like  China and India.  We decided on this second option,

ie, to corporatise BDD.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we had to decide how to corporatise BDD.

Again, we had two options,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

two ways of doing it.  One way was for the new entity  to

hire  the  staff on HDB's existing terms and  conditions.

Under  this  option,  staff  joining  BDD  would  not  be

retrenched, they would not get the SRS, but they would be

guaranteed  a  job, with no loss of pay or  seniority  or

other  benefits.  This option would create problems  down

the  road.   The new corporatised entity will be  saddled

with high cost and it would not be nimble and flexible in

reacting to changing housing preferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way was for HDB to offer voluntary early

retirement   to  all  its  staff  through   the   Special

Resignation Scheme (SRS) of the civil service.  Those who

remained,   would   be  redeployed   within   HDB's   new

organisation structure, based on its new role.  Those who

opted  for  SRS  and  decided to join the  new  corporate

entity of BDD, ie, HDB Corp, would do so on new terms and

conditions.  In other words, HDB Corp would start off  on

a  clean  slate.   It  would not  take  over  HDB's  cost

structure.   It would not take over terms and  conditions

of  service that HDB used to offer.  We decided to  adopt

this  method.   This is a more complicated  option,  more

effort  and  time are needed to retrain and  to  redeploy

staff,  but  it  is  a  win-win for  the  staff  and  the

organisation.   It is fair to HDB staff.   It  shows  our

appreciation to them, for their years of service.  It  is

fair  to  HDB  as it allows them to cut cost, streamline,

refocus.  And, finally, it is fair to the new company  as

it  gives  them  and  their staff a  fighting  chance  to

succeed,  with  no guarantee of success, but  with  every

confidence  that  they will succeed.   And,  if  they  do

succeed, they would once again bring value to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has recently been some public discussion on

whether we were actually too generous towards HDB  staff,

especially  those who leave HDB under  the  SRS  and  are

subsequently re-employed.  A few Members have also raised

this.   Let  me explain why I believe these concerns  are

unfounded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB staff are public service officers, with tenures

until retirement.  The SRS

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

recognises  this reasonable expectation of  employees  of

statutory boards and civil servants.  In previous  public

service restructuring exercises, eg, in the case  of  the

hospitals,  all  staff  were given  the  option  to  join

restructured  hospitals on terms that were no  worse  off

than what they were getting.  However, in the case of HDB

Corp  there  is  no guarantee of a job for  all.   Ex-HDB

staff  who are accepted by HDB Corp would be employed  on

fresh terms.  They would be no different from others  who

receive  benefits,  leave HDB and join  another  company.

So,  whether  they  join XYZ or HDB Corp  they  would  be

getting  their retrenchment benefits and then they  would

be  joining the new company, if they agree to those terms

and conditions.  So the offer of SRS is not unreasonable,

nor is it unduly generous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, one of the considerations in

this  exercise  was to maintain the high  morale  of  the

organisation and the high level of service to the  staff.

So we took a decision to keep staff informed, as early as

possible,  as  openly  as  possible,  and  as  fully   as

possible,  to  dispel  any  uncertainty  and  quash   any

unnecessary  rumours.  The CEO met all  8,000  staff,  in

groups  of  500,  16  sessions in  all,  to  explain  the

restructuring  process.   HDB management  worked  closely

with   the   HDB   Staff  Union.   There   were   various

communication channels open to staff to provide feedback.

During the briefings, via direct emails, there was even a

dedicated   staff  hot-line.   A  counsellor   was   made

available for staff who were affected by the changes  and

needed assistance.  As a result of a combination of early

retirement and redeployment, HDB's staff survey indicates

that  there  may  be no need for HDB to retrench  anyone.

Madam, in a major restructuring exercise such as this,  I

believe  this  is  an outcome which both  management  and

staff of HDB would welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the cost of the restructuring of

HDB.   I  am afraid that I am not able at this  point  in

time to give a definitive answer because the exact number

of staff leaving under the SRS would only be confirmed by

the end of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

May, and it is only at that point in time that we will be

able to determine the cost of this exercise.  But, in any

case,  let me make this point.  This cost will eventually

be  recovered through a reduction in HDB's manpower  cost

in subsequent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go on to address some of the other

specific  issues  regarding HDB Corp  that  Members  have

raised.   The  HDB  Corp  will focus  on  four  strategic

business   areas,  namely,  building  and  infrastructure

consultancy work, including architectural and engineering

works   and   project  management;  integrated   township

development; property development and the acquisition and

marketing  of  construction technology  solutions.   Some

MPs,  eg, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Ang Mong Seng, amongst  others,

have  raised the concern that HDB Corp will compete  with

firms in the private sector and take away their business.

I  do not think there is a need for private developers to

be  unduly worried.  In fact, the corporatisation of  BDD

paves  the way for private developers to be more involved

in the development of public housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public housing building programme will be

gradually opened up to the private sector - 10%  in  year

4,  beginning July 2006, 30% in year 5 and 50% in year 6.

HDB  Corp,  through its subsidiary CESMA,  will  only  be

allowed  to  compete with the private sector for  non-HDB

projects in year 5.  The volume of projects in the public

housing  sector is large, compared to the volume  in  the

private  property sector.  So private companies are  more

likely to gain from the outsourcing of HDB projects  than

HDB  Corp would from being allowed to compete locally  in

the  private  sector.  But, in fact, the  more  important

market  for  HDB Corp is not in Singapore, but  overseas.

So HDB Corp's focus will be on the overseas market.  This

phased approach that I mentioned earlier will ensure that

there   is  minimal  disruption  to  the  public  housing

programme in the initial period of liberalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked, for example, whether the pace of

outsourcing  can be accelerated.  My answer  is  that  we

will monitor

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

this outsourcing programme and, if it is going well, I do

not   see  any  reason  why  we  cannot  accelerate   the

programme.  In any case, my Ministry has made it clear to

HDB  Corp  that  there  is no moratorium  and  that  this

outsourcing programme may be varied, depending on  policy

dictates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in the longer term, such a move, I believe,

is   a   big   plus  for  Singaporeans.    With   greater

competition,  it  will  result  in  greater  choice   and

variety,  more  innovation in building  and  design,  and

better value for money for flat buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about private sector

participation  in  the implementation of  estate  renewal

programmes.   The formation of HDB Corp will  not  change

the  level  of private sector involvement in  our  estate

renewal  programmes,  at least  in  the  beginning.   For

example,  for  precincts that are selected for  MUP,  the

adviser  can  continue to choose between HDB  or  private

sector  architects  to  design their  upgrading  package.

But,  over time, as the implementation moves forward,  we

will study how we can outsource more of such works to the

private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked about the value of the

contracts  to be allocated to HDB Corp in the  next  five

years.  Again, I must apologise that I cannot give him  a

specific  answer  because  HDB's  building  plan   really

depends on the actual demand for flats, and the number of

upgrading   projects  is  dependent   on   the   economic

situation.  So, it is difficult, at this point  in  time,

to estimate what that number will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me assure Members that the restructuring

of HDB will be implemented carefully.  I do not want this

to   create  unnecessary  upheaval  on  the  ground,  so,

therefore, this should have minimal impact on the public.

The  new  HDB  Corp  will continue  to  carry  out  HDB's

building  programme  in  the  initial  years.   HDB,  the

statutory  board, will continue to serve  the  public  in

areas   such   as   the   sale  of   flats   that   needs

administration.  We will ensure that the fundamentals  of

public housing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

are  preserved,  and that Singaporeans will  continue  to

enjoy high quality public housing at affordable prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the issue of bank

origination  and the financing of HDB flats.   To  enable

HDB  to  focus  on  its core functions, we  reviewed  and

implemented  the  bank origination  of  HDB  market  rate

loans,  which took effect from 1st January this year.   I

explained to this House last year why we needed to go for

bank  origination.  It is in line with our  move  towards

greater  self-reliance and responsibility on the part  of

individual  flat buyers.  Of course, at  the  same  time,

those  who  take  bank  loans  can  also  expect  greater

flexibility  in the use of their flats.   So  we  relaxed

some  of the rules and regulations regarding the  use  of

their flats.  Flat buyers who take bank loans, of course,

would   be  subject  to  the  bank's  mortgage  financial

policies.  And, that is why I have cautioned flat  buyers

who  are taking bank loans to exercise financial prudence

and to buy a flat within their means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bank origination, the Government is pulling

back  the  safety net a little bit, at the  fringes,  for

those  who  should not need that safety net in the  first

place,  in  other words, the financially better  off,  or

those  who  already own a flat.  At the same  time,  bank

origination  has given HDB flat buyers, who  take  market

rate  loans, greater choice in their mortgage  financing.

They  have  greater flexibility and leeway in the  resale

and  the  use of their flats as we have recently  relaxed

the rules.  So those taking bank loans, for example, will

have  a  shorter  minimum  occupation  period,  one  year

instead  of  two and a half years, before they  can  sell

their flat, and they will also be allowed to sublet their

whole flat after occupying it for ten years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to inform this House that the bank

origination scheme has proceeded smoothly, with banks and

financial  institutions offering attractive  packages  to

flat  buyers  and  lessees.  To-date,  HDB  has  received

nearly  3,000  resale applications and new flat  bookings

with bank loans, and another 2,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

HDB  market rate mortgages out of about 100,000, who have

refinanced their loans with the banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from the banks indicates that many flat

buyers are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude.   They

want  to  see  whether there are better offers  available

before  committing to a flat purchase.  As such, I expect

the volume to pick up as the situation in the loan market

stabilises.   I  would like to assure  Members,  like  Dr

Maliki and Mdm Cynthia Phua, that bank origination of HDB

market  rate  loans does not detract from our  policy  of

providing   subsidised  housing  for  the   majority   of

Singaporeans.   HDB  will continue to provide  subsidised

loans to eligible flat buyers.  Indeed, Members may  wish

to  know  that  this is the bulk of the  loans  that  are

granted for the purchase of HDB flats.  About 60% of  the

mortgage  loans  last year, for example, granted  by  HDB

were concessionary rate loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether the

review of HDB's functions will cover other areas, such as

car  parks,  industrial properties, commercial properties

and so on.  Madam, this restructuring exercise is a major

milestone in HDB's history.  We do not expect to make any

more  changes  of this nature.  But HDB cannot  remain  a

static  organisation.  We will continue to  review  HDB's

rules, its role and functions as circumstances change.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give Members an idea of the review that is

ongoing,  take  the branch office, for  example.   Branch

offices  play a very important role on the ground.   They

coordinate between residents, Members of Parliament,  the

Ministry  and HDB.  We recognise the value that they  add

on  the ground, and this is the reason why the operations

and   functions  of  the  branch  office  are  constantly

reviewed in order to improve the level of service to  HDB

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB carparks are planned and built to serve HDB

residents.  They are heavily

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

subsidised  and,  currently,  there  are  no   plans   to

corporatise HDB's carparks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now move on to the sale of HDB flats.

As  I  have mentioned earlier in my response, the  demand

for  HDB  flats is volatile.  In 1997, there were 146,000

on  the  waiting list.  The waiting time  for  new  flats

could be four or even five years.  Last year, we had  the

reverse  situation.  There was an overhang of unsold  HDB

flats, and we had to implement a walk-in selection scheme

where  people could just walk in and buy a flat  off  the

shelf.   There  is an overhang which we are now  steadily

clearing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queuing system has worked well. When demand was

high,  it  provided applicants with greater certainty  in

applying  for  new  homes.  But it was  not  sufficiently

responsive to sudden shifts in demand.  So, we  have  now

switched from the RFS to Build-to-Order (BTO) system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTO system better matches the flat supply to

buyers'  needs and preferences in terms of the  location,

the  flat type and the design. Under this system, the HDB

will  call  tender for construction only if a  sufficient

number of flats have been booked.  If the take-up is  too

low,  HDB will not award the contract.  Instead, it  will

redesign   the  contract  according  to  the  needs   and

preferences  of applicants.  And, if necessary,  it  will

also  make  adjustments to the flat mix.  Dr Teo  Ho  Pin

asked, for example, whether HDB can consider providing  a

better  mix  of  flats for each BTO project,  eg,  5-room

flats, studio apartments and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more recent BTO offer in December last year,

we  only offered 4-room flats, because that was where the

demand was.  We still have an excess supply of 5-room and

larger flats.  But once the supply and the demand of  HDB

flats  have  reached a steady state,  we  will  certainly

consider offering other flat types, such as 5-room  flats

under  the  BTO.   As  for  studio  apartments,  HDB  has

recently announced that it will pilot the integration  of

studio  apartments with other flat types in a  few  sites

where there is a high proportion of the elderly.  So,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

we   can   also   similarly  consider  including   studio

apartments in BTO projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether HDB can sell surplus

SERS replacement flats more quickly.  Let me explain that

SERS  replacement  flats  are  still  needed  to  rehouse

affected lessees from other SERS sites.   Nevertheless, I

would  like  to  assure her that HDB will  release  these

surplus units for sale as soon as it is practical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua has also asked whether we can sell flats on

a   daily  basis.   I  will  ask  HDB  to  consider  this

suggestion.  She asked whether we can sell flats  without

subsidies  -  sell all the surplus flats, put them on the

market at market price.   Is that correct?  Was that what

she said?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am not so sure whether the private

sector  developers are going to be very happy  with  this

suggestion.   But,  in  any  case,  I  am  positive   and

confident that the surplus flats that we are seeing today

-   the  huge overhang that we had, say,  two years  ago,

which has been slowly whittled down  -  will be sold  off

in  time.  We now have slightly less than half the number

of flats left from the time when we first started, and  I

am  sure  that, over time, in the next two years  or  so,

such  flats will be sold.  So, I do not think Mdm  Phua's

suggestion is a tenable one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the resale levy, Dr Teo asked if we could waive

the  resale levy for various categories of flat  lessees,

eg,  those who sold their flat below the purchase  price.

Let  me explain why we have the resale levy  in the first

place.   When  second timers sell their first  subsidised

flat, they would have cashed in on the subsidy that  they

enjoyed  on  their first flat.  So, they are required  to

pay  a levy on the selling price of their first flat, but

only  if they purchase a second subsidised flat from HDB.

This  is  specifically meant to dampen  the  demand  from

second  timers.  If Members recall, before this levy  was

in  place,  lessees would sell off their first  flat  and

queue up for the second flat, without any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

penalty.  And why not?  Flat prices were going up.   They

could  cash  out and enjoy themselves and do many  things

with  the money, including, as Mr Zainul Abidin said,  go

on  haj.   But we need to ensure that housing  subsidies,

which  are not unlimited, are fairly distributed  between

first  timers and second timers.  Obviously, we  have  to

favour  the first timers, because they have more pressing

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic circumstances have changed. We do not see

huge  amounts of money being made from the  sale  of  the

first flat, as in the halcyon days of the early 90s,  but

the  resale  levy  is still necessary to  ensure  a  fair

allocation  of  subsidies.  Yes,  there  are  lessees  of

smaller  flats who have a need to upgrade.  That  is  the

reason  why  we calibrate the resale levy rate,  so  that

those  who  upgrade from smaller flats - the 3-roomers  - actually  pay  a smaller resale levy.  In this  way,  the

subsidy  from  the second flat that they enjoy  is  still

attractive compared to the resale levy they have to  pay,

and that is the reason why quite a lot of 3-roomers still

return to HDB for a second subsidised flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those who are in financial difficulties

or need to downgrade to smaller flats?  They can use part

of  their  sales proceeds to finance the  purchase  of  a

second  subsidised  flat.  Alternatively,  they  can  use

their  sales proceeds to purchase a smaller flat  in  the

resale market so that they do not have to pay the levy at

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Members may not be aware that we operate a much

more generous system compared to, say, in Hong Kong.   In

Hong  Kong, flat owners are eligible for only one housing

subsidy,  the  first flat.  There is  no  second  housing

subsidy.   In  addition,  when  they  sell  their   first

subsidised flat in the open market, they have  to  pay  a

levy  straightaway.   The government  creams  back  their

housing subsidy once they sell their flats.  There is  no

deferred payment, and there is no second subsidy.  In our

case, flat owners who do not purchase a second subsidised

flat need not pay the resale levy, and they can keep  the

full amount of subsidy realised from their first flat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the many requests for

rental  flats.  Many Members have asked whether, as  part

of  the  public  housing review, we  should  revisit  our

policy  towards  home  ownership  vis-a-vis  rental,  and

perhaps  allow a larger rental class to avoid  tying  too

much of Singaporeans' money on property assets  -  Dr Amy

Khor, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr Ong Kian Min, Ms Irene Ng  and

many others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have questioned whether HDB flats are

still  affordable  in the current economic  downturn  and

whether  we  should  relax  our rental  flat  eligibility

criteria, so that more can benefit from subsidised rental

housing.  The end result of both requests is the same   - more  rental  flats.  But I think there are two  separate

issues  here.  The first is a philosophical one,  whether

home ownership or rental.  The second is whether there is

enough  housing assistance for those who are affected  by

the economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the first issue - the philosophy of

home  ownership.  Public housing in  Singapore  comprises

both  home ownership flats and rental flats.  But as home

ownership is a key objective, we have deliberately priced

our new flats such that 90% of Singaporean households can

afford  their own homes.  This policy has been a  success

so  that,  today, 85% of Singaporeans stay in HDB  flats,

and  95%  own  their homes.  Should we  now  deliberately

restructure our public housing subsidy so that  a  higher

proportion live in subsidised rental housing permanently?

Have  we really built too many home ownership flats?   To

me,  public  housing  in  Singapore  is  more  than  just

providing  a  roof  over  people's  heads.   It  plays  a

critical social role in promoting rootedness and a  sense

of belonging among Singaporeans.  To own a home is to own

a   part   of   Singapore.   It  makes  Singapore   worth

contributing to and worth defending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government remains committed to home ownership,

notwithstanding  the restructuring of HDB  or  any  other

policy changes, such as bank origination, etc.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

Social cohesion is critical, especially for a young small

country  like ours.  Giving Singaporeans a stake  in  the

nation  through home ownership is the bedrock upon  which

we  have achieved social stability and engendered a sense

of community and belonging to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for low-income families, HDB has several

schemes  to assist them to buy their flats.  We have  the

Special  Housing Assistance Programme, the Sale of  Flats

to  Sitting Tenants Scheme, the Rent and Purchase  Scheme

for  3-room  flats and so on and so forth.  Why?   It  is

important that we keep this dream of home ownership alive

for  as  many Singaporeans as possible, especially  lower

income  Singaporeans.  By giving them a helping  hand  to

own  their  homes, we give them a stake in Singapore  now

and  in the future.  And as our society develops, as  our

economy restructures and as income disparity widens, this

becomes  even  more crucial in order to  maintain  social

stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I recognise that there will always

be  room for rental.  For some, rental is the better  and

probably  the only option.  Here, I would like to  assure

Mr  Ong  Kian  Min that HDB does not intend to  stop  its

rental flats scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the monthly household income ceiling for

subsidised HDB rental flats is $800.  Most of the lessees

in  rental  flats  are in 1- or 2-room flats.   And  some

Members  have asked whether we can relax this eligibility

criterion.   At  $800,  we  are talking  about  the  12th

household  income  percentile   -   the  bottom  12%   of

Singaporeans.   Yes, we will study whether  this  current

income  cut-off  is still relevant today  or  whether  it

should be raised.  But even while we are doing the study,

let  me assure Members that we are always mindful of  the

fact  that there will always be some people who will fall

in  between the gaps.  And for such cases, HDB  will  see

how  it  can help on a case-by-case basis.  But we should

be  careful  not  to  make subsidised rental  housing  so

comfortable  that  people are quite happy  to  remain  in

these   flats  even  when  they  no  longer   need   such

assistance.   If you go to Hong Kong, for  example,  they

will tell you and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

show  you many middle to higher income families who  stay

in  subsidised  rental housing throughout their  lives  - very  comfortable rental housing, no intention of  moving

out, whatsoever.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, some Members have questioned whether the HDB

flats  are  still  affordable,  especially  during   this

current  economic downturn.  Let me assure them  that  it

is, and will continue to remain so.  Last year, those who

bought  4-  and  5-room flats of HDB needed  to  use,  on

average,   around  18%  of  their  total  gross   monthly

household  income  which includes their  CPF  to  service

their mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How mentioned just now a figure as high

as  34%.  I am not too sure where the figure comes  from.

But  it may be interesting for me to have some indication

from  Mr  Heng  so that we will be able to  verify  those

figures.  But what HDB tells me is that, on average,  18%

of  the monthly household income is being used to service

the  mortgage  which  is certainly well  within  the  40%

guideline  which most financial institutions  used  as  a

tool of credit assessment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give some specific numbers. For a 3-room

buy-back  flat which HDB offers, a family would  need  to

spend less than $300 on the mortgage instalment.  And for

those who opt for cheaper flats, they will pay less  than

$200 per month.  Notwithstanding this, there may be those

who  wish to rent temporarily, like what Mr Ong  Ah  Heng

has  described  -  newly-married  couples,  young  mobile

workers, and so on.  They want to rent before they buy  a

flat,  or they want to rent one nearer to their place  of

work,  or whatever.  I suggest that they can do so,  even

today,  by  renting  from  the  open  market.   This   is

something  that the Government can and will  continue  to

facilitate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already taken the first step by relaxing the

subletting  rules.   First of all, a few  years  ago,  we

allowed elderly lessees

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

to   sublet   their  whole  flat,  subject   to   certain

conditions.  We can relook at those conditions,  if  need

be.   We  have  relaxed the subletting  rules  since  1st

January  this  year  for  lessees of  non-subsidised  HDB

flats,  who are taking bank loans and who have not  taken

any  loans  from HDB.  This will increase the  supply  of

rental flats in the market and, if need be, we can relook

at the rules and relax them even further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you take all these schemes into consideration,

inclusive  of  flats that are sublet  under  the  elderly

scheme   and  those  under  special  circumstances,   for

example,  those  who are overseas, there  are  more  than

30,000  HDB flats that can be sublet.  So I believe  that

there  are  sufficient HDB flats available for rental  on

the open market.   Of course, as I said, we will continue

to  monitor and, if necessary, we can liberalise further.

But  we have to do this consciously and gradually because

we  do  not  want to disrupt the rental market  or  cause

disamenities for other residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to those households which are in

financial  difficulties due to the economic downturn.   I

think  many Members have spoken about this and have  made

appeals  on  their behalf.  We all know that  HDB  has  a

comprehensive  package of financial assistance  measures,

whether   it   is  reduced  mortgage,  loan  instalments,

extension  of  loan repayment periods, etc.   Yes,  there

will still be those who are in financial difficulties and

may  have  no choice but to sell their flats.  There  are

rules  which have been formulated to make sure that there

is  no  abuse  of the system, for example,  the  30-month

debarment  rule.  When you sell your flat,  you  are  not

eligible to come back to HDB to either rent a flat or  to

buy  another flat for 30 months.  As I said, this  is  to

minimise abuse of the system, generally speaking.  But  I

assure Members that for those in genuine difficulty,  HDB

is  prepared to consider waiving this 30-month  debarment

rule on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Dr Maliki asked specifically about the

treatment  of single parent families.  As he  knows,  the

Government's  public  housing  policy  is  pro-family  in

orientation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

We  do not want to inadvertently encourage divorce.   But

as  he  says, there are many reasons why people  divorce.

So  for  those  who are divorced, or who  are  separated,

again,  I say that HDB will consider waiving the 30-month

time  bar  if divorced or separated parents meet  certain

eligibility  conditions, such as custody of a  child  and

other eligibility conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Madam, Mr Othman asked about the newly

introduced  option to purchase scheme.  He asked  whether

it can prevent buyers of resale flats from being cheated.

It  goes  without saying that we would like  to  see  all

buyers and sellers adequately protected.  There have been

many reviews of the resale procedures by HDB to make sure

that  they  are more simplified and people  are  able  to

understand  them.   But the latest introduction  of  this

option  to purchase by HDB replaces the current sale  and

purchase  agreement because HDB has discovered that  many

times, people make purchases and want to opt out, or want

to cancel the purchases because of one reason or another.

So this option to purchase provides buyers with an option

period  during  which they can reconsider  the  purchase,

they  can verify various aspects of the purchase and,  if

they  change  their  minds, they can  withdraw  from  the

purchase with minimal financial loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman mentioned a case where one of his

constituents was cheated.  I will ask HDB to  investigate

this case, check the information, check the documentation

provided by the buyers and the sellers and, if necessary,

we will follow up with the relevant authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have reviewed the role of HDB. We have

implemented major changes in our public housing  policies

over  the past year.  I have explained why these  changes

are necessary.  I also assured the House that there is no

change  to  our  commitment to public  housing,  to  home

ownership  and  the provision of quality  and  affordable

housing.   We  will constantly review to do  whatever  is

necessary to ensure that our public housing policies  and

programmes  remain relevant to the needs of  our  country

and our people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, just a quick clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Madam, can I get

a  clarification  from the Minister with  regard  to  HDB

Corp?   Does  HDB Corp take the place of HDB in  building

public  housing?   Does  HDB Corp  operate  only  like  a

private company?  And if it does, can the HDB Corp  still

sell public housing at a subsidised rate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Madam, the answer to both of Mr

Chiam's questions is yes.  It will take over the building

of  public  housing  and it will  operate  as  a  private

company.   As far as subsidies are concerned, that  is  a

separate   matter,   and   the   management    and    the

administration  of public housing subsidies  will  remain

with  the  statutory board, the public housing  authority

called HDB.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Madam, upgrading,

in the form of interim upgrading, main upgrading and lift

upgrading,  has  changed many of  the  HDB  estates  into

somewhat   like  condominium  style  living  environment.

Those  who  benefited  in the early batches  enjoyed  the

fruits  of  these upgrading exercises.  But,  today,  the

situation has changed because of the economy and  changed

situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some upgrading exercises, especially the major

upgrading  programmes, no longer appear  that  attractive

because the Government is providing less money for  these

upgrading programmes and payment for flats has  become  a

very heavy commitment for many of the flat dwellers.   In

the  past, when times were good and there was no  history

of upgrading to learn from, I believe there were excesses

in   our   upgrading  programme.   We   built   elaborate

entrances,  signages, walkways and pillars.  So  we  have

made mistakes, but we gained experiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learnt from such mistakes and with the

experiences  gained, we have improved.  So, now,  we  see

our  HDB  estates  better upgraded and  more  functional.

Still,   we   must  continue  to  better  the   upgrading

programmes.  So my purpose in moving this cut is  to  ask

the Ministry to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

have  a relook at these upgrading exercises to make  them

more  practical, more affordable, with less  wastage  and

duplication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that a flat owner wants? From all the

grumbles  and frustrations brought to us at our  MPS  and

the   feedback  sessions,  I  think  they  want   special

attention to be paid to very practical needs.  They  want

changes  made to the piping system, the water pipes,  the

sewer  pipes, old electrical fittings for safety reasons,

toilets to make sure they do not leak so that they have a

clean   environment,   spalling   concrete   to   prevent

accidents.  These are what they want.  And they  hope  we

can  use  the funds for all this major upgrading to  take

care of the wear and tear within the flats.  This is like

a one-off thing.  Many of these practical needs cannot be

seen.   They  are all hidden, like the piping system  and

sewer  pipes, which you cannot see them.  But  these  are

actually the areas where you should upgrade, not so  much

the external facade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, another area that they really want

upgrading  is the lifts.  They want the lift to  stop  at

every  landing, which is very practical,  and  we  should

support  that.  The next thing they want is to make  sure

that these upgrading programmes are affordable and within

their  means.   The reason again is simple -  economy  is

bad,  there  is uncertainty of jobs and loss of  jobs  in

some cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the HDB has a very well structured payment

programme, the truth is that, at the end of the day, they

still have to pay.  So an item like additional space does

not  attract their attention as it costs a lot more, some

about  $20,000.  We should pay attention to how  best  to

fund  these needs, perhaps taking away some of the  funds

allocated  for  external use for these internal  changes.

This  is  because town councils also do a  good  deal  of

external works, landscaping ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, can you please wrap up your

speech?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Okay. So I was wondering

perhaps  we  should leave some areas of the upgrading  to

the  town councils and some to HDB.  Maybe we could  work

out  a  formula,  in  terms  of  funding  and  areas   of

responsibility,   so  that  we  can  fulfill   the   four

conditions   that  I  have  mentioned,  that   is,   more

practical,  more  affordable,  less  wastage   and   less

duplication.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Madam, residents of Ang Mo Kio GRC

are  very  appreciative of the upgrading of their  flats.

Residents have voted strongly in support of upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP), which was

introduced  recently, is very popular with the residents.

Those  with aged parents and relatives and young children

are  most happy, as the lift on every floor increases the

mobility of their loved ones.  Many have expressed  their

preference for the LUP over IUP and MUP, as they see more

benefits in the programme to them and the community.   If

we have seen the amount of efforts that the loved ones of

low-mobility residents have to put in to help them to get

in  and  out  of the flats, we can empathise  with  their

request.   I  would therefore join Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  in

urging the Government to allocate more money for the LUP,

and  to  hasten the timeframe to introduce it to all  the

flats in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing plan, blocks of flats less than

five  storeys  high are excluded.  If we have  difficulty

walking, even a step is excruciating, not to say a flight

of  steps.  Residents with aged parents and relatives  in

these  flats are appealing to the Government not to  shut

them out of the LUP.  I am aware that lifts are expensive

facilities  to install, operate and maintain.   Hence,  I

would  like to suggest that the HDB consider smaller  and

lighter  lifts  for  these  low-rise  blocks  of   flats.

Presumably,  such lifts would be less costly to  install,

operate  and  maintain.   If  necessary,  we  can  impose

restrictions to confine their use to the old, the infirm,

the very young and the accompanying persons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the Interim

Upgrading  Programme  is meant for blocks  which  are  at

least  17  years old. Originally, the fund allocated  for

the  IUP  Plus scheme was $7,000 per unit which  included

covered  walkways,  improved mailboxes,  senior  citizens

corners, study corners, etc.  All these improvements will

give  the  residents a better living environment.   After

the  upgrading, some estates appear to be as good as,  if

not better than, private condominiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Interim Upgrading Programme was first

introduced, the residents were all very excited and happy

about  it.  But now HDB has reduced the fund from  $7,000

to $4,000, and this year it is further reduced to $2,000.

With  this reduction in the fund, we are unable to afford

comprehensive  renovation works.  We can only  afford  to

put  up  covered walkways and new mailboxes.  I think  we

should not cut down the provision so drastically. I  hope

that more funds can be given to the town councils so that

we could undertake better IUP for our residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support Dr Tan Boon Wan's appeal for the Lift

Upgrading Programme.  The LUP is very popularly supported

by the residents. I have two blocks of 4-storey HDB flats

in   my  constituency  which  are  undergoing  IUP.   The

residents  are  very anxious to know whether  they  would

also  be included for LUP.  But, according to the present

policy,  they are not eligible for LUP.  May  I  ask  the

Minister, if the residents are prepared to bear  part  of

the cost, whether HDB would consider extending the LUP to

them?   When  we are implementing the LUP and  IUP  Plus,

these  4-storey blocks of flats should not be treated  as

second-class flats.  We should treat them equally.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, I am glad to note

that the HDB has conducted a survey recently to find  out

if  the  Studio Apartment Scheme has met its  objectives.

It shows how responsive the HDB seeks to be to its target

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original target group of the Studio Apartment

Scheme, when it was launched

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>

in  1998, was the elderly.  But in his National Day Rally

Speech  in 2001, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong widened  it

by  announcing that a housing option being considered for

singles   is   studio  apartments.   Studio   apartments,

customised for the elderly, have always been offered only

to Singaporeans who are at least 55 years old.  After the

Prime Minister's announcement, singles thought that there

was  hope  at  last for more affordable housing  directly

from  HDB  for  singles  aged  35-54.   Presently,  their

housing  options  are  limited to resale  flats,  private

housing and rental flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, recently, after the review, HDB announced that

the  Studio  Apartment Scheme would not  be  extended  to

singles aged 35-54.  This is because, after polling about

300  singles  aged  35-54, only  12%  picked  the  studio

apartments with the current 30-year lease as their  first

choice  for  housing, but about 30%  preferred  a  longer

lease  period.   So, HDB has decided not  to  extend  the

Studio Apartment Scheme to singles of this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But has the HDB paused to consider why the Studio

Apartment Scheme is not the first choice of most  singles

polled?    Presently,   it  comes   with   elder-friendly

features, such as support handbars and the 30-year lease.

If  you are a 40-year-old single, you may well expect  to

be  around  after  70, and I think that is  a  reasonable

expectation.  And if we are 35-54, I do not think we need

support  handbars yet.  So, instead of shutting the  door

of  the  Studio Apartment Scheme on singles, can the  HDB

consider  modifying  the  studio apartments  for  singles

above  35?  This would mean building a certain number  of

studio  apartments  without the elder-friendly  features.

This would also mean offering a longer lease period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB announced that it would pilot integrated

studio  apartments to encourage greater  integration  and

interaction among the elderly and younger residents,  and

also  to achieve a better mix.  Singles also want to live

in a block where there are families and a mix of flats to

promote  more interaction between the old and the  young.

The not-so-old singles can also be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>

a  ready  source of volunteer help to look  out  for  the

elderly  in  the  block.  One of the  greatest  fears  of

singles  is dying alone and nobody finding it  out  until

there  is a stench.  But if we can build more such studio

apartments to allow middle-age singles to grow old in  an

integrated block with other families, it will make for  a

more  cohesive community and a better Singapore.  It will

also increase their sense of belonging to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to relook at the Studio

Apartment  Scheme to modify it to attract another  rising

target  group  that  has already been identified  by  the

Prime Minister, ie, the singles.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Madam, the Ministry of National

Development  has,  in  recent years, implemented  various

very  good  programmes  towards making  housing  and  the

physical  environment  in Singapore more  elder-friendly.

Examples  of these include the introduction of  the  Lift

Upgrading Programme in 2001 - referred to by Dr Tan Cheng

Bock  and  Dr  Tan Boon Wan before me -  and  the  Studio

Apartment Scheme referred to by Ms Irene Ng just now.  My

NMP colleague, Mrs Fang Ai Lian, I know would be speaking

later on retirement villages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to the Code on Barrier-free

Accessibility in Buildings which was first  published  in

1990  and  has been revised twice since, which prescribes

features  to  help  the wheelchair-bound  and,  now,  the

visually-impaired,  the  aged  and  families  with  young

children  negotiate their way around our buildings.   The

Code  imposes  both  mandatory requirements  as  well  as

recommends  good  practice  guidelines  which  are   non-mandatory requirements.  The most recent revision to  the

Code, in July last year, included four sets of guidelines

on   non-mandatory  requirements  to  cover  groups  with

special  needs,  including  one  set  directed  at  older

persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pre-empt the Minister, let me state that I am in

full  agreement with the philosophy that the  less  rules

the better.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>

So,  I am not asking for all the good practice guidelines

to  be  summarily made mandatory.  However, I  would  ask

that  the  Ministry  regularly  monitor  the  progress  - developers are responding to the guidelines - and review,

if  necessary, the balance between the mandatory  "shall"

statements and the recommended "should" statements in the

Code, and whether there should be a shift in balance that

might be good over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Government buildings are exempted from the

provisions  of  the  Code and, instead,  follow  internal

directives.   For Government buildings, I would  be  less

reticent  in  asking for more rigorous implementation  of

the  good  practice  guidelines,  and  I  hope  that  the

Ministry  of  National  Development  will  use  its  good

offices  to  push  its fellow Ministries  and  Government

agencies in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that some objections to the

mandatory  requirements come not  only  from  developers,

based on cost concerns, but also from some architects who

want  to  preserve  more leeway for creative  design.   I

would   like  to  encourage  our  architects  that  their

creativity  can be directed instead to how to incorporate

elder-friendly features into building design at a minimum

additional cost.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, the HDB has, as part of its

plans  to  help homeowners, encouraged the  inclusion  of

more  co-owners  of  existing  flats  when  the  original

lessees  have  gone into financial difficulties.   Often,

these  so-called  new  co-owners would  be  young  adults

helping out their parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I foresee a problem in the future, as many of these

young  people eventually want to set up a family,  or  as

family  differences cause a falling out and the  sale  of

the  flat.   This  family nucleus could  then  set  about

eyeing another flat even before they get married, as  one

parent  and  child, in order to have a  roof  over  their

heads and some place to live.  When it comes to the  turn

of  the  young  person to apply for a flat, these  people

would be counted as second-timers, even when applying for

what amounts to the first flat of their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>

own.   These people, arguably, would not have had a first

bite of the cherry per se with regard to HDB subsidies in

terms  of  their own families.  Rather, they  would  have

been pulling together to help each other out as a family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the concept of fairness in terms of not

wanting  to  have  granted too many  subsidies  to  these

people.   But should these young people, pulling together

to  help  their families in a time of need, be  penalised

for helping their parents or siblings during a rainy day?

I  hope the Government could think of a creative solution

to this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been this push for everyone to own a flat,

and  I  think this has been a very successful  Government

policy.  But if we look around, in other countries,  many

of  the  young people actually rent before they buy.   In

fact,  our Ministers have mentioned something about  this

possibility of young people getting smaller flats  before

getting  bigger ones.  But what happens to some of  these

people who are already stuck, living in a flat that  they

cannot  afford  to continue to pay?  Is it possible  then

for  the young people to rent in situ, instead of  having

to  move  everybody out and get a new flat?  Is  it  also

possible for the lease term of these flats to be changed,

in  such  a  way that the lease becomes shorter  and  the

young  people are then not deemed to have taken a  second

subsidy?  Perhaps, a creative solution could be found.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Madam, HDB

headquarters  moved out from Bukit Merah Central  to  Toa

Payoh  around June last year.  Till now, the Bukit  Merah

buildings are still left vacant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had raised this subject six months ago in

Parliament and was reassured then that the Ministry would

look into this matter with urgency.  In the meantime, the

retail sector in the area continues to suffer in silence,

with  a severe drop in businesses, especially in the area

of  Bukit  Merah Central.  All the while,  the  buildings

remain  in deep silence, awaiting their next occupants  - not even a trickle all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>

these  six  months - whilst the shopkeepers  and  hawkers

there watch with envy the booming businesses in Toa Payoh

Central brought about by the move of HDB headquarters.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help but sympathise with the retailers in

Bukit  Merah  Central whenever I visit the place,  and  I

think  that  poor planning of the HDB has contributed  to

their present woes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst complaint that I have heard is that the

HDB  did  not care very much and still moved out, despite

knowing  that its vacation would spell disaster  for  the

shops at Bukit Merah Central.  They expressed unhappiness

and  wondered  how was it that after eight  years,  since

1995, when HDB had planned to move out, HDB is still  now

unable to find a suitable occupant, where all this while,

there  are  many,  many more Government  buildings  being

built.   How could HDB answer to the rest of Singaporeans

with the loss of potential rental income of as much as $1

million per month?  I would like to take this opportunity

to  find  out  the Ministry's plan for these Bukit  Merah

buildings and also raise the question of whether the soon-to-be  formed HDB Corp would be invited to  set  up  shop

there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Madam, wet markets

have  improved  over the years.  Now the environmentally-friendly,  cleaner  new markets have  taken  shape.   The

neater,  cleaner  and  drier  appearance  is  a  welcomed

departure from the wet markets of old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a market continues to fulfill its roles

from  time  immemorial.  It is primarily  a  place  where

fresh and inexpensive foodstuffs are purchased.  It is  a

key node of community life.  A market gives character  to

the   locality.   In  many  cities  and  towns  in   many

countries, there are old market streets.  We have our own

-  Whampoa,  Kreta  Ayer and Tekka are  characterised  by

their markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the less academically-inclined

Singaporeans, the market is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>

source  of  livelihood.  In short,  a  market  is  a  key

feature  of any community. Hence, I ask that the Minister

consider  building  new markets to meet  the  demands  of

residents  in  new  towns.  In Anchorvale  and  Fernvale,

parts  of  Sengkang,  they  are constantly  inundated  by

requests for a market.  From such interactions,  I  begin

to  challenge the assumption that as Singapore  continues

on its inexorable modernisation drive, the new generation

of  younger Singaporeans eschew the wet markets for other

shopping   experiences.   Like  their  grandparents   and

parents  before them, even career-minded and professional

men  and women continue to view the markets as fulfilling

the  needs  that I have mentioned earlier, especially  so

with  the  success  of our drive to  make  these  markets

hygienic and less messy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our ingenuity in co-locating markets with multi-storey carparks or as part of a shopping facility has

alleviated the concerns that wet markets suffer from poor

land  utilisation.   Can  I  then  ask  the  Minister  to

consider  the  need for such markets to be available  and

accessible  to  residents in new towns  and  to  consider

favourably building one for those towns that suffer  from

a lack of such a facility?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, I am speaking on

this  cut  on  rejuvenated public housing estates.   Just

before  that, I would like to join hon. Member  Tan  Boon

Wan  to  also  express our thanks to HDB and Ministry  of

National Development for the Lift Upgrading Programme  at

Eunos, Aljunied GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one of the HDB success stories is also in

the  way  they  have rejuvenated their  housing  estates.

Geylang Serai is due for SERS. We would have read in  the

papers  and the media that there has been a very positive

response  from the residents of that area.   I  think  we

also  know that the MP for that area, Mr Mohamad  Maidin,

has been working very hard towards that end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Madam, Geylang Serai is very well-known for its deep histo-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>

rical, social and political roots. Singapore would be the

loser  if  the rejuvenated Geylang Serai would  lose  its

special  place  as far as the hearts of  the  Malays  are

concerned.   In  fact, no Malay in Singapore  would  feel

complete  if  he  has  not gone to Geylang  Serai  during

Ramadan  in  preparation for his  Hari  Raya.   For  that

matter, ask any Bruneian or Malaysian Malay who has  come

to  Singapore. I think he will be able to regale us  with

his stories and experiences in visiting Geylang Serai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, actually enjoy the vanishing food which

you can still find in Geylang Serai today.  Just to share

an experience with you. Even our Member of Parliament, Mr

Yatiman Yusof, got married in Geylang Serai. I was  there

during that wedding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my question about Geylang Serai's

rejuvenation  is:  what are the plans of  HDB  to  ensure

that  the  new Geylang Serai would not lose  that  ethnic

culture and historical attraction that it has?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, in view of the development

of new sites within existing estates, especially with the

new  MRT routes, such as the North East Line and also the

Circle Line, many of the older neighbourhood centres have

given rise to new neighbourhood and town centres next  to

the  MRT  stations.   These are generally  good  news  to

residents who benefited from these new neighbourhood  and

town  centres,  but  not the shopkeepers  who  have  been

operating in the old centres for many years and who  have

bought  their shops and could not move out at all.   They

see  a  drop  in the number of residents going  to  these

centres without the essential Government agency services,

such  as  HDB branch offices, bus interchanges, and  even

banks followed suit, which is understandable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Government agencies have valid reasons to

shift  out,  such as efficiency, productivity  and  cost-saving for them. Can the Minister clarify which agency is

responsible  for the planning of the alternative  use  of

the  existing neighbourhood and town centres and ensuring

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

survival of these old neighbourhood and town centres?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three such sites come to mind. One of them is the

former Woodlands Town Centre, vacated since 1998. We have

just  heard Dr Chong's vivid description of the  woes  of

the  existing shopkeepers in Bukit Merah and  his  appeal

for  his  constituents.  The landowner had  shifted  out,

knowing  full well that the neighbourhood shops  depended

so much on the HDB's customers and its 8,000 strong staff

to  survive  and,  yet, no plans for its alternative  use

were activated before the shift.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Kovan Centre - here I must declare my

interest as it is within my division - the branch  office

had  just  shifted  out in December 2002.   I  have  just

appealed to Minister Yeo Cheow Tong to consider retaining

at least a few of the feeder services so as to retain the

existing  bus  interchange and bring in the residents  to

the  350 shops and offices and over 80 market and  hawker

centre   stalls,   and  the  shopping  complex   in   the

neighbourhood.  Just to give you the impact of the  shift

of  the  essential Government services and the  transport

hub  from a neighbourhood centre, NTUC Fairprice is doing

about  50%  of the business it was doing in  pre-1998  in

Woodlands Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no one agency taking charge, could there

be  an  inter-ministry committee to ensure that the shops

in  these  old  towns and neighbourhood centres  survive,

before  allowing  any  shift of the essential  Government

services,  like the HDB branch offices, the CPF branches,

the  libraries,  the post-offices, into  newer  locations

and,  most  importantly,  the  interchanges  which  bring

people  to  the centres?  As we appeal to each  Ministry,

each  would  look  at  its own operation  and  would  not

consider   other  agencies'  operations.   However,   the

withdrawal of all the relevant agencies' operations would

have  a  tremendous impact on the old centres and  nearby

estates.   It is common knowledge that, as with  any  new

transport hub, the value of the commercial property  will

increase because of the human traffic. For new sites, ie,

MRT stations, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

should  ensure that the land surrounding these  sites  is

acquired  so  that  no property owner will  benefit  from

these   new  locations  of  the  MRT  stations   or   bus

interchanges.   It can be seen here the importance  of  a

transport hub to a neighbourhood or town centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Madam, let me first respond to Dr

Tan Cheng Bock's questions on the upgrading programme. Dr

Tan   suggested   that  the  HDB  review  the   upgrading

programme, especially the MUP, and to concentrate on  the

more  practical and affordable and less of those  aspects

which  are  wasteful and duplicated.  Similarly,  Dr  Tan

Boon  Wan  and Mr Ang Mong Seng made the same  point  and

asked about the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, upgrading is a long-term programme. This is a

programme that the Government is committed to.  It is  an

expensive programme and is heavily subsidised.  For  this

reason, it is necessary for us to continue to review  the

upgrading  programme, one, to make sure that it continues

to  stay relevant to the needs of HDB residents; and two,

to  make  sure  that  we get the best  value  for  money,

bearing in mind that resources are limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Members will know that we have completed

quite  a  few rounds of review of the upgrading programme

over  the  last few years.  I think Mr Ang Mong Seng  has

mentioned specifically a review of the IUP programme.  In

1999,  we  revised the upgrading programme to scale  down

the   improvement   works  that  were   considered   less

essential, for example, things like amphitheatres,  water

features,  fountains,  and  so  on.   Then,  we  reviewed

further the scope of the upgrading programme last year to

focus on improvement items that the residents would value

more, mainly improvement items within the flats, like the

change of pipes, spalling concrete, toilets, changing  of

the windows, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in 2001, we revised the age criterion for the

MUP  and  IUP  programmes so that more HDB flats  can  be

considered for upgrading.  In 2001, we also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

introduced  the  Lift Upgrading Programme  because  there

were  a  lot  of requests from MPs for lifts to  stop  at

every  floor, and also we recognised that the  population

was  aging.   Last year, we implemented IUP Plus.   Under

IUP Plus, we can have more lift upgrading works to enable

more residents to have access to the lift upgrading works

earlier at the same time as they enjoy the IUP works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Ang is correct to say that under the IUP

Plus, we have actually revised the budget from $4,000  to

$2,000 and this is for the IUP component.  Why do  we  do

this?   The  rationale is because we want to divert  more

resources to the lift upgrading works. The Lift Upgrading

Programme  is  a  much  more sought  after  programme  by

Members  of Parliament, as well as by residents, and  for

this  reason, we diverted the funds to what we felt would

be  more  appreciated and more valuable to the residents.

However,  within this IUP budget, the working  committee,

which is usually chaired by the advisor, would be able to

select  from a list of improvement works. It  is  like  a

menu.  So  whether it is repainting of  the  blocks,  new

letter  boxes,  covered linkways, improved  lighting,  or

whatever,  advisors and residents choose what they  think

will  bring most benefit to the residents. What  we  have

done is to keep the budget lean, divert it to areas where

they  are more appreciated and for the remaining  budget,

allow  a  list  of things that residents  would  want  to

choose from.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the selection of blocks for upgrading, we do

so  after  very  careful consideration.   After  we  have

selected  the blocks for upgrading, it is ultimately  the

residents  themselves  who  decide,  through  a   polling

process, by voting, whether they want their blocks to  be

upgraded or not.  Based on the polling results so far, it

is  clear that many residents are in favour of upgrading,

in spite of the inconvenience, the noise, the dust and so

on,  that  they  face while the upgrading  works  are  in

progress.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for example, we polled ten precincts for

MUP  and  every  precinct voted "yes"  for  the  standard

package.   85%  "yes"  votes,  on  the  average,   is   a

resounding approval for the MUP programme.  For the  Lift

Upgrading Programme that was implemented in 2001, out  of

68 blocks that were polled in the demonstration phase, 67

voted in favour of the programme.  Remember that there is

a co-payment element in the lift upgrading programme, and

why  the  one  block did not agree to the lift  upgrading

programme could be because the co-payment amount  was  on

the  high  side.  As for the space-adding  item,  yes,  I

agree with Dr Tan that it does cost more to have a space-adding  item  included in the upgrading programme.   But,

again, this is subject to approval of the residents.   If

the residents do not wish or they do not feel that it  is

good  value for money, all they have to do is to say  so.

Some  precincts  have indeed voted "no"  for  the  space-adding item (SAI), especially the 5-room flats.  I  think

this is quite a pragmatic position.  They already have  a

large  flat.   They  do not wish to  have  an  additional

storeroom or an additional balcony, and they say,  "Thank

you  very  much.  I do not need it."  We say, "Yes,  fair

enough."   We  move on and offer it to another  precinct.

So  it is not true that the upgrading, especially MUP, is

no longer attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as payment for the upgrading is concerned,

again, I would like to inform Members that so far,  HDB's

data  indicate that there are 48,000 households that have

been  billed  for the upgrading work, and more  than  95%

have paid up, either in full or by instalments.  The rest

can  opt  for  either a longer repayment period  or  even

defer  their payment until their flat is sold,  and  this

accounts for the rest of the residents.  So, again, it is

not  true  that  the  residents are not  able  to  afford

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lift upgrading, I am glad that we have been

able to implement the lift upgrading programme because it

is indeed a very highly appreciated programme.  But there

are many blocks that are eligible for lift upgrading.  In

fact, to date there are some 3,500 high-rise blocks which

still do not have lifts on every floor yet.  So, I do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

sympathise with the call for lifts for four-storey blocks

from  Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Tan Boon Wan and others.  But,

as  I  said, there are many other high-rise blocks  which

still  have not had their lifts changed.  And in view  of

the funds that we have available, we need necessarily  to

continue  to  prioritise this lift  upgrading  programme.

So,  I do not have good news for Mr Ang Mong Seng at this

point  in  time.   We  do not intend  to  implement  lift

upgrading for four-storey blocks as yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to Mr Zainul who asked about the

SERS programme for Geylang Serai.  I did not know that my

parliamentary  colleague,  Mr  Yatiman,  was  married  in

Geylang  Serai.   Maybe if he tells me  which  particular

place,  we  might find a way to preserve  that  -  put  a

plaque there or whatever.  It is something that has  been

very  well received by the residents and I agree with  Mr

Zainul  that  the atmosphere and the unique character  of

Geylang Serai are something worth preserving.  So, in the

redevelopment  plans of Geylang Serai,  I  will  ask  the

relevant   authorities,  HDB,  the  National  Environment

Agency  and  others to bear this in mind.  Geylang  Serai

market, for example, serves a very important purpose.  It

is,  as  I understand, an anchor facility for festivities

during  the Ramadan period, and it is a social  gathering

point  for many people.  So, we will rebuild the  Geylang

market  at  a  prominent location, fronting Changi  Road,

and,  in  this way, together with retaining many  of  the

merchants  in  that area, we hope that the character  and

the vibrancy of that area will be reinforced.  Mr Mohamad

Maidin, the MP for the area, has, I believe, also set  up

a task force to gather feedback from all the stakeholders

-  from  the  residents, the stallholders and shopkeepers

and   from  the  Malay  community  generally  -  on   the

redevelopment  of Geylang Serai.  I assure  Members  that

the  Government will take note of the feedback and ensure

that  their needs are taken care of and the character  of

the place is retained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of housing for singles. Ms

Irene Ng advocated passionately for singles to be allowed

access

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

to  the studio apartments.  Let me just go one step  back

and explain what is the purpose of the studio apartments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduced the Studio Apartment Scheme (SA

Scheme),  we really wanted it to be a customised  housing

option, another housing option for the elderly.  To  make

sure  that  they  were  affordable  to  the  elderly,  we

purposely  sold it on a short 30-year lease, with  option

for   extension,  the  idea  being  to  keep  the   price

affordable.  Then, we thought, why not consider  it  also

as a housing option for singles?  We considered this very

seriously.   We conducted a survey on the SA Scheme  last

year,  and  we  found  that,  in  fact,  younger  singles

considered the studio apartments (SAs) as just one of the

many options.  And, indeed, the majority indicated non-SA

housing  options as their first housing choice,  such  as

resale HDB flats and even private housing.  So, for  that

reason,  we decided we would not extend the SA Scheme  at

this  point  in time because they have viable alternative

options to meet their housing needs.  They can stay  with

their parents, they can buy a 3-room flat, loan from  the

open  market, or they can buy a bigger flat if they apply

together  with another eligible single.  And, of  course,

they  can rent rooms.  So, the SA Scheme has worked  well

as  a  housing  form for the elderly.  It has  been  well

received.   Almost all the SAs that we offered have  been

snapped up.  And, in view of our ageing population, it is

important  for us to continue to focus on the  SAs  as  a

means to meet the housing needs of the elderly.  We  will

build  more  SAs,  new  SAs, and we will  integrate  them

together  with  other blocks and offer  them  to  elderly

persons.  So, at this point in time, again I say that  we

do not have plans to open these up to singles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about the housing for the

elderly,  especially  apropos the  Code  on  Barrier-free

Accessibility.   Yes, she is right to say  that  we  have

implemented  several initiatives to make  living  in  HDB

flats  more  elderly-friendly.   In  fact,  one  of   the

strategic  thrusts of the Inter-ministerial Committee  on

the Ageing Population that I chaired, was to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

encourage  "ageing in place".  In other words, to  enable

our  elderly  to continue to live in their  homes,  their

communities, in places that they are familiar  with.   Dr

Lee  has already enumerated some of the initiatives - the

flats   with   elderly-friendly  features   through   the

upgrading programme, the lift upgrading programme, and so

on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address her concerns about the

Code   on  Barrier-free  Accessibility,  especially   the

voluntary   guidelines.   Yes,  we   will   monitor   the

implementation  of  this Code in so  far  as  the  public

housing  estates are concerned.  I would like  to  inform

her  that  HDB,  for  example, under the  Main  Upgrading

Programme, will provide ramps for the mobility of elderly

residents - ramps leading up to the blocks and also ramps

leading to other facilities, like recreational facilities

and  so  on.  I thought that I should mention  one  other

amenity  that we had implemented, and that is, under  the

project to Improve the Living Conditions for the Elderly,

apart from just improving the physical environment,  non-slip  tiles, hand-bars, alert systems and so  on,  it  is

also important to put in place some of the more community-based care and support services for the elderly.  And, in

this  regard,  we have worked very closely with  MCDS  to

make sure that there are VWOs who are in place to provide

such  support to the elderly.  So I just want to reassure

her that we have a policy framework in place to deal with

the  challenges posed by the ageing population.  We  have

made   progress   in  implementing  some   of   the   IMC

recommendations,  but,  as  in  all  things,  while   the

Government can provide the infrastructure and the  policy

framework,  it  is  the individual, the  family  and  the

community  that  have  to play a  part  in  sharing  this

responsibility   of  making  ageing  in  Singapore   more

fulfilling and rewarding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee posed a question on children who

helped their parents to pay for mortgage instalments and,

as a result of that, they lose out on their entitlement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

to  a housing subsidy.  Yes, we recognise that there  are

such  situations.  Parents have difficulty to repay their

mortgage and children are invited to become co-owners  so

that  they can make use of their CPF.  When the  children

get married and they want to set up their own homes, they

are,  in  certain  circumstances, tagged as  first-timers

already  and  are  therefore  not  eligible  for  another

subsidy.   I  would  like to inform Dr Warren  Lee  that,

under certain circumstances, they can still be considered

as  first-timers, eg, if they relinquish ownership or co-ownership of their parent's flat by way of transfer.   In

this  case, the parents must agree to be tagged as having

enjoyed  the  housing subsidy and they will  have  to  be

liable  for  the resale levy.  I also want to  inform  Dr

Warren  Lee that although we have a ten-year time bar  on

lessees  before  they can apply for a  second  subsidised

flat,  this  requirement will be waived for children  who

are in this situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very quickly, I would like to respond to Dr Chong on

HDB  Centre.  I do sympathise with the shopkeepers in the

Bukit  Merah  Centre.  Any major move of this  nature  is

bound  to  affect them adversely.  I just want to  assure

him  that HDB is actively looking at marketing HDB Centre

for  rental.  It has appointed a panel of five  marketing

agents  to  lease out the premises.  The panel of  agents

has  conducted many show arounds but, ultimately, whether

HDB  can  rent  that particular premises depends  on  the

demand for office space.  The demand for office space  at

the  moment  is very, very weak, not just in HDB  Centre,

but island-wide.  There is a major oversupply of space in

the  market.  Nevertheless, HDB will continue to actively

look  for tenants to occupy the vacated premises  and  it

will be prepared to offer competitive rent, especially to

anchor tenants.  But, having said that, I do not think it

would  be  tenable for HDB to substantially undercut  the

market  or  just give away the premises almost for  free,

because  this  would  have serious repercussions  on  the
