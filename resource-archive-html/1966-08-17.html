<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Clerk</b>:  I have to inform Honourable  Members

that  I had on the 5th day of August, 1966, at 4.30

p.m.,  received  a letter under  the  hand  of  Mr

Arumugam  Ponnu  Rajah  resigning  his  office   as

Speaker of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office of Speaker is therefore vacant and

under clause (1) of Article 24 of the Constitution,

Honourable  Members shall elect a  person  to  fill

that office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye)</b> stood up, and addressing himself to

the  Clerk  of Parliament said: Mr Lopez, I propose,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr P. Coomaraswamy do take the Chair of

this Parliament as Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b> stood up,

and addressing himself to the Clerk of Parliament said:

I support the proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no other proposal, the Clerk then

declared  P. Coomaraswamy to have been  elected  as

Speaker of Parliament.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Administration of Oath</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, standing at the Table, made

Affirmation of Allegiance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker went to the Chair and sat down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Mace (which before lay below the Table) was placed upon the Table.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say a

few  words  of congratulations to you on behalf  of

the  Government  Benches on the  occasion  of  your

election as Speaker to the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House might want to know that Mr P.

Coomaraswamy  was  born in Johore.  He  comes  from

Malaya as his predecessor did, was educated in  the

English College in Johore Bahru, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



subsequently  studied law at Nottingham  University

where  he  was  an active member of  the  Students'

Union and also the President of the University  Law

Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, Mr Coomaraswamy was called to the Bar

at  Lincoln's Inn and on returning to Singapore  he

entered  into private practice as a member  of  the

Singapore Bar. It might interest Government Members

also   to   know   that  while  in  Singapore   Mr

Coomaraswamy did considerable public service in the

interest of his profession. He was a member of  the

Law  Faculty at the University of Singapore. He was

also  on the editorial board of the University  Law

Review  and  other  bodies. Moreover,  he  was  the

Chairman of one of the many advisory committees  on

the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Coomaraswamy was also recruited as a member of the advisory committee on the P.P.S.O., and his services as a member of the public are perhaps best remembered as Secretary of the Singapore Bar Committee. In fact, I myself first met him in Select Committees of the House when he,

representing  the  Singapore  Bar  Committee,  came

forward   to  give  evidence  on  behalf   of   his

colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now very happy indeed that Mr

Coomaraswamy,  arising out of his  legal  expertise

and  experience, has been able to resign  from  his

private  practice  in order to  take  up  full-time

duties  as Speaker of this Parliament. You  can  be

assured,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that our  side  of  the

House  will give you all the co-operation that  you

require,  and  I  only wish that a  Member  of  the

Opposition  were here today to say a few  words  on

your election. But, unfortunately, their absence in

this House is entirely beyond my control.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, the Leader and

Members  of  the House, I thank the House  for  the

honour  it  has done me and the confidence  it  has

shown  in  me  in electing me to the Chair  of  the

House. That the House and each Member present  here

should think me worthy of the office makes me  most

humble.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In becoming the Speaker, I am very conscious of

my  shortcomings.  I  am aware  that  I  suffer  by

comparison  with  my distinguished predecessors.  I

have  much to learn. Since you elected me as Deputy

Speaker last February, I have received helpful  and

friendly  guidance  in very full  measure  from  my

immediate  predecessor, Mr Speaker  Rajah,  and  I

have no doubt that you will join me in wishing  him

well  in  the new duties he has undertaken for  the

nation.  For  myself, I acknowledge my indebtedness

and  gratitude for his kindness to  me  both  as  a

friend and mentor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the performance of my duties, I will, as a new

boy, ask you for your indulgence at all times and I

trust  you  will show me every kindness even  if  I

have  from  time to time to draw your attention  to

the provisions of the Standing Orders. However,  in

doing  so, and at all times, I shall be, first  and

last,  the  servant of the House administering  the

rules  of debate that the House has set for itself.

I  will  uphold the dignity of the House and  guard

its  privileges  and those of its Members.  I  will

endeavour to discharge my duties with patience and,

if  necessary, with firmness and at all times  with

impartiality.  I  shall  ever  be  conscious   that

Government  must get on with the vital business  of

governing, that Back-Benchers have their rights and

that  minorities must be heard. I have had  in  the

last  six months every help from the Clerk and  the

staff  of  the  House.  Let  me  say  how  much   I

appreciate the very efficient work done by them, in

large  part unseen and unheard. I know I can  count

on them for their continued good and loyal work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, for the

very kind words that you have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me once again, sincerely and in humility,

thank  Members for the great honour they have  done

me  in calling me from outside their ranks, in more

senses than one, to this distinguished seat.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>INTEGRATED SCHOOL IN SEMBAWANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether the Government has any  plans  to

set  up  an  Integrated  School  in  the  Sembawang

Constituency for the enrolment of students  in  the

English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil streams.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are no

plans  for the building of primary schools  in  the

Sembawang constituency under the Second Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extension of 16 classrooms has been approved

under  the 1966 programme for the Canberra  School.

This  extension  will  be used  to  take  over  the

primary  classes in the Naval Base Full School  and

to  absorb  the increase in the intake  of  primary

school  students  in  the area.  It  will  then  be

possible  to  admit children in the Malay,  Chinese

and   Tamil  language  streams  in  the  Government

English  schools in this area and to  convert  them

into integrated schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sembawang Malay School has 27 Malay and 14

English   classes  and  is  already  an  integrated

school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>TECHNICAL SCHOOL IN SEMBAWANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether the Government has any plans to

set up a Technical School in the Sembawang

Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are no

plans for the building of secondary schools in the

Sembawang area under the Second Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is proposed to put up extensions to

the  Naval  Base Full School which will convert  it

into   a   multi-purpose  secondary  school.   This

conversion will enable it to take in twice as  many

secondary  students as it now has. There will  also

be   facilities   for  vocational   and   technical

education  in  this school in accordance  with  our

latest trends in educational development.

<div align="center"><b>(Number of students)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education (i) the number of Malay Secondary Schools

and  the total number of students therein; and (ii)

the number of Tamil Secondary Schools and the total

number of students therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

number of Government Malay medium secondary schools

is  ten with a total enrolment of 7,316, made up of

eight  Malay medium secondary schools with a  pupil

population of 6,669 and two Malay medium  secondary

vocational  schools  with a student  population  of

647.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one Government-aided Tamil full

school with 247 secondary students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE CLINICS AND DISPENSARIES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Dispensation of poisons and dangerous drugs by unqualified personnel)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health whether he is aware that in some clinics and

dispensaries  owned by doctors, the  dispensing  of

poisons  and  dangerous drugs  is  carried  out  by

unqualified  personnel  without  the   direct   and

personal supervision of the medical practitioner or

qualified   pharmacist,   and   whether    he    is

contemplating   steps   to  control   the   further

employment  of unqualified personnel in  dispensing

poisons and dangerous drugs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under

existing law - to be precise, section 7 (4) of  the

Poisons  Ordinance,  Cap. 146 -  doctors  may  both

prescribe and dispense medicines, or have medicines

dispensed under their supervision. In some advanced

countries   such   as   the  United   Kingdom   and

Scandinavia,  doctoring is, however, kept  separate

from  dispensing. Such a situation is possible only

when there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



sufficient    number   of   qualified   pharmacists

available. In Singapore, at present, the number  of

doctors  in  private practice is 460,  whereas  the

number  of pharmacists in private practice is  only

88.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the School of Pharmacy of our University of

Singapore is now graduating annually about 20 to 25

pharmacists who are Singapore citizens, it will not

be   possible,   for  the  present,   to   consider

separation  of  dispensing  from  the  function  of

doctoring, because such a restrictive practice,  if

implemented,     whilst    benefiting     qualified

pharmacists  directly  will,  however,  result   in

unqualified personnel now in the employ of  doctors

to  lose  their jobs, and worse still, the cost  of

services for treatment of patients may also rise in

consequence.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Health  has

given  a reply to my question. But I would like  to

inform  him  that understandably if the  Government

were   to  implement  certain  laws,  then  certain

unqualified  but  experienced  people  employed  by

doctors  would be out of job. I would like  to  ask

him  whether he can make use of any law to  prevent

any  future happening of this sort; in other words,

while  the  present employees will not be affected,

the  practice  will be stopped in future,  so  that

unqualified   people  may  not   be   employed   in

dispensing  drugs. Of course, under any restrictive

law,  the pharmacist graduates may benefit, but  we

can perhaps see to it that in future there will not

be any more unqualified people dispensing drugs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I wish to assure the hon.

Member for Delta that the question of looking after

the interests of qualified pharmacists in Singapore

is  very much in the mind of the Ministry. In fact,

we  are  having  very close relationship  with  the

School  of  Pharmacy authorities  as  well  as  the

Malayan Pharmaceutical Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt that this is not quite the time to

decide on restrictive practices. We are aware  that

there  are a few graduates who have not been  fixed

up in employment. But this, I think, must take some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



time  because I do not think it should be  regarded

as  a  right by any graduate automatically to  move

into a job after graduation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier on, I can assure the

Member that as soon as we feel that it is the right

time   to   stop  the  employment  of   unqualified

personnel, we shall do so. We are, in fact,  making

efforts  to  get  pharmaceutical  firms  to  employ

qualified personnel as and when licences are  being

renewed. And because of this, a number of qualified

pharmacists have, in fact, been employed.

<div align="center"><b>(Rudeness towards public)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  he  is  aware  of  complaints  of

rudeness   by  some  Government  officers   towards

members  of  the public, and what action  has  been

taken in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> I am not aware of any complaints, but if

the  hon. Member is aware of any specific incident,

he  should let me have the details for an immediate

investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may not be aware that there is

adequate  machinery  to deal with  allegations  and

offences   of  this  nature.  The  Public   Service

(Disciplinary    Proceedings   -   Delegation    of Functions) Regulations were promulgated  under  the

authority of the then Yang di-Pertuan Negara acting

in accordance with the advice of the Public Service

Commission in 1962. These Regulations authorise the

Permanent Secretary in each Ministry to deal, among

other  things, with rudeness or discourtesy to  the

public by Government officials. Every such case  is

required  to  be investigated and, if proved  true,

the  offender may be severely reprimanded  and  his

record  of service endorsed. More severe cases  can

be  punished  by forfeiture of up to  half  monthly

salary  or  a fine of $200, whichever is less.  The

most  severe cases may be reported by the Permanent

Secretary   concerned   to   the   Public   Service

Commission for disciplinary action.

<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE MEDICAL ADVERTISEMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN CHINESE NEWSPAPERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Culture and Social Affairs whether and what steps

will be taken to eliminate undesirable medical

advertisements appearing in Chinese newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy) (for the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an ad hoc Committee has

been set up by the Ministry of Culture to study the

problem of undesirable medical advertisements.  The

Committee  held its first meeting on  the  23rd  of

May,  1966.  In  the course of discussions  at  the

meeting,  it  was learned that in 1962 a  Committee

was  set  up  by the Ministry of Health  under  the

chairmanship of Dr Gwee Ah Leng to study this  and

other  related problems. Dr Gwen's Committee  made

recommendations for effecting certain amendments to

the  Medicine Advertisement and Sale Ordinance.  It

is  considered that one of the proposed amendments,

if  made,  will deal effectively with  the  problem

under question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand further that the Minister for Health

has   already   requested  the  Government   Senior

Physician,  Dr  Gwee Ah Leng, to resuscitate  this

Committee   and   to  bring  up   to   date   their

recommendations:  the terms  of  reference  of  the

Committee  being  to  study the current  unethical,

dishonest,     and    undesirable    advertisements

pertaining  to  treatment,  cure,  to  the  medical

skills   of  unqualified  persons  and  to  suggest

measures  of  effective  control.  Members  of  the

Committee  will  include representatives  from  the

Attorney-General's Office, Culture, Social Affairs,

the  C.I.D.,  and the Controller and  Registrar  of

Imports and Exports.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

regarding  these medical advertisements in  Chinese

newspapers,  I remember that the Member  for  Delta

asked a similar question last year. I think she has

in mind the advertisement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



concerning abortions. The Government at  that  time

said  that it would put a stop to it. But almost  a

year  has lapsed and nothing has been done.  May  I

have  an  explanation from the Minister why nothing

has been done to stop these advertisements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I can assure you, Mr

Speaker, that all necessary measures to curb  these

undesirable  activities  have  been  taken  by  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

question  was first raised by the hon.  Member  for

Delta  at a sitting of Parliament on 28th December,

1965.  On 19th January, 1966, I obtained copies  of

the  Hansard  with the relevant extracts  and  sent

them  down  to  the  responsible  officers  in   my

Ministry  to investigate into the matter. About  10

days  after  the  19th  January,  the  Ministry  of

Culture  began correspondence with the Ministry  of

Health  on this subject, and discussions  went  on,

and  many matters came to light. On 9th March I put

up a report to my Minister of State, explaining the

circumstances  and  the various  consequences  that

might  result  from any proposed amendment  to  the

existing   legislation.   The   question   of   new

legislation  was also explored. But  it  was  later

discovered that a Committee had been set up in 1962

the details of which had been explained earlier  by

my Minister of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that since

the question was brought up in December 1965, there

has  been  no let-up and there has been a chain  of

continuous  action on this problem.  I  assure  the

House  that the Ministry of Culture will not  allow

such constructive criticisms to be left unanswered.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and National Development whether he has  plans

to  build  more fountains, and if he will  consider

building a fountain at the Delta Circus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there are no immediate plans to build

more  fountains  in Singapore. However,  the  three

fountains  that  have recently  been  erected  have

proved  to be a great attraction and added  to  the

sense  of civic pride amongst the residents.  These

fountains, which are colourfully lit up  at  night,

add grace to our city. In view of popular response,

it  is  felt that more fountains should  be  built,

especially  at traffic circuses and in parks.  When

planning is done for future fountains and the sites

are  chosen, every consideration will be  given  to

the building of a fountain at Delta Circus.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> A supplementary question

in  Mandarin,  Mr Speaker, Sir. <i>(In Mandarin)</i>  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, just now the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for National Development has given

us  only  part  of  the answer.  I  feel  that  the

situation  is like this. At present the  Government

has  already built fountains in certain localities.

The purpose is to beautify Singapore. Of course, in

this  respect, I feel that the Government, in doing

so,  should enable all the people to appreciate its

beauty. I can say that all the fountains now  built

are located in areas where there are rich people.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member has gone beyond

the bounds of a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I was just giving a little

bit of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could the Member please get to her

question?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Yes. <i>(In Mandarin)</i> I would

like  to  ask  the Parliamentary Secretary  whether

there  is  any intention or plan to build fountains

in  poor  areas, especially crowded areas.  If  so,

will the Government let us know when such fountains

will  be  built? And if the present conditions  are

favourable  to build such fountains,  I  would  ask

whether  the  Minister has any intention  to  build

fountains there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary Secretary

has  already answered the question. His answer  was

that  when  plans are made, consideration  will  be

given  to  fountains in other areas. But  does  the

Parliamentary Secretary want to add anything?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these

fountains in our city have been built not  only  in

rich  men's  areas, as mentioned just  now  by  the

Member  for  Delta, but, as I have  mentioned,  the

Government   is  also  considering  building   more

fountains at circuses -that means in our  city.  Of

course,  that includes those circuses  situated  in

poor people's areas, especially Delta.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Just now I have heard the Member for Delta say that

the  Government has built fountains in  rich  men's

areas.  I  would like to ask the Minister concerned

whether  he has any plans to build fountains  on  a

smaller scale in rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think that is a

supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can I repeat

my  question?  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister

concerned whether he has any plans to build smaller

fountains in the rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I said just now, I do not regard

that  as  a  supplementary  question.  Perhaps  the

Member will put down a specific question for answer

at the next available sitting on fountains in rural

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Cheng Lock.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the re-registration of persons

started  a few months ago and is now about half-way

through. Numerous questions were raised before  the

re-registration  began and many other  difficulties

were faced during the process of re-registration.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through anticipation and experience the

Government  has been good enough to find  solutions

to  most of the problems. But, Sir, I am sure  hon.

Members  will agree with me when I say  that  there

are still quite a number of difficulties which have

not  been solved in the way they should have  been.

In  spite of the Minister's assurance, in the  case

of  a  person  who has an unnamed birth certificate

but who holds an identity card issued before 1949 -

I  am subject to correction - in which the place of

birth  is  shown  as  Singapore,  the  officers  at

various centres would not accept that person  as  a

Singapore citizen by birth at the time when the re-registration started. But now I understand that the

position  has  been  clarified  and  there  is   no

difficulty  on  that point. Sir, if this  had  been

done  right  from the start, much difficulty  would

have  been  saved  both  by  the  public  and   the

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem which still remains a problem is

wrong spelling. Take a Chinese name. When a Chinese

character  is  written  in  English,  I  think  the

spelling  varies according to the dialect.  And  as

this  is  going  to  be  the last  chance,  as  the

Minister  stated  earlier, for anyone  to  do  such

corrections,  I hope the Minister will  direct  his

officials   to  be  considerate  and   allow   such

corrections.  For instance, if there is  a  request

for Teh - T e h - to be corrected to Tay - Tay - it

will  be too much to ask that person to go and take

a deed poll. Similar difficulties arise in the case

of  Indians and Malays. Ramasamy may like to  write

his  name  Ramaswamy, that is, with an addition  of

"w";  or  Ramasamy Sellapa would like his name  and

his  surname abbreviated to S. R. Samy. And a Malay

whose name is Abdul Rahim Ishak would like his name

called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



as A. Rahim Ishak. Sir, I am giving you these names

as  examples because you will find all these  names

in  this House and with such modifications. I would

not call these as changes, Sir, because nothing  in

the  name  is  changed. These  are  corrections  or

slight   modifications.  Maybe  some   registration

centres  are  allowing  such  corrections.  But  it

should be a general rule, because when a team  goes

to  the  community centres there will be  thousands

and thousands of such cases, I am sure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is the fee

for  the  new  identity card. The Schedule  to  the

Regulations  under  the Act says  50  cents  for  a

citizen's I.C. and $1 for a non-citizen's I.C., and

$5  for a replacement. Sir, suppose a child who was

born  outside Singapore applies for an I.C. He  will

be  given a non-citizen I.C. That is well within the

law. A few months later this child, who earlier has

obtained  a  non-citizen I.C., gets his citizenship

and  when  he goes to the Registration  Office  and

requests  for a new I.C. for citizens,  he  is  told

that  the fee is $5. I cannot understand this.  The

fee of $5 is for a replacement. But in this case no

one  will  say  that  is a replacement.  The  child

surrenders the old IC, and requests for a change as

his  status  has changed. So, Sir,  I  request  the

Minister  to  see that the Schedule is  interpreted

correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has replied to my queries earlier.

I quote  column 94 of the Hansard dated  21st  April, 1966.

This is what the Minister for Labour said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has raised the

question of names being wrongly spelt either in the

birth  certificates  or  in  the  present  identity

cards. I wish to assure the Member that in the  re-registration

exercise,  this   matter   will   be

rectified  once  and for all. Any mistakes  in  the

spelling  of  the  names will be given  sympathetic

consideration and if these are genuine errors, they

will be rectified in the new identity cards. In the

case  of  an illiterate applicant, it is  suggested

that  his  friend should assist him by writing  out

the correct spelling of his name on a slip of paper

which   he  should  bring  at  the  time   of   re-registration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote this just to remind the Minister what

he  promised  earlier. But as it  seems  that  such

cases are not being considered sympathetically, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



would   like   to  request  him  to   issue   clear

instructions  to  the registration centres  setting

out  what they should do. Where the officers  could

do  such minor corrections, Sir, the people  should

not be referred to Headquarters but should be dealt

with by the registration centres themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   Ministry  of  Labour  is   seeking   a

supplementary vote of $1,450,630 and  I  feel  this

House  is  entitled to a more detailed  explanation

from the Minister as to how this supplementary  sum

is  required, which is about 140 per cent more than

the original estimate of $1 million when the Budget

was approved in December last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to raise is that the

first and second phases of re-registration are  now

in  progress and I have come to understand that  in

certain cases during the re-registration of  school

children,  forms had been filled in by the  parents

and  submitted to the registration teams, and  when

the  pupil received the new identity card back, the

information  contained therein was  different  from

that  provided by the parents. When this was  drawn

to  the  attention  of the registration  team,  the

school  teacher  was told that they  could  not  do

anything about it and that the pupil would have  to

go  to Empress Place. This may be an isolated case,

but  I  feel  that  if the people  working  in  the

registration teams are not careful in  writing  out

the  new identity cards, the public may be  put  to

unnecessary inconvenience, not through their fault,

of  having  to go back again to Empress  Place  for

correcting the new identity card. Here I hope  that

the Minister will tell the registration team to  be

absolutely careful when writing out these cards for

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is that

since   our   new  identity  cards  are   important

documents, some care should be taken in writing the

information on them clearly. There are  some  cards

which  have  been  written  on  and  scratched  and

rewritten again, and I think this is not desirable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point I would like to raise is that when

the third phase of re-registration commences, which

is  meant  to re-register the general public,  here

again   I  feel  that  the  Citizens'  Consultative

Committees of the constituencies together with  the

Member of Parliament of the constituency, should be

consulted  and their assistance sought in providing

suitable  places  in each area  where  the  general

public  have  least inconvenience in  having  their

cards  re-registered. Likewise, the Ministry should

also  look  into  the different  language  speaking

groups   and  send  the  language  speaking   group

concerned to attend to the people. This will save a

lot of trouble in the language problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

national registration campaign started about  three

months  ago.  So far we have registered  more  than

half a million people - to be exact, the number  of

persons  registered up to the  13th  of  August  is

566,540  persons. Judging by the number of  persons

we  have  registered for the period, I  should  say

that  we  have  done quite fast work.  The  workers

employed   in   this  registration   campaign   are

recruited  from  a  list  provided  by  the  Public

Service Commission. They are mainly young boys  and

girls freshly graduated from secondary schools and,

because  of their lack of experience and  training,

some allowance must be made for their work. But  so

far, we have found that the number of mistakes made

in the identity cards in comparison with the number

we  have  registered is very few. Nevertheless,  we

will try to ensure that mistakes will be as few  as

possible. If the mistakes made in the new  identity

cards are due to our own fault, then, of course, we

will  offer  free replacements, but the  applicants

must  provide  their own photographs.  I  think  we

cannot  help  that,  but I  hope  the  public  will

forgive us for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has raised two points.

The first is about the names on identity cards.  If

you look at the new identity cards, you will notice

that in addition to one column for the name,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



there is another column for the alias. A person  is

allowed to have any number of aliases, but the name

appearing  on his old identity card must appear  on

his  new  identity  card  in  order  to  provide  a

continuity.  But if a person feels  that  his  name

should  be  spelt in such and such a way,  we  have

made  provision for that and I am sure the  workers

in   the  registration  centres  will  oblige.  But

sometimes  people  are quite difficult  to  please.

Some  of  them may want to have their names written

in  such a way or in a short form. Some may want to

have  their names written in a long form. Some  may

want  their  names to be spelt in Cantonese  or  in

Mandarin.  But we cannot help that. If  we  are  to

accept  all  these demands, then the  work  of  the

registration   campaign  will   be   slowed   down.

Nevertheless,  we will try our best to  accommodate

all these demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second point raised by the Member for

Aljunied  regarding the replacement of an  identity

card  for  a person who has changed his citizenship

status,  I would say that where the replacement  is

not  his fault, then the normal charge of 50  cents

will   apply.   But   where,  for   instance,   the

replacement is due to his own carelessness or loss,

then the fee of $5 will apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by the Member for River

Valley  that during the third phase when we go  out

to  the  community centres to register the  general

public  as a whole, they would appreciate the  help

of   Members   of  Parliament  and  the   Citizens'

Consultative  Committees in the various  areas,  we

are,  in fact, now making plans to bring in Members

of   Parliament   and  members  in  the   Citizens'

Consultative  Committees to help us carry  out  the

registration  in  their various  constituencies.  I

hope  the  Members of Parliament on our  side  will

volunteer and, in fact, mobilise their workers  and

helpers in their constituencies to help us  in  the

registration  campaign so  that  the  work  can  be

speeded up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to appropriate language group teams to be sent

to  the  registration centres, we are making  every

effort  to  send  proper  language  groups  to  the

various areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point is the amount of money we

have  asked this House to vote for the registration

campaign. The original sum of $1 million  put  down

is   for  the  initial  work.  This  includes   the

purchasing  of machinery and stationery  and  other

items.  We  now find that this sum is insufficient.

Our  estimated  total  expenditure  for  this  year

amounts to about $2,395,827 of which $1,619,837  is

for  Personal  Emoluments, $188,860  is  for  Other

Charges  Annually Recurrent, and  $587,128  is  for

Other  Charges  Special  Expenditure.  Of  the   $1

million  which  was  provided for  in  this  year's

estimate, $44,800 was transferred to meet  expenses

in  connection with the operation of the Regulation

of  Employment  Act, that is, with  regard  to  the

issue of work permits. Thus a sum of $1,450,630  is

required  to  cover  expenses  in  connection  with

national  re-registration up to  the  end  of  this

year.  So  you will see that most of this money  is

required for Personal Emoluments. This is  for  the

employment  of a large number of temporary  workers

in these various schemes.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping

Ordinance  (Chapter  207) to  enable  a  Singapore

register of ships to be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will enable the Minister to prescribe

regulations for preventing collisions at  sea  and

to   make  the  necessary  provision  that   ships

registered under the new Singapore Registry  shall

be  governed  by  the provisions of  the  Merchant

Shipping Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the Singapore Registry

shall  be  confined  to ships owned  by  Singapore

citizens  and  bodies corporate established  under

and  subject to the laws of Singapore. This is  in

accord  with  the  principles of the  Commonwealth

Shipping  Agreement with which Singapore has  been

associated all this while. The principles  of  the

Registry   are   also  in  accord  with   accepted

international  practice,  and  the   Minister   is

empowered  to  exempt any ship or class  of  ships

from the requirement to register in Singapore.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the

constitution  of  the Pawnbrokers Licensing  Board

which at present consists of:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a Chairman appointed by the Minister;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Commissioner of Police or his

representative, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) four other persons appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>It  is considered undesirable for the Commissioner

of  Police or his representative to be a member of

the Pawnbrokers Licensing Board. In the course  of

their  duties,  the  Police  exercise  supervisory

functions over pawnshops and have direct  dealings

with pawnbrokers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases where cancellation of licences is

under  consideration by the Board, the decision  of

the  Commissioner  of Police or his  representative

can  be considered to be an interested party  where

the contemplated cancellation of the licence arises

out  of  a  complaint by the Police  in  the  first

instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes to delete section 7 (1) (b) of

the    Pawnbrokers   Ordinance   to   exclude   the

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Trade Unions

Ordinance with the following objects:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To debar non-Singapore citizens and persons

with criminal records from holding any office in or

from being employed by a registered trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To provide for the compulsory registration of

branch offices, members of other committees and

paid officials of a trade union in the same manner

as is being done now in respect of the registration

of headquarters' offices and central committee

members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To make it compulsory for a trade union to

obtain  the  consent of the  majority  of  the

members  concerned  by  secret  ballot  before

calling  a  strike  or  taking  any  form   of

industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Trade Unions Ordinance, any

person  who  has attained the age of 21  years  may

become  an  officer  of a trade union.  Other  than

this, the only restriction imposed by the Ordinance

on  the  qualification of trade union  officers  is

that at least two-thirds of the total number of the

officers of a trade union shall be persons actually

engaged  or  employed in an industry or  occupation

with  which  the  trade union  is  connected.  This

laxity  has  enabled persons who are not  Singapore

citizens  and  undesirable elements  with  criminal

records  to hold important positions in and  manage

the affairs of trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As comprehensive measures have already been

adopted  by  Government to protect  the  employment

opportunities of Singapore citizens,  it  would  be

illogical to allow non-Singapore citizens to remain

entrenched  in  the  executive positions  of  trade

unions. The democratic trade union movement  has  a

vital role to play in our national development.  It

is,  therefore, only right that measures are  taken

to  ensure  that individual unions  and  the  trade

union movement as a whole should be led by citizens

of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. has already made it clear that under

no circumstances will it tolerate corrupt practices

in   the   labour  movement.  The  elimination   of

undesirable elements with criminal records from key

positions in trade unions will ensure the emergence

of a clean and honest labour movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the existing Trade Unions

Ordinance do not adequately safeguard the  interest

of  the members of trade unions in connection  with

strikes  and other forms of industrial action.  The

Ordinance  merely  requires trade  unions  to  make

provisions  in  their  rules  for  the  taking   of

decisions  in respect of strikes by secret  ballot.

But nowhere in the Ordinance does it lay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



down  that failure to comply with the necessity  to

carry out a secret ballot prior to strike action is

an   offence  under  the  Ordinance,  although  the

Registrar of Trade Unions may, on proper complaints

laid  before him by the members affected, call upon

the  union  concerned to show cause as to  why  its

registration should not be cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deregistration, no other action can be

taken   against  the  defaulting   union   or   the

responsible  officers,  as  a  strike,   which   is

commenced  without taking a secret  ballot  of  the

members  of the trade union concerned,  is  not  an

illegal  strike  within the meaning  of  the  Trade

Disputes Ordinance. It is intended to rectify  this

deficiency by making specific provisions in the law

to  require a trade union to obtain the consent  of

the  majority  of its members concerned  by  secret

ballot  before calling a strike or taking any  form

of  industrial action. This would ensure  that  the

views  of  the rank and file members in respect  of

industrial  action  are  respected  by  the   union

leadership,    and   eliminate   any   undemocratic

manipulation of imposing a strike from the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As anticipated, the anti-national elements in the

pro-Communist unions have come out with their usual

distorted  statements alleging that the  object  of

the  Bill  is to deprive the right of the so-called

left-wing  trade  unionists to serve  the  workers.

They  have  been singing this old tune  for  years.

Members  will  recall that in the  past,  when  the

Government   introduced  legislative  measures   to

safeguard trade union funds, it was accused by them

of  adopting  Fascist  and dictatorial  methods  to

suppress  the trade unions. It is easy to see  what

is  at  the back of their tortuous minds. They  are

not  really  interested in the right to  serve  the

workers simply because they have no concern for the

interest  of the workers. What actually gives  them

cause  for concern is that the Bill might  in  some

way  curb  their evil design to subvert  the  trade

union movement to serve their selfish interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now explain the amendments proposed in

this  Bill. The provisions in clause 2 of the  Bill

seek   to   enlarge  the  existing  definition   of

"executive"  and "officer" to include reference  to

the  branch committees, branch officers and members

of  other  committees  of a trade  union.  This  is

necessary in view of the provision to be introduced

in  clause 4 which deals with the qualifications of

trade union officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes it compulsory for a trade union to

obtain  the consent of the majority of the  members

concerned by secret ballot before calling a  strike

or taking any form of industrial action. Failure to

comply  with  this democratic process would  render

the  defaulting  union and its officers  liable  to

prosecution  and, if convicted, a  fine  of  up  to

$2,000  can be imposed. There is nothing whatsoever

in  this  clause  which may in any way  hamper  the

workers' fundamental right to strike. In fact,  its

sole  aim is to ensure that every member of a trade

union   has   the  opportunity  to   exercise   his

democratic  right and express his views  freely  by

secret  ballot on the vital question of strike  and

other  forms  of  industrial action which  directly

affect their livelihood. It was not uncommon in the

past that in some disputes the workers knew nothing

about their cases at all. The first thing they knew

about  the strike was that when they turned  up  at

the  factory  gate they found banners  hanging  all

over  the place and they were not allowed to  enter

the factory. Now, we are not going to allow this to

happen  any  more. We are not going  to  allow  the

trade  union leaders to have the only  say  in  the

unions.  But we are not saying that they cannot  go

on  strike  or take any form of industrial  action.

All we say is that if they want to go on strike  or

take any form of industrial action, they must first

consult their members, and the general members must

have the final say as to whether or not they should

carry out a strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the First Reading of the Bill, my

Ministry  has  received  representations  from  the

National  Trades Union Congress. The  N.T.U.C. has

pointed  out that subsection (1) of the new section

24A in clause 3, as it stands,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



would give the impression that before a trade union

commences a strike or any form of industrial action

which affects only a section of its members, it has

to  obtain  by  secret ballot the consent  of  the

majority of the entire membership. This is not  the

intention of this subsection which, in such  cases,

requires   only  the'  majority  consent   of   the

particular section of members concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the Committee

stage  to  move  an amendment which will  make  the

intention  clear. The N.T.U.C. has  also  expressed

very   strong   objection  to  the  definition   of

"industrial action" in subsection (4)  of  the  new

section 24A. For this reason, the Second Reading of

the  Bill was postponed twice to enable my Ministry

to  discuss the matter fully with the N.T.U.C. Sir,

at  the Committee stage I will move an amendment to

the definition of "industrial action". Although the

new  definition  does not meet  the  views  of  the

N.T.U.C. in full, I would say that it is the  most

realistic   provision  we  could  make  under   the

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendments in clause 4, a

person  is disqualified from holding any office  in

the  central executive committee, branch committees

and  other committees, such as industrial  relation

committees, education and cultural committees of  a

trade union, if he is not a citizen of Singapore or

has  been  convicted of criminal breach  of  trust,

extortion  or criminal intimidation, or  any  other

offence,  which,  in the opinion of  the  Minister,

renders  him  unfit  to be an officer  of  a  trade

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides in clause 5 that a person

shall  not  be employed as an employee of  a  trade

union  if he is not a citizen of Singapore  or  has

been  convicted  of  a criminal offence.  In  other

words,  the amended section 26 and the new  section

26A in clauses 4 and 5 endeavour to ensure that not

only  the running of this country in every  respect

shall be in the hands of citizens of Singapore, but

also  that the trade union leadership shall not  be

exposed  to  corrupt influence. A clean and  honest

trade  union  movement will inspire the  confidence

not  only  of  the workers but also of the  general

public and the employers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been appreciated that there would be

practical difficulties in certain cases in applying

the  new provisions of section 26 in clause  4  and

section  26A in clause 5. A proviso has  also  been

incorporated  in  both these sections  which  gives

power   to   the   Minister  to   rule   that   the

disqualification arising from conviction shall  not

apply   where  he  is  satisfied  that  the  person

convicted  has reformed. Powers are also  given  to

the Minister in the new section 26B in clause 5  to

exempt   any  trade  union  or  person   from   the

provisions relating to disqualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the effective implementation of the

provisions  in  clause  3 and  to  improve  on  the

existing  provisions  of the  Ordinance  concerning

secret ballots, the Bill provides in clause 6  that

the  rules of a registered trade union shall ensure

that every member has an equal right to record  his

vote  freely,  that the results of the  voting  are

accurately ascertained and declared, and  that  the

secrecy of the ballot is properly secured. Besides,

power is given to the Registrar of Trade Unions  to

inspect  ballot papers and other documents used  in

connection with the ballot, and it is provided that

all  such  papers and documents shall be  preserved

for  six months and the results of the ballot shall

be  sent  to  the  Registrar.  Under  the  existing

Ordinance, registered trade unions are required  to

notify   the   Registrar   of   every   change   of

headquarters or offices, including members  of  the

central  executive  committee,  within  seven  days

after   the  change.  In  view  of  the  provisions

relating   to  disqualification  of  officers   and

employees  of  trade unions in  clauses  4  and  5,

consequential changes are made in clauses 7  and  8

whereby,  in  addition  to  reporting  changes   of

headquarters  or  offices  and  central   executive

members,  trade unions are also required to  notify

the  Registrar  of all changes of  branch  offices,

members of other committees as well as employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to add a new clause

to  the Bill at the Committee stage relating  to  a

minor  amendment to section l8B of  the  Ordinance.

The  purpose  of  the amendment is  to  enable  the

Official  Assignee to deal with immovable  property

belonging to trade unions which are dissolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I find that the contents

of  the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill are good  and

the  Bill  should be supported if the intention  of

the  Minister  for  Labour is sincere,  as  he  has

explained  in respect of clause 3 in this amendment

Bill. But there are two other clauses which are not

very  happy  ones. I believe not only I myself  but

every other trade unionist will support me in  this

respect.  For  example, Mr Speaker, clause  2.  At

present executive members only should be registered

with a trade union. But with this amendment when it

comes  into force - every branch committee  of  the

union   will  have  to  be  registered   with   the

Registrar.  In  this  matter, large  unions  -  for

example,  the  Bank Employees Union, the  Insurance

Employees Union, the A.U.P.E., the Singapore Manual

and Mercantile Workers Union, etc., which have tens

or   hundreds  of  branches  -have  many  sectional

committees,   e.g.,  picnic,   social   and   other

committees.    Although   these   committees    are

temporary, their members will also have to register

their  names,  addresses,  ages,  etc.,  with   the

Registrar of Trade Unions. Mr Speaker, this  would

involve the union in administrative work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see any other constructive aim regarding

clause  4  of this amendment Bill. I find  that  it

prevents  a non-citizen, or a person who  has  been

convicted of a criminal offence, criminal breach of

trust, extortion or criminal intimidation which, in

the  opinion of the Minister, renders him unfit  to

be  an  officer of a trade union or a branch  of  a

trade  union,  from holding office. The  Government

has  issued work permits to non-citizens and  these

workers  can continue to work in Singapore.  It  is

fair  that  if  a  person is  allowed  to  work  in

Singapore, he should be allowed to be a member of a

trade  union to safeguard the security of  his  job

and his family. If he is allowed to be a member  of

a trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



union  according  to  our  democratic  trade  union

regulations, then he will have the right to contest

or  to  hold  office either in a branch or  central

committee.  I  agree  that people  not  given  work

permits be not allowed to hold office in any  trade

union. But if a person, who has been issued with  a

work permit, is a member of a trade union, then  he

should  have  the  same rights as  other  Singapore

citizens. Otherwise these people will not have  the

right  to  vote concerning an industrial action  in

respect of section 24A (1) . Employers will make use

of  this provision to oppress workers who are  non-citizens  but who are allowed to work in Singapore,

and  these  workers will find hardship.  Then  this

will   bring  about  the  downfall  of   the   free

democratic trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, workers with Singapore citizenship will

also  suffer  similar consequences.  As  the  Malay

proverb says, "If the needle can pass through,  the

string can also pass through."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I support the

sentiments  in  section 26 (1)  (b)  of  the  Trade

Unions   (Amendment)  Bill,  I  would  nevertheless

suggest  that  the  provisions  in  the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance  be  included  in  this  Trade

Unions (Amendment) Bill. I refer to section  7  (4)

of  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance  wherein  a

person  who is an undischarged bankrupt and  is  of

unsound  mind  should not work as an officer  of  a

trade union, because such a person will not be able

to manage his own financial affairs. Maybe he is  a

spendthrift  and his bad habits, such as  gambling,

drinking,  etc., will cause him to get  into  debt,

and if he cannot clear his debts, then he is made a

bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister for

Labour to take action in respect of clauses 4 and 5

of  this  Bill  - that this provision  be  added  -

persons  who  are non-citizens but  who  have  work

permits  be  allowed to hold office  in  the  trade

union movement. And also include in this provision,

that  persons  who  have not been  discharged  from

bankruptcy  and are of unsound mind should  not  be

allowed to hold office in the trade union movement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no

quarrel  at  all with the Minister  for  Labour  in

respect of his introducing the amendment of the new

section 24A, subsections (1) , (2) and (3) . But, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if you look at subsection  (4) ,  the

wording contained therein, I will say that if  this

Bill  is  passed today, then I am afraid  that  the

whole  trade union movement in Singapore will  have

to   close  shop.  The  Minister  for  Labour   has

introduced this piece of legislation, or rather  an

amendment  to  the Trade Unions Ordinance.  Sir,  I

refer to the proposed amendments to section 24A  of

the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill. As I said, if it

is  passed  today by this Legislature,  I  have  no

doubt  that  the status of the Minister for  Labour

will  be  very much enhanced and, instead of  being

referred  to  as Minister for Labour,  he  will  be

addressed as the Honourable Minister for Management

or Employers. As a Member of Parliament and also as

a  trade  unionist, it is my duty to point out  the

flaws   in   the   amendments.   We   welcome   the

introduction  of  this  amendment  which,  as   the

Minister  for Labour has said earlier, is  to  curb

irresponsible   leadership  in  the   trade   union

movement  and the anti-national elements  who  call

for  strikes without resort to a secret ballot. All

these  are  well-meant  intentions.  But  does   he

realise  that in the process of curbing  the  anti-national elements and also the irresponsible  trade

union leaders, the loyal and democratic trade union

movement  like  the National Trades Union  Congress

will also be clobbered?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I read the amendments to

the  Trade  Unions Ordinance, the new section  24A,

subsection (4) wherein -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> When you refer to the new section

24A,  subsection  (4) ,  could  you  make  it  clear

whether you are referring to it as published in the

Bill or as in the proposed amendment to be taken in

the Committee stage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to the

proposed amendment by the Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed, Mr Ho.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> - wherein the Minister attempts

to define "industrial action", this definitely will

receive maximum applause from the employers but not

from   the   unions.   I  was  at   the   beginning

disillusioned and later on disgusted by this attempt  to

curb  healthy trade unionism in Singapore. And even

at  this moment of disillusionment, I cannot but be

a  little  amused by this definition of "industrial

action" -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, I am sorry to interrupt once

again. Two points occur to me. I know it is very difficult

when you are  dealing with an amending Bill to confine  your

remarks to the general policy of the Bill. But if you  are

going into detailed  criticism of clauses  or sub-clauses,  I

think it would be better for you to reserve that for  the

Committee stage, and in so far as is possible  at  this

moment,  please address your remarks to the general

policy of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is with regard to proposed

subsection  (4) of which the Minister has  given  notice.

There  is  no 100 per cent certainty that  he  will

move  it. So you may, in fact, be anticipating  him

when you refer to that. Would not the better course

be to wait till we sit as a Committee on that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I agree. May I proceed ?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole

object  of  this  new amendment  will  restrict  an

employee even to take only two or three minutes off

for  the  purpose of answering the calls of nature.

Legally, if you read the amendment, it will, ridiculously

enough,  mean  that every  act which limits  productivity

constitutes   an  industrial  action.   While I am not

attaching  any  blame  on the legal draftsman  for  this

definition, I cannot appreciate its anti-labour concept.

Even during the heyday of the colonial regime, when our

Prime  Minister  and  his colleagues  were  in  the

forefront  of attack against the anti-labour laws  of  the

foreign  masters, there was not a single  piece  of

legislation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



amendment  to  the  then existing  Ordinance  which

could  match  this wonderful piece of  legislation,

for  which the present Government attempts to  seek

the approval of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why at this juncture the Government

should exert increased pressure and restrictions on

the  union  movement, especially when the  N.T.U.C.

and  its  affiliates are acting in  a  very  highly

responsible  and  democratic manner.  The  N.T.U.C.

today  represents 75 per cent of organised  labour,

and  our  record during the past few years  is  one

which  deserves praise from all quarters.  Even  in

the  face  of  extreme provocation from  management

from  time to time, we continue to explore peaceful

ways  and  means  with  a view  to  arriving  at  a

solution  consistent with our declared objective  -

"industrial peace with justice". Thus, our approach

has  resulted  in  very few industrial  actions  in

Singapore. During 1961, there were 116 strikes  and

lock-outs, while in 1962, the fact that the  figure

was   reduced   to  only  88  apparently   was   no

consolation  either  to the  employers  or  to  the

unions.  But at that time, the Government  did  not

see  fit  to  introduce measures to curb industrial

action.  As all the people of Singapore are  aware,

at  that time, the Government and the N.T.U.C. co-operated  very  well. We fought the Communists.  We

fought  the crooks. We fought the communalists.  We

came  out with flying colours. But it is surprising

that  today  the  P.A.P.  Government,  which  often

claims   to   be   labour-biased,   is   apparently

determined  to throttle us for no rhyme or  reason.

Compared  with the figures of industrial  stoppages

in  1961  and 1962, there were only 31 strikes  and

lock-outs  in 1965, and further, during  the  first

six  months  of  this year, from January  to  June,

there  were  hardly  half a dozen  strikes  on  our

industrial scene. Mr Speaker, Sir, does  this  not

indicate  the high sense of responsibility  on  the

part  of  the  trade union movement  and  also  our

success in finding a common ground for the economic

survival  of  the Republic? And yet the  Government

has  got  the  cheek to introduce such  restrictive

measures to curb



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



a  loyal  democratic trade union movement like  the

N.T.U.C.!  That being the case, can the  Government

furnish   one  good  acceptable  reason   for   the

introduction of this particular subsection  in  the

amendment which de facto binds and chains the limbs

of the workers? The colonial masters did not do it.

The turbulent years of 1961 and 1962 did not demand

it,   and   yet  today  in  a  comparatively   calm

atmosphere and situation, the Government  is  going

to  introduce this amendment - as the Minister  for

Labour  has  said  earlier - to curb  irresponsible

leadership and anti-national elements. I completely

agree  with him. But does he realise that in  doing

so, we will also get involved? The democratic trade

union  movement  also  will  be  clobbered  in  the

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, a series of statements issued by our

Prime Minister on labour matters and the number  of

amendments to the labour legislation introduced  by

the Labour Minister have subsequently made many  of

us wonder what exactly the Government are up to. Do

they  believe in industrial peace at any costs?  Do

they  believe in knocking down the N.T.U.C.,  which

is  a loyal and democratic trade union movement, so

that the Communists and opportunists can take over?

I  would like to warn this House, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that   if  the  Government  prefer  to  allow   the

Communists  and  opportunists  to  take  over   the

government, they can go ahead with their amendment.

But  if  they  choose the N.T.U.C.  -  the  present

leadership in the trade union movement - then  they

are listening to the voice of reason. It says, "Vox

populi, vox dei."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While analysing the figures for organised labour

in  this country for the years 1956 and 1966, I was

surprised to note that for the year 1956, organised

labour  was 157,216 and for June, 1966, the  figure

for  organised  labour  was reduced;  it  was  only

152,023.  Why is it so? If the Government claim  to

be  labour-biased and labour-orientated,  organised

labour  should  have  increased,  but  instead  the

figure   was  reduced.  Something  must  be   wrong

somewhere.  As I understand, in 1956, we  had  only

semi-colonial status, but today we are told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



that  we  are  citizens  of a democratic  socialist

Republic.  Further, the labour force has  increased

substantially during the last decade, and today one-third of the total population can be considered  as

economically  active. Still, the  total  number  of

unionised  workers has dwindled. Why?  It  is  very

apparent,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the Government

continues  to  introduce  anti-labour  legislation,

nobody  will  wonder that the number  of  organised

workers has dwindled. So in future, I will  not  be

surprised  if  the  number  of  our  organised   or

unionised workers will be further reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, it will be

pertinent  to refer to section 79 of the Industrial

Relations  Ordinance which is intended  to  protect

the interest of labour from victimisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

think   section  79  of  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  has nothing to do with the present  Bill

we are discussing now.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I will wait to see what

connection the Member for Bras Basah seeks to bring

between the two.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The reason why I mention section

79  now, which was section 77 (10) then, is to make

a  comparison,  that  for a  piece  of  anti-labour

legislation, the Government is ever ready to  bring

it  to this House for approval. But for a piece  of

progressive labour legislation which is intended to

restrict  employers - that is  section  79  -  from

victimising workers, the Government is reluctant to

do  it, in spite of our repeated requests. So  when

we  made  repeated requests to put more teeth  into

this clause, there was reluctance on the Government

side.  They just do not care. But today,  they  are

ever  ready to bring this new amendment  into  this

House to seek its approval. On the other hand,  the

Minister  for Labour has no hesitation to introduce

this  particular  amendment which incorporates  the

definition of "industrial action" which he  himself

should  know amounts to selling the labour movement

lock, stock and barrel to the employer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government maintain or at least

attempt   to  maintain a semblance  of  a  socialist

Government! But the working class cannot be  duped.

They  can  see  through the "camouflage".  We  have

battled   right  from  1945  against  colonialists,

against  colonial stooges like Lim  Yew  Hock,  and

also  against Communists during 1961 and 1962. But,

today, if we have to face another "emergency" which

warrants solidarity and determination of the workers to

struggle  for the survival of a free and democratic

trade  union movement in pursuit of its  legitimate

maintenance of dignity of labour, we will  have  no

hesitation  or reservation in doing battle as what we  did  in

the  past against the Lim Yew Hock regime  and  the

Communists.  Now,  I have made it  very  clear before the

House  that it is left to the Government to  decide

whether   they   are  to  delete  the   amendments,

particularly  subsection (4) , or whether  they  are

prepared to face the wrath of the working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I subscribe to the point of view that

this  amendment  is designed to curb irresponsible  trade

leaders  and anti-national elements who call for strikes

without  legitimate grounds and without the  consent  of

the majority of their members. As I said earlier, I

completely  agree with that. But in the process  of

curbing   the  anti-national  elements   in   their

irresponsible acts,  the  loyal  democratic  trade  union

movement like the N.T.U.C. and its affiliates  will

also  get  clobbered.  Hence,  I  submit  that  the

amendment  is  totally unnecessary and unwarranted.

The  existing laws are sufficient and  adequate  to

deal with any situation. For instance, section 28 (b) of

the  Industrial  Relations Ordinance  gives  enough

power  to  the  Minister to refer  any  dispute  to

arbitration  at  any  time. The  President  of  the

Arbitration  Court  is  also  fully  armed  to issue any

injunction  to  meet  the  requirements. So why  is  the

Government  afraid  that  strikes  will  be  called

without secret ballot, and so on? If the President  of  the

Court  feels that a strike is illegal, he can issue

an  injunction  to  call it off. The  Minister  for

Labour has full ministerial power to direct  it  to

Court. So where is the necessity to have this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



amendment?   Even   the   constitution   of   every

individual trade union has also relevant clauses to

prevent it from taking industrial action without  a

secret  ballot. Further, there is the Registrar  of

Trade Unions - the watchdog of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I submit that this subsection

should  not  be incorporated. It should be  totally

deleted  from the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill.  I

hope  that  the Government will succumb  to  common

sense  and  democratic ideals  and,  last  but  not

least,  give  way to the legitimate rights  of  the

working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was wondering whether this would

be a convenient time to suspend the sitting for

half an hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the Chair again at 5.20 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.20 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

completely   concur  with  what  my   trade   union

colleague and Member for Bras Basah has to  say  on

the   amendment  to  the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance,

namely,   section  24A.  The  attempt   to   define

"industrial  action" is, if I  may  say  so,  quite

unprecedented in our part of the world. I would  be

most  interested if the Hon. Minister  for  Labour,

who is not here at the moment, I think, could point

out  to  this House one example of such  definition

being attempted in the Legislature of any socialist

democratic country in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that we have competent Industrial

Arbitration Courts in Singapore. If this is  indeed

true,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, then why in the  name  of

heaven do we find it utterly necessary to spell out

what is or what is not an industrial action in  our

Ordinance? Cannot our competent Arbitration  Courts

be called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



upon  to do what is legitimately their work? Cannot

they  from time to time evolve what is or  what  is

not an industrial action in any given circumstance?

Has  the  Hon.  Minister for  Labour  examined  all

avenues  to  this  problem before  coming  to  this

irretrievable position of having to define  in  our

statute what is meant by "industrial action"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at the definition itself as it

appears in the amendment Bill No. 69. It is couched

in  such a manner that it can only be described  by

any   observer  as  a  blanket  definition   in   a

deliberate  attempt to tie the working  class  hand

and foot. We are supposed to be men and women given

to  liberal,  democratic, socialistic thinking.  If

all   our   thinking  can  only  produce   pathetic

legislation  of  the sort that is  being  attempted

here,  then  I  for one am at a loss to  understand

what is meant by either socialism or democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless and until the Hon. Minister supplies us

with  very  cogent reasons for the introduction  of

this amendment, I am of the view that it ought  not

to  be  approved. As a trade unionist, I  will  not

stand  for anti-labour legislation in any shape  or

form. As my colleague the Member for Bras Basah has

quite  rightly  pointed  out,  the  need  for  such

restrictive   provisions  in   the   Trade   Unions

Ordinance  is  completely unjustified, particularly

in  view of the fact that the figures quoted by him

do  not warrant undue restrictions to be imposed at

this juncture of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. and its affiliates cannot, by any

stretch of the imagination, be termed anti-national

or  obstructive in their attitude. All that we, the

workers of the N.T.U.C., ask for is not to seal our

armoury  in such a way that our existence  will  be

rendered    hopelessly   impotent   or   completely

ineffective. There is not one iota of doubt in  the

minds  of  the  workers  of  Singapore  that   this

proposed amendment is rightfully anti-labour. If it

is  the  Government's intention slowly to  do  away

with   every   single  right  of  the  workers   of

Singapore,  then we have no doubt that  legislation

to  this  end is indeed possible. But, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is this the avowed intention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



of  our Government? Was this our manifesto? I  hope

not  and I pray not. The workers of Singapore  have

been  aware  and have been more patient  in  recent

times,  but let this not be mistaken for  cowardice

on their part. For, as the saying goes, even a worm

will turn if it is unduly provoked. And the workers

that the N.T.U.C. represents are not worms either!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Sir, I will oppose the proposed

amendment and appeal to all my colleagues  in  this

House,  whose  sympathy lies with the  workers,  to

reject this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, what I want to speak on more or  less

differs  from  what the Member for Bras  Basah  has

said.  In  order to clarify my opinion and thoughts

on  this, I think I have inevitably to mention  the

differences  between his views and  my  views,  and

finally  I  will have to sum up my own  opinion  on

this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah just now in making his

speech created an impression on others that he  was

speaking  not  only as a Member of  Parliament  but

also  in  his  dual capacity as spokesman  for  the

workers.  This would cause people to think  of  his

identity as the Secretary-General of -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am speaking -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member for Bukit Merah

prepared to give way? The Member for Bras Basah  is

raising some point. Is he prepared to give way  and

let the Member for Bras Basah raise his point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Lim Guan Hoo</b> indicated assent and resumed his

seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am speaking

in  a dual capacity - as a Member of Parliament  as

well as the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C. I  am

not speaking only in the capacity of the Member for

Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that was the point the

Member was making.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): About the question

of  his  capacity  and identity,  I  think  I  have

already touched on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Bras Basah - I am not

directing  my  remarks  at  his  capacity  or   the

position  from  which he made his speech  -  talked

about his reasons for opposing this amendment which

makes people  feel  that if it were passed without opposition,

then  the people would think that it is meant as a  piece

of legislation to suppress the trade union movement

in  Singapore. What are the reasons?  What  he  has

said  just now is not enough. He said that  judging

from  the last few years, although there have  been

strikes, there has been a decrease in the number. But this

could  be  ascribed to the fact  that  the  workers

under their leaders have realised their own position  and

have  co-operated with the Government to  meet  the

present  situation. This I say is a good  sign.  To

say  that the decrease in the number of strikes has

been  due  to the fact that we have not  introduced

such  an  amendment as this, and that  if  once  we

introduce  this  amendment then  there  will  be  a

greater  number of strikes and so on, I should  say

this  argument  of his could not hold water.  From  the

point  of view of legislation, it is not for us  to

discard our duties in legislation just because  the

number  of strikes has decreased. This can also  be

due  to industrial peace. It is a healthy sign.  It

does not go to show that once the number of strikes

has  decreased, that shows a healthy  situation  in

the trade union movement, legislation must end.  In

a  primitive  age  there was no  strike  whatsoever

because  in  that  society the existence  of  trade

unions  or strikes was not possible. That  goes  to

show   that  it  is  not  necessary  to  have   any

legislation on that aspect. It is an extreme  case.

But  what I want to point out to him. If we can say

that  the reduction in the number of strikes  is  a

concrete, collective sign of industrial peace, then

it  is another matter. If it is just because of the

decrease  in  the number of strikes that  we  amend

this law, then the anti-national elements will like

very  much to amend our law because of that reason. And  if

the  anti-national  elements are  wise,  they  will

adopt  an attitude of opposition in silence. If  in

just a short period of one year, when they are able

to control the trade unions or when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



they have great influence in the trade unions, they

will  suddenly  ask the workers on  their  side  to

strike en bloc for one year or half a year. And  by

that  time,  can  we  still  say  that  it  is  not

necessary  for us to make any advance  preparations

in our legislation to prevent such a situation, and

not  be  able  to  argue  again  that  there  is  a

reduction in the number of strikes by 90  per  cent

in  one  year?  What  we can  see  of  the  present

peaceful  situation in the trade union movement  is

that the law should be such that it can endure  all

situations  and not just be able to meet  only  the

present calm situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will find out if Mr Lim is

prepared to give way. Mr Ho wants to raise a point

of clarification, Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope the Member

will  allow  me  to  continue my speech  before  he

raises the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, you will have to restrain

yourself for a moment, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I feel that the

law itself has its merits and good characteristics.

These good characteristics lie in the fact that the

law  can  meet all situations and will be effective

in  all  situations. We should not think of passing

legislation to deal with a situation only  when  it

arises.  The  law should be flexible enough  to  be

able  to deal with all situations. In other  words,

it should have a preventive and curative effect.  I

will  sum up my conclusions which will give you  my

opinion  on this matter. I feel that in the  spirit

of  independence of Singapore, what should  not  be

lacking  is democracy which should also be  applied

to  trade unionism. Our trade unionism should  also

have  the  manifestation  of  the  spirit  of   the

democratic   Republic  of  Singapore.   Legislation

should not prevent the development of the spirit of

democracy. If there is anything contrary to or  bad

in the spirit of democracy, then I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



oppose  it. But I do not find anything in this  law

which is against the spirit of democracy. Unless  I

know  of  any  concrete point or  fact  which  will

enable  me to know that this law is anti-democracy,

I  will  not  agree to its opposition or  anybody's

opposition  to this law. Mr Speaker, I approve  of

the passing of this law.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> I rise to

support  this Bill. I think it is a good  Bill  and

one  which not only protects the workers  but  also

the  public in general. The trade union leaders  on

this side of the House have bitterly criticised the

Government  on the proposed amendments.  A  lot  of

slogan-shouting has been made, but -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> We do not believe in slogan-shouting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> We have not heard one good,

valid reason why the workers or the N.T.U.C. oppose

section  24A  (4)  of the amendment.  I  think  our

national   trade  union  leaders  have  failed   to

understand  the  present approach and  thinking.  I

think they have failed to understand that they  are

no longer dealing with a colonial Government, but a

free  and  independent Government who has  got  the

interest of the people at heart. Why do they oppose

the  proposed  amendment? I  personally  feel  that

there  is nothing wrong in this legislation.  If  a

union  wishes to take industrial action and  if  it

has legitimate reason to do so, by all means go  on

strike. By all means have a strike ballot. If their

reasons  are valid and if they have the support  of

the  workers, why should they fear this  amendment?

It  is  this  very amendment that is  necessary  to

regulate    irresponsible   employers   and    also

irresponsible   trade  union   leaders   who   take

advantage of the slightest reason to go on  strike,

with  the result that the public suffers.  We  have

seen many cases of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that this Bill gives

adequate  power  to  the  Registrar  to  deal  with

irresponsible trade union leaders who do not  abide

by the rules of their union. I believe we have seen

a  recent case in the High Court of workers against

workers to seek redress,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



at  painful  expense of legal  fees  to  the  legal

profession.  I am sure that if this Bill  had  been

introduced  then,  such  action  would  have   been

unnecessary and the workers would have been  spared

the expense of having to take High Court action.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): My

colleagues  have spoken on this amendment  Bill.  I

would also like to express my views. Generally, for

those union leaders who can act in a lawful manner,

there  is no difficulty. In this country, for those

who treat the workers well and who want to work for

their  welfare,  there is scope. We  cannot  expect

progress and prosperity by suppressing the  workers

and  reducing their affluence. Production  will  go

down.  The country's affluence will also  go  down.

For  example, today the labour unions, through  the

labour movement, often resort to strikes. I do  not

know  which  law  they follow.  It  is,  therefore,

necessary to restrict these activities. The  unions

are  meant  to lift up the workers. When  they  see

such  a severe law, they will think that they  have

to  work  for  the trade unions and  work  for  the

labour  movement. And they will then  come  to  the

stage to take further action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a law is made, the situation should be

carefully  examined. We should know which  are  the

countries where there is confusion, and when  there

is  such  confusion, the country or the people  may

suffer; and when there is such a situation,  a  law

similar to this is necessary. My friend the  Member

for  Bras Basah has stated that it is not  easy  to

stage  a strike. When there is a strike, we have  a

law  and  we can deal with that. We have to  follow

the proper way and exercise control, and if workers

do  not  come under control, then we will  have  to

take  further  action. When we think of  all  these

things -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, are you prepared

to give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Ho. Could you make it a

point   of   order   rather   than   a   point   of

clarification?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I do not think I can take a

point   of  clarification,  but  since  the  Member

speaking  is  prepared to give way, please  let  me

know what your point of clarification is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member for Anson has misunderstood my point when  I

made   my speech  earlier  on.  I  said  I  support   the

requirement  that  any industrial  action  must  be

conducted  by a secret ballot. I did not  say  that

industrial  action can be taken  without  a  secret

ballot. I fully support taking a secret ballot  for

a strike, I represent the National Trades Congress.

We  fully support the secret ballot. I did not  say

that without a secret ballot, the union can go on strike. Any

strike must be supported by -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, you have made your point. I

think  what you did say was that the rules  of  the

unions  contain provision for a secret  ballot  and

that is adequate to meet the problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my

friend  has  stated his facts.  I  am  saying  that

strikes are now conducted by a secret ballot. I  am

not  saying  that they are being staged without  a  secret

ballot.  I am asking why there is such a Bill  when

there  is  such  a  situation  in  Singapore.   And

whenever there is a law, there should be a reason for  it.

But  this  time I am asking whether  there  is  any

reason for it. There is no confusion in this country,  and

it is only when there is confusion that such a Bill

should be brought in. If there is confusion, you can say

that that is a good reason to bring in a Bill.  But

we  should  not  bring  in a situation  which  will

demand  such  a  Bill. This Bill is  favourable  to

unions which abide by the law. I am saying that this Bi11

is  favourable  to  unions  which  carry  on  legal

activities. What I am asking is whether  this  Bill

is important and necessary. We have to work hard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



for the trade unions and we have to treat employees

properly. Therefore, by bringing in this  Bill,  we

should  not  make  it difficult  for  the  workers,

employees  and the trade unions. We  have  to  find

some  other way. We may not be able to do any  good

for  the people. What I think is that this Bill  is

not  a  suitable one. Therefore, it should  be  re-examined  and action should be taken in the  proper

way  to  give benefit to the employees.  Therefore,

the Labour Minister has to think carefully and come

to a conclusion in the right way.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this Bill  has  been  heatedly

debated in Parliament. Nevertheless, the Government

has  introduced it for the benefit of  the  public,

including  the working class, which is  represented

by the National Trades Union Congress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): However, in the

enforcement of this Bill, although in our heart  of

hearts we know that in introducing it we have  good

intentions,  it  is feared that the phraseology  as

contained  therein may be misinterpreted or  abused

and will result in the Bill oppressing one section,

maybe  the  working class or the public. When  this

Bill is introduced, and if a mistake is made, it is

certain  that the working class or the  public  may

accuse   the   Government,  which  is  actually   a

democratic  and  socialist Government  and  labour-orientated, and thus bad results will occur. So  in

introducing amendments we must bear in mind  mutual

benefits.  We  have  heard hon. Members  say  anti-national elements. Anti-national elements  are  not

confined  to  the  Communists alone.  They  include

opportunistic  employers.  They  come   under   the

definition of "anti-national elements".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 24A (4) has been emphasised by

the hon. Member for Bras Basah:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"industrial action" means any action aimed at

retarding,  obstructing, limiting or  reducing  the

normal progress of work in any occupation,...'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



and so on. I cite an example, Mr Speaker, Sir.  Shift workers -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Mahmud, you are going into the

detailed provisions of sub-section (4) , but I think

it might be more appropriate to raise it in the

Committee stage than now.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am merely making passing remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you pass very quickly?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Suppose a trade

union  of  bus  workers convenes a meeting  of  its

members  for the purpose of taking a secret ballot,

maybe for a strike or a go-slow or other matters in

accordance with the union laws. Naturally those bus

workers  who  are doing shift duties will  have  to

attend  the  meeting,  which  means  that  the  bus

services  will  be affected. In  such  a  case  the

employers  will take the opportunity  to  say  that

this  particular  section can  be  taken  as  going

against   that   particular   section.   Then   the

Government   cannot  do  anything.  That   is   the

difficulty with which we will be faced. That is the

fundamental  issue  which is  brought  out  by  the

workers,  and  I hope such matters  can  be  looked

after carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, as has been said by the hon. Member for

Kampong Kembangan, perhaps unconsciously we make  a

mistake  -  those  who have been issued  with  work

permits, whether they have become union members  or

union  leaders  and  so  on.  That  also  must   be

considered  so  that  this Bill  will  be  enforced

smoothly  for the benefit of both sides,  including

workers and the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have heard some hon. Members in this House speaking

against the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill which has

been introduced by the Minister for Labour. What is

there  in  this Bill to be afraid of if  the  trade

unions themselves are aware of where they stand and

what  they  do?  Sir,  there is  a  saying  in  the

political  field  that state power  put  in  proper

hands will lead men to a good society. We can  take

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



that trade union power put in the proper hands  may

lead to better industrial relations between workers

and  management. But my trade union  colleagues  in

this   House   cannot  say  that   there   are   no

unscrupulous unionists in the disguise  of  genuine

loyal unionists dedicated to the labour cause. Sir,

I  know of unionists who try to use union authority

to  go  into the normal day-to-day problems of  the

workers. For instance, if there happen to  be  some

members  who  do  not toe the line,  they  will  be

threatened  by the trade unionists that  they  will

see   to  it  that  they  are  sacked  from   their

employment. There are certain trade union officials

in  Government departments who even threaten  their

own colleagues by using their own position as trade

union  officials. Therefore, I hope my trade  union

colleagues in this House will agree with me -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  are debating the amendment.  We  are  not

debating  trade  union officials  being  sacked  by

trade unions. The Member for Farrer Park is talking

about  trade union officials being sacked by  trade

unions. I think there is no relevance to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for Bras Basah has mis-heard what I said. I did not

say  at  any  time that trade union  officials  are

being sacked for trade union activities. I am  just

bringing  up these matters to support the Bill  and

giving  the reasons for it. Therefore,  I  hope  my

trade  union  colleagues in this House  will  agree

with   me   that   not  all  trade  unionists   are

unscrupulous people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They can be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> However, I feel that these amendments

are  intended  to curb only irresponsible  leaders.

Therefore, there can be no grouse by Members  about

this piece of legislation. This amendment does  not

legislate against strikes or any industrial action.

It  only  requires that a secret  ballot  be  taken

before  a strike or any industrial action is taken.

Why  are the trade union officials afraid of secret

ballots?  If they are conscious of their duties  to

their members, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



should  welcome  secret ballots  to  ascertain  the

wishes of the majority of the members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. claim to be a responsible democratic

institution. Then why should they be afraid of this

legislation which actually does not curb any of its

powers?  It  only tries to regularise things  in  a

democratic way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support this amendment.



<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, many Members on the  Government

side   have  expressed  their  opinions   on   this

amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah was not actually

expressing  his opposition to this amendment  Bill.

He  was  directing himself against the new  section

24A  and he was expressing his opinion thereon.  He

thought this new section is beneficial to employers

and  not  to employees. I feel that it is  not  so,

because   the   important   thing   lies   in   the

organisation  and leadership of a trade  union.  If

the  leadership of a trade union can guide it  well

and  can look after the interest of its members  so

that  a  secret  ballot can  be  taken  before  any

industrial  action, then the Member for Bras  Basah

will have no cause to worry.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the executive members of

the  trade  union headquarters or branch having  to

register with the Registrar. I think this will help

to consolidate the organisation and discipline of a

trade union, and is good. It will also prevent anti-national  elements  designs on  trade  unions.  The

strength of trade unions cannot be ignored, and our

Government  has  all along been looking  after  the

welfare  and interest of the workers by legislative

action.  Let  me  refer  to an  example  concerning

workmen's  compensation. In the past one year,  the

compensation  amounted  to $400,000.  At  the  same

time,  the  Government has always been  encouraging

healthy   trade   unionism.   For   instance,   the

Government  has a big sum of money to  build  Union

House   to  show  its  keen  for  democratic  trade

unionism,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



and it is still continuing to give such support  in

order that trade unionism can develop and grow from

strength to strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ridiculous to say that this Government has

all  of  a  sudden become an anti-labour Government

because of the introduction of this amendment Bill.

This  will  only give the impression to the  public

that  there  are even Members on this side  of  the

House who think that the Government is anti-labour.

I  hope this is not the intention of the Member for

Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all the amendments proposed here will

be implemented correctly and properly.



<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

encouraging   today  to  hear   our   trade   union

colleagues speak with so much gusto on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah, who reminds us that he

is  also the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C., has

accused the Government of clobbering, knocking down

the  N.T.U.C. by way of opposing this Bill. But  it

has  been  reassuring to hear the Member for  Telok

Blangah  reminding the House that the N.T.U.C. are

not  worms  and  that  even worms  may  turn.  Some

Members  have  described this Bill as  a  wonderful

piece  of  legislation which did not even exist  in

the  colonial days. Yet the Member for  Bras  Basah

says that the number of strikes has gone down. I do

not  want to repeat his figures, but he admits that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Apparently you did not study it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I can quote his figures. He said that

there  were 116 strikes in 1961, which were reduced

to  31 in 1965. But who claims the credit for  this

reduction  in the incidence of strikes? Is  it  the

N.T.U.C. alone?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Or is it because there has been

better  legislation? Or perhaps the Government  can

claim some credit?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



And what about giving some credit to the employers?

Perhaps  they  are  giving better  terms  to  their

employees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to get down to bare facts, Mr Speaker, Sir,

why  is  there so much opposition to this amendment

Bill? Opposition has been concentrated on clause 3,

in  particular, new section 24A (1)  and  (4) .  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do not want to be reminded that  we

are  not in Committee but all that new section  24A

(1) says is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A registered trade union shall not commence,

promote, organise or finance any strike or lock-out

or  any  form  of  industrial  action  without  the

consent  of  the  majority of the members  thereof,

which  consent shall be obtained by taking a secret

ballot  of  the  members of such  registered  trade

union.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the N.T.U.C. claims to be - again to use the

words  of the Member for Bras Basah - "a democratic

socialist  trade union". Why then is it  afraid  to

seek  the  views  of its members?  This  particular

piece of legislation does not ban all strikes, lock-outs  or any form of industrial action. All it does

is  to  say, "Before you start a strike,  seek  the

views  of your members." And I would say that  this

Bill   protects  members  of  trade   unions   from

irresponsible leaders. Before you go on a strike or

a  go-slow or, as the Member for Kampong Kapor  has

said,  "Lain2 perkara", what is wrong  with  asking

your  members?  They do not want  to  rise  up  one

morning  and  find  flags flying, members  shouting

slogans, pickets all round the place - a strike  is

on.  This has happened before and this is  what  we

want  to  prevent. If the N.T.U.C. claims to  be  a

responsible  democratic socialist  trade  union,  I

cannot  see  any good reason why it  should  oppose

this Bill.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather

surprised that the Member for Bras Basah has made a

sudden outburst over this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to restore democratic rights to

the  workers. Is the Member for Bras  Basah  not  a

trade unionist? If he is, then why is he so worried

that  workers  are  given  their  right  to  decide

whether or not they should carry out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



industrial  action  which  directly  affects  their

livelihood?  I  hope he is a man  who  believes  in

democratic  principles and who  does  not  want  to

impose  his will on the workers. If so,  then  this

Bill  serves exactly that purpose. Unless he  seeks

to be a dictator of the workers, then there is some

justification for so vehemently opposing this Bill.

For  my  part, I have no intention to be a dictator

or  to  bulldoze this Bill through. That is why  we

have  postponed  this  Bill  twice  in  order   to

accommodate the views of the N.T.U.C. leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For eight months since this Bill was read the

First time in this House in December last year,  we

have  been  contacting the leaders of the N.T.U.C.,

begging them to come to our office to discuss  this

Bill  with  us  and  to  find  ways  and  means  of

modifying  it so that it would suit the present-day

labour  movement. That is because  we  respect  the

N.T.U.C. and because we believe their leaders to be

responsible  leaders  and  not  just  weaklings  or

stooges  of  the  Government,  as  they  are  often

accused  by  the Barisan Sosialis. So do  you  call

this an anti-labour Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was not sincere when he accused me of

being a Minister for Employers and that I tried  to

oppress the workers. He made mention of the Lim Yew

Hock  Government and of the anti-colonial movement.

I  went  to  gaol under the Lim Yew Hock Government

for  trying to propagate the cause of the  workers.

And where was the Member for Bras Basah then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In the Straits Times!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Only after the battle was

fought and after a pro-labour P.A.P. Government  is

safely in power do we start seeing N.T.U.C. leaders

appearing  one by one. Nowhere in this Bill  do  we

restrict  the right of the workers to go on  strike

or  to  take industrial action to settle a dispute.

All we ask is that, before taking such action, they

must take a secret ballot to ascertain the views of

the  Members. Why are they so excited and so afraid

of the secret ballot? Is it because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



are  afraid to face the Members; and that they have

no  confidence  that their call for  strike  action

would  be  carried in a secret ballot? In fact,  in

all  the  constitutions and rules of trade  unions,

there  is provision that any strike action must  be

produced by a secret ballot.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

seek clarification. The trade union leaders are not

afraid to take a secret ballot. But what I want  to

clarify is: how can we conduct a full secret ballot

when we have committed an offence under section 24A

(4) ?  If  all  the  bus workers were  to  attend  a

general meeting to take a secret ballot - and  this

section 24A (4) may be used by the employer -  this

action  may  be construed as an offence under  this

particular section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Any action under this Bill

would  be  taken by the Registrar of Trade  Unions,

and  I do not think he will be so foolish as to say

that  workers  attending  a  general  meeting   are

contradicting this Bill. So let me proceed, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that there is provision in the trade

unions'  constitutions that any strike action  must

be  preceded by a secret ballot. It is because this

provision  is  so often by-passed  and  flouted  by

irresponsible  trade  union  leaders  that  it   is

necessary  today  to  put  this  provision  in  the

statute book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Bras Basah is

speaking the truth when he says that the Government

is  anti-labour -[Interruption]. If  we  are  anti-labour, then why should we want to take the trouble

today   to  clear  the  trade  union  movement   of

criminals  and undesirable elements so  that  there

will be a clean and honest trade union movement  in

Singapore? It is because the N.T.U.C. in  the  past

was  saddled  with  several crooked  and  dishonest

leaders  that it was not possible for it to develop

as  fast  as  it should. I am not saying  that  the

present  leadership  of the  N.T.U.C. is  full  of

dishonest  and crooked leaders. They  are  quite  a

good  lot. We have helped to clear a few crooks  in

the  past, and if there are any more, then this law

will help to clear them further,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah also laments that the

number of organised workers has gone down in recent

years.  Is  the  Government to be blamed  when  the

N.T.U.C. is not working hard enough to win over the

workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Inefficiency!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Kampong

Kembangan   wants   us   to  include   undischarged

bankrupts and lunatics as persons undesirable to be

appointed as officials. I do not think we can -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of

clarification, Sir, I was saying that  undischarged

bankrupts and those of unsound mind should  not  be

allowed  to  hold office in trade unions.  But  the

Minister says that -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  who has misunderstood the Minister.  The

Minister  has just said that the Member  wants  the

exclusion of these persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> That is exactly the point.

The   Member   wants  us  to  include  undischarged

bankrupts  and  lunatics as persons undesirable  to

hold  office  in trade unions. I do  not  think  we

should  do all the work for the trade unions.  They

must  also  do some work themselves. The Government

can only prevent criminals and undesirable elements

in  a  wide sense from taking office. If there  are

other categories of undesirable elements, then  the

trade  unions  must remove them by  the  democratic

process of election. That is all they can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also worried that non-citizens

carrying work permits will not be allowed  to  work

in  trade  unions, and he wants  us  to  put  in  a

provision to exempt them if they are of any good. I

should  say  that  he  should not  worry  about  it

because  the provision is already there, in  clause

5, i.e. new section 26B (b) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister may by order -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) grant, either absolutely or subject to such

conditions as he may consider reasonably necessary,

exemption



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



from  all or any of the provisions of section  26

or 26A in respect of officers or employees...'.



<br><br>The power of exemption is already there, so he need

not be worried about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I should say that responsible

trade  union leaders should not be afraid  of  this

Bill.  They  should  answer the  challenge  of  the

workers  and lead them democratically  and  not  be

dictatorial as some leaders in the past were.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the Bill be now read a Second

and marginal note and insert -



<pre>

"Strike or         24A.-(i) A registered trade union

 industrial    shall not commence, promote, organise

 action.       or finance any strike or any  form of

               industrial action affecting the whole

               or any section of its members without

               obtaining  the   consent,  by  secret

               ballot,of the majority of the members

               so affected.".

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is to make it clear that before a

union  could  commence  a strike  or  any  form  of

industrial action, it has to obtain the consent  of

the  majority  of its members in the establishment.

It  is  not  the intention that the union concerned

has  to  obtain the consent of the majority of  the

total   members  of  the  union  working  in  other

establishments before it can commence a  strike  or

take  any form of industrial action in a particular

establishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original subsection (1) of section 24A could

be  interpreted to mean that before a  trade  union

could  commence  a  strike  or  take  any  form  of

industrial action, it has to obtain the consent  of

the majority of its entire membership. For example,

if  a  branch  of  a union has a  dispute  with  an

employer  in  a firm, the union could not  commence

any  strike or industrial action until it  has  the

consent of the majority of all its members. This is

not our intention and hence the new amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, after

the Minister for Labour has clarified the position,

I merely wish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



to  know  whether the consent, which requires  two-thirds,  includes workers who are  non-citizens  of

Singapore  but  are in possession of work  permits.

For  instance, in a branch which has voted to  take

industrial action by a secret ballot, 90  per  cent

of the workers agree to go on strike - only ten per

cent  do not agree. If, of the 90 per cent  who  so

agree, 60 per cent of those members who have  voted

are  non-citizens  of Singapore but,  nevertheless,

are holders of Singapore work permits, can such  an

action be considered right?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there any other query? There

does not appear to be any. Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

such restriction. Whether they are citizens or non-citizens holding work permits, so long as they  are

members of the union, they are entitled to vote and

the  result of the vote is valid. So I do not think

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan should  worry  on

this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to,



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out lines 23 to 32 inclusive

and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(4) For the purposes of this section "industrial

action"   means  the  adoption  of  any   practice,

procedure  or  method  in the performance  of  work

which  would  result in a limitation on  output  or

production  in  any  occupation,  service,   trade,

industry or business.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is to narrow down the definition

of  "industrial action" in the light  of  the  very

strong  objection from the N.T.U.C. to the original

definition.  The definition of "industrial  action"

here  will cover such practices as go-slow and work

to  rule.  I am sure Members will agree  that  such

forms  of  industrial action are even more damaging

than  a  complete  work  stoppage,  and  we  should

prevent  a small group of trade union leaders  from

taking  such industrial action without the  consent

of the majority of the members.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

wish to obtain clarification from the Minister  for

Labour. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



I  have  said  originally in connection  with  this

Bill,  if  members  of  a union  attend  a  general

meeting,  and considering particularly the  section

which  has been amended just now, can it be applied

to  accuse the union of contravening it within  the

meaning  of  the  words "limitation  on  output  or

production" as worded in the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have replied just now that

where a trade union is holding a general meeting of

the  members in order to decide by a secret  ballot

whether  or not there should be any strike  action,

of  course, this should not be taken as "industrial

action".  I  have  already  said  that  the  Labour

Ministry  is administering this Bill and I  do  not

think  our officials are so foolish as to say  that

the  holding of this genuine general meeting of the

workers is an industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 4 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

earlier  on I have said that in the enforcement  of

clause  3 (section 24A (1) ), there is no difference

between citizens and non-citizens of Singapore. But

under  this clause 4, a person who is not a citizen

of  Singapore  - it does not say whether  he  is  a

holder  or a non-holder of a work permit  -  cannot

become  an official of a trade union. The  Minister

for Labour has also said just now that every member

of  a union has democratic rights as a worker under

clause 3, new section 24A of this Bill. But in this

clause 4, however, members who are holders of  work

permits   are   denied   the   democratic   rights.

Therefore,  I suggest that the following  words  be

added  to  section 26 (1) (a) , "those who  are  not

citizens  of  Singapore  or  who  are  not  yet  in

possession of work permits." Just now the  Minister

for Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



has  also  said that trade union leaders  need  not

worry because he has his prerogative under clause 5

of  this  amendment  Bill, because  he  can  decide

whether  non-citizens of Singapore who are  holders

of  work permits can or cannot become officials  of

unions. Why cannot this be vice versa? That  is  to

say, if the Minister finds that the person is not a

citizen  of Singapore but is the holder of  a  work

permit,  then he can use his prerogative to  inform

the  union and ask the particular member  to  cease

being  an  official of the union.  So  I  hope  the

Minister can consider my amendment regarding  those

who  are not citizens of Singapore or those who are

not yet in possession of work permits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  it  is now possible to amend this  Bill  any

further.  I  hope the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

should not confuse citizens of Singapore with  non-citizens   who   are  holding  work  permits.   The

principle  of  this  Bill is to  exclude  any  non-citizen from taking part in the running of a  trade

union.  If  we  allow  non-citizens  holding   work

permits  to  be included, then the object  of  this

Bill will be defeated. But only in very exceptional

cases  can  the Minister by his power  exempt  such

persons  from this provision. So I do not think  we

can  accept the proposals put forward by the Member

for Kampong Kembangan.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Now, Sir. I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this is a very important

Bill which will affect all Muslims in the Republic,

and  so  that what I have to say in this  House  is

fully   understood   and   appreciated   by   them,

especially the Malays, I will speak in the national

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) The Administration of Muslim Law Bill,

which has been under consideration for a number  of

years,  was  referred  to  a  Select  Committee  in

January   1966   after   its   introduction    into

Parliament.  The closing period for the  submission

of  written representations on the Bill, originally

fixed   on   24th  January,  1966,  was  eventually

extended  to  the  31st March, 1966.  In  all,  18

written  representations  were  received  and  oral

evidence was heard from 14 of the representors. The

Bill  was subjected to close scrutiny not  only  by

Muslim  organisations and persons but also  by  the

Select  Committee  which had  the  benefit  of  the

advice not only of the Attorney-General but also of

Tuan Haji Mohamed Sanusi Bin Mahmood, the President

of the Shariah Court. The Bill was also referred to

a  number  of  Muslim scholars in England  and  the

United Arab Republic and it is hoped that the Bill,

while  it  may  not  satisfy  every  one,  will  be

welcomed  as  a  significant step  forward  in  the

regulation of Muslim religious affairs and  in  the

proper administration of Muslim law in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, it must be emphasised, does not seek to

deal  with the Muslim law itself but only with  its

administration. No attempt has been made  to  alter

the  fundamental concepts or rules of  Muslim  law

and where the Bill suggests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



improvements  in the administration of  the  Muslim

law,  every  effort  has been made  to  follow  the

precedents which have been adopted in other  Muslim

countries.  The  Bill,  in the  main,  follows  the

structure  of the various Administration of  Muslim

Law  enactments  in the States in Western  Malaysia

and  it  has  also  followed  the  changes  in  the

administration of Muslim law in the Arab  countries

and in Pakistan and, in this respect, represents  a

considerable    advance    towards    the    better

administration  of  the  law  and  the  removal  of

discriminations and abuses in such administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to constitute a Council of Muslim

Religion   which  will  be  responsible   for   the

regulation   of   Muslim   religious   affairs   in

Singapore.  Most  of  the representations  received

dealt with the composition of the Council and  many

would  like it to be a fully elected body  entirely

free  from  any  control or supervision.  This,  no

doubt,  would be an ideal to which all of us should

strive. But those who are aware of the position  in

Singapore and of how easily religious issues can be

used  or abused to create division, dissatisfaction

and civil strife must agree that, to begin with, at

any   rate,   there  must  be  some   control   and

supervision, not necessarily by the Government  but

by  the more stable elements in Muslim society. The

Bill  therefore  provides for an  equal  number  of

elected and appointed members - and this is  indeed

in  line  with the composition of the  Councils  of

Muslim  religion in the States of Malaysia. In  the

present stage of Muslim society in Singapore, also,

it  would  appear  that election  from  the  Muslim

registered  societies  in Singapore  will  not,  in

fact,  provide a representative body  in  Singapore

and  the  power of the President to appoint members

will  enable  the  Majlis to be a body  more  fully

representative  of the Muslims of  Singapore.  This

will  be  the  first  time  that  the  Muslims   of

Singapore  will  have  a  body  to  regulate  their

religious  affairs. The Council of Muslim  Religion

will  have considerable executive powers  and  will

not  be  merely  an advisory body like  the  Muslim

Advisory  Board. It appears to be wise  caution  to

ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



that the powers of the Council are not abused, that

it  will be an executive body whose sole purpose is

to  serve the interests of the Muslims of Singapore

and  that  it  will not be used for  any  personal,

sectional or political purposes. On behalf  of  the

Government,  I  should like to give  the  assurance

that no political influence will be made to bear on

the  Council. All that the Government is interested

in  is  to  see that the affairs of the Muslims  in

Singapore  are entrusted to a wise, forward-looking

and stable organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Council, as I have said,

will   have  considerable  executive  powers.  Some

representors  would like to deny the Council  these

powers and, in effect, to leave the organisation of

Muslim  society very much as it is at present.  The

power  of  the  Majlis to arrange for  the  orderly

collection  and  distribution of  zakat  and  zakat

fitrah  has,  for  example,  been  criticized.   At

present,  zakat  fitrah is collected  not  only  by

Muslim      societies,     including      political

organisations,  but also by individuals.  There  is

duplication  and  wastage of  resources.  If  zakat

fitrah  were properly collected, a sum of  $100,000

can be collected each year and this will provide an

effective  fund  for  the  relief  of  poverty  and

distress  among  the  Muslims  in  Singapore.  Some

representors again would deny the Majlis the powers

in relation to charitable foundations which are now

possessed by the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board.

The  Bill,  it  is true, provides that  the  Majlis

shall have power to take over the administration of

any  Muslim  charitable endowment, if it  is  shown

that  this  is  to the advantage of the  endowment.

This power is already possessed, as I said, by  the

Muslim  and  Hindu  Endowments  Board.  It  is  not

contemplated that the Council will be able to  take

over the administration of all Muslim endowments in

Singapore;  most of them will still  be  under  the

control  of  private trustees but  subject  to  the

supervision  of the Council and with power  to  the

Council  to  remove the trustees  and  appoint  new

trustees,   where  such  a  step  appears   to   be

necessary.  I  should like to  emphasise  that  the

Council will be a Muslim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



organisation,  whose  members  should  and  can  be

trusted to ensure that the interests of the Muslims

will be safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks also to strengthen the powers of

the  Shariah Court in Singapore and to provide  for

the   better  administration  of  Muslim   law   in

Singapore. A Mufti will be appointed and he will be

the  Chairman  of a Committee of the Council  which

will  be  empowered to give rulings on Muslim  law.

The  administration of the law relating to marriage

and divorce has been further strengthened following

the  precedents in the Arab countries and Pakistan,

and  the Bill will provide that the Muslim law will

apply  not  only  to  the  distribution  of  Muslim

estates on intestacy but also to testate succession

among  Muslims. In all these matters, the views  of

the representors have been given full consideration

and the Bill has, in fact, been amended to meet the

representations made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many respects, the Bill represents a

compromise.  On  the minimum age of  marriage,  for

example,  some representations would like  the  age

increased to eighteen; others would prefer  not  to

have  a  minimum age of marriage. The Bill provides

that the minimum age shall be 16 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it has not been possible to please

everybody  and  to  accept all the  representations

made, it is hoped that the Bill will be welcomed as

one   more  step  -  a  significant  step - in   the

regulation  of  Muslim affairs and  in  the  proper

administration of Muslim law in Singapore. The Bill

also  represents  a significant advance  in  social

legislation for the protection of women, and it  is

hoped   that  Muslim  women  will,  in  particular,

welcome  the  Bill. The Bill has not, it  is  true,

given  the  Muslim women all the  benefits  of  the

Women's Charter, 1961, but in itself and within its

limitations  it  represents  a  charter  which  has

restored to Muslim women their rights of which  for

long they have been deprived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

every  law  that  is  enacted  cannot  satisfy  all

sections  of  the  people.  The  Administration  of

Muslim  Law Bill, which is now being read  a  Third

time  today, does not amend the Muslim law  itself,

but  it  is  a Bill to administer Muslim law.  Here

arises   misunderstanding  among  members  of   the

public, because the States in Malaysia, who are our

immediate neighbours, have established Councils  of

Muslim  Religion to administer the  Muslim  law  in

their States. It is appropriate that Singapore,  as

their  immediate neighbour, should have  a  similar

law. Furthermore, in addition to being a neighbour,

we have maintained close contacts with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parts of the Muslim law have been taken from

Muslim  laws  implemented in Western  Malaysia  and

which,  I  believe, before their enforcement,  have

been  given careful consideration by the Ulamas  in

their  respective States and which have  eventually

been  approved by the State Assemblies.  To  be  in

line  with our neighbours, it can be said that more

than  80 per cent, or more than 100 clauses in this

Bill  have  been  taken from  States  like  Penang,

Selangor  and  Pahang, and the remainder  from  the

Muslims Ordinance, 1957, which is in force  at  the

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the speech of the Minister for Social

Affairs   which  says  that  this  Bill   will   be

implemented  in stages. The most important  is  the

setting  up  of  a  Council of Muslim  Religion,  a

Mufti, and a Council of Rulings, or Fetua. It is up

to  the  Legal Committee and the Council of  Muslim

Religion  to put up recommendations to the Minister

concerned if they find it necessary to amend  parts

of  the Bill. I am sure that the Minister in charge

will give due consideration if such amendments  are

found necessary in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On principle, and for the reasons stated above, I

fully support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion

"That  the  Bill  be now read a  Third  time."  The

Government  has  given full opportunity  to  Muslim

bodies and Muslims individually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



to  study  the  Bill, which has been  deferred  for

about   four  years.  We  need  the  Bill   to   be

implemented early, because our first object  is  to

administer smoothly the Muslim law in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had an assurance from the Minister for

Social Affairs that the Bill does not touch on  the

fundamental concepts of Islam. Therefore, those who

accuse  that this Bill is contrary to the interests

of Islam are wrong. They do so deliberately with  a

view to misleading the Muslim population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the passing of this Bill in the

Republic   will   be  one  step  further   in   the

advancement of Muslim affairs. It is true that this

Bill  cannot  satisfy all sections  of  the  Muslim

population, but I am sure that when the Council  of

Muslim Religion is set up, its implementation  will

be  examined from time to time to fit in  with  the

changing times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Muslim population in the Republic

will  give their full support in the implementation

of  this Bill. I wish to emphasise that the  Select

Committee  of  Parliament has carefully  considered

representations  on  the  Bill,  both  verbal   and

written,  and these have been incorporated  in  the

Bill.  There  is  no  truth  whatsoever  that   the

Government  has ignored or neglected representation

from Muslim bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also given the assurance that this Bill, when approved, will be implemented stage by stage. This is proper procedure because the provisions in the Bill can be examined from time to time. I wish to reiterate that only a minority of the Muslim population are opposed to this Bill, and

I know that their opposition is not in the interest

of Muslims but in their own self-interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the Third Reading of

the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, for

many  years,  people of Muslim faith  in  Singapore

have  been waiting for this Bill to be read a Third

time when it was referred to a Select Committee.  I

believe that the Muslims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore will now be at ease on the passing of

this Bill. I am also sure that there will be groups

dissatisfied with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aim of the Bill is to protect and

safeguard  all Muslims as a whole in our  Republic.

But  those  Muslims who are at a disadvantage  with

the  passing of this Bill will be dissatisfied with

it.  However,  Mr  Speaker, we  must  protect  and

safeguard the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the assurance of the Minister for

Social Affairs that the implementation of the  Bill

will  be  carried  out  stage  by  stage.  This  is

practical  and wise, because this is a  Bill  which

affects  Muslims  as  a  whole.  Therefore,  it  is

necessary  for us to examine it from time  to  time

with a view to improving it. I am sure that it will

satisfy all Muslims in Singapore in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Speaker, whilst welcoming

the   Minister's   assurance  that   it   will   be

implemented  stage  by stage, I hope  an  assurance

will also be given by him to appoint members to the

Council  when the time comes. I hope he  will  once

again use his discretion so that political elements

will  not  be  appointed to the Council,  including

those  from  the  ruling Party.  In  this  way  the

Council  will  comprise  persons  who  are   really

conversant with Muslim law, so that it will not  be

used as a political platform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, that if the Minister in

charge  can  judiciously implement this  Bill,  the

majority  of  Muslims will have confidence  in  it.

However,  there  will  be  Muslims  who   will   be

dissatisfied because they will be at a disadvantage

or  because  they  may  not  be  appointed  to  the

Council. No person in this world can satisfy  every

member of his community, but what we can do  is  to

satisfy the great majority of the community.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Administration of Muslim Law  Bill  was  first

introduced in 1960. At that time, the Bill  was  in

English  and there was a Malay rendition,  We  must

also remember, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  that  in 1960 the P.A.P. was  in  power.

Prior  to  that,  there was an Alliance  Government

which  included  political  Parties  like  U.M.N.O.

Since the P.A.P. Government introduced the Bill  in

1960, representations have been put forward by  the

Muslim community. Today we will be taking the  Bill

through  its  Third Reading. Over a period  of  six

years  -  six  years is a long period - opportunity

was  given  to  the Muslim population to  consider,

examine, and decide upon the Bill which affects the

Muslim community. Certainly, Mr Speaker, this Bill

seeks to put right the administration of Muslim law

which   is   being  administered  by  the   Muslims

themselves.  By  Muslims, I  mean  those  qualified

Muslims  who  are holders of diplomas and  who  are

very  conversant with Muslim law. They are  experts

in  the Muslim law, and will remove persons who use

the Muslim religion for their own self-interest  or

for   their  own  monetary  interest  -  like   the

collection  of  zakat fitrah  -  and  not  for  the

interest of the Muslim community. It follows  that,

from  the  point  of view of the Muslim  community,

there  exist persons who misuse religion,  as,  for

instance,  the  collection of zakat fitrah  not  in

accordance  with  the  Muslim  law.  According   to

today's  newspapers  - the Straits  Times  and  the

Utusan  Melayu - U.M.N.O, has expressed  its  views

which,  inter alia, support the Bill in  principle.

U.M.N.O. has emphasised on the membership  of  the

Council  of Muslim Religion. That is the  worry  of

U.M.N.O. There is no other worry as far as they are

concerned.  In  the  Utusan  Melayu  today,  it  is

mentioned  that the Select Committee  has  rejected

U.M.N.O. proposals. It has been mentioned  earlier

on  by  the Minister for Social Affairs that, among

the   representations,  the  Select  Committee  has

accepted  some.  What  the  Select  Committee   has

rejected  is  that we do not want  members  of  the

Muslim religion in Singapore who are unqualified in

matters relating to Muslim law. These members  must

be  holders of recognised diplomas from an  Islamic

university. The Government want such people  to  be

members of the Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there are U.M.N.O. leaders

who  are  qualified  and who  have  graduated  from

Islamic  universities, and if they are  anxious  to

sit  on  the Council, they are at liberty to submit

their applications to the authorities concerned. If

there  is any member of U.M.N.O. who has been  left

out  and who is aspiring to be the President of the

Council of Muslim Religion, if he is qualified  and

in    possession   of   the   requisite    academic

qualifications, the Government will not hesitate to

appoint such a person. The object of the Government

is  to  appoint  suitably qualified persons.  There

should  be no worry from U.M.N.O. because our  real

aim  is to protect and promote the Muslim community

so  that  they  will not be duped  by  persons  who

misuse   this  religion  for  their  own  political

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Mr Speaker, Sir, political Parties in

the  opposition want to hinder the passage  of  the

Bill  because it has been brought out  by  a  Party

which   does  not  play  on  religion,   like   our

opposition  political Parties. Yet we are  prepared

to  protect the interest of the people of Singapore

irrespective  of  race, colour  or  creed.  We  are

responsible  for  the Republic of  Singapore  as  a

whole. That is all, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.
