<br><br><div align="center"><b>(Assents to Bills Passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to report that on the 30th

day of December, 1965, the President of the Republic  of

Singapore assented to the following Bills:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Guardianship of Infants (Amendment) Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Widows' and Orphans' Pension (Amendment) Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Corporation Duty (Amendment) Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Stamp (Amendment) Bill; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Estate Duty (Amendment) Bill.

<div align="center"><b>TAPAH STREET</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Plans to alleviate flooding)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr P.

Govindaswamy ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development whether the Government is aware that during

heavy rains Cheng Cheok Street and Tapah Street  are

flooded and whether the Government has any plans  to

remedy the situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the absence of Mr P. Govindaswamy, may I ask Question

No. 1?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Government is aware that during heavy  rains,

Cheng  Cheok  Street and Tapah Street are  flooded.  The

levels of the two streets are some three feet below high

water  during spring tide. This gives rise  to  flooding

when  heavy  rains  occur at the time  of  spring  tide.

Flooding  is  further  aggravated by  rubbish  from  the

nearby  market  in Narcis Street which regularly  chokes

the roadside drains. This flooding in Cheng Cheok Street

and Tapah Street is not considered to be serious, as  it

occurs  only  when  a heavy shower falls  during  spring

tide.  It  is also difficult to do much in  the  way  of

flood alleviation because the area is fully built-up and

densely populated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide statutory

clause 2 of Article 87 of the Constitution of Singapore

for  certain  additional provisions for  expenditure  in

excess  of the provisions for expenditure authorised  by

the  Supply Ordinance. These additional sums which  were

<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the

year 1966 have been considered and approved by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



House as Cmd. Paper 25 of 1965. Under Section 85 of  the

Constitution  of  Singapore, Heads of Expenditure  other

than   statutory  expenditure  to  be   met   from   the

Consolidated Fund have to be included in a  Bill  to  be

known as a Supply Bill. The purpose of such a Bill is to

provide for the issue from the Consolidated Fund of  the

sums   necessary  to  meet  the  expenditure   and   the

appropriation  of those sums for the purposes  specified

therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give legislative

approval  for  the issue of funds from the  Consolidated

Fund  to  meet  the  sums of expenditure  shown  in  the

Estimates  of Expenditure for 1966. In the  Schedule  to

the  Bill are shown the various heads of expenditure and

the  sums that may be incurred in respect of each  head.

These  have been approved by the House in the  Estimates

of Expenditure for 1966 and appear in pages 53 and 54 of

Paper Cmd. 25 of 1965. Once the Supply Bill is approved,

I  will  be  empowered  to  issue  warrants  authorising

expenditure up to the amount under each Head as shown in

the Bill to be paid out from the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Prime  Minister is subject to the consent of the Speaker

and  the  general assent of the Members now  present.  I

give my consent. May I take it that the House gives  its

general assent to the Minister moving the Motion?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The Motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House appoints a Committee of Selection with Mr.Speaker

in the chair and the following members:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh Chin Chye

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche A. Rahim Ishak

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr K. C. Lee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ho Cheng Choon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Chee Seng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kow Kee Seng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to draw

the attention of the House to Standing Order 92 (1) (b):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(b) The Committee of Selection shall consist of the

Speaker  as Chairman, and seven Members of the  Assembly

to be appointed by the Assembly, in such manner as shall

ensure  that, so far as is possible, the balance between

the Government benches and the Opposition benches in the

Assembly is reflected in the Committee.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason provided for in the Standing Order

that I have included two names, Mr Kow Kee Seng and Mr

Chia  Thye  Poh,  from  the Opposition  benches  in  the

Committee of Selection, although the Opposition  Members

have  absented themselves from this House. I  have  also

written  to both Mr Kow Kee Seng and Mr Chia Thye  Poh

asking  them  whether they would want to  serve  in  the

Committee  of Selection in keeping with the requirements

of  Standing Order 92 (1) (b). However, neither of  them

has  had  the  courtesy to reply. There  has  been  dead

silence from both of them. But I feel that the functions

and  the  workings  of this Legislature  should  not  be

paralysed  by the unco-operative attitude of Members  of

the  Opposition.  Neither should it be  held  to  ransom

simply  because Members of the Opposition take  it  into

their  heads  that  they  have  their  own  reasons  for

absenting themselves from the House. Therefore, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



spite  of the fact that the Opposition has not  made  an

appearance  in this Chamber, I have, in accordance  with

the  requirements of Standing Order 92 (1) (b), included

the names of Mr Kow Kee Seng and Mr Chia Thye Poh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

That this House appoints a Committee of Selection with Mr.Speaker

in the chair and the following members:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh Chin Chye

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche A. Rahim Ishak

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr K. C. Lee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ho Cheng Choon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Chee Seng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kow Kee Seng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [30th

December, 1965], "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the trade unions would like to  be  given

extensive  power  under Section 77 of the  Ordinance  to

prosecute  the employers whenever they are found  to  be

victimising  their workers. But I am  not  sure  whether

this will do any good to the trade union movement in the

long run. For one thing, there is no guarantee that  the

powers  so given will not be abused. If the trade  union

movement  only consists of persons like the  Member  for

Bras  Basah  and  the Member for Telok Blangah  who  are

reasonable and intelligent people, then there need be no

worry. But ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order or on a point of

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In my speech yesterday, I did not ask

the  Minister  for Labour to give the trade  unions  the

power to prosecute employers when employers dismiss  the

workers. What we are asking under section 77 is that the

Ordinance  be  simplified as we have  come  across  many

cases  of  victimisation  and  we  have  found  it  very

difficult to bring the employers to book. What makes the

procedure  cumbersome is this, Sir. Undue  emphasis  has

been  placed  on the reference to the Public  Prosecutor

for  his  opinion on whether the prosecution  is  to  be

instituted or not. The whole point is that we  want  the

Ordinance to be simplified. We do not want to be so very

unreasonable as to prosecute employers as soon  as  they

dismiss the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have not come to that story yet.

I will give it later. I am inclined to believe that most

of the unions affiliated to the N.T.U.C. are reasonable.

They  are  led by responsible leaders and they will  not

abuse  the power. But I am not so sure about the  unions

which  are  not  affiliated to the N.T.U.C.,  especially

when  they  are  assisted by Lenin-styled lawyers.  Once

this power is given, I am quite sure they will abuse  it

to  the full and bring our economic system to a grinding

halt.  In  fact, they are already doing  this  now  even

without the help of this power. What will happen if this

power is given to them will be unimaginable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another point. A man who has invested

his  money  in  a  shop or a firm or a factory  and  has

become  an employer would like to be given some  freedom

of  what  is  called "Hire and fire". If every  time  he

dismisses a worker, whether on genuine grounds  or  not,

he is to be hauled up in court to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



answer  charges of victimisation, life would  be  indeed

quite  miserable for him. In fact, the N.T.U.C. at  one

time  earlier  had wanted to lay down in  the  Ordinance

that the employer has to go to gaol once he is convicted

under section 77. What would the employer think of  this

if  every  time he sacks a man he has to go to gaol  for

it? How would he maintain discipline in his factory? If,

in  these circumstances, a man still wants to invest his

money here and open up factories to benefit our workers,

then  I  think  he  must have his head examined  at  the

Woodbridge Hospital. So it is no wonder that  when  this

proposal  of  the N.T.U.C. was put up to the  Employers'

Federation, there was an uproar from the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in a very delicate position.

We  are  a  pro-labour Government and we  want  to  make

everything easy for the workers. But, on the other hand,

we  must also protect the interests of the employers  so

that  they  are not unduly persecuted and do  not  start

running away. On the one side, there is this demand from

the N.T.U.C., and on the other, there is this resistance

from  the employers. We must strike a balance somewhere,

and  I  say the compromise is in clause 22 of the  Bill.

There  were extensive discussions among Mr Devan  Nair,

the  Attorney-General,  officials  in  my  Ministry  and

myself   before  we  finally  put  in  this   amendment.

Hitherto,  a  complaint of victimisation is reported  to

the  police and they will investigate it from the police

point  of  view. They seldom secure enough  evidence  to

initiate  proceedings. But after this amendment,  it  is

provided  that  a  complaint of this  nature  should  be

referred  to the Commissioner for Labour. He  will  then

investigate the case from the industrial angle. If he is

satisfied  that  there is evidence of victimisation,  he

will inform the Public Prosecutor and proceedings can be

initiated. In this way, we are able to sieve through all

the  cases  before they go to the court. Otherwise,  our

courts will be jammed up with all kinds of complaints of

victimisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exact copy of this Bill was forwarded to the

N.T.U.C. on 14th September, 1965. For nearly four months

it  was lying in the office of the N.T.U.C. and we  have

not heard from them that there is something wrong in the

Bill.  Based on this copy which we had forwarded to  the

N.T.U.C.,  the  then Secretary-General of the  N.T.U.C.,

Mr  Devan  Nair, has this to say in his report  to  the

N.T.U.C. Second Annual Conference in October this  year,

and I quote, in page 18 ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From the same paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes, in the same report. In page

18, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A close study of the Bill will show that the

N.T.U.C. can feel justifiable pride at having  secured

progressive  amendments  to  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  in  the interest of industrial  justice  and

fair play.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the personal opinion of Mr Devan Nair, for

this  report  was unanimously adopted by  the  N.T  U.C.

Conference in front of trade union leaders from the

Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the remarks made by the Member for Bras

Basah  when  he raised a query on whether  the  proposed

section  15A  would  restrict the  Minister's  right  to

intervene in any dispute between an employer and a trade

union  which has lost out on a secret ballot.  The  hon.

Member  need  not  have  any fear  on  this  score.  The

proposed  amendments  do not in  any  way  restrict  the

Minister's  power, and I can assure the  Member  that  I

still  have  the  power to direct any trade  dispute  to

arbitration  by the Industrial Arbitration  Court  under

section 28 (b) of the Industrial Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Member for Telok Blangah's complaint

that  the 14 days' limit for making an appeal against  a

referee's  decision, as provided for in  sub-clause  (6)

of  clause  18, it is apparent that he is not conversant

with  the procedure of the Industrial Arbitration  Court

in  this matter. I would like to enlighten him that  the

current  practice  of the Court is to  insist  that  all

referee's decisions should be handed down in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



writing  either  by  the  referee  himself  or  to   the

Registrar at the direction of the Court. A copy  of  the

written  decision  of  the referee is  immediately  made

available to the parties concerned. The regulations that

will  be  prescribed  for  appeal  will  lay  down   the

procedure  for  appeal step by step beginning  with  the

notice  of  appeal. Once the notice of appeal  has  been

filed within 14 days under sub-clause (6) of clause  18,

the  court  will  proceed  to make  available  the  full

transcript of the referee's proceedings together with  a

copy of the referee's decision and all relevant exhibits

to  enable  the  appellant to prepare  his  petition  of

appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the Court has not laid down any time limit for

the  appellant  to submit his petition  of  appeal,  but

eventually this will be regulated. I, therefore, fail to

see  the  necessity for the amendment  proposed  by  the

Member.  In view of this, I see no necessity for  either

an  employer or a union to employ stenographers  at  its

own  expense to take down court proceedings for its  own

use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Jek Yeun Thong]

15,  the  Member does not wish to say anything then.  Is

that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Clause 16.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Up to clause 15, you are all right. You

have no amendments to move?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Clause 16 of the

Bill provides for a trade union to submit claims on

the employer, but we often come across employers who,

on receiving claims from the unions, embark on an

action of dismissal or retrenchment, and we have

submitted proposed amendments to the Labour Ministry ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member just want to speak on

the clause, or does he want to move an amendment to it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I want to move an amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member move the amendment? Let

us see what is the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> My amendment is that in clause 16 an

amendment  be introduced that any employer on  receiving

claims  served  by  the union shall not  embark  on  any

action to retrench or dismiss the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member have it in writing?

Could he give it to me in writing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have not got it in writing, but I

can write it down.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, on a point of order. Should not the hon. Member

seek  the general assent of the House to introduce  this

amendment  if  he  wants to move  an  amendment  without

giving notice?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Procedurally, the Minister is perfectly

correct. I have received no notice of amendment, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



the Member for Bras Basah will not be allowed to move an

amendment unless he has the general assent of the House.

I  just want the Member to produce his amendment so that

I can put it to the House and find out whether they want

to  give general assent. But if the feeling of the House

is  that  no  general assent is going to be forthcoming,

that might very well be the end of that amendment.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that I

would  not  like  to  accept  the  amendment  from   the

N.T.U.C.,  but I have already said that a copy  of  this

very  Bill  was  given  to  the  N.T.U.C. on  the  14th

September. It has been lying in their office for  almost

three months, and if the Member thinks that there is any

reason for any amendment, he should have given it to  us

in  the Labour Ministry so that we could have studied it

properly and accepted it if agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we cannot just accept any amendments to

this  Bill,  because this Bill will become law  for  our

industries. If we start accepting amendments without any

notice,  it would make our laws very loose and difficult

to administer.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I gather then that the House is not

ready  to  give  its assent to the Member  to  move  his

amendment without notice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, I consider this

amendment is very vital to the workers. So when I submit

it to you, Mr Speaker, you can put it to the House. And

if the House rejects this amendment of mine, then I will

withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think we have not reached the

stage where we are to discuss the merits or demerits  of

the  proposed amendment. We are considering whether  the

Member  should,  after having been  given  a  very  long

notice, specifically as Chairman of the N.T.U.C., spring

an  amendment at the last minute in this House.  If  the

Member  says  that it is a very vital  matter,  then  it

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



have been attended to long ago. In principle, I think it

is  bad  to  introduce amendments without notice,  where

Members  of  the House would not have been  given  every

opportunity  to  consider them, and I  will  oppose  the

introduction of any amendment to this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That finishes that. Mr Ho, you do not

have  the  general assent of the House, and in  view  of

that, your amendment cannot be moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, I,

as  a Member of this House, would like to give my assent

to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. It must have general assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One vote!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, all that I can do for you is

that  I will propose the Question that the clause  stand

part of the Bill, and you can have your full say on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, I am obliged.

But  since I cannot get general assent of this House,  I

do  not  want  either to speak on it  or  introduce  any

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 to 23 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has given notice of two

amendments  which appear in the Order Paper  Supplement.

Now,  before I call upon the Minister to move his  first

amendment,  I would like to draw his attention  to  what

appears to be a clerical error in lines 2 and 3  of  the

clause. Sub-clause (1) of clause 24 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The following sections of the Ordinance are hereby

amended  by  deleting  the expression  "State

Advocate-General" wherever they appear...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be a grammatical error in `the

expression "State Advocate-General"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



wherever  they appear ...'.  We  had  a  similar

mistake previously. I wonder if the Minister will  agree

to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in view of the drafting of sub-clause (2) and the

proposed  new  sub-clause (3) in the  Minister's  second

amendment  where  the word "words" is used  rather  than

"expression", perhaps the Minister may wish to  consider

proposing an amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 2, to leave out "expression" and there

insert "words".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is done, then the whole section will tie up

properly with the same word being used all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister agrees, the amendment requires my

consent  and  the general assent of Members  present.  I

give my consent. Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that

the amendment be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: In page 9, line 2, to leave out

"expression" and there insert "words". - [Mr  Jek  Yeun

Thong].



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, I wonder whether in the

fourth line the word "expression" should also be changed

to  "words". After the amendment just now, I think  that

if the whole clause were to read properly, then the word

"expression" should be changed to "words", so  that  the

clause will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...by deleting the words "State Advocate-General"

wherever  they appear therein and substituting  therefor

the words "Attorney-General":-'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that not be more consistent?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister agree to that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I seek your consent and the

general assent of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is all right. There is nothing wrong

with it, neither is the "expression".



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 4, to leave out "expression" and there

insert "words".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think "Attorney-General" is a compound

word, and therefore it should be "word".



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I am sorry.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has my consent to move his

amendment. Has it the general assent of the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

"expression"  and  there insert "word"  -[Mr  Jek  Yeun

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 5, after "60 (1),", to insert "61 (1),".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an oversight in drafting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, after line 11, to add -

hereby  amended by deleting the words "Yang  di-Pertuan

therefor  the words "President of Singapore"  -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 2, 3 (1), 5 (1), 15 (1), 28 (c) and 30.'.

changes recently introduced to our Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Singapore became a sovereign Republic,

independent of Malaysia, certain amendments have  become

necessary  to the Probate and Administration  Ordinance,

and these are contained in clauses 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



15  of the Bill. The opportunity has also been taken  to

make  other long-awaited amendments to fill in some gaps

in the law relating to probate and administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at Common Law the personal estate of

an  intestate in England vested in the church and realty

vested in the heir-at-law till letters of administration

were  granted. The Administration of Estates Act,  1925,

of  the  United  Kingdom, which  is  not  applicable  in

Singapore,  vests  the real and personal  estate  of  an

intestate until administration is granted in the Probate

Judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore it is assumed that the estate of an

intestate  vests  in all the Judges of  the  High  Court

pending  the  grant  of administration.  Clause  5  will

clarify the legal position by vesting the estate  of  an

intestate in the Chief Justice between the death of  the

intestate and the grant of letters of administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes to add to section 54 of the

Ordinance  a proviso to make it clear that the  Official

Assignee  can,  in urgent cases, apply  for  letters  of

administration  within six months of the  death  of  the

deceased. At present it would appear that he has to wait

for  six months to elapse from the death of the deceased

person  before  applying  for  probate  or  letters   of

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 propose to introduce detailed

provisions  for the administration of the  assets  of  a

deceased  person  whether  the  estate  is  solvent   or

insolvent  at the death of the deceased, and to  provide

for  the manner in which charges on the property of  the

deceased are to be paid. These provisions are taken from

the  United Kingdom Administration of Estate Act,  1925.

They  also  appear  in  the Probate  and  Administration

Ordinance, 1959, of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 60 of the Probate and Administration

Ordinance,  the  Official Assignee  may  administer  the

estate  of  any  person  who dies  leaving  property  in

Singapore  not  exceeding $2,000  in  value,  as  though

letters of administration had been granted to him. Since

the introduction of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance

and other legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



for the benefit of the workers, most people in Singapore

die leaving property worth more than $2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for the summary administration of

estates  not exceeding $10,000 in value by the  Official

Assignee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 proposes to give the Official Assignee power

to  pay  for a minor's maintenance, education or benefit

out  of property not exceeding $10,000 in value held  by

him  upon trust for such minor out of income or  capital

in   his  sole  discretion.  At  present,  the  Official

Assignee  has  power  to pay for a minor's  maintenance,

education and benefit when the property so held  by  him

does  not  exceed  $1,000.  Clause  13  also  gives  the

Official Assignee exemption from the necessity of giving

notice  of distribution of property of less than $5,000,

but  such  exemption will not free the Official Assignee

from any obligation to make the usual searches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 enables the Official Assignee to conclude

the administration of an estate within a reasonable time

by paying the undistributed funds to the Public Trustee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been referred to the

Singapore Bar Committee who support all its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill he now  read

a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the income Tax Ordinance

include  a  number  of textual changes  and  changes  of

terminology   taking  account  of  the   separation   of

Singapore   from   Malaysia  and  the  independent   and

sovereign  status  of the Republic. In  particular,  the

jurisdiction  of the Malaysian Board of Income  Tax  and

the Comptroller-General of Inland Revenue will no longer

extend to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in clause 29 will restore certain

personal  reliefs  for  individual  taxpayers  to

pre-Malaysia  levels. For instance, earned income relief  is

to  be increased from one-tenth of the income earned  to

one-fifth, subject to a maximum of $1,000; the deduction

from  chargeable income for life insurance premiums  and

provident  fund  contributions is to be  increased  from

$3,000  to $4,000 or one-sixth of the assessable income;

married women are to he permitted again to elect to have

assessment  of the income tax liability on their  earned

income  separate  from  their husbands;  but  children's

allowances  will  be  limited  to  a  maximum  of   five

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the higher pre-Malaysia rate of tax

on  individuals whose chargeable income exceeds $100,000

is to be restored by clause 59 to 55 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to plug loopholes in the

existing  legislation  to  render  more  effective   the

administration  of  the  revenue  laws  generally.   For

instance,  clause  5  will  make  it  possible  for  the

Comptroller   of   Income  Tax  to   disclose   official

information  to  the Comptroller of Property  Tax  where

such  information  may be required for  the  purpose  of

property tax collection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 14, power is to he given to the

Comptroller to take possession of documents  in  certain

circumstances where offences have been or are likely  to

be  committed,  e.g, where false books of accounts  have

been kept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8, a new provision is introduced to

enlarge  the scope of the charging provisions, rendering

liable  to tax miscellaneous forms of income in  respect

of which no specific provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



now  exists. A further amendment in clause 8 limits  the

exemption in respect of the net annual value of an

owner-occupied  house  to  $3,000  which  would  provide   for

additional  tax  liability in respect  of  those  owning

expensive residences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 12, the Comptroller is to be empowered to

curtail  the deduction allowable where a taxpayer  makes

abnormal   payments  of  salaries  or  wages  to   close

relatives,  e.g, wife, husband or child, which  are  not

bona fide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent Republic, double taxation

arrangements will he entered into with other  countries,

and in clause 5 provision is to be made for the exchange

of official information with the taxation authorities of

other  countries with which double taxation arrangements

exist to prevent tax evasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent upon the separation from Malaysia, the tin

profits  tax provisions are to be repealed by  clause  9

and  such  profits will be charged income tax under  the

relevant Malaysian legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 11, the liability for tax of income

derived  in Sabah and Sarawak is to be restored  to  the

extent that it is remitted to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with Government's policy to encourage

industrialisation  and market development,  certain  new

provisions have been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 14, a new provision has been made to

allow   a   further  deduction  in  respect  of   market

development expenditure overseas and for increased local

advertisement expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 provides for the Minister to vary the rate

of  initial  allowance which may be given in respect  of

plant   and  machinery  by  Order,  thus  allowing   for

flexibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 introduces a special incentive allowance in

respect   of   plant  and  machinery  used  in   various

manufacturing industries whereby the cost may be written

off after three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent upon the full independence of Singapore,

the former combined income provisions, whereby Singapore

and  States of Malaya residents were assessed  in  their

places of residence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



irrespective of where they derived their income, are  no

longer appropriate and are repealed by clause 56.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain consequential provisions are made necessary by

such repeal to prevent hardship arising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 23, residents in the States of Malaya who

continue carrying on business in Singapore will  receive

capital  allowances under the Singapore  Ordinance  from

1966,  together  with  the  carry-forward  benefit  from

previous  years  to which they were entitled  under  the

States of Malaya legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 27, provision is made for assessment on a

continuing  basis  in Singapore from 1966  of  State  of

Malaya taxpayers deriving income in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made under clause 28 for the

carry-forward  of  the  benefit of the  loss  provision  where

States of Malaya taxpayers continue to derive income  in

Singapore  and have accrued losses previously agreed  in

the   States   of  Malaya  under  the  combined   income

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these immediate relieving measures,

more  detailed provisions will be provided in  a  Double

Taxation Agreement with Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is two-fold. In the first

place,    the   Bill   seeks   to   implement    certain

recommendations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



the  Prisons  Inquiry Commission which was appointed  in

November  1959  and,  among  other  things,  recommended

reform   of   the  existing  legislation  dealing   with

destitute persons. Under the Vagrancy Ordinance (Chapter

125),  no distinction is made between destitute  persons

and  petty criminals, who are all broadly classified  as

vagrants  and  may he committed to a house of  detention

maintained by the Prisons Department in the precincts of

a  prison  under  the provisions of the  Ordinance.  The

Prisons  Inquiry Commission recommended  in  its  report

published in 1960 that no person should be committed to

a  prison because of destitution, that destitute persons

should  be  kept  in  welfare homes run  by  the  Social

Welfare  Department  as  part  of  the  State's  Welfare

services, and that their admission to these homes should

be   through  the  Social  Welfare  Department  and  not

normally  through a court sentence, as  is  the  present

practice    under   the   Vagrancy   Ordinance.    These

recommendations have been accepted by the Government  in

the White Paper on the Commission's Report (Cmd. No.  30

of   1961),  which  was  presented  to  the  Legislative

Assembly on 27th October, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill accordingly amends the

Vagrancy  Ordinance by excluding destitute persons  from

the  definition of vagrants, so that that Ordinance will

in  future apply only to petty criminals - as  distinct

from  purely  destitute persons -  who  may,  under  the

provisions  of that Ordinance, be committed  to  varying

terms of imprisonment. The Bill also deletes Part II  of

the  Vagrancy Ordinance relating to the setting up of  a

house  of detention which will no longer be required  on

the establishment of welfare homes for destitute persons

under   the   provisions  of  this  Bill.   Transitional

provisions are also made for persons at present detained

in  the  house of detention under the provisions of  the

Vagrancy  Ordinance to be admitted  to  a  welfare  home

after due inquiry by the Director of Social Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill will enable the Government to deal

more effectively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



with   the   beggars  problem  which  has  lately   been

aggravated  by  the activities of professional  beggars,

including  many from across the Causeway who have  found

it  extremely profitable to come to Singapore to beg for

alms.  As  hon.  Members are aware, the  Social  Welfare

Department has been engaged for some time in a  campaign

to  clear  our streets of these beggars, especially  the

professional  beggars, and some  statistics  may  be  of

interest  to  the  House. Since  the  beginning  of  the

campaign in November last year, the Department has dealt

with  some  450 beggars. Of these, some 70  or  so  were

found to have come from across the Causeway - some from

as  far  north  as  Kota  Bahru  and  Alor  Star  -  and

arrangements  were  made  to send  them  back  to  their

country  of origin. Those of Singapore origin, who  were

found to be genuinely destitute and without relatives or

friends  to  care for them, were given  shelter  in  the

Social Welfare Department's homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives power to the Department of Social

Welfare  to deal directly with the beggars problem,  and

will  therefore  enable more effective  and  expeditious

action   to  be  taken.  The  Bill  provides   for   the

establishment  of  welfare  homes  for  the   care   and

rehabilitation  of destitute persons, and  empowers  the

Director of Social Welfare to require destitute  persons

to  reside in welfare homes after due inquiry. There  is

also  provision for any destitute person to be  admitted

to  a  welfare home on his own application.  Alterations

have been made to one of the Department's existing homes

-  the  Bushey Park Home - to adapt it for the reception

of  destitute persons. This Home will be the first to be

set  up  as a welfare home under the provisions  of  the

Bill.  And  as the need arises, other appropriate  homes

run by the Department will be similarly adapted and used

for the purposes of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, any person who has been admitted to a

welfare  home may be discharged to relatives who satisfy

the  Superintendent of their ability to support or  care

for  the  person to be discharged. Where  the  destitute

person who has been admitted to a welfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



home is not a Singapore citizen, there is provision  for

him to be repatriated to his country of origin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. -[Inche Othman bin Wok].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL (THERAPY, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grafting of healthy human tissues to replace

diseased  parts of a human body has been  fairly  common

medical  practice for some time. And  one  of  the  most

common,  and  also  the most successful  transplantation

operations  at  the  present time, is  that  of  corneal

grafting, where the corneal graft is obtained  from  the

eye of a recently dead person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, more spectacular transplantations have been

attempted  although  with less successful  results.  For

example,  there  have been transplantations  of  organs,

like kidneys, from one person to another, and there  are

reasonable  hopes that such operations may  become  more

commonplace and successful in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been attempts to use tissues from

animals  and  even of inert materials such as  plastics,

for  replacement and transplantation operations, but the

main  source  of transplant material, in the foreseeable

future, will continue to be that of human tissues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, there is no legislation in existence in

Singapore whereby a person may "will" his body  or  part

of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



body  to doctors for use as transplant material. Such  a

deficiency  in  our laws has somewhat  hindered  medical

progress  in  Singapore for the more  extensive  use  of

tissue  transplants. As a result, many blind persons  in

Singapore,  for  example, unfortunately have  to  remain

blind,  because of the lack of sufficient corneas  which

can  be  willed for their benefit. This Bill, therefore,

serves  to bring light and happiness to those now doomed

to  a  life  of  eternal  darkness  and  unhappiness  by

enabling persons who are prepared to "will" their  eyes,

on their death, for use on suitable persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, advantage has been taken for the Bill to be

drafted  for even wider general application and  is  not

being  limited  only to the transplantation  of  corneal

grafts.  The  Bill makes it possible  to  use  parts  of

bodies  of deceased persons for medical treatment,  i.e.

for  transplantation of any tissue or organ, as and when

such   operations  can  be  successfully  performed   in

Singapore.  The  Bill  also allows for  the  post-mortem

examination of bodies and of its dissection for  medical

education and research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill stipulates an important safeguard

that  removal  of  parts  of the  body  for  therapeutic

purposes  or for medical education or research can  only

be  performed,  if  the person, before  his  death,  had

expressly given permission either orally, or in writing,

and  which  has  been witnessed by two or more  persons,

before  such  procedures may be carried out,  after  his

death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill empowers any person who has

lawful  possession of the body of a deceased  person  to

authorise,  in  writing,  the  use  of  the   body   for

therapeutic   purposes  or  for  medical  education   or

research or for post-mortem examination of the body,  if

he has reason to believe, after making such enquiries as

may  be  practicable, that the deceased person  had  not

previously  expressed an objection  to  his  body  being

tampered  with  after his death or  that  the  surviving

spouse  or  relative of the deceased does not object  to

such body being so dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the contingency whereby the

Director of Medical Services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



may  authorise, in writing, the use of the body or parts

thereof for use as indicated in the Bill, if the body of

a  deceased person has not been claimed for more than 24

hours  from  a hospital, or other institution  which  is

maintained on public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, clause 5 ensures that the authority of the

Coroner to direct the post-mortem examination of a  body

under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code  is

not to be prejudiced in any way by the operation of this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, a very comprehensive Bill to

permit  the use of human tissues for purpose of grafting

and  for  the  dissection of human  bodies  for  medical

examination, education or research. It is essential that

this  important  piece of legislation be  introduced  to

permit  such work, which at present is being done  on  a

limited   scale,  without  legal  coverage   or   proper

safeguards  which  are  now  to  be  rectified  by   the

provisions of clause 6 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the additional safeguard that the

person  entrusted with cremation or interment of a  body

is specifically debarred from authorising the removal of

parts of the body and post-mortem examination of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's present population is over 1.8 million and

our  population density is more than 8,000  persons  per

square mile, certainly a very over-crowded little island

State!  Our crude birth rate is around 32 per  thousand,

which  is  much  too high. The fact  is  that  too  many

children are being brought into the world each  year  at

the  great cost of their mothers' health, and  also  far

too  many  bread-winners  of  families  are  finding  it

difficult  to feed and clothe adequately the many  extra

children.  Regrettably, many women in sheer  desperation

over  innumerable  child-bearing  over  the  years   are

resorting  to  illegal abortion, as a way out.  This  is

evidenced  by  nearly  500 patients  being  admitted  to

Kandang  Kerbau Maternity Hospital each year in  serious

condition, known as "abortion with sepsis" and which  is

most  likely  the  result  of unsuccessful  attempts  at

induced abortions. The number of illegal abortions  each

year  is conservatively estimated by people in the  know

to  be  in the region of thousands! In order, therefore,

to  liberate  our women from the burden of  bearing  and

raising  an  unnecessarily large number of children,  to

lighten the burden of many bread-winners, and to  reduce

the   nefarious  activities  of  ruthless   professional

abortionists, Government accordingly published  a  White

Paper on Family Planning as part of its second Five-Year

Development Plan (1966-70) of Singapore - Cmd. Paper 22 of

1965 dated 27th September, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan envisages that over a period of five years a

target  of  180,000  eligible married  women,  of  the

fertile  age  group (15 to 44 years) would be  motivated

voluntarily  and  actively to  participating  in  family

planning.  The total cost to Government for  this

Five-Year Plan is estimated at $1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action on a national basis is required to cope with

the   present   problem  of  uncontrolled  increase   of

population which, if left unchecked, may well hinder and

even  to nullify present great and strenuous efforts  at

economic expansion by the Government and its people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief purpose of this Bill is to provide the legal

means whereby the Five-Year Plan for Family Planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



could  be  given effective direction and  execution.  If

this  Family Planning programme succeeds -  and  we  are

determined  that it should - besides increasing  welfare

and  happiness  for  hundreds of thousands,  Singapore's

future  annual net increase in population in the  1970's

can be brought down to one-half of its present rate, and

thus  be  brought in line with the prevailing  rates  of

population  increase  now found in  the  prosperous  and

advanced countries of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the formal constitution of a

body  corporate  to  be known as "the  Singapore  Family

Planning  and  Population Board" as recommended  in  the

White  Paper on Family Planning. The Board is to have  a

maximum  membership of 15 members, vide  clause  4.  The

Board  represents  a broad spectrum of interests,  seven

are  ex-officio members (five representing the  Ministry

of  Health  and  the other two from the  Statistics  and

Social  Welfare  Departments  respectively)  and   eight

others  are  non-officials, two of whom would  represent

the  University of Singapore and up to six  others  from

members  of  the  public who are  deeply  interested  in

family planning and population control activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual powers are given to the Board under clause 6

to  employ such stall as may be deemed necessary for the

effective carrying out of its work and programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important provision of the Bill is clause 11 which

provides  that  any  person,  body  or  association  now

carrying out family planning work in Singapore has to be

registered with the Board. Specific exemption,  however,

is  made for medical practitioners arid pharmacists  who

are  registered under the Medical Registration Ordinance

(Cap.  191)  and  Registration of Pharmacists  Ordinance

(Cap. 198) respectively. The Board may also register any

body, association or person carrying out family planning

work  with  or without conditions. This is necessary  as

the Board is to he the sole agency for the promotion and

dissemination  of  information  pertaining   to   family

planning in Singapore and it must ensure that such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



a  valuable  social  programme is not  to  be  exploited

commercially or otherwise by any other agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me to mention, at this stage, of

the  prominent  work of two voluntary organisations  now

conducting  family  planning  activities  in  Singapore.

Firstly,  the  Singapore  Family  Planning  Association,

which  was established as far back as 1949, or 16  years

ago,  and at whose request, Government was asked to take

over  90  per cent of their present responsibilities  on

family  planning.  Arising  out  of  this  move  by  the

Singapore  Family Planning Association, the White  Paper

on  Family Planning thus came into being. Secondly,  the

South-East  Asia  and  Oceanic Regional  Centre  of  the

International Planned Parenthood Federation and to which

Federation the Singapore Family Planning Association  is

also  a member thereof. This Regional Centre of I.P.P.F.

serves  as a Training Centre for family planning workers

for  the  territories ranging from Fiji in the  east  to

Burma to the west of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these two voluntary organisations would be

required to register with the Board under the provisions

of  clause 11 of the Bill, the closest co-operation with

these    two    agencies   will   be   maintained,    as

representatives  from each of these  two  agencies  have

been sounded to serve as members of the Board under  the

provisions  of  clause 4 (1) (i), and I  am  pleased  to

state that these invitations have been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision under clause 12 for the

Minister,  if  he  deems  it  necessary  in  the  public

interest  to do so, to order the Board to take over  the

functions  pertaining to family planning and the  assets

and  property  of  any  body  or  association  which  is

required either to be registered under the provisions of

clause 11 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 spells out in detail the functions of the

Board   which  covers  family  planning  and  population

control  programmes, and clause 17 provides for  various

penalties  for any person who fails to comply  with  the

various  provisions of the Bill. The other  clauses  are

mainly administrative in character.
