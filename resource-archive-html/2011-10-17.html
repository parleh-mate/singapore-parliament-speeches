Singapore embarked on our journey to nationhood after our separation
from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Our progress over the last 46 years
has been nothing less than impressive. As the President has noted
in his Opening Address, we have created the basic building blocks
for the nation and are now progressing to a new phase of development.
I wholeheartedly agree that our new phase of nation building takes
place in a new environment – a different economic, political and
social landscape, very different from what our forefathers faced
when we first became independent.</p>

Election was a watershed event in Singapore's political history,
not because for the first time ever, an Opposition party managed
to secure a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), nor was it
because the PAP's popular vote had fallen by about 6% points from
the previous election in 2006. Rather, it was a result of Singapore's
political landscape being dramatically altered with the advent of
the Internet and social media.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2249517a-7469-43f2-bc37-4e1f20cb4276">

the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) concluded that the Internet
did not have a decisive effect on the 2011 General Election, there
was no doubt a surge in the utilisation of new media platforms by
political parties to reach out and connect with the electorate before
and during the campaign period.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-95984875-1000-47f4-913b-87cceb313cc0">
                  <a name="president-address__id-95984875-1000-47f4-913b-87cceb313cc0"><!--a--></a>The take-away message from
the last General Election is that these online spaces, whether they
are social-media tools, online news sources or blogs, are now inevitably part
of the standard tool kit for people engaged with politics. As more
Singaporeans gravitate towards the social web in their daily lives,
the social media will become an important space for them to share
their views and interpret what is going on in the world around them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8c596318-34b2-4b1c-bb26-1e5509b5288a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8c596318-34b2-4b1c-bb26-1e5509b5288a"><!--a--></a>As the President has said,
the Internet and social media will be a tremendous tool for us to
reach out to all Singaporeans. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has
also said that the Government "can do better" in harnessing cyberspace
to "explain issues, shape opinions and rally support". At the last
National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee had mentioned that the Government
as a whole needs to be more active and spry in engaging Singaporeans
online. With this in mind, Singapore's Government agencies are also
set to get more structured training in the use of social media.
The use of social media will enable the Government to reach out
and to engage Singaporeans. The ultimate aim of this is to foster
a greater sense of shared ownership. </p>

still has an important role to play, the proliferation of social
media is certainly challenging many norms, and its current and future
impact is and will be profound on all aspects of life. In particular,
social media is slowly supplanting traditional media as news and
entertainment outlets. Yet, the President's warning that while social
media has its uses, it is also hard to distinguish truth from falsehood
on the Internet. According to a news article in the BBC, independent
think tank Demos observed that many young people did not know how
to navigate the vast information available on the Internet. The
social media is likened to the "Wild Wild West" on the Internet
with very limited regulation and control over its content. On one hand,
there may be a huge amount of very trustworthy, academic, good bits
of journalism on the Internet. On the other hand, equal proportions
of distortions, propaganda, lies, mistruths, half-truths and all
sorts of rubbish can be found too. </p>

especially for netizens, to sort the wheat from the chaff. While
we have focused thus far on increasing the IQ and EQ of Singaporeans,
let us remember that there is an urgent need to enhance the DQ or
Digital Quotient of Singaporeans by educating Singaporeans, especially
the young, proper digital judgement in discerning what is right
and what is wrong. I would urge the MOE to work with MICA on taking
concrete steps to teach and inculcate our young children with sound
digital literacy and judgement as part of their curriculum in schools.</p>

in Singapore will undergo constant evolution. The results of the
last two elections held this year have shown that Singaporeans have
diverse political views and wish to have a greater say in the political
affairs of the country. I agree with the President that diversity
in society is a good thing. Since the early 1990s, we have encouraged
diversity. Mr George Yeo, then Acting Minister for Information and
the Arts, had spoken about the need for the state and Government
to recede its reach, to trim the branches of the banyan tree and
allow society to flourish. That, I think, has seen significant transformation
over the past 20 years, for our society has become more diverse
and active citizenry can be said to be more vibrant, both in the
real and the virtual world. This diversity should be perceived and
received positively, as Singaporeans have begun to take charge of
what they are passionate about and many have naturally begun to
see Singapore more as a home for themselves and their families. </p>

own political views, to the cats, dogs and dolphin lovers, the nature
and heritage supporters, we see in Singapore, people who root themselves
to causes they believe is right and passionate about. This, I believe
is good for Singapore, for the people have developed what we can
call a Singapore soul. As politicians, let us continue to engage
Singaporeans in the issues they believe in, with the tacit agreement
that we are all moving towards a better Singapore. And with our
new parliamentary colleagues from the Ruling Party, Opposition and
NCMPs, I look forward to a more robust and constructive debate in
this House. </p>

Singaporeans have begun to find a Singapore soul, as a small nation,
there are still many external challenges Singapore has to overcome
in order to maintain our lead and ensure long-term survivability.
On the economic front, we have just overcome the 2008 global economic
recession, sparked by the failure of many major banks in the United
States, with fortunately minimal injuries. This episode has demonstrated
the resilience of Singaporeans and the resolve of the Government
in solving tenacious issues faced by Singapore. Our economy, guided
by the sound policies of the Government, has rebounded and is growing
strong. Our GDP grew by a sterling 14.5% last year, and by 5.9%
on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2011. Total employment
grew by 24,800 in the second quarter of 2011 and unemployment rate is
at 2.1%. By all measurements, our economy is healthy and our people
employed.</p>

dark clouds are gathering in the horizon. The world is threatened
with a repeat of the 2008 financial meltdown, but on an even more cataclysmic
scale. Just as we thought that the United States' economy is showing
initial signs of a recovery, their debt situation appears to be
spiraling out of control. In August 2011, major credit rating agencies
downgraded the US' rating to AA+. Europe is still deep in recession
and the financial storm engulfing Europe is far from over.</p>

insulated from these problems, we must remember that we are an open

must be ready to put through the necessary policies for Singapore
to pull through tumultuous times. We must continue to look to equip
Singaporeans with the right skills to enable them to survive in the
competitive globalised world. As we seek to educate Singaporeans
with the right skills to survive in the global economy, I would
like to state that this must not only focus on knowledge but also
on soft skills. I believe that many Members have heard the passing
of Steve Jobs on 5 October 2011. Many of us here have used one of

Steve Jobs is that, although he was a high school dropout, Apple
Inc, which he founded in 1976 with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne,
is today one of the largest and most successful companies around the
world. </p>

a strong rules-based multilateral trading system. Singapore has
been a consistent champion of liberalisation on the multilateral,
regional and bilateral fronts. To date, we have signed 18 FTAs with major
economies and regions around the globe. These FTAs have positively
contributed to Singapore's growth in recent years.</p>

about the President's Address was his call to make Singapore the
best home for all Singaporeans. Thus, we must meet the challenges
of the global economy head on and ensure that this growth benefits
all segments of society. Yet as we pursue our goal of quality and
inclusive growth, at the same time, there is a need for the Government
to focus, too, on overcoming internal challenges facing Singapore.
For one, the changing demographics of Singapore will pose a significant
hurdle for the nation. In 2010, the fertility rate was an all time
low of 1.16, way below the replacement level of 2.1. A recent IPS
study also warns that if fertility rates were to remain the same,
there would be severe implications on Singapore's ability to compete
in the global world. More needs to be done to address the declining
TFR. Besides taking a microscopic analysis of the current procreation
package, the Government will also need to have a macroscopic review
of the social support required to encourage Singaporeans to have
more children, which includes childcare and pre-school facilities
as well as more family-friendly workplace arrangements. </p>

TFR in the world, has seen a surge of 16% of babies being born in
the first nine months of this year, after the government offered
incentives to couples in a bid to boost the dismal birth rate. Maybe,
we can learn from the Taiwanese, measures to reverse this worrying
trend in Singapore.</p>

by a rapidly ageing population or what is called the silver tsunami.
With 20% of the population above the age of 65 come 2030, we need
to prepare ourselves right now to ensure that those who need help
are taken care of, medically and socially. With more elderly Singaporeans,
the demand for healthcare services will inevitably increase and
many will suffer from age-related chronic diseases. This dual-pronged
danger, if not met and addressed, will leave us with an elderly population
supported by fewer and fewer working adults – a high dependency
ratio. </p>

I wish to turn the attention of the House to several other issues which
will affect our ability to pursue quality and inclusive growth for
all Singaporeans. For one, there are currently many challenges facing
Singapore's healthcare system. Besides the rapidly ageing population,
the affordability of healthcare, manpower and infrastructural developments
are issues that will inevitably affect the lives of many Singaporeans.</p>

system, with our top doctors, nurses, cutting-edge techniques and
equipment, and infrastructure, are well placed to keep Singaporeans healthy.
However, let us remember that we need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity
in our healthcare sector to deal with the impending silver tsunami.
Already, our system is facing a crunch due to the increase in Singapore
population over the last four to five years. We need to urgently
streamline work processes, enhance productivity and also better
manage existing space and facilities to alleviate this crunch. For
instance, the public health sector can consider re-locating non-clinical
services such as administrative offices in the hospitals elsewhere
and converting the spaces to wards and clinics. There may also be
a need to look at buying services from the private sector as an
interim solution to help ease the crunch in the public sector. Besides
the physical infrastructure, let us also look into ensuring that
we have adequate trained manpower including doctors, nurses and
allied health professionals, in anticipation of this trend. </p>

starts from the "relatively young age of 40". At the same time,
we also need to ensure that healthcare remains affordable and anyone

that there are those in society who find it hard to finance the
medical costs in Singapore. Yes, there are already many financial
schemes available to help Singaporeans such as the Medisave, MediShield

be subject to financial distress in seeking medical treatment for
themselves or their loved ones? Should they have to borrow from banks
and friends to pay their bills? Should they sell all their assets
before they can qualify for medical assistance under the stringent
eligibility criteria?</p>

that, globally, medical costs are growing, even in developing economies,
and double-digit increases may be the norm for 2011 and beyond.
Medical trend rates are not predicted to drop significantly anytime
soon. In fact, in most countries, they are expected to continue
to rise over the next five years.</p>

as people start living longer, as medical costs increase, we need
to relook at our medical funding framework to address some of these
problems in the near future. How can we ensure that Singaporeans
are able to pay their medical bills or not worried about seeking
the necessary medical treatment because of financial constraints?
With increased longevity and rising healthcare cost, are our various schemes,
like Medisave, adequate to meet the healthcare needs of Singaporeans
in the future? Now, before we increase the Medisave contribution,
let us remember that the medical inflation rates ranged from 6%-8%
over the last three years while the wage increase ranged from 2%-4%.
Clearly, the increase in the cost of healthcare is outstripping
that of the rate of increase in our salaries. And this is even more
stark in the case of the lower income group, whose disposable incomes
are stretched more tightly today. I was speaking to a resident the
other day, and he told me this in Mandarin – "the poor is better
off dead than sick". With rising healthcare costs, this old adage
appears to be truer than ever. </p>

state. Our citizens must understand that there will not be free
medical care and all Singaporeans must help to bear some costs.
That I think everyone seated here would concur with. But nevertheless,
as I have mentioned, Singapore has evolved its own model where subsidies
are given to those who need it most. The tiered means testing system
is a useful method to determine how much a person should pay for
medical treatment. But with rising medical costs, it is worthwhile to
think about how we can help the lower and middle income groups by
increasing the quantum of subsidy for them. There is also a need
to re-examine the rules governing the use of Medisave. Many Singaporeans
feel that it is too restrictive and very often, there may be sufficient
amount of Medisave savings but the rules do not allow its use in
many instances. Many of such incidents are genuine medical expenditure,
such as outpatient consultation, treatment and investigations. </p>

system, as announced by the Prime Minister during the National Day
Rally speech, are steps towards meeting the current and future needs of
Singaporeans. The expansion of the Primary Care Partnership Scheme
(PCPS), Medical Assistance Fund and the increase in withdrawal limit
of the Medisave for outpatient treatment will surely be welcomed
by all Singaporeans. But we can do more, for instance, listing essential
drugs in the standard drug list so that patients too can enjoy the
subsidy. Let us remember that making healthcare more accessible
to all would mean that more Singaporeans stay healthy in their older
age and live an active elderly lifestyle.</p>

especially in Singapore, has pushed many Singaporeans to move their
loved ones to nursing homes in Johor Bahru. In Singapore, we have always
asked our citizens to take care of their loved ones, often in homes.
But for many, especially those with low incomes, this is often impossible
to do so. How is one going to juggle work, earning about $2,000
to $3,000, take care of the family and look after the elderly who
is frail, non-ambulant and is totally dependent on others for activities
of daily living, all at the same time? It is a tough balancing act,
to say the least. </p>

                  <em class="ph i">New Paper</em> highlighted how
some Singaporeans have sent their loved ones to Johor Bahru. In
one of the stories, Mdm Kong, 90 years of age, is seemingly abandoned
by her family who have stopped visiting her and paying the nursing
home. These stories of our elderly admitted to nursing homes in
Johor Bahru and deserted by their families are heart wrenching.
And while we can say that the family is to be blamed for this, does
our high healthcare cost, high cost of nursing homes, lack of nursing
beds, not contribute to this phenomenon, too? Should our elderly
be treated this way after all their sacrifices to build the nation,
for Singapore to be what it is today? </p>

that to make Singapore a more inclusive place, we need to make Singapore
a home for all Singaporeans. Reviewing our healthcare policies and making
it better for all Singaporeans, in terms of affordability, availability
and accessibility, would be a good step in the right direction.
In my opinion, there are many more areas where we can look towards
making Singapore a better and more inclusive place for everyone.
Take for instance, the Enabling Masterplan. First implemented in 2007,
it has now gone on to its second five-year plan, and has achieved
much in terms of early intervention, especially for children with
intellectual and developmental disabilities. The expansion of the
Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children to include
private sector operators has also added more vacancies to the special
needs system.</p>

has taken the right steps towards a more inclusive society, I believe

old. Her husband is 82. They have three children, like most Singaporean
families. Their youngest child was born in 1963. At the age of two,
he had a high fever and was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain
or meningitis. Hence on, Peter became totally dependent on his parents
for his needs. He became intellectually and physically disabled,
unable to move, unable to articulate his needs and feelings. While
her husband worked, Mrs Koh took care of Peter full time, together
with her other two children. As her husband did not earn huge wages,
Mrs Koh had to scrimp and save to bring up her three children, Peter
included. Her situation was made worse as in the 1970s and 1980s,
she did not know whom to turn to for help. She had no caregiver support
nor training in caregiving. She had no respite and, many a time,
she would just cry to let her pent-up emotions out. Finally, in
2007, at the age of 67, she and her husband decided that they were
no longer physically able to take care of Peter, and sent him to
be institutionalised. </p>

that there is an all encompassing framework for caregiver training
and support as we move to face our silver tsunami. But let us not forget
that the caregivers themselves, those in the present and the future,
need to be taken care of, too. Today, Mrs Koh and her husband survive
on a paltry $900 monthly for their daily living. Of this sum, more
than $550 goes towards the upkeep of Peter. We need to think about
caring for these caregivers and to make respite care more readily available
or affordable. There might be people callous enough to suggest that
Mrs Koh was dealt an unfortunate hand in life, but unfortunate hand
or not, as a nation, as fellow citizens, as fellow Singaporeans,
there is more we can do to provide a helping hand. </p>

disabled and their caregivers, I would also like to speak briefly
about another group of people in society who are often left in the
lurch. This group is the single parent, either male or female. The
single parent faces many difficulties in life as he or she takes
care of their children. For one, the myriad of schemes and subsidies
available to married Singaporeans with children are not available
to them. Often than not, the single parent is faced with a double
whammy of sorts. Apart from the lack of Government support, some
are also cut off and "abandoned" by their families. Take for instance,
the Baby Bonus is only eligible, according to the MCYS guidelines,
if the mother is lawfully wedded to the father.</p>

leave, where marriage is one of the eligibility criteria. HDB's
BTO policies are also skewed against those who are single parents.
I think we should relook the way we see parents who one way or another
have to raise children on their own. Let us consider them as parents
and make avail to them all such schemes and subsidies that are available
to married couples. We must remember that some of them are single
not by choice and we should not further add to the problems they
face in raising a child single-handedly.</p>

making a better Singapore for all. Over the next few days, Members

Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to congratulate you on your election as

to our President on 10 October delivering his Address, I cannot
help but wonder what does it really mean to my fellow Singaporeans
when he said, "Our shared goal is to create a better life for all."
To tell you the truth, I do not know yet. But one thing I do know,
Sir, is that more and more Singaporeans are watching and they want
this Parliament to continue to make Singapore better and, most importantly, to
improve their lives. </p>

goals and objectives that our President had articulated in his opening
speech. But, Sir, it is how we work towards achieving those goals
for the next five years that really matters because it is how we
will and can affect the lives of Singaporeans for the better. By
all counts and benchmarks, either in education, housing, economy,
healthcare and many more, as a young country, we can be proud to
say that we have done reasonably well. Singaporeans know that they
are living in much better conditions than in many other countries.
The challenge then was for us to continue to do well and improve
on our shortcomings. Since the early days of Singapore's independence,
we have worked hard to provide for our people and we have focused
on the fundamental and basics very well. The three areas of thrusts
that we had single-mindedly worked on, namely, public housing, education
and employment, have brought us far and forward in development.
Living conditions improved, lives got better, there were good-paying
jobs, and our citizens became more educated. </p>

communities in Singapore flourished and progressed including the
Malay community. Over the years, coming from the Malay community,
I would say that we have made lots of leaps and bounds in progress,
and this has happened unabated for many years. The Malay community
made significant progress in many areas, like housing, educational
achievements, employment and also businesses. The rapid development
of our economy had provided an impetus for the community, which
is a minority in Singapore, to advance and stand tall side by side among
other fellow Singaporeans. Nevertheless, even if we have progressed,
we still face many challenges that we need to overcome together.
Just like many others in this country, this is a new Singapore,
a new landscape where we face many common challenges. This cuts
across racial and cultural boundaries. </p>

more often than not the new recruits are foreigners. She had many
questions to ask: Is this normal? What is happening? Where are our
technicians and our engineers? Are we training enough to produce
them for our industry and our economy?</p>

stories from financial firms and friends who work in banks that
employ entirely foreign workers in a department, and they ask me
the same question. They are concerned because they wonder whether
the jobs that have been created, and the opportunities that came
about through our development in growth, are not going to Singaporeans.
Where are our locally trained bankers from our universities which
are renowned and reputable? Are we training them enough? Are they
suitable for our own economy? So, these are some of the questions
that people ask when it comes to opportunities and jobs.</p>

residents gave me a lot of feedback and some concerns homes. Let
me just move on to an issue that is close to our hearts. Having
a roof over our head is, in fact, a basic human desire. It is no
surprise, therefore, that many Singaporeans are concerned about
housing and whether they can afford a comfortable home for themselves
and their family. To be fair, Sir, this PAP Government has done
an outstanding job in housing its population. Within just 50 years,
our population has moved from living in <em class="ph i">kampongs</em> and overcrowded
shop houses to modern, well appointed public housing flats. I believe
many in this House went through this experience and so did I. I
remember my father proudly receiving the keys to his 2-room flat
in 1970 when he bought it at a price of $13,500 from Jurong Town
Corporation (JTC), using his salary of about $150 per month. By
no means luxurious, our HDB flat was still a great step forward,
with running water, electricity, sanitary and plumbing.</p>

our heads, a place to go as a family and make friends with our neighbours.
It seems to me that in those days, that was the basic purpose of
our public housing programme − to house a growing population − and
how well we have done it.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-830e4596-bd95-4046-b359-e42817bf0725">

Singapore's public housing programme is probably the most successful
of its kind anywhere in the world. Where other public housing programmes
house low-income population and often quickly reduce to slums, Singapore's
public housing programme houses about 80% of our population, with options
for low-income as well as high-income earners. Today, we proudly
say that Singapore boasts among the highest home owners figure in
the world. And this did not happen by chance. It happens because
of a very conscious decision by the Government that people should
own their homes and have a stake in this country.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9b3ecd57-7e41-40bd-8b7e-7d404f39c954">

a certain sense of belonging in the estate and encourages residents
to look after their flats and their neighbourhood. An HDB flat has also
become a growing asset and, in some instances, offering a windfall
of a few hundred thousand dollars to owners if they choose to sell.
So it seems to me that now, from a basic purpose of housing a population,
our public housing programme has taken on many more roles − that
of giving Singaporeans a stake in our country, of building a community
and of being a financial investment as well. Little wonder that
housing issues are so complex and so emotive.</p>

of view, let me try to unravel some of the issues facing housing.
First, there is the issue of demand. If demand was constant and
predictable, I do not think there will be an issue. HDB will be
able to plan the number and the types of flats to build enough to
satisfy all the flat buyers. But demand has not been predictable for
many, many reasons − a poor and volatile economy, fewer marriages
and new family units, and sometimes even the fear of a "Tiger" year
baby. So it seems to me that rather than trying to predict demand,
HDB sought to deal with this by building to order. A very great
idea because flats would be built when there were buyers for them
and buyers would know when their flats would be delivered to them.
This would allow them to plan, save money for payments, renovations,
furniture and get on with the business of raising a family. And
yet, Sir, there are people who are very dissatisfied with this solution.
Some say that they cannot get a flat that they like. Others say
that they wait too long. Yet, others say that the location is no
good – too far from the amenities, too far from their parents. I
am sure these are all valid complaints. But I cannot see how HDB
can address all of them, except perhaps by building flats faster
without putting too much pressure on construction resources and
putting all the necessary amenities in place at the same time. If
newer flats have all the necessary amenities and good public transport,
I believe flat buyers in newer flats will have less cause for concern.</p>

businesses that offered amenities may not be economically viable
in the first instance because new flats only slowly build up their population
and their clientele for the businesses. But this is something that
creative support from Government can overcome, whether through reduced
rental, small business financing schemes or manpower cost subsidies.
I believe that if we want to tackle these issues, we should take
the concerns of home buyers as legitimate throughout our preconceived
notions and start with a fresh look for solutions.</p>

issue of cost. There is no lack of feedback that cost of housing,
including public housing, is too high. One resident quipped to me
that most Singaporeans are working for the HDB. He explained that
many of us take a whole working lifetime to pay off our mortgage
for our flat. After we have done so, we are left with little savings
for our retirement and, heaven forbid, if our family members are
faced with major illnesses and the expenses related to that. Looking
back, as a Government that encourages home ownership, we cannot
absolve ourselves of the responsibility of acceding to the deep
desire among Singaporeans to own property. As I understand, from
the feedback from the residents, there are at least two sides to
the concern about the high cost of public housing. Clearly, those
who aspire to buy their flats, even new flats, and after the subsidies
that HDB offers, are concerned that they will be saddled with a
large mortgage. A large chunk of their income will go towards paying
for their flats and this is not an unreasonable concern. </p>

of 2009/2010 and the prices of flats that were offered ranged from
$72,000 for a 2-room flat in Bukit Panjang to $409,000 for a 5-room
flat in Punggol. Former Minister for National Development, Mr Mah
Bow Tan, in his article in <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> newspaper in November 2010
dealt with this issue of whether HDB flats were affordable. Using
the concept of debt service ratio, Mr Mah said that for a new HDB
flat in non-mature estates and for a 30-year loan, the debt service
ratio was an average of 20%. This means that, for me, when I buy
an HDB flat, 20 cents of every dollar I earn goes towards paying
for my flat. Sir, no wonder my resident told me that we all worked
for HDB. Granted that this ratio is lower, according to Mr Mah,
than the international benchmark of 30% to 35% for affordable expenditure
on housing, but let us also consider that unlike other countries,
a large chunk of Singapore's income is also spent on transport and
education. After all the other expenses, it is no surprise that
many Singaporeans live from pay cheque to pay cheque.</p>

is that no one seems to be able to tell me how much actually does
an HDB flat cost. Since our private sector construction companies
build our flats, I suppose we could look at their tender price for
a clue to what the construction cost is. I am sure there must be
other costs, including cost of land. Now, if we think about it, should
land cost be included in the price of HDB flat, some may ask. I
agree that we have to impute the cost for the use of land to build
flats, but what would be the basis? I do not think this question
has been adequately debated. Having promised home ownership for all,
the Government must do its utmost to fulfil it. If a quarter of
our income is used to finance our home, where would our savings
for retirement come from? Is this the reason that many people hope
to boost their savings by trading their biggest asset, that is,
their home? Is that why many people buy their flats, take the so-called
first bite of the cherry and then tempted at selling the flats five
years later for profit to invest in a retirement fund, and to attempt
a second bite of the cherry after that? Some may point to the Minimum
Sum Scheme and the CPF LIFE Scheme for retirement. But all of us
know that these will hardly be adequate and other sources of income
are also needed. Of course, Sir, we could all keep working until
a ripe old age, but we all know the challenges older workers face
too. Again, that is another issue that would be covered.</p>

the Government should find ways to make HDB flats even more affordable.
CPF grants are helpful but it seems that we are just taking money
from one pocket to return it to the other. We must seriously consider
the pricing formula for HDB flats and seek to make it a transparent
one as much as possible. In this way, we can assure residents that
the Government is not out to make profits from the sale of housing. By
pricing our flats more reasonably, we can also relieve the debt
service burden of our residents. </p>

I would also like to bring up the plight of a very particular group
of residents of mine. As you may know, there are some residents
who have run afoul of HDB because they are unable to pay for their
flats. No doubt, HDB works hard with them to reschedule their instalment
arrears but, in some cases, regardless of what is done, some residents
simply are not able to pay. The reasons are many – unemployment,
prolonged sickness, unstable families, prison, and the like. I am sure
we all have residents who come to see us often at the Meet-the-People
Sessions. </p>

is that HDB houses these residents in what is called the interim
housing. In my constituency in Toa Payoh East, they are housed in
flats which are earmarked to be demolished as part of the selective <em class="ph i">en-bloc</em> redevelopment
exercise. This was put off because of the demand for rental housing
and also to house people who could not pay for their flats. If you
were to visit these flats, you could not imagine that you are still
in Singapore. The whole family is squeezed into one room, sometimes
two different families share a 2-room flat, with one family in one
room. I accept that this is a temporary situation until more permanent
housing can be found. But some families I know have been living
in these flats since 2009, hardly temporary. I cannot imagine how school-going
children can study and how parents can keep their young safe when
they are living with strangers. </p>

are slow at resolving this issue. We should try to provide a stable
home for them. I am sure many will say that this group of residents
put themselves into the situation and have themselves to be blamed.
I would say that we all share the blame. Let me explain. In the
first place, why should we encourage people who simply cannot afford
to buy a flat to aspire towards home ownership? I personally have seen
a scenario where a resident defaults on his housing instalments,
has his flat sold or repossessed. He is put in an interim housing
for a period and then he is encouraged to again buy another flat.
I think we cannot see residents as simply statistics or numbers, to
be channelled from one place to another. I think the Government
must think of a longer term sustainable solution for this group.
Perhaps, HDB can think of expanding this rental scheme and work
out meaningful subsidy scheme so that families can live together
safely, children can have a conducive environment to study and play
and, over time, hold up hope that they can improve their lives and
break out from the poverty cycle. </p>

income ceilings on purchase of new 3-room flats, as it does now,
HDB might consider restricting the resale of 3-room flats to only
low-income Singaporeans. HDB could consider being the sole agency
that sells and buys back 3-room flats at a price that is predetermined,
for example, at the original sale price plus the annual inflation
rate, because these small flats are meant for low income as its original
intent. In this way, the price of 3-room flats can be managed and
low-income families can aspire to own flats without undue burden
on their incomes. Once the price is controlled, we can also exclude
people who want to buy 3-room flats as an investment or for even
speculation. We have a duty to our residents, to understand their
needs, recognise their circumstances and offer solutions to improve
their lives, as we have said in the speech, and not to put them
in situations where they end up worse than they were before.</p>

we should also recognise that the home is more than just some bricks
and tiles. It is a place where families grow, memories are made, neighbourly
ties are forged. And home is also where the seeds of rootedness
to the community and country are sown. Yet, sometimes, these seedlings
were uprooted in the name of national progress. I have a group of
residents whose freehold homes will be taken away from them by the
Government for redevelopment works. We all agree, and we all agree
in many ways, that the greater national interests must come first
and that, from time to time, even those residents who own freehold
flats or properties will have their homes acquired by the Government.
In such instances, I am told that the Government would offer compensation
to owners based on the valuation on the day that their property
is gazetted –</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to be speaking here today. As a new
MP, I must say that speaking in this Chamber is truly a humbling experience.
Seeing the pictures of past parliamentarians along the hallway is
a reminder of all the people who played a part in legislating for
this country over the last 46 years during our remarkable growth
through Third World to First. It also reminds me of the burden of
responsibility we bear as new MPs. We stand on the shoulders of
giants, but there is an expectation that we will be able to bring
this country to greater heights, just as our predecessors had done. </p>

like many of my parliamentary colleagues, I have been busy meeting
people and understanding what is on their mind. While I received
warm reception from many, there were also those who told me quite
openly they did not support "my party". When I asked them for more
details, some of them expressed the angst that Mr Zainudin Nordin
expressed earlier; others also explained to me that it was because
they felt that our Party no longer cares for ordinary Singaporeans.
This was a little hurtful for me and also for many of the volunteers
who were assisting me at that time. For the volunteers, they get
nothing in this except the gratitude of serving people. So, in that
sense, I think the President's first message, to make life better
for all Singaporeans, is an important one, and one that I am sure
will be supported by all.</p>

on this goal. The first is in trying to make life better for all
Singaporeans, I think it is important to build a consensus first.
There is an old Tamil proverb by a wise old lady named Avvaiyar
that goes like this கற்றது கையளவு கல்லாதது உலகளவு. Now, that translates into saying that the sum
of your knowledge can be captured in the palm of a hand, whereas
the things you do not know is the size of the world. Essentially,
what that means is that when we approach people to build this consensus,
we have to approach it with an open mind. We have to be prepared
to learn as well. So, if our opinions are different, we have to
change those opinions. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ed36eb40-ccf8-4167-95c0-ed1413fc5fcf">
                  <a name="president-address__id-ed36eb40-ccf8-4167-95c0-ed1413fc5fcf"><!--a--></a>One example of a policy that
I think was seriously misunderstood was the decision to open the
door to foreigners quite widely in the last few years. I think the
reasoning for that was sound. It was to capture the economic growth
in the wake of the global recession. But, unfortunately, I think
the way it played out was most Singaporeans did not really understand
what all these foreigners were suddenly doing in our country. We just
had a recession the year before and at the same time we now see
a lot more foreigners in our trains, in our housing estates, perhaps
even working with us. I think this added to some of the angst that
people were feeling. </p>

law firm, so I experience first-hand the jobs created by foreigners.
I think people working in multi-national companies would probably
share the same experience too. But not everyone works with foreigners.
Others benefit indirectly from it, say, for example, the construction
industry which builds houses for every one of us. That industry
is sustained largely also by foreigners. So, broadly speaking, foreigners
do play an important role in our economy but I think it is necessary
for us to build a consensus on how many we need before opening the
door. </p>

declining birth rate, as was already mentioned, is a problem that
we all accept. One solution obviously is to keep foreigners coming
in. But I think in doing that we have to manage the process very
carefully and make sure that Singaporeans are behind us as we do
it. </p>

like to deal with is the external environment. Because Singapore
is a small country, we do not exist in isolation and there are at
least four points in the external environment that I think we have
to bear in mind when making any policy going forward.</p>

capitalism and globalisation in general. When the Berlin Wall came
down in the 1990s, there was a view that liberal democracy was the
right way forward, and capitalism was the best way to govern. This
was also coupled with the fall of communism which was at that time
the only alternative. The last 20 years has seen the unleashing
of global capitalism, but this also has some downsides. The first
is the movement of capital to the lowest cost locations. Now, what
this means is that capital will always go to where the cost production
is lowest. So, the First World, for example, that had the highest
wages was also amongst the first to suffer as manufacturing and
so on, moved to developing parts of the world. The First World,
at the moment, has unemployment rates close to 10%, along with the
low cost jobs that have moved abroad, and there are no clear alternatives
for the people who are at the very bottom. The other effect of globalisation
is at the very top. The companies in these countries have also become
global corporations. And this has actually permitted the CEOs of
these companies to earn phenomenal salaries because they commanded
much a larger corporation. But the impact this has created within
the countries is a tremendous divide in income. The lowest income
workers face unemployment at the worst or stagnating on low wages
because they compete with low-wage workers in other countries. On
the other hand, the people at the top enjoy a tremendous amount
of wealth because they are leveraging on everyone else.</p>

that stage yet. But as we strive to get higher wages for all our
workers, we have to make sure that we do not fall into that trap
because that is the direction that we are going into. Is there another
way out? I do not have the answer at the moment but I think that
is a problem that we have to be aware of as we move forward.</p>

in the external environment is what I call a sea of money. Now,
a sea of money is a good thing except that it does not really wind
up in the pockets of the people who need it most. In fact, what
has happened in a lot of the developed world is that in order to
stimulate the economy, the Central Banks have kept interest rates
at very low rates. This money has flowed not necessarily into their
own economies but to other parts of the world. And while this has
not stimulated the economies, it has created rising prices all around.
In Singapore, we feel this too. Our young people are afraid of the
rising price of buying a house; our old people are afraid that they
do not have enough for retirement and medical expenses. All around,
I think we feel the prices of rising food and oil. But this is created
by the fact that Central Banks around the world are printing money.
Our own Singapore dollar is strong and that limits the effects somewhat,
but there is a limit to how much we can let the Singapore dollar rise
as well because that would kill our manufacturing sector. So, again,
this is another complex problem we face. </p>

is something that came up in the last few months − is somewhat the
reverse of the sea of money but it may co-exist, and that is, a
risk that capital may actually fly from Singapore. Over the past
year or so, the flight to quality had been to places like Asia but
the last one or two months when the financial markets crashed, what
we noticed was that some of the money was going back to US treasuries. Even
though the US government is in trouble, for some reason money always
goes back to its home base. Although the money that was coming out
in the first place was from the developed world, it tends to run
back there. Now, the issue we face when capital flight takes place
is a little bit different. Capital flight would be similar to what
happened during the Asian economic crisis. In 1997, when economies
in Asia started collapsing one after the other, capital ran away
from Asia. And when capital ran away from Asia, Singapore faced
its worst recession in history up to that point in time. I do not
think we are getting close to that scenario at the moment but that
is a risk we have to bear in mind, at least on account of events
the last one or two months.</p>

happen if there is a protracted crisis in the West and the developed
world. As we know it, during the last crisis in 2008, much of the
developed world managed to get its way out of the crisis because
governments helped to bail out banks that were in trouble. They
took on the distressed debts. The trouble we face right now is that
the governments themselves are the ones in crisis. Fiscal policy,
which was a tool that permitted governments to spend more than their
budget in times of crisis, is no longer available to any of these
governments because they do not have the ability to run budget deficits
any longer. The weakest economies, like Greece, are in danger of default,
but even the strongest economies like the US have faced credit downgrades
and parts of their governments have shut down every now and then.
So, the reality is that the West seems to have protracted crisis
and one of the tools that they used to get out of crisis in the
past was fiscal policy, which is not available to them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-03f8bdef-7d61-4164-a6b6-12ad12c4db50">
                  <a name="president-address__id-03f8bdef-7d61-4164-a6b6-12ad12c4db50"><!--a--></a>The other tool that these
countries used to use in the past was what we call monetary policy,
and that was to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy.
Unfortunately, this policy also seems to have reached its limits
because interest rates have already been floored and yet the economy
does not seem to be reviving. So, in a sense, the economic stimulus
almost seems to be at full force but the economies are still flagging.
Now, a crisis in the West is not something that we should be celebrating
or in any way be happy about because it would have profound impact
on the world. A lot of global demand comes from the West, a lot
of our exports are going there. So, if the West is hit hard, then Singapore
cannot expect to prosper and it would be very difficult to do that. </p>

face, of course, is the risk of contagion, as happened with the
Lehman crisis. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, it was not just Lehman
that was in trouble but every bank that lent to them was also in
trouble. Right now, Greece may be the weakest link, but if Greece
collapses, it is not just Greece that is in trouble, the banks that
lent to them are in trouble. If those banks get into trouble, the
banks that are counter-parties or involved in other bank transactions
could also be in trouble. The risk of contagion is another one that
could spread here. So, this is the fourth risk that I think we face
in the external environment. </p>

this speech was not so much to paint a picture of doom and gloom

up ahead going forward. In moving from Third World to First, we

forward, in trying to build a better life for Singaporeans, we have
to find a path that even most developed countries have not done.
I do not think that is an easy task. It is a daunting one and we
have to stay together as a nation.</p>

Sir, since independence, Singapore has maintained constant economic
growth, social harmony and political stability. In spite of its
limited land area and resources, and dependence on the world economy,
Singapore attained remarkable achievements. Many describe this as
€˜The Singapore Economic Miracle'. Since the 1997 Asian financial
crisis, global economic cycles have become shorter and shorter,
to the extent that it experiences one cycle every three years. From September
11 in 2008, to SARS, to economic recession, to the global food crisis,
to the global financial crisis in 2009, in a span of 15 years, our
country experienced the impact of an economic crisis every three
years. However, we were able to tide over these crises. This little
red dot was able to race against the tide, not only was it able
to stay afloat, it even emerged stronger. During this period, when
the unemployment rate of many countries had been on the rise, we
were able to sustain full employment with low jobless rate. In many
countries, real wages have stopped increasing. But with the tripartite partnership
between the government, unions and employers, we were able to achieve wage
growth. Although the increment is not great, we were still able
to achieve real wage growth. We cannot take these achievements for
granted. Our €˜miracle' is, in fact, the result of our nation's stability,
every Singaporean's hard work and the spirit of working together
to overcome difficulties. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-e670bfd0-0a99-496a-b809-ff0aa7642fdb"><!--a--></a>Looking ahead, the challenges
that lie ahead are relentless. We have to face not only fierce competition
from neighbouring countries of various regions, but also turmoil brought
about by rapid economic growth. This includes socio-humanities changes,
as well as the impact of economic uncertainties in Europe and the
rest of the world. All these will have a continuous impact on us. </p>

with the climate of complex changes in the world economy, we will
inevitably be affected. The Europe debt crisis, recession in the
United States, global inflation and the potential of China's bubble
bursting, will have lasting impact on us. Every Singaporean will
feel the pressure, as everyone has to deal with the stress of high
cost brought about by economic uncertainties. In Singapore, we also
face challenges brought about by the problem of an ageing population,
low fertility rate, limited manpower resources and inflation, as
Singapore imports almost all essential supplies. The stress we experience
due to global and local challenges is evident. Many people wonder,
will Singapore be able to continue to create miracles as in the
past, and overcome crisis? </p>

grassroots and youth to listen to their views. I notice, recently,
that many young people are uncertain and worried about their future.
This anxiety is not only experienced by recent graduates but also
working professionals and their family members, as well as the elderly.
They are worried that their children will not be able to enjoy the
stability and prosperity that they have experienced. Two weeks ago, the
characters portrayed by actor Huang Wenyong and his son in the 9.00
pm Channel 8 drama serial expressed such sentiments.</p>

worried about their future, and they are anxious about what kind
of role they can play in the development of our nation. Even more Singaporeans
strive for not only economic success but a role for themselves in
the society, and they want to be a contributor and creator. This
desire can be seen from their participation in non-governmental
organisations, social enterprises and welfare organisations. In
terms of the economy, with the increased turbulence in the world economy,
they face increasing uncertainties and competitive pressure. In
my opinion, the Government needs to create more avenues for young
Singaporeans to better understand and take part in our policies,
to strengthen their self-confidence in dealing with future challenges.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9a86c768-f8c2-4ebb-be22-8f00eb024f68">

to maintain stability and prosperity, the Government needs to continue
to get its fundamentals right, to ensure our country's stable development,
that Singapore continues to be a land of opportunities for all,
and that every Singaporean enjoys equal opportunity in education,
employment, housing and healthcare. For years, our tripartite partnership
achieved many benefits and came up with many good policies for our
workers, for example, the Re-employment Act for older workers, recommendations
by the National Wages Council, etc. The Government should further
strengthen this tripartite arrangement, which is a platform that
is admired by many countries. Singaporeans should give this tripartite
partnership strong support, so that this effective platform can
continue to create benefits for working Singaporeans under the cooperation
of the unions, employers and the Government.</p>

I believe education is an important cornerstone. Singapore has one
of the world's most highly educated population. I am happy to note that
our Government-funded universities will be admitting 12,000 students
this year, a record high. From next year, our Government-funded
universities will admit 2,000 more Singaporeans every year, and
total admission for universities will reach 14,000 annually by 2015.
To ensure that all Singaporeans can afford to attend Government-funded universities,
the Government has continued to subsidise 70% of university tuition
fees. I remember during the first year of my university education,
I had to collect a cheque from the Government at the university
office, to pay for my tuition fees, together with my own portion
of the fees. This helped us to understand how much the Government's subsidy
was. Nowadays, very few people know about the amount of subsidy. </p>

investment, I hope that the Ministry of Education will consider
raising the subsidy level to 80%, similar to the subsidy level for
C Class wards in hospitals.</p>

resources and we are reliant on our manpower resources for development.
I hope the Government will make greater investments in tertiary
education, to allow Singaporeans to further realise their potential.
As the little red dot in the region, our young generation faces
even greater challenges. The Ministry of Education should consider
creating a better learning environment for our local undergraduates
and give them more opportunities to realise their potential. The Ministry
of Manpower should also ensure fairness in the employment conditions
of our tertiary graduates, and that they are given a fair starting
point in their careers.</p>

full employment, our jobless rate is only 2%-3%. Currently, Singapore's
unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world. Last year, 77%
of Singaporeans between the age of 25 to 64 were employed, this
is way above the numbers in other similar Asian economies like Hong
Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.</p>

take note of the unemployment rate among young people. In the second
quarter this year, 6.8% of Singaporeans under the age of 30 are jobless.
Of course, this is not the actual jobless rate, as many are still
waiting to further their studies. Although this figure is lower
than other developed nations, we must ensure that it does not continue
to rise. In Spain, the jobless rate of young people between the
age of 16-29 is 45%, this has led to discontentment and anger within
the country. In the United Kingdom, 20% of young Britons between
the age of 16-24 are jobless. We must ensure that our education
system, employment policies and labour market have the mechanisms
that nurtures competitiveness for the future, so that Singaporeans
do not have to worry about employment in the future.</p>

I hope that the Government can consider expanding the Enterprise
Internship Programme and Management Associate Programme by SPRING
Singapore – to introduce university and polytechnic graduates to
companies – so as to provide more internship and apprenticeship
opportunities for them. This will help local graduates face unfair
competition from more experienced foreign competitors. We must ensure
that our young graduates possess the competitive advantage, so that
they will have a fair chance for employment in our labour market which
is open to competition.</p>

that our bilingual policy contributed to the success of Singapore,
and laid the foundation for the future development of Singapore.
Our education system should further emphasise the importance of
learning English and Mother Tongue, and to inculcate traditional
values more effectively. Singaporeans' bilingual ability is one
of our advantages. In China and many other Asian countries, as more
and more people now realise the importance of a bilingual education,
we should not allow Singaporeans to become monolingual. We have
to further strengthen our bilingual education system, so that our
next generation will continue to have this competitive advantage,
to face greater challenges in the future. Not only must we give our
future generation a good education, we must also give them the correct
education. And the correct education is to prepare them for our
nation's development, for living in the future and to tackle the
challenges of the future.</p>

education arena, we are reaching greater heights in the academic domain,
and have produced many young people with outstanding academic achievements. However,
we must be clearly aware that values education deserves more emphasis
and attention. I personally feel that values education in school
must focus on three areas – one, to be responsible for oneself.
It is not uncommon to find that youngsters, who are constantly influenced
by Western culture, view traditional values as feudalistic and not
in tune with the changing times. However, these are often assumptions.
We should shape an individual's moral values from the roots, to allow
youngsters to think about and explore the nature of moral values
under the guidance of teachers, so that young people understand
the true significance of these moral values from their schooling
days, to create their own values structure according to their self-identity
and put these into practice.</p>

for others. Besides learning to be responsible for oneself, values education
should also teaches young people to consider how their actions affect
others. Through discussions of case studies and sharing of personal
experiences, students can better understand the damage caused by
inappropriate behaviour, understand what it means to be responsible
for others and the trade-offs. Teaching them to face the consequences
will have a deterrent effect to some extent.</p>

to the society. As a member of society, values education should also
nurture young people to become good citizens who are socially responsible.
This include, taking care of social hardware like the environment
and public amenities, and also respect for social "software" like
our nation's multi-culturalism."</p>

now aware and have adopted the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility.
This is good. More importantly, Corporate Social Responsibility
should be viewed holistically. I believe that to be socially responsible, businessmen
should employ according to the principles of meritocracy in a fair
and just manner. In other words, they should give all job seekers
equal opportunity, regardless of their age, gender and physical
handicap. That is the social responsibility of employers.</p>

of Manpower has implemented anti-discrimination regulations. The
new Re-employment Act even ensures that elderly Singaporeans who wish
to continue working, will have the opportunity to do so. Companies
who employ them would also benefit from their experience. I urge
employers to abide by fair employment practices when they employ
foreign workers. I also hope that employers will treat local job
seekers more fairly when they make employment decisions. The Ministry
of Manpower should strengthen legal measures to ensure employers
are fair in their recruitment and employment process, to make sure
that employers share their profits with employees.</p>

passed the "Singaporeans First" resolution recently. I am disappointed
to read from media reports that employers are resistant to this.
For our labour policy to be sustainable, there must be a balance
of interests. Currently, the ratio of foreign labour and local labour
is close to 1:2. Our future policies must be more cautiously deliberated,
we must be more selective in bringing in foreign labour. I suggest
the Ministry of Manpower consider the WSQ skills accreditation scheme
as a pre-condition for the renewal and application of work permit,
employment pass. The Ministry of Manpower can also consider tying
the application for work permit to the employment of older workers,
to reduce employers' over-reliance on foreign labour. The Ministry
of Manpower should also strengthen legal measures and impose harsher
penalties for employment agencies and employers who are involved
in exploitative practices when employing foreign workers, for example,
receiving kick-backs, giving loans to foreign workers, charging
exorbitant agency fees and other unreasonable exploits. We cannot
allow employers to transfer the social cost to us in their bid to
cut down business costs.</p>

economic growth and remain strong, we must strengthen our social

tripartite partners consisting of employers, unions and the Government
to support President Tony Tan's emphasis on inclusive growth. This
will allow all Singaporeans, including the low-income, the elderly
and the needy a chance to experience a vibrant life. Being inclusive
does not apply just to the economic aspects, but also in terms of
family, income, education, social and individual development.</p>

me more is how our social security system can ensure that every
Singaporean will be able to receive medical care. As our population
ages, families become smaller, this problem will become more acute.
I believe that strengthening and improving the 3M (MediShield, Medisave
and Medifund), as well as Portable Medical Benefits for workers,
is of immediate urgency. At the same time, the Government should
further educate the public about medical insurance, so that they know
and understand that they need to have enough medical insurance coverage,
to cover the cost of their individual medical needs. On the basis
of the 3M framework, the Ministry of Health should ensure that all
Singaporeans have enough medical insurance coverage to deal with
their healthcare needs.</p>

we should be better prepared to deal with the changes in demographics.
The ageing population means that we need to have relevant facilities

adequate medical care, social assistance and other relevant amenities.
The Ministry of Community, Youth and Sports (MCYS), should assist
families in supporting their elderly, and give more support to the
family caregiver. The emergence of immigrants in our country, as
a new component of our demographics, means that Singapore is becoming a
global, more diverse country. We must strengthen social ties, and

We must not be like some politicians, who claim to be patriotic,

Zaobao</em> commentator Chen Hua Biao wrote, "From this year's General
Elections and Presidential Elections, we can see that our country's political
scene has undergone changes. The new generation voters' desire to
be involved in politics is stronger than before, and after the elections,
the ruling party has responded to demands made by the electorate
during the campaign period, reiterating that it is willing to listen
to the voices of the electorate more effectively and respond to them."
The willingness of any government to listen to the people is a good
thing. However, the Government must also ensure that they do not
over do it, they should not suggest policies that will reap short-
term political gains for themselves, in order to gain the support
of voters. I believe that if voters were to ask to give examples,
they can list the policies that they dislike. With the new political
situation, the Government, with an eye on the next general elections,
may consider doing away with some unpopular policies. However, if
the policies to be scrapped are "good medicine", this would not
be considered as effective, instead, it just shows that they are
only concerned with pleasing the voters. </p>

that the Government must allow for more avenues for Singaporeans

their real identity when they express their views. After all, if

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first thank the President for his Address
and the Government for making the promises contained in the Address?
The Workers' Party welcomes and supports the statement that Singapore's
success is defined not just by material progress but by our values
and ideals. The Workers' Party is ready to work with the Government
towards a better life for all. However, it is important to point
out that over the last few years many Singaporeans have faced harsh realities
that do not match the sentiments contained in the Address. A country's
headline figures such as GDP growth mask the realities of life for
certain groups. Thus, to have segmented updates such as the recent
joint report by the Ministry of Manpower and Department of Statistics
released on 11 October is helpful.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3168d669-de3a-4e4e-ba84-97135715f5ca">

report is that after accounting for inflation, wages of Singaporeans
at the 20th percentile of income have stagnated over the last decade.
In other words the real incomes of the bottom 20% of working Singaporeans
have not increased in 10 years.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4243b4ef-298c-4122-b087-88fcf8b4b5ab">

there are Singaporeans who feel unfairly treated <em class="ph i">vis-Ã-vis</em> the
foreign workforce. Divorces leave many families homeless. The demand
for rental flats has risen. Seniors worry about healthcare costs.
There are chronically ill patients who have even sold their homes
to pay medical bills. As Dr Lam Pin Min said earlier, there are
Singaporeans who believe that one is better off dead than sick.
These issues and the fact that they have been around for years may
lead some Singaporeans to question whether the vision in the President's
Address will be translated to reality.</p>

we share, a future we build together". With such a vast divide between
the haves and have-nots, how do we nurture such a shared home and future
together? At the opening of the Twelfth Parliament, I believe that
the Government is seriously pondering over how to alleviate the
ill effects of certain policies, but moving forward, how should
the Government assess whether it is going in the correct direction and
making a positive impact on people's lives?</p>

hogged headlines over the weekend. As many of us know, the Kingdom
of Bhutan has an unusual way of measuring the country's development.
It is called GNH or Gross National Happiness. This indicator is
garnering international attention even among developed countries.
In July this year, Bhutan initiated a resolution at the UN General
Assembly titled "Happiness towards a holistic approach to development".
There were a total of 66 co-sponsors of the resolution and the General
Assembly adopted it without a vote. The resolution's preamble states
that and I quote, "The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human
goal", and that "the gross domestic product indicator, by nature,
was not designed to and does not adequately reflect the happiness
and well-being of people in a country." Member states have been
invited to "pursue the elaborations of additional measures that
better capture the importance of the pursuit of happiness and well-being
in development with a view to guiding their public policies".</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 84</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-85eafef2-8f30-42cb-a0b9-38288b37edf9">
                  <a name="president-address__id-85eafef2-8f30-42cb-a0b9-38288b37edf9"><!--a--></a>With such international interest,
is it now time for Singapore's Government to conspicuously focus
on happiness as a national goal? Should policies be articulated
to show how they will ultimately achieve happiness for Singaporeans
as a whole? This may sound too warm and fuzzy for some but, in fact,
our Government supported the resolution at the UN. Indeed, Singapore
was one of the 66 countries that co-sponsored the draft resolution.
Since Singapore was a co-sponsor, may I ask the Government to specify
what the practical effect of the resolution is for Singapore? What
indicators does it intend to put in place to measure whether Singaporeans,
as a whole, are achieving happiness and well-being? Might the Government
also tell us how its policies, over the next five years, will be
guided by such indicators?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d8facbe5-287f-407a-8e2d-77b321dac4df">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d8facbe5-287f-407a-8e2d-77b321dac4df"><!--a--></a>In fact, the concept of happiness
at the national level is not new. The American Declaration of Independence
states that among the unalienable rights of men are "life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness". Back home, our children pledge everyday
to "achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation".
Since Independence, Singapore has focused on achieving prosperity
and progress. Has happiness been forgotten despite the words in
our pledge? Or maybe it has been assumed that once there is prosperity
and progress, happiness will ultimately follow. But has it?</p>

come sometimes at the expense of happiness? Prosperity and progress
are certainly important but they cannot be ends in themselves. Surely,
they should be the means to an end, the happiness of Singaporeans
as a whole. What difference can this make to our policy approach?
Let me give an example of an issue that might need to be dealt with
very differently by the Government if it pursues happiness rather
than high GDP growth as the overarching goal – Singapore's low fertility
rate. Dr Lam Pin Min spoke about this earlier as well. Singapore's
total fertility rate or TFR should concern us greatly if we are
worried about preserving our culture and identity for future generations.
I note that surprisingly low emphasis was placed on this in the
PMO's Addenda. In recent years, home prices have risen sharply.
For couples who want children, one of the factors they consider
in deciding when to have children and how many to have is the affordability
of housing. A young couple who wants children but who is stretched
by high housing payments over a long repayment period may delay having
them and may even have fewer children than they will ideally like
to have.</p>

the Chinese University of Hong Kong suggests that housing price
inflation could account for up to 65% of their decrease in fertility
over the past 40 years. In Singapore, analyses by local economists
show a similar link. Assoc Prof Tilak Abeysinghea, Deputy Director
of the Singapore Centre for Applied and Policy Economics at NUS,
has been studying the issue of housing affordability for some time. </p>

Straits Times </em>on 1 September this year, that in Singapore, the
data showed that between 1977 and 2010, there were generally "fewer children
when house prices headed north". He notes that the total fertility
rate of Singapore has a close link with how affordable housing had
been two years earlier. When housing was more affordable, the fertility
rate in Singapore actually rose two years later. He concludes the
article by saying "although the fertility rate is stubbornly less
responsive to many factors, it is possible that sustaining housing
affordability may help at least in arresting the decline in the
fertility rate".</p>

a critical issue if Singaporeans are to remain the core of our society.
If economic growth is overwhelmingly the Government's goal, then
achieving higher housing prices at the expense of fertility may
not be considered a problem. But if the happiness and sustainability
of Singapore society is the overarching goal, then there is a need
to unravel the exact relationship between high property prices and
fertility and what responses might arrest or even reverse the decline
in fertility rates. We will have to look beyond immediate procreation
incentives to the bigger picture. My point, Sir, is to ask: since
the Government had co-sponsored the draft UN resolution to stress
the importance of happiness and well-being in guiding policies,
what tangible changes can we expect in the Government's general
approach? Will Government policies from now on be framed to focus
on whether they will lead to happiness and contentment for Singaporeans
as a whole? Will we be coming up with our own national index of happiness
and well-being?</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, may I add to the congratulations on your election
as the Eighth Speaker of Singapore. Sir, I thank you for the opportunity
to rise in support of the Motion of Thanks to the President. In
my speech, I will cover two broad points: the shaping of a new social
compact in this new political environment, and some thoughts on
holistic education for our children. </p>

an all-embracing, broad-ranging speech which covered many different
facets of life in Singapore. He has outlined his views on how this Parliament
can take Singapore forward. In his speech, he has also re-affirmed
the vision for Singapore, in creating and maintaining a better life
for all – a job, a home and a multi-pathway education system with
many opportunities and options waiting at the end of each path.</p>

in which we will have to operate in order to make good on this vision.
Singapore has a rapidly changing landscape on several fronts:-</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-573d4091-fdb4-4660-854d-0f8ea2242f60">
                  <a name="president-address__id-573d4091-fdb4-4660-854d-0f8ea2242f60"><!--a--></a>(i) After an excellent economic
rebound in 2010, with a 14.5% growth, we are now moving into more
difficult and uncertain economic times.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8397018d-bd05-4c35-a033-1d65471ac6d7">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8397018d-bd05-4c35-a033-1d65471ac6d7"><!--a--></a>(ii) Our societal needs have
also evolved. Our basic needs in food, education, security, housing
and healthcare have been met. But Singaporeans have newer demands,
demands which sit higher on the hierarchy of needs and these present
greater difficulties. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-015002d3-d1a4-49b3-ae4d-bb1501cbb821">

political landscape has also evolved with great pace and in several
ways, and continues to do so. As Dr Lam Pin Min mentioned, there
is now greater political awareness and a heightened subscription
to political ideology and idealism. We are seeing more vocal, diverse
and liberal expressions of desire and a keener interest in Government
policies and laws. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-82c35a76-27d3-4294-9d22-d659df412fad"><!--a--></a>The challenge for us lies
in being able to unite all Singaporeans, foster a shared sense of
purpose and goal and drive Singapore forward in such an evolving
political landscape. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a5fea637-e711-498c-bd3e-982509952264">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a5fea637-e711-498c-bd3e-982509952264"><!--a--></a>In the last few months, straddling
both the General and Presidential Elections, we saw an outpouring
of unhappiness, resentment even, at the implementation of some policies.
As a new Member of Parliament, I must confess I was somewhat taken
aback. But when analysed to a greater or lesser extent, I think
that those sentiments of unhappiness were probably an accurate reflection
of matters on the ground. It was felt that the Government did not
listen, or did not want to listen, or simply decided on policies
and laws regardless of what the ground sentiment was. As a result, Singaporeans
sent a message through the Elections and the Ruling party was returned to
power with its lowest margin, and lost a GRC for the first time.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f6af4d28-2d16-4ff6-a8ab-4b5c82e19328">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f6af4d28-2d16-4ff6-a8ab-4b5c82e19328"><!--a--></a>It has certainly been more
difficult for the Government to navigate and operate in this new
landscape. But more difficult does not mean it is bad. In fact,
I see political maturity as a good thing for Singapore and Singaporeans.
It is good for Singapore that its citizens want to be engaged with
the Government, to understand and challenge its policies in open
and honest debate, and to be very much a part of the decision making
process.</p>

new awareness and idealism to grow into a tension and divide us,
we should harness this growing political awareness and interest
and use it as capital to build a new compact between the Government
and its people for whom its policies are designed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b4828dea-902d-43c1-b43e-b3e206431f4c">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b4828dea-902d-43c1-b43e-b3e206431f4c"><!--a--></a>Indeed the Government has
resolved to be much more open and seek out alternative ways in which
to reach out to citizens. Active citizenry was something that was promoted
at the National Day Rally by the Prime Minister. I read over the
weekend that the Government will also deploy civil servants to gain
a better sense of ground reaction and sentiment.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-3b717921-dc4a-494d-aad2-e2cc7ae70567"><!--a--></a>Sir, in many ways we are already
shaping this new compact. Singaporeans now expect that the Government
must not only have strong and effective leaders, it must operate
in an environment where the policy-making is an inclusive process.
As this new compact takes shape, there are, Sir, to my mind, three
important considerations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e071ce6-884d-42de-8083-e9cc4afa432b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9e071ce6-884d-42de-8083-e9cc4afa432b"><!--a--></a>First, we have to learn to
deepen and broaden our engagement with Singaporeans from all parts
of society. There must also be an emotional connection. While we rationalise
and explain policies and law to Singaporeans, sometimes unfavourable ones,
we can do more, not only to reason by logic but also to connect
better with the hearts of Singaporeans and, perhaps even learn to
understand what some Singaporeans sometimes find difficult to articulate.
It goes without saying that not all laws and not all policies will
find favour, even after the most open of consultations and engagement.
But it would help if Singaporeans understand, if not necessarily
agree with, the rationale behind a policy decision. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 87</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e4ef8b76-fe59-4760-910c-4ece25b958d1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e4ef8b76-fe59-4760-910c-4ece25b958d1"><!--a--></a>Sir, I think the Government
needs to spend some time to change several perceptions, that dealings
with the Government is a one-way street, that the Government does
not listen, that feedback is notionally gathered when the Government
has already made up its mind by the time it consults with the public.
I believe we need to cultivate a better understanding and foster
a spirit of partnership to make all Singaporeans feel that they are
engaging the Government on a dynamic, interactive platform. Only
then can we foster a shared ownership of matters which affect the
lives of Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c15d83c8-c8c5-4a17-8f71-9b63494cb002">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c15d83c8-c8c5-4a17-8f71-9b63494cb002"><!--a--></a>Secondly, the Government must
proactively review and constantly re-consider the rationale and
applicability of policies and update them. It is only if we do so
that we can earn and cultivate the trust which Singaporeans invest
in the Government. We are now beyond even the P-65 generation. Singaporeans
in this generation are not only more educated but also cynical to
an extent and naturally inquisitive. They want to know how a policy
decision is reached and what has been considered in reaching that
decision. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3a41bddd-4d55-4cfb-bb10-c2ca3fff3f8b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3a41bddd-4d55-4cfb-bb10-c2ca3fff3f8b"><!--a--></a>Sir, the political compact
of today requires more than just a belief that the Government is
good and that it would always make the right decisions. In the past,
when you see a doctor and get a diagnosis and a prescription from
the doctor, it would almost always be religiously adhered to. Today,
you are more likely to find that the same patient will look up the
Internet to verify both the diagnosis and the prescription just
to check if indeed the doctor knows what he is talking about. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a05285e-7b3e-4cc8-b4f8-250d542e0d58">
                  <a name="president-address__id-7a05285e-7b3e-4cc8-b4f8-250d542e0d58"><!--a--></a>We must accept that we are
now operating in this sphere. A sphere which will accord process
and accountability with as much if not greater weight than the decision
itself. It is not a generation that will invest trust just on blind
faith.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-726dafe3-2066-4ec8-9f52-e63acc539cc1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-726dafe3-2066-4ec8-9f52-e63acc539cc1"><!--a--></a>In the last few months, there
have been a number of policy revisions which have been fairly well
received. The Government has revised the income ceiling for HDB applications.
It was a move that was greeted with widespread cheer. The reasons
given for revising the ceiling were that income levels were going
up, and couples were marrying later. And a combination of these
factors meant that unless the income ceilings were raised, a significant
number of our people would not make it within the HDB fold.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0d5bd04d-3196-4f4c-b2ff-76cc77274972">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0d5bd04d-3196-4f4c-b2ff-76cc77274972"><!--a--></a>But there was also some circumspection,
and perhaps some scepticism. It was felt that the revisions came
at a time when it was viewed as a knee-jerk reaction in response to
rising sentiments against the Government. Rising income levels and
later marriages have been a trend for some years now, even prior
to the revisions, and there have been previous calls made to relook
and revise the income ceilings. Why is it only now that the Government
is responding to these calls? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b7852667-489c-4a87-99b1-b2ab5d97345b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b7852667-489c-4a87-99b1-b2ab5d97345b"><!--a--></a>The same could perhaps be
said of the review of Ministerial salaries, an issue which had occupied
this House several times in the past. Why was it not necessary to
review previously, but had to be done so now? In my view, Sir, the
greater accountability and access to the basis for making those
decisions, especially those which affect the lives and livelihoods
of Singaporeans are needed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7afa2787-22ba-4e95-a06e-54f420043f32">
                  <a name="president-address__id-7afa2787-22ba-4e95-a06e-54f420043f32"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, we should always,
despite what I have said, be careful about not allowing the deeper
and broader engagement to become a situation where the Government
bows to all demands and becomes populist. We have been fortunate
to have had a strong and decisive Government, highly competent,
well capable of looking after Singapore both in the short and long
term. It is an advantage which not many governments in the world, if
indeed there are, would have. That has meant that our Government
did not shirk from making unpopular decisions, if indeed those decisions
are believed to be in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans,
even if it comes with the prospect of losing some amount of political
capital. Singaporeans must accept that not every demand can be met.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 88</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aac6cda1-3dc6-4316-a253-dff51725eef6">
                  <a name="president-address__id-aac6cda1-3dc6-4316-a253-dff51725eef6"><!--a--></a>I therefore urge Singaporeans
to meet the Government half way. They need to be rational and practical
as to the limits within which the ideals are pushed. The compact will
need to balance idealism with real-world complexities and practical
limitations. It would be irresponsible to expect the Government
to embark on popular policies which might well have short-term gains
and political mileage but which have longer term adverse consequences
for Singapore.</p>

three factors, collectively, will anchor the new socio-political compact
between the Government and the people of Singapore. The President
has called on all Singaporeans to build our future together. It
is my respectful view that, before we do that, we must first settle
on this new equilibrium in the relationship between the Government
and its people. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c2fde8e4-5e8c-4476-b13b-f21b02bfb6ef">

onto my next point, in relation to the Government's renewed emphasis
on attaining a holistic education for our children. In Singapore,
it goes without saying: land and other natural resources are scarce,
our people capital represents our most valuable resource. In his
Address to this House, the President had noted that heavy investments
have been and continue to be made in education for the young; and
that we should maximise their pathways, give them options, help
them gain confidence and blossom. Sir, to my mind, this is absolutely
vital. There is no doubt that the future of Singapore lies in our
children.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-763c7133-43ec-4486-b31d-ac83eb84e10d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-763c7133-43ec-4486-b31d-ac83eb84e10d"><!--a--></a>One of the best ways to invest
in our children is to continually improve and transform the education
system to meet the needs of new generations of children. When Minister of
Education Heng Swee Keat delivered his speech at the Annual Work
Plan Seminar, he said that education has to be a long-term endeavour.
A child entering Primary 1 next year will contribute to our workforce
only around the year 2030. This point resonated with me because
it graphically illustrates why it is that we must be long term in
our vision and planning. If we get our policies wrong, then the
impact will be felt by a whole new generation of citizens. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8badca2f-b6f9-44f9-bc21-37ff08fd2eb7">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8badca2f-b6f9-44f9-bc21-37ff08fd2eb7"><!--a--></a>Over the years, progressive
changes have indeed been made to our system. The most recent ones
have been very well received. The focus has shifted to quality and diversity,
with the goal being to develop the potential of every child to the
maximum, particularly in terms of character development and the
inculcation of a good value system in our children. In addition,
more choices are being introduced to our students so that they can
develop their strengths and interests not only at a different pace,
but also on different paths. </p>

in my constituency to invite ideas and comments to get a better
sense of the areas of concern in Singapore's education policies.
I found that my residents' desire to be involved in and to be heard
on Government policies, which I spoke of earlier, was very evident
during this forum. It was very well attended, and we had grassroots
leaders and residents representing parents, teachers and students
take part in the debate. We had a very lively debate and this has
helped shaped some of the points which I would now make.</p>

its Addendum made clear that the values and character development
will be placed at the front and centre of our education system.
Our policies will be designed to build a sense of shared values
and respect so that we can appreciate and celebrate the diversity
in our country. Sir, this re-affirmation is timely. But it is also not
a new policy. </p>

Learn More" movement was started. This movement introduced a focus
on helping teachers and students focus on the fundamentals of effective
teaching, so that our students would be, and I quote from the 2010 Parliamentary
response, "engaged, learn with understanding and are developed holistically,
beyond preparing for tests and examinations". That was the objective
of the 2006 movement.</p>

parents and teachers will agree that values and character development
should be placed at the core of any good education system. But the question
is how is it different from our earlier initiatives, and how is
this going to be introduced and implemented in our classrooms? In
my view, it would be wholly counter-intuitive to make values and
character development a teaching module on which tutorials can be
had.</p>

I came across a paper. In 2008, the Ontario government launched
a Character Development Initiative for their schools. They grappled
with the same difficulties as we have – coming from a system which
tended to put academic excellence ahead of everything else. In the
end, they settled on a few key principles, and I found the report
to be instructive.</p>

time to teach core values and character development. Instead, these
concepts have to be woven into the fabric of our education system;
it has to permeate all that happens in schools. It cannot be taught
like any other content-based subjects. </p>

traits have to be experienced. It has to be lived and imparted by
example. It has to be demonstrated and exemplified by our school principals
and our teachers on a daily basis, and reinforced by the community
and parents at home. At the end of the day, character is built and
values instilled by giving the child an opportunity to live life's
experiences – such as when they fail a school exam, or lose a football
match, or work with peers in a group project or simply resolve a
dispute in the school courtyard.</p>

that, and I quote, "Character development must be integrated into
the curricular experiences of students and embedded into the culture
of the school and classroom in an explicit and intentional manner."
Sir, I hope we can consider this approach and realign the focus
in our school curriculum so that the relevant measure of our students
is not just the academic grades achieved, but also in that student's
fundamental moral precepts and value system. We might well need
to have a mindset shift to reinforce the message that a quality
education is a whole lot more than just academic development, but
it would be worth that shift if our children emerge from the system

pre-school education. I know that this is not a new debate at all
and there have been previous calls to nationalise early pre-school
education. The Ministry has resisted this system because it did
not want the pre-school system to become merely an extension of
the formal school system, where numeracy and literacy skills get
emphasised at the expense of other developmental goals. </p>

not advocating an extension to formal schooling. But I do believe
that more could be done to start the process of inculcating core
values and character development from an early age. It has long
been recognised that children between the ages of three and seven
have a strong cognitive ability and that this can best be nurtured
through play at that age. The pre-school years are a critical period
for the development of our children. They lay the foundation for
our children's education prior to formal schooling.</p>

movements by the Government to improve the standards of and accredit
pre-school education such as SPARK, and also various recent MCYS
efforts. Just last night, the 25th Anniversary of PCF was celebrated
with a pledge to improve the standards of pre-school education. </p>

remains not compulsory nor is pre-school curriculum content currently
regulated by the Government. Hence, in addition to continuing to accredit
good quality pre-schools, I hope the Government could also develop
a suitable programme for pre-schoolers to nurture character building
and shape the inculcation of a strong moral system from an early
age. I also hope that we can invest more in training and equipping
pre-school teachers to be able to help our pre-school children at
that age. Those are the formative years in a child's learning path
and I feel we should not lose the opportunity to seed the foundation
of good quality values and encouraging the development of strong
moral fibre in our children.</p>

local request. The Minister has also outlined his vision for every
school in the neighbourhood to be a good school. Again, this has
been very warmly received. In my constituency at Jalan Besar, however,
the issue is a more fundamental one because there are no schools
at all in my constituency, and I hope the Ministry can look into
the possibility of building a new school in this neighbourhood. Jalan
Besar is a mature estate, but there is an increasing young parent
population and hence sufficient demand, particularly in the areas
around City View which is a new DBSS project which has just received
its first residents a few months ago. And so, the overall younger
residents, young parent profile, has increased. Sir, with that,
I whole-heartedly support the Motion.</p>

Minister for Education and Minister for Law (Ms Sim Ann)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank the President
for his Address. The President spoke of changes that are occurring
within our society and the challenges we face in building our shared
future. His words, Sir, struck a chord with me. My own experience
of serving constituents since the General Election in May has been
nothing short of eventful. Doing so, with a baby on the way, has
made it even more interesting. People approach me to strike up conversations
about pregnancy and childbirth. They ask me how I am coping. We
trade parenting tips and advice and they share their hopes and fears
for their own children. This has given me ample opportunity to reflect
upon the kind of society we are building for ourselves and leaving
for the next generation. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dd4e1510-40f8-40d8-817c-19a84f7a2aad">
                  <a name="president-address__id-dd4e1510-40f8-40d8-817c-19a84f7a2aad"><!--a--></a>I am among a new batch of
MPs elected to this House after a watershed General Election (GE).
We operate in what the media has taken to calling the "new normal". There
is a sense that the game has changed, to the disadvantage and discomfort
of those who only know how to play by the old rules. I see it differently.
Whether you choose to call it the "new normal" or something else,
I embrace the present. And why not? The forces that shape the political
landscape as it currently stands have also shaped the perceptions
and instincts of many of us here.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0eefd5cc-c8a8-4fd2-b04c-0d3fcb2cd0f1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0eefd5cc-c8a8-4fd2-b04c-0d3fcb2cd0f1"><!--a--></a>We are the product of our
personal experiences. I was a child of the late-1970s and 1980s,
a teenager of the early 1990s. The story of Singapore in the years
when I was growing up was largely an upbeat one. Growth was good
in most years, and indeed came to be expected. There were jobs.
Incomes rose. Our parents told us how their lives have improved
vastly compared to those of their parents, and they hoped, too,
that our lives would represent similar quantum leaps in comfort
and prosperity over theirs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f317dd64-a880-4efe-8c35-492712842abb">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f317dd64-a880-4efe-8c35-492712842abb"><!--a--></a>As our economy grew, we could
afford to put away more and more resources for long-term goals,
such as investing in our people. I, too, was a beneficiary. As an undergraduate
studying Economics and Political Science overseas, I felt convinced
that my country had got it right. In classes and tutorials, we argued
endlessly about problems like unemployment, slow growth, no growth,
bloated welfare systems, fractious labour relations, grid-locked
parliaments – problems which troubled societies more developed than
ours. I felt a thrill of pride every time Singapore was held up
as an example of a country that had found a miracle formula to sustained
success – and more than a twinge of indignation when detractors
argued that our success was no more than the result of a historical
fluke. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a225647-c5f4-4dae-8c54-7f0747400a91">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2a225647-c5f4-4dae-8c54-7f0747400a91"><!--a--></a>In 1998, I started work in
the civil service, while the Asian Economic Crisis was in full swing.
My views were quickly moderated by a new reality. Like stages in
a roller coaster ride, we went from climbing a long, steep incline
to a series of swoops, turns and somersaults. In quick succession,
we experienced the Asian economic crisis, followed by the bursting
of the dot-com bubble, the 9-11 terrorist attacks, SARS, the Flu Pandemic,
and most recently, the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4958b75a-6efa-462f-a095-b14cd7c0033c">

a new challenge on the horizon. At the same time, major tectonic
shifts are re-shaping the global landscape – most notably, the rise
of China and India. With nimble steering and steadfast implementation,
Singapore has stayed clear of the worst effects these challenges
could bring. We have managed to avoid many of the problems that
larger, more developed economies still face. I remain convinced
that many of our broad policies are right. But over time and with
experience, my understanding became more nuanced. I do see new challenges
that will stretch our ability and put our resourcefulness to the
test. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 92</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-efdbea6d-c2fa-4ef1-8a36-aa4451ef9c9b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-efdbea6d-c2fa-4ef1-8a36-aa4451ef9c9b"><!--a--></a>First, the trade-offs involved
in our strategies are getting more stark, and the pay-offs becoming
slimmer. My generation has seen improvements, but not necessarily
the quantum leap that our parents' generation had enjoyed compared
to our grandparents' generation. That is inevitable, as we start
from ever-higher bases. Whether it is landing new investments, creating
new jobs or incubating new engines of growth, we have to run fast
just to stay in the same place, and faster still, if we want to
get ahead of the competition. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-cca9d848-837e-4c4b-a2fd-beaea0302d87"><!--a--></a>Second, even the best conceived
strategies and policies are not immune to shortcomings in implementation,
gaps in communication and sometimes, human error. Meanwhile, our
people are becoming better educated, and their expectations of government
greater. Society is becoming more complex and diverse. People rally around
a wider range of causes, and form expert opinions on issues close
to their heart. Against this backdrop, the bar has risen considerably
for policy implementation and communication. Representatives of
government agencies who communicate policies and enforce rules on
the ground find themselves having to withstand the scrutiny of an increasingly
sophisticated and involved public. Residents in my constituency,
for example, in their dealings with Government agencies and their
representatives, do not shy away from pointing out flaws in implementation,
imperfections in the application of rules, or unsuitable choices
of words and phrases. They do not hesitate to tell me how they think
I can improve too, for which I am grateful.</p>

present new areas of challenge. People do want to have a say on
things that concern them and I have come to learn that this could
include how openings should be constructed in the lift landing or
where a road divider should be positioned exactly. Not to mention
less tangible but possibly more far reaching policy like education,
healthcare and employment. Having gathered views – how to shape common
understanding and how to formulate plans that the community can
take true ownership of, also require judgement and skill. Communications,
too, are a challenge because it is not just about conveying information
but about fostering genuine understanding. To do all these well,
requires dedicated resources, large amounts of time and the right
kind of people. But there are good reasons why we should take the
trouble and make the investment. In many areas, the Government does
not have a monopoly on good ideas. Tapping on the community's strengths
and ideas often helps us realise better outcomes for all. I have
seen many examples – the teaching of Mother Tongue, the organisation
and delivery of special education, or something as everyday as re-organising
traffic flow in a housing estate.</p>

owned by the community also have better chances of retaining support
and of being sustained. Improving on policy implementation, communications,
outreach, and working hand-in-hand with the public – these, to me,
are the demands of the "new normal".</p>

at many levels. For elected representatives, it means an even heavier
investment in constituency work and ground presence. For Government
agencies, it means a rebalancing of effort between conceptualisation
and delivery, between planning and implementation. It means redefining
a set of skills, and equipping our officers with them. </p>

bodies, it means higher standards of service and commitment. Some
will say that these are all details. But details do not take care
of themselves. Someone – and very possibly, many "someones" – have
to do it. Many of the things that made Singapore great – and cleanliness
comes to mind as an example – are the results of many individuals
collectively looking after details, and sweating the small stuff.
It is the attention to detail and robustness in delivery that makes
our system greater than the sum of its parts. It is one of the hallmarks
that keep Singapore unique, and a precious legacy to be handed over
to the next generation.</p>

better implementation and outreach are the demands that stand before
us. Meeting those demands, however, does not imply that the Government
will be able to deliver what every single citizen wants. No amount
of consultation or outreach can guarantee every single person a
dream home, for instance. There may also be instances where constraints
of the law prevent us from meeting every individual's request. But
I think we do owe it to ourselves and our fellow citizens to pursue
every possible opportunity to make things better.</p>

the education system and the schools' outreach to parents. As Vice-Chair
of Community and Parents in Support of Schools (Compass), I have
the opportunity to meet and hear the views of many parents and individuals
who want to better understand what they have observed in schools
or in their children's learning experience, and offer concrete suggestions
on how we can further strengthen our partnership with parents. On
the part of the Ministry of Education, we value such interactions
highly. We are actively thinking about how to scale up such interactions
so as to be able to invite the insights and perspectives of more
participants.</p>

heart is the ongoing review of Special Education for students with
special learning needs. This is an area in which many voluntary
welfare organisations (VWOs) and passionate individuals have left
their mark, and with whom public sector agencies like the Ministry
of Education, MCYS and the National Council of Social Services work
in close partnership. My team is now actively tapping the views
of many stakeholders in studying how best to improve the quality
and accessibility of Special Education, enhance assistance to families
who need more help, and improve support for special needs students

teaching and learning, too, community efforts have played a key
role in supporting the efforts of schools and educators, and continue
to do so. For example, the Malay Language Learning and Promotion
Committee (MLLPC), chaired by my colleague Senior Parliamentary
Secretary, Mr Hawazi Daipi, has supported Malay language and literary
activities put together by various Malay community organisations,
for example debates and video-making competitions. Likewise, the
Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC), chaired
by Minister Iswaran, had also worked extensively with various community
partners to organise a wide range of programmes to promote the use
of Tamil in the wider community, such as creating a radio jockey
programme for students and holding a Tamil Language Festival in
April this year. Mr Speaker, with your leave I shall use Mandarin

many people in the cultural and education sector. Overall, we are
all concerned about the level of the language and the learning environment.</p>

and exerts more influence in the world, Chinese parents, and even
some non-Chinese parents, are realising the importance of learning Chinese.

future.</p>

fast flow of information have enabled Chinese learning more interesting
and diversified, and further proved the vitality of the Chinese
language. I think many people still remember that, before computer
and the Internet became popular, some questioned whether Chinese
would be rendered redundant in the digital era. Now time has proven
that Chinese not only has strong vitality but can also generate new
content and new vocabulary. What we can learn and use has increased.</p>

that many of them are young people who have benefited from our bilingual

Their feedback is not limited to pointing out where the Government

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion of thanks to the
President for his speech delivered at the Opening of Parliament.
The President has outlined a clear plan, and statement of intent,
for upholding the values of our society, while growing the economy
to deliver a better life for all Singaporeans. It should hopefully
increase the happiness quotient for our nation. It may seem odd
to raise on this occasion, certain aspects of the recent Presidential
Election, which caused some confusion and even unhappiness. But
the President's Opening Speech is a timely reminder of the critical
role he plays in our system of Government, and these issues are simply
too important to overlook. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-704de221-24bb-4f94-a12e-06ccdca0f421">
                  <a name="president-address__id-704de221-24bb-4f94-a12e-06ccdca0f421"><!--a--></a>I would like to highlight
three aspects of the Presidential Election, namely, one – the qualifications
to be elected as President; two – the duties and powers of the President; and
three – the manner in which the elections should be run. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-85e3c8e2-d54a-4f3c-8b92-f6ec9c956c5a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-85e3c8e2-d54a-4f3c-8b92-f6ec9c956c5a"><!--a--></a>Taking first the qualifications
to be elected as President, the recent contest threw up some interesting
posers. While certain criteria such as serving previously as a Minister were
clear, others were less clear. Does the reference to a chairman
in the same breath as a chief executive officer, connote an executive
chairman as opposed to one who held a non-executive role? The difference
is more than one of semantics, when one considers that the nation
is looking for a candidate with the requisite experience and ability
to manage the affairs of a sizeable entity.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 96</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-634f3401-2e2c-456f-b81a-c90962619691">
                  <a name="president-address__id-634f3401-2e2c-456f-b81a-c90962619691"><!--a--></a>The posers did not stop there.
Should a co-operative equate to a company incorporated under the
Companies Act? And perhaps the issue that sparked the most controversy
under this head – did a senior position in a fund management company, which
had assets under management but not paid-up capital of over $100
million, constitute a similar or comparable position so as to qualify
the person to run for President? The candidate in question was himself
quoted in the media as having been surprised, albeit pleasantly,
that he got his certificate of eligibility.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f53d7d6b-6208-400c-a938-48aa670a7109">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f53d7d6b-6208-400c-a938-48aa670a7109"><!--a--></a>It is worth pointing out that
the assessment of whether a candidate is in a similar or comparable
position is made by a three-member Presidential Elections Committee, whose
decision is final and not subject to appeal or review in any court
of law. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3f35f80c-ed89-4d60-8bdc-127bb8e7f737">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3f35f80c-ed89-4d60-8bdc-127bb8e7f737"><!--a--></a>I do not seek to criticise
the actual decisions of the Presidential Elections Committee, whose
members are all of impeccable standing. But it seems incongruous
that on something so fundamental as the qualifications to be President,
there should be a wide range of views on what falls within and without
the statutory criteria. And that the issue would be decided by three
individuals, no matter how wise, without review by any other body. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e63b55eb-1b49-4a57-be84-28fbf25e082b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e63b55eb-1b49-4a57-be84-28fbf25e082b"><!--a--></a>Based on the precedent set
in this recent election, there is a whole host of non-executive
chairmen and hedge fund managers that could harbour hopes of eligibility, should
they decide to run for President in 2017. In fact, each assessment
by the Presidential Elections Committee is specific to the individual
candidate, so they may very well be disappointed. But this itself
would lead to further queries as why one candidate is eligible and
another, in another similar or similar-sounding position, is not.</p>

the intention of Parliament to have such a wide range of persons
who would be qualified to run for President? The government of the
day should review the situation and consider if greater clarity
– whether to make the group of potential candidates narrower or
wider – should be introduced. It is simply too critical an issue
to be left open to interpretation. </p>

is that of the functions of the President. In the run-up to, and
during, the actual campaign period, voters were confronted with
the rather unsettling spectacle of candidates coming up with different
views as to what the President could or could not do. We even saw
a couple of candidates, none of whom are legally-trained or citing
any legal authority, disagreeing with remarks made by the Minister
for Law as to the scope of the powers of the President. </p>

that the Constitution is clear on the functions and duties of the
President. I also believe the majority of voters were not confused,
and voted for their choice of candidate according to the role laid
down by the Constitution. Rather than to use the words of one candidate,
the role that some of them would "like to have". However, there
is no telling how many voters were genuinely confused, or even misled, about
what the President could do for them. And it certainly had an impact
on the way the respective campaigns were carried out, which is the
last aspect to which I turn. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 97</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-709e3e8c-be7b-49b2-aec0-1ad8d755a99c">
                  <a name="president-address__id-709e3e8c-be7b-49b2-aec0-1ad8d755a99c"><!--a--></a>The role of the President
was conceived clearly as a non-political one, so as to unite all
segments of society. To that end, the Constitution provides that
the President shall not be a Member of Parliament nor even a member
of a political party. It was probably envisaged that the election
of the President would be on that basis, as exemplified by the only
previous contest involving the late Dr Ong Teng Cheong where the
focus was on the candidate's credentials and experience. However,
it was perhaps inevitable that any form of election would be susceptible
to politicking and campaign tactics. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-748f5b9a-a3fd-4a09-862b-89253a52f3c8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-748f5b9a-a3fd-4a09-862b-89253a52f3c8"><!--a--></a>Given the different views
the candidates held of the powers and duties of the President, this
spilled over into some candidates promising to raise issues which
were more akin to those to be raised by Parliamentarians or political
parties, and one candidate even spoke of promoting the profile of
non-PAP forces. Added to the fact that all four candidates had been
members of political parties, three of them until shortly before
the election, and one of whom who actually contested in the last
General Elections in May this year, and the election of our supposedly
non-political President had strong political overtones to it. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-75298f33-2f98-4e4a-857a-d4ff14b8cd90">

process by which we elect our head of state to be a unifying figure
for those of different race, religion and political persuasion.
Should criteria be introduced to require a candidate not to have
been a member of a political party for a minimum period of years,
and not to have taken part in any political activities or contested
an election in that time? Should limitations be placed on the sort
of campaigning candidates can engage in, so that it stays non-political
and they do not promise to do something if elected, which is not
legally within their powers? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-924e8d0a-bdec-42b2-8c39-feb0d5fefb64">
                  <a name="president-address__id-924e8d0a-bdec-42b2-8c39-feb0d5fefb64"><!--a--></a>I believe the electorate have
as a whole voted wisely and well in the recent Presidential Election.
But that does not mean that these issues should not be addressed. The
role of the President, and the election of the best person for that
role, is far too important to leave things as they are. And changes
should be introduced well before the next Presidential Election
in 2017, so that the position is made clear to all, detached from the
hubris of a national election. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's Address was very thought-provoking,

8.5 births to every 1,000 persons. The fertility rate is about 1.11%.</p>

such a dramatic way that it will not be very long before where instead
of the young having to care for the old as it is now, the old may
have to care for themselves and maybe the young. This is indeed
a very serious issue which requires soul searching and comprehensive
plans to deal with. Time is running against us. We cannot stop the
clock. For me, this is an issue very close to home. In Potong Pasir, the
percentage of older persons is much higher than the national average. Approximately
37% of residents in Potong Pasir are 50 years and above. As of May
this year, we have more than 600 residents who are above the age
of 80 years in our very small community.</p>

the President spoke on the theme of a home we share and a future
we build together. He spoke on the challenges of growth amidst the
current flux in the global economy but pointed out also and I quote,
"that we have a well diversified financially sound and competitive
economy. We have a well-educated, hardworking workforce". The President,
also in his concluding remarks, emphasised that as a nation, we
have achieved something unique in the world – that of a multi-racial city
living in harmony. On this note, Sir, if you may allow me to divide
my speech into two areas: the first focusing on the economy and
its impact on young professional managers and executives (PMEs).
I will speak separately in Mandarin on the challenges of ensuring
a continued focus on our cultural heritage while maintaining a strong cohesive
multicultural and multi-ethnic society. </p>

global economy is a proverbial yo-yo: one minute up, the next minute
down. Even amidst the strong fundamentals that we have built in Singapore,
we have just narrowly avoided a technical recession in the third
quarter of this year. Yet, I hasten to add that compared to the
rest of the world economy, our growth rate is still stable. Recent
job creation statistics in the United States have improved for the
first time in many months and should have been a source of celebration.
It has shown that the US economy, still the single largest in the
world, is performing better than expected. In September 2011 alone,
almost 103,000 jobs were reported as being created, an almost two-fold
improvement from the Labor Department statistics in August 2011.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fcac6d82-9a91-4fb5-a54a-8eb4eb1e6e11">

since Lehman Brothers have been that the unemployment rate in the
US has stayed stuck at 9.1%, with about 14 million jobless, more
than twice the population of Singapore. The 100,000 jobs in September,
to put things in perspective, are nothing more than a drop in the
ocean, akin to fighting a forest fire with a garden hose. A further
important note in the quagmire of statistics is that of the 103,000 reported
jobs added back into the US economy, close to 50,000 were due to
workers returning from strike action, not new jobs at all. In essence,
it was a recovery that was very much a non-event. Far more troubling,
of course, is the Summer 2011 report by the Labor Department again
that youth unemployment now stands at a total of 4.1 million in
the United States. </p>

also continues to loom large over global financial stability. Coming
on the back of the 2008 crisis, the second hit is seen to have come
too soon. Unemployment in the Euro zone has continued to climb and
it is particularly sobering that a staggering 46.2% of youths in
Spain alone are now unemployed. Greece is not far behind. For much
of the EU, cash-flow is now deemed to mean "the movement of money
as it makes its way down the toilet".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-02800e81-6bad-48cc-9a23-9d28bfda8435">
                  <a name="president-address__id-02800e81-6bad-48cc-9a23-9d28bfda8435"><!--a--></a>On the home front, the situation
is rosier. The unemployment situation in Singapore has remained
stable, at about 2%. Our fundamentals remain strong and, amongst younger
Singaporeans, our labour force participation rates remain stable
at 89.4% for those aged 25 to 29, and 89% for those aged 30 to 34.
Higher education amongst younger Singaporeans has also kept them
mobile in the job market compared to their seniors. And a recent
development is that a far larger proportion is now employed as PMEs.
However, Sir, just as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, the Member for Ang Mo Kio
GRC, had mentioned earlier, I have had the opportunity to hear from
many young workers, both from trade unions as well as from my residents
in the constituency over the past few months. A common refrain has
been concerns over the future of our economy as well as the stability
of the job market. Although a significant proportion of our graduating students
from polytechnics as well as universities continue to be able to
find suitable employment, a growing number is feeling the strain
of both global competition as well as decreasing job security. A
recent straw poll of 200 young respondents showed that 70% did not
think that the world economy has recovered since 2009. A further
50% were least optimistic when asked to project the economic performance
of the world economy for 2012. During a recent focus group discussion,
a large proportion of time was spent discussing the challenges faced
by young contract workers. Dismiss the current notion of contract
work as that of older workers or low-wage workers alone. Contract
hire has been the norm in many western economies for PMEs as well.
In Singapore, this preference for contractors has only recently
seen a rise in demand amongst employers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f27f980-3f8a-499b-a2e2-7dfa6961ec42">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2f27f980-3f8a-499b-a2e2-7dfa6961ec42"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, in a <em class="ph i">Business
Times</em> article on 11 October 2011, the title read and I quote,
"contract workers become more attractive to MNCs". The article alluded
to the fact that more MNCs as well as local companies are beginning
to hire staff on contract basis. Following the Lehman crisis, the
lap to downsizing by many companies, including MNCs in Singapore,
a new trend has been to move towards the hiring of short-term contractors
to shift headcount costs to become a variable rather than a fixed
cost. This arrangement works well for some PMEs, young PMEs in particular,
who gain greater exposure and are able to explore more horizons
in their early career. Flexibility is also an added bonus for them.
However, the reality hits home for some, when rolling contracts
mean that career progression and employment benefits are curtailed.
While there are many enlightened employers, many young PMEs on contract
find themselves losing out to their peers on permanent employment
in terms of job security as well as benefits.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-570147ff-622c-43af-90ee-7211e10405a9">

is not evil. Many young workers thrive on it. The problem, frankly,
becomes finding the next job and putting yourself out there on the market.
The other issue, however, is the fairness of contracts as well as
whether young workers are aware of their contractual obligations
as well as the type of contracts they have entered into. In our
enthusiasm to start work, I believe that many of us, Sir, have plunged
into our first job with the eagerness of children in a sweet shop,
only to find that we have inadvertently ended up in a sweat shop
instead. While many employers provide their contractors with leave
and even medical benefits comparable to permanent staff, these appear
to be few and far between. Many young workers on contract continue
to sacrifice employment benefits in looking for contract work and
this may lead to long-term issues. One young lady I spoke to was
troubled by how she would be treated by her employers should she
settle down and start a family. She was genuinely worried that her
contract would not be renewed, should she get pregnant and that
her employer may still legitimately decide not to renew her contract.
A young IT professional was equally worried about finding the next
project within the industry, with it becoming increasingly crowded
out. Another felt that after two renewals, he seems to have lagged behind
his peers in career progression when compared to those on permanent employment.</p>

just some of the many feedback that young workers have provided
recently and represents a microcosm of the bigger issues faced by
them. Sir, I am heartened that come January 2012, PMEs will be able
to receive limited representations under new guidelines. This change
recognises the changing demography of our workforce with PMEs soon
becoming the rank-and-file of today. In fact, based on the labour
force survey by the Ministry of Manpower, the share of young PMETs
in the age band of 25 to 29 has increased significantly from 55%
in 1999 to 69% in 2009. Sir, it is in this vein that I sincerely
urge the Ministry of Manpower to continue to look into the issue
of contract work, especially the challenges it poses for young PMEs.
I further urge the Ministry to consider a set of guidelines to ensure
that young workers in particular are not taken advantage of, should
they be in contract hires and to expand the information base contained
within MOM's Career Compass initiative.</p>

youth employment in Singapore is decidedly optimistic. Although
some may point to a shrinking youth presence in the workforce at
only about 36%, this is because youths in Singapore have delayed
rather than having been denied entry into the labour market due
to more furthering their education. At the same time, maintaining
flexibility in the economy and job market is important, especially
with a volatile global financial situation. But this must never
be at the expense of the basic rights of workers, young or old.
We must continue to work together to ensure a dynamic future-ready
workforce. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue my speech

order to strengthen young Singaporeans' national identity and sense
of belonging, we must reinforce the cultural essence and values
of various races. As we move ahead with the times, our society is
gradually becoming more westernised. This is also one reason for
our success. We act as the bridge between Oriental and Western cultures,

a joyous society and prosperous economy on the basis of bilingualism

that regardless of whether we are Chinese, Malays or Indians, all
of us have our unique traditions. If we do not understand our roots,
it will be difficult to understand our future. Our multi-culturalism
must be an important factor in promoting cultural prosperity and
progress in our civilization. As we create a unique Singapore culture,
various races must not only engage in cultural exchanges and integration,
but also preserve and perfect their individual cultures. The latter
forms the basis of the former. Hence, the traditional culture of
every race is important. When a nation has a vibrant culture, a
powerful cohesive force can then be formed, as it is our roots.</p>

of the teaching of Mother Tongue, the Ministry of Education also

I sincerely urge the Ministry of Education to continue to place
emphasis on developing the teaching of Mother Tongue languages,
to ensure that students' passion for learning their Mother Tongue
is reinforced, even in the face of changing trends both domestically
and abroad. Promoting culture is also an avenue to promote the learning
of our Mother Tongue.</p>

Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts can enhance

consider helping disappearing traditional trades, for example, shops

our cultural roots. </p>

Inter Racial and Religious Circles under MCYS to reinforce our youth's
understanding of different races and religion, in order to preserve
the foundatio-n for social harmony in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir,
Singapore is a multi-cultural small nation, but I believe that inheriting
and preserving the different cultures of our various races has great
benefits. Through understanding their own roots, young Singaporeans can
appreciate social harmony in Singapore better, and this will strengthen
their national identity and sense of belonging. </p>

storms and emerged stronger. As aptly put by the President, and
I quote, "these shared trials have strengthened our bonds and helped
us to mature as a nation". Yet we must not take things for granted.
No one can predict for certain the surprises that will come our
way. We must continue to build an even stronger and more united
country where the interests and rights of workers are protected,
where industry can grow and society can grow stronger and more united
amidst our diversity. This is our home which we share and our home
is where we will be. Our future is also what we build together.

Office (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank
you for allowing me to speak on the Motion to thank the President for
his Address. This Address reaffirms the Government's commitment
to create a better life for all Singaporeans and, indeed, through
that, to pursue their happiness. The vision is inclusive. It is
not easy to achieve but achieve it we must. Earlier, when I heard
Ms Sylvia Lim talk about happiness and how we should pursue it for
this country, it is something that we should put our heads together
for and I would certainly like, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if she could
also share with us further in terms of what might be the suggestions
and the ideas to pursue this happiness in the specifics. Also, she
mentioned the relationship, through a study with regards to the
total fertility as well as housing prices and that, therefore, created
a nexus on the economic front and yet growth and happiness, according
to her, is supposed to be not related or not pursued this way. So, economics
where it works, drives up the housing prices, maybe on the one hand,
but it also creates the jobs and the pay. So that moves in tandem
and I also like to understand basically how the relationship between
growth and happiness will then work out in her scheme of things.</p>

for a good life for Singaporeans is the availability of good jobs,
jobs that pay well and jobs that have safe, balanced working conditions
that we can be proud of. How do we get these jobs for Singaporeans?
By attracting and supporting companies that create such jobs and
making sure that Singaporeans can do the jobs and have good access
to them. This, in turn, means that we must ensure that the conditions for
investment and growth stay positive and that we are bold in investing
in our infrastructure, our workforce capability, our competitiveness
and our inclusiveness. It also means that we must be resolute in
ferreting out practices that are sub-standard and that hamper our
progress economically and socially, and restructure them away.</p>

far not by blindly or meekly mimicking others. We have done so by
being crystal clear about our own strengths and limitations and
by playing to our strengths and positioning ourselves to be useful
to others. In the immediate post-Cold War decades where many countries
were still pursuing import substitution, and when we have lost our
hinterland, we chose the path of export-led growth. There were risks
in doing so. We had no particular natural attractiveness to external
investments. Yet, we were bold and dared to be different from the
rest of the world, not out of bravado or delusion but out of necessity
and the searing desire to survive and make a better future. We were
also thoroughly practical – good intention and rousing rhetoric
do not put food on the table. We must create the basic conditions
and these included tripartism for industrial peace and agility to
respond to changing circumstances, the EDB venturing out into the
world to pull in investments, configuring our systems, policies,
regulations to maximise overall effectiveness and efficiencies for
both local and foreign businesses, educating and training the population
to have the skills to do the jobs and therefore be employed, improving
and safeguarding the health of our people so that we can strengthen
confidence and morale. The result was fast expansion of the economy,
rising household incomes and sustained improvement in the standard
of living for the majority. With more resources, the Government
was able to re-invest further to gear up our infrastructure and
programmes for the next phase of development and to care and share
more with Singaporeans, especially with the lower-income citizens.</p>

for its own sake but growth was the means to a better life for Singaporeans.
The outcome for Singaporeans is very different from that experienced
by citizens of many other small island nations in the post-war decades.
This is an outcome that is neither universal nor pre-ordained. Over
time, things change. Our economy has grown and outgrown the size
of our local workforce. The workforce became more stratified with
growing professional and white-collar segments alongside a lower
skilled base. International competition for the investment dollar
greatly intensified. Technology changed rapidly and industries and
jobs were re-structured and de-layered. Lifelong employment was
no longer assured. Costs in Singapore rose. At the same time, the
people became better educated, better travelled. Expectations for
quality jobs in pay and working conditions and for social infrastructure,
like housing, transport and recreation rose. There was also a growing
yearning across different arenas for what might be called "explicit
fairness", characterised by level playing fields, transparency, accountability
and decency. And just as the saying goes, "justice must not only
be done but be seen to be done" and so, too, Singaporeans demand
for policies, programmes and politics to be conceived and conducted
with both sense and sensibility.</p>

together for bold investment into our collective future, building
upon our strengths in logical thinking and yet doing it in new ways
to embrace the new social and emotional desires of Singaporeans.
I remind us to strike this balance and be grounded in the reality
of our vulnerabilities because our future must not be constructed
on a misunderstanding or a neglect of fact. It must be one that
allows us to know of our limitations and yet find smart ways to
transcend them. And so, there must be a healthy tension between
our not confusing ourselves as a small economy as a lizard would
be to a bigger economy of crocodile and yet not short-changing ourselves
by behaving like a worm when we could be a caterpillar with the
destiny of a butterfly.</p>

been calls for a global movement to occupy Wall Street or its equivalent
in cities around the world in reaction to the woes caused by the
financial markets. I recall sometime back that the people in a certain
South American country took to the streets bearing pots and pans
to protest against the high unemployment they were suffering from
as a result of economic weakness and mismanagement. We certainly
see on our TV screens the riots and damage that the austerity measures
in some EU countries have sparked recently. These outpourings of
human anger and frustration result from the failure of governments
and society to adapt to changing times and of those who exchanged
long-term good for short-term pleasure and of living beyond one's
means. Hence, we must remind ourselves that refusing to change and mimicking
others blindly are both dangerous and potentially fatal mindsets.
Instead, we must consider carefully how we can improve, adapt and
then power ahead.</p>

to dwell deeply into too many areas and I will just raise three
for discussion. First, on tripartism. Tripartism has brought industrial
peace and economic progress to Singapore and Singaporeans have benefited
and this is not automatic. The tripartite partners understood the
basic truths that if investors, whether local or foreign, have to
worry constantly whether their businesses in Singapore would be
disrupted or their factories burned down, they will go elsewhere.
And if they go, the jobs go. We also knew that if workers of any
segment feel that they have been pushed into a corner with little
fairness and no prospect, then it is a time bomb that must eventually
explode. Our tripartism is, therefore, constructed upon a clear-eyed understanding
of the realities and the need to find a mechanism and an enduring
set of trustworthy relations to achieve stable, win-win outcomes
over an extended period.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 106</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-00507d5f-4a23-4671-b9b7-24a88cd492d3">
                  <a name="president-address__id-00507d5f-4a23-4671-b9b7-24a88cd492d3"><!--a--></a>Tripartism has served us
well. In good times, it has given us the platform to agree on productivity
and competitiveness improvement and gain-sharing. In bad times,
it has granted us the responsiveness and agility to act quickly
and decisively to minimise the pain for workers and for companies.
What we have achieved in real outcomes is admired by many in the
international community. For example, many countries knew of our
Jobs Credit and SPUR programmes. They knew the logic of these arrangements
and they also knew that their countrymen and companies would have
benefited if similar actions were taken in their case. But the fact
was that they could not get their social partners to come together
to work for the collective good nor did they have the resources
to do so because their countries were mired in debt. As a result,
while Singapore came through the storm with relatively lower retrenchment
figures and a low unemployment rate, many OECD countries were stuck
with unemployment ranging from 5%-10% and youth unemployment ranging
from 20%-45%. This is but one of the many examples of how Singapore's
tripartism has quietly but surely given us a competitive advantage
and a refuge through the decades.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e25a9e16-4937-4e0e-afc7-d65c9ec3ff6d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e25a9e16-4937-4e0e-afc7-d65c9ec3ff6d"><!--a--></a> Yet there are those who
might doubt the authenticity of our tripartism. They say that it
is too quietly done. They do not know what is going on and they
want to see more of what is actually happening. I spoke recently
to a group of senior civil servants on this subject. I said that
perhaps a traditional approach of our tripartism was like a three-in-one
coffee mix. It is good coffee, premixed for quick use and convenience.
But I observe that in today's context many people buy expensive
coffee machines. You stick a capsule of beans into the machine and
you press the button and you hear this grinding sound that the machine
makes as it works on the beans and then out comes the coffee, and then
you say, "Ah, this coffee is fresh and good." So, I think that there
is a need for tripartism to also adapt to the changing mindset and
expectation. It is fine for the social partners to share more of
how each one thinks and what feedback its respective constituencies
are giving. But let us be clear that the quality of the coffee lies
not in how much grind you hear but in the quality of the bean and
the mix. Never let our tripartism go the way of that in many other
countries, bogged down by players' incessant bickering, posturing
while the common people suffer and see their jobs evaporate. Mistaking
one for the other is to mistake heat for light, form for substance
and rhetoric for solution.</p>

to speak on social capital, in particular on the Wellness programme.
I spoke earlier of the boldness and insight of going into export-led
growth, unafraid of going against the trend of the world at that
point because we knew ourselves well. We also knew where we needed
to head. That was certainly not the only example. Changi Airport,
Jurong Island, our MRT system, even the 3G SAF. These are strategic decisions
that do not come by just looking at existing data and options and
doing number crunching. These game-changing decisions do not just
optimise for more efficiency. They do not even just innovate on
what already exist. They create a new reality and for that they
require insight, foresight and gumption, in short, strong leadership.
We must continue to have the courage to invest ahead in infrastructure,
in capability and capacity to address the emerging needs of society
proactively. This will help Singapore find ways to punch above our
weight and avoid drifting willy-nilly into the league of the "no
different from other nations" or worse still, into the company of countries
that are constantly fire-fighting to fix problems but with decreasing
success.</p>

must make is into our ageing population and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has
spoken a lot about that just now. Today, there are about 300,000 Singaporeans
aged above 65. By 2030, there will be 900,000. Knowing this, we
must create a Singapore that embraces advancing years with a positive
attitude so that Singaporeans may live long, live well and live
with peace of mind. For that to happen, we have to alter stereotypes
and restructure society and institutions to reflect this new reality.
We must create the conditions and opportunities for our seniors
to be healthy, to be happy and to be active. The Wellness programme
is a strategic investment to convert this good intention and kind
thought into real outcomes. Wellness is not only about physical
health or sickness. Equally importantly, it is about having good
friends and neighbours. It is about relationships that care. It
is about opportunities for volunteerism. It is about bringing out
the best in us for ourselves and for each other, and especially among
the seniors.</p>

seniors live and feel better but would also indirectly do the same
for their children. Forty two out of the 87 constituencies already

also like to say that we must also fine-tune our Performance Indicators
or Tracking Indicators to make sure that we are tracking the meaningful
and avoid being blind-sided. For example, one of the values that Singaporeans
hold dearest is that of decency of treatment. Recently, a newspaper
article highlighted the plight of some workers of industrial accidents
– that they were given two days of medical leave, which according
to those that they interviewed appeared to be manifestly inadequate
for the condition that they are suffering. It could be an odd case but
we have to look further into these kinds of situations. For example,
under current regulations, companies do not need to report industrial
accidents if injuries do not call for more than two days of medical
leave. And this is probably to avoid swarming the system of very
minor types of episodes – which is right. </p>

for companies with high reported rates of industrial accidents,
then, we must be careful to check and police the issuing of medical
leave so that a holistic picture emerges for all of us at the national
level for each industry and at the company level. This would then
put to rest any suspicion that anyone might have that there was
gaming on the part of companies, leading to unfair treatment of
injured workers on a systematic basis. Alternatively, if it should
reveal that there was such gaming of the system, then action can
be taken against the companies. </p>

                  </span>: Thank you,
Sir. If I have your leave, Sir, I would like to make three clarifications
since Mr Heng referred to my speech earlier. The first is: he mentioned
the resolution that I made reference to in my speech. And the point
of my speech was that, because Singapore has actually been one of
the co-sponsors of that draft resolution at the UN, and the text
of the resolution says that the member states are to be pursuing
the elaboration of additional measures to better capture the importance
of the pursuit of happiness and well-being in guiding their national
policies, since our Government has endorsed this resolution, I was
asking the Government to elaborate on what additional measures it
intends to put in place since that is the text of the resolution. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8e189d6d-5219-42db-89a9-ec7441820c35">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8e189d6d-5219-42db-89a9-ec7441820c35"><!--a--></a>Secondly, he made reference
to my example on housing – and that was brought up to illustrate
that if we are really concerned about the declining TFR, concentration
on happiness and well-being and sustainability of the society as
a whole may require us to weigh the options differently. This means,
right now, the Government seems to say that the TFR is a concern
but immigration can help us to address that, but the question is what
is the cost of immigration to Singapore if it is done on a large
scale and are we not concerned about taking more steps to improve
the fertility rate of indigenous Singaporeans? If these studies
bear out a linkage between housing affordability and low fertility
rates, then it is incumbent upon the Government to do something
about that. Instead of looking at fertility just as a procreation
issue, giving more incentives, we have to look at the bigger picture
and see – if we are serious about improving the fertility rate of
indigenous Singaporeans – we may need to look at some of these things
which were not traditionally associated with the mere act of procreation.
My point was an example of a policy which may need to be relooked
at if we have a different compass – looking at sustainability and
happiness of society rather than the economics of bringing in immigrants
to replace the population as such. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-38d29e85-cedc-4375-9348-a02257665b4d">

indicators I have in my own mind. I think he knows that there are
many indicators out there that can be considered. There are factors
like job security, retirement security, how we use the environment
and various other indicators like that. So, my point in the speech
was, since the Government has endorsed this resolution saying that
we need to look at additional measures to measure happiness and well
being, I would just like the Government to explain to us whether
this changes anything.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, let me highlight a couple of points brought up
by the President in his address. He said, "Strong families are the
building blocks of a resilient society" and "our success is defined
not just by material progress but also by our values and ideals."</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 109</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-c7d992bf-9ad7-436c-80dd-b36872ff9fb0"><!--a--></a>In a competitive and growth-centric
environment like Singapore, bringing up a strong family with good
values and ideals is a challenging task. How do we inspire our children to
go beyond material progress when there is so much emphasis placed
on asset enhancement? How do we tell our children to think about
the values that matter in their lives and not about the values of
their HDB flats?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dd3cec1a-7037-426d-881b-c0c0040ea3ad">
                  <a name="president-address__id-dd3cec1a-7037-426d-881b-c0c0040ea3ad"><!--a--></a>This Government has always
emphasised the correlation between a strong economy and the quality
of life here. While it is true we need money for material progress,
we should also look into other important needs in life that can
help build a resilient society but have no correlation to economic
growth.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3149b6a1-37eb-4e80-bf3a-ba0dda9b1873">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3149b6a1-37eb-4e80-bf3a-ba0dda9b1873"><!--a--></a>In a family unit, the head
of the household is responsible to create an environment conducive
to inculcate good values and ideals in every member of the family.</p>

level, the Government is responsible to create an environment conducive
to inculcate the same good values and ideals in people to build a
home and a future that we can all partake and share. The Government
must formulate and implement policies that will allow an individual
to fulfil his psychological, emotional and spiritual needs apart
from material needs, so that he can develop into a responsible member
of the community. When that happens, this person will be able to
contribute more effectively and positively towards nation building.</p>

President acknowledging that our success is defined not just by
material progress but also by our values and ideals. It is indeed
timely to look beyond growth and economy for nation building.</p>

has boosted the economy and created some jobs for Singaporeans.
However, the benefits brought on by the casinos come with a heavy
price to some people in the society. MCYS, in its Addendum, states
that the Ministry will reinforce social safeguards to reduce harm
arising from problem gambling. The MCYS statement seems to suggest
that problem gambling is going to be a big issue going forward.
If problem gambling is set to grow, the negative impact on our society
as a whole will also grow.</p>

experience, I have come to understand the systemic nature of a family
unit that the action of an individual member will affect or influence
the family as a whole. Thus, if a part of our society is suffering,
the nation as a whole will suffer along. I urge MCYS to do more
to build a cohesive and resilient society in a slowing economy.
I also urge the Ministry to help individuals and families at risk
so that their lives will not be destroyed by the roll of a dice
or a flip of a card.</p>

has also warned of fault lines developing in our society. Fault
lines exist almost everywhere now. It exists in our workplace, public housing
and even schools. Singaporeans are feeling deprived of their privileges
as citizens.</p>

and not let these issues divide the nation? Economic growth certainly
did not help prevent fault lines from developing further. It certainly
did not heal any fault lines either. The solution to the fault lines
in our society lies in this House. Most of the fault lines are the
by-products of the growth policies of the Government. The Government
must address the issues and heal the community. </p>

The 2011 General Elections was a watershed election for Singaporeans.
Singaporeans, especially the residents of Aljunied GRC, have made
the decision to effect a change to the nation's administrative system
by voting the Opposition into Parliament. The election of six Opposition
candidates into Parliament is an indication that Singaporeans want
to have a different approach, compared to the previous years where
the Government Party dominated Parliament. I would like to congratulate
Singaporeans, especially the residents of Aljunied GRC.</p>

was also a milestone for the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore.
For the first time, a Malay Opposition candidate was elected into
Parliament.</p>

change will bring much good to the Malay/Muslim community. Even
though there are those who say that differences will impede development
and progress, but for me, differing views and perspectives are part
of human nature, which, if we use correctly, will bring blessings
and all that is good.</p>

Member of Parliament six months ago, I have received many views,

and open to this new situation and hope for the best for the community.</p>

that I voice out issues that are close to the heart of the Malay/Muslim
community. However, they also admit that I have two roles, that
is, as a leader for the Malay/Muslim community as well as the general
Singapore society. Even though they thirst for an alternative voice
to voice out the issues that are related to the Malay/Muslim community,
they hope that this alternative channel will function in a rational,
responsible and dignified manner. They want me to conduct my leadership fairly
and equally, regardless of race, language or religion. I would like
to state that I am proud of the Malay/Muslim community for being
rational, concerned, mature and inclusive. This is in contrast to
the view of some people, who feel that the Malay/Muslim community
finds it difficult to integrate and is exclusive in nature.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the chance to join in the debate.
Personally, I have not been to Bhutan − I wonder if Ms Sylvia Lim
has been to Bhutan, but I recall reading a little bit about it.
Bhutan is at the eastern end of the Himalayas with mountains that
are up to 7,000 metres high, principally a country focused on agriculture,
forestry and a bit of tourism. It is completely land-locked, with about
700,000 people, GDP per capita of about US$1,300 (Year 2006).</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3f6e2a78-3d70-457a-ad38-57c4ffad4b1f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3f6e2a78-3d70-457a-ad38-57c4ffad4b1f"><!--a--></a>I think the Opposition Member
could not have chosen a more dissimilar country to compare Singapore
with. We are exposed to the seas and the onslaught of competition from
the world. We were dealt a different deck of cards, a different
hand altogether when we were independent and we must find our own
formula forward. I do not think the Government objects to Singaporeans
being happy. In fact, having served at the front bench, I can say
that all we do is to make sure that, ultimately, we can improve
the quality of life for all Singaporeans. It is the Government's
job, I believe, to make sure that conditions are right, so that
such quality of life can be enjoyed. And whether people are happy
or not: it is really for them to decide.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-75cdcb73-fc09-41c3-b687-1d9e985acbbf">
                  <a name="president-address__id-75cdcb73-fc09-41c3-b687-1d9e985acbbf"><!--a--></a>Also, I think Bhutan for
many years was a monarchy and only in 2008 they held their first
general election. And they are now a constitutional monarchy. They
have a bicameral system and the Lower House, I think the party is
DPT, won 45 out of 47 seats. So, maybe because they never had an
Opposition or only two Opposition members recently, the people are
very happy. I really do not know. How does the "gross national happiness"
work? But if you read the literature and study it carefully, the
proponents of this system said that this is an additional or supplemental
measure that countries could use. It is not to substitute GDP growth.
So, I want the Opposition Member, Ms Sylvia Lim, to clarify whether
or not she thinks GDP is total baloney and we should forget about GDP,
and I hope she can confirm her position. I would support that other
than just gross GDP growth, yes, we should look at other aspects
of growth but not to say that GDP growth is unimportant. Because
if it were unimportant, what does it mean? What is the formula for
GDP – consumption, investment, government spending, exports minus imports?
If it is unimportant, we do not want any investment in trains or
housing? If it is unimportant, we do not want any government spending?
We do not want the private sector investment in jobs for Singaporeans?
If we do not have GDP growth, given the fact that we were thrown
out to be independent and yet our success was actually nothing short
of miraculous? Even though we are resource-poor, how do we get the funds
to fund all the programmes, all the "equal opportunities", the safety
net, and so forth? So I hope Ms Sylvia Lim will be more specific
in what she means by adopting the gross national happiness (GNH)
and that she will confirm that GDP is still important.</p>

fertility rate (TFR), I think we heard in this House many, many times
– in fact, former Minister Mentor had mentioned it here – that our
number one challenge is the replacement rate for Singapore, and
Singaporeans must come first, and there are a lot of efforts put
into it. In fact, I think the Prime Minister has offered a prize for
anybody who can come up with a solution that helps Singaporeans
replace themselves. If Ms Sylvia Lim has a special formula, I will
suggest that she propose it to this House, and I am sure if it works,
the Government will take that into account. So, to say that the
Government did not pay any heed to total fertility growth in Singapore
is, I think, well, to be kind, misleading.</p>

of time rebutting that point. So I will just go through the crux
of what I wish to say. Sir, there is a disconnect as shown in the
General Elections. I have been pondering about it: why is it, despite
our best efforts, despite our best intent, that there is a disconnection
between the Government and the people? I think one area is "Information
Asymmetry". Having served in the front bench for a few years, I
know for a fact that we have bright, committed people in the Cabinet.
When they receive information, they glean insights from it. They
try to understand the state of play locally. They discuss and engage
with counterparts in other countries to see where our geo-political
and geo-economic situation stands and then make informed decisions,
even though there are many unknowns that we have to grapple with,
the intent of how to improve the quality of life for the majority
of Singaporeans.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-e433ef95-0ca3-4a5a-8db1-a27f48ae6b5d"><!--a--></a>However, the public at large,
especially the voters, do not have the benefit of this information.
I think this asymmetry is where part of the disconnect can be explained.
So, I would urge the Government to share more and, if possible,
set the default mode to "share" rather than "do not share", unless
prohibited for national security reasons. The more information the
people have, the easier it is for us to bring them on board and
also the greater will be their buy-in and the more likely we can
achieve a convergence of opinions. And also, importantly, the less
room there is for the truth to be distorted.</p>

I would like to raise is on transport. The formula that we have now
since 2006 is due for review in 2012 for implementation in 2013.
I hope that the formula review can be brought forward because we
have had enough experience having worked with that formula since
2006. Also, one of the features that I would like to recommend is
that the frequency of fare reviews not be carried out annually but, perhaps,
every two to three years. This formula, I see as only a means to
achieving a higher public transport modal share, up from the 60%
we have today to about 70% by 2020. Therefore, the formula is not
an end in itself but must produce fares that are affordable. Together
with MOT's efforts to upgrade the coverage, service and reliability of
our public transport networks, I believe we will achieve the higher
public transport modal share.</p>

that I feel passionately about. Whenever folks ask me about polytechnic
student fares for MRT and buses – why they do not enjoy the same
fares as their peers in Junior Colleges and ITEs – frankly, I cannot
look them in the eye and say something that I myself am convinced
about. So, I would like the Minister to consider aligning this as
fast as he can because there are really no grounds to say that you
are both of the same age, but just because I classify you as polytechnic
students, you pay more than your peers. This can be done anytime.
We do not have to wait for the formula to be reviewed.</p>

on pedestrian paths. I believe Ms Irene Ng's estate in Tampines
has experimented with it. Can the Minister inform us what we have
learned from it and whether this can be introduced in other estates,
because I think many of us are facing this issue?</p>

to have heard from Minister Vivian Balakrishnan that hawker centres
and markets will now be built in new estates. I just want to remind
him that Pioneer is a new estate and our residents have waited for
more than 10 years and, hopefully, we can be (not the first) but
at least at the top end of the queue. Thank you, Sir, and I support
the Motion.</p>

Sir. Mr Foo earlier asked me for clarification about my stand on
GDP as an indicator. I did not say that GDP as an indicator is not
relevant. But international opinion as well as in the United Nations,
it was clearly recorded, that GDP growth as an indicator as such
is inadequate to represent the state of happiness or sustainability
or well-being of a society. So, that was why the resolution was
called for the member states to come up with additional measures
so that we can actually holistically gauge whether a society is
actually moving forward in a sustainable manner.</p>

Minister for Defence and Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad
Maliki Bin Osman)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for
allowing me to join in this debate. I stand in support of the Motion.
Sir, before I speak on matters that I would like to share with the
House, I would like to just seek clarification from the Member for
Aljunied, Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap, who just spoke a while
ago. He spoke of the fault lines that exist. And if I heard him
correctly, there seems to be an indication, or he alluded to the
fact, that economic growth does not heal fault lines. I just wonder
if what he is saying is that we should not have economic growth,
so that we do not have fault lines or that fault lines will not
exist if there is no economic growth. I am not quite sure what he
really meant when he spoke about the fact that we are always focusing
so much on economic growth and, because of those fault lines, that
we are not paying attention to the fault lines.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1e46d4fe-98ed-49a3-a3ab-36f4e9c7bab4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-1e46d4fe-98ed-49a3-a3ab-36f4e9c7bab4"><!--a--></a>Maybe I could clarify that
the PAP Government has always been very concerned about potential
systemic effect. He is right that, if there is a problem in one
aspect of the system, there will be a trickling effect. But if there
is success, there will also be trickling effect of the success.
Therefore, while we work on economic growth, while we focus on suggesting
and ensuring that our country and Singaporeans succeed, we get growth and
we channel the excess growth to issues or fault lines that may exist,
to make sure that we do heal those fault lines. He is a counsellor.
I am also a social worker for many, many years. I worked with families
all my life as a professional social worker, and in all those families
that I worked with, nothing I think is attributed to economic growth. Nothing
is attributed to the fact that because we are successful, therefore,
we have family problems. There are many, many issues that relate
to family problems and we cannot pinpoint any particular factor
that could possibly explain family issues. But what is important
is really whether we have enough support systems in place. We have enough
social workers, counsellors and resources that we put in place.
Over time, we have been putting in so much resources. In this House,
for example, in the last 10 years I have been a Member of this House,
we have never stopped talking about the need for social workers.
We have never stopped talking about the need to raise the value
of social workers in society, and that is really the recognition.
While we acknowledge there are fault lines, we are not irresponsible
to allow the fault lines to continue to become deepened.</p>

Member that we cannot possibly talk about economic growth not being
good and therefore we need not focus on it, or what the Member is
saying is, do not focus too much on economic growth. I think there
is this old adage that says that we are so small, we cannot afford
not to have economic growth. But, really, what is important is how
do we manage the potential impact of economic growth, the potential impact
on individuals and families? It is true that we have to strengthen
our families, and we have been strengthening our families. We have
to make sure that families continue to be the building block. We
are challenged. We spoke a lot about how the elderly is being taken
care of and the fact that with our lower TFR, the possibility of
families looking after the elderly will continue to be challenged.
But that does not mean that we cannot continue to have growth rate.
We need to have more growth to make sure that we can take care of
the elderly in the future by virtue of the fact that the TFR is
not coming down, by virtue of the fact that the family may continue
to be challenged. </p>

is to really look at the principles behind governance, how do we
ensure that we must make sure that the economy grows so that individuals
can take advantage of good income, good jobs and support their families,
strengthen their families and thereby make sure that our children
will also have a brighter future ahead of them.</p>

spoke about the new environment we face in Singapore – a changing
society, a changing economy and changing politics. These changes
challenge us to pursue new measures to build a better life for all
Singaporeans. But even as we pursue these new measures, the President
called on us to continue to "strengthen our bonds and build an inclusive
nation where we can all be proud of". In our bid to build an endearing
home, we must pursue developments in a way that we celebrate our
past shared memories and create new spectacular memories for our people.
Let me share with Members how we hope to achieve this balance with
our project in Geylang Serai. </p>

at the recent National Day Rally that part of the site occupied
by the former Malay Village in Geylang Serai will be used to develop
a new civic centre. The centre will house the Geylang Serai Community
Club, the Southeast Community Development Council and the Malay
Heritage Gallery. There will also be an open plaza for festivals
and activities. How do we ensure that these plans retain and strengthen
Geylang Serai's Malay identity and continue to have a special place
in the heart of the community? Much of this, I think, will depend
on how we develop these plans for the centre and the area. It is
my intention that our plans will be an exercise of co-creation with
the community on many levels. Let me explain in detail.</p>

range of backgrounds and disciplines. Distinguished architects,
businessmen, academics, community leaders and artists are all part
of this workgroup and the various subgroups. The workgroup has met
twice and has made good progress. In particular, I am pleased to
note that the workgroup includes Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef; former
MP Mr Yatiman Yusof; CEO of Mendaki, Mdm Moliah Hashim; President
of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Abdul
Rohim Sarip; and Chairman of the Malay Heritage Foundation, Mdm

to reach out and gather feedback from the public. Since August,

competition to name the centre next month. The name "Wisma Geylang
Serai" has started to gain some traction with people, but it is
still a working title. Through the competition, apart from engendering
ownership within the community, I hope we can find an original and
creative name which reflects the Malay heritage, the nature and
flavour of the civic centre, and can connect with the Malay community,
the area's residents and the general public. Everyone has a part
to play in this centre. Right from the beginning with the finding
of a suitable name, we want to reach out and involve as many people
as possible in this important chapter of Geylang Serai and Singapore's
heritage. I have been encouraged by the positive response so far from
the Malay community. What is more heartening is that even the non-Malays
are also contributing their ideas. Sir, with your permission, I

Speaker, the main theme of the President's speech is the importance
for us to build an inclusive nation, where principles like working
hard and meritocracy continue to be the main pillars of our country.
The nation's vision to be inclusive is welcomed by the Malay community
and we have benefitted from many Government policies for the past 45
years since Independence. For example, in terms of education, we
have seen more of the young Malay-Muslim cohort between 15 and 19
years old with polytechnic diploma qualifications, increasing seven
times between 2000 and 2010, and the number of the cohort between
20 and 44 years with a university degree has increased three fold between
2000 and 2010. </p>

that this is not satisfactory. However, I feel that it is important that
we achieve success rather than looking for shortcomings to criticise.
Although we agree that there are segments of the community that
are still impeded by social problems, we must also be proud of the
success of our community. For this group, we will continue to craft
strategies and programmes, with the cooperation of the members of
the community who are successful, to help upgrade their abilities.
What is important is that we continue to be seen as a community
that is important and is needed in our nation's progress, and we
have the ability to continue contributing to the nation's success.
We can see individuals in our community who continue to become our inspiration
and our idols. Their experiences going through life by continuing
to achieve success can become a great memory for our community.
What is important is that we possess the leadership to help them. </p>

Parliament for Aljunied GRC said that as a leader, he is ready to
contribute to the community. I feel that it is hard for us to just
say that we are leaders and our leadership should be measured based
on our success in helping the community. We must be valued as a
leader and I feel uncomfortable for us to call ourselves leaders,
unless we have shown our ability to help bring our community to
a higher level. </p>

this project will include leaders and professionals from a wide

leaders and artists, who are all distinguished, will be part of
this workgroup and the various subgroups. </p>

to reach out and gather feedback from the public. Since last August,
we have received over 200 suggestions and comments through our Facebook account
for Wisma Geylang Serai, letters to the press and personal emails.

up our engagement with more stakeholders for the next few months.</p>

competition to name the centre next month. The name "Wisma Geylang
Serai" has begun to be familiar with some people, but it is still
a temporary name. Through this competition, apart from increasing
the sense of ownership among Malays for this project, I hope we
can find an original and creative name which reflects the Malay
heritage, the characteristic and surrounding of the civic centre,
and has meaning to the Malay community, the area's residents and
the general public. Everyone has a part to play in this centre,
and we want to reach out and involve as many people as possible
in this important chapter of Geylang Serai and Singapore's heritage.
I have been encouraged by the positive response so far from the
Malay community. What is more pleasing is that even non-Malays are
also contributing their ideas and suggestions.</p>

exciting future and a centre that remembers its rich Malay heritage.
I received an email from Mr Muhammad Nadim Adam who sent me a detailed paper
that contains many interesting ideas for Wisma Geylang Serai. It
shows his concerns and interest towards the "Wisma Geylang Serai"
project. In his conclusion, Mr Muhammad hoped that "Wisma Geylang
Serai will become the pulse and identity of the Singapore Malay
community that is caring, aware of its history and able to continue
to face the future confidently and objectively." These letters voice
out the sentiments of many people among the Malay community, and
our plans should reflect the community's memories of the past and
hopes for the future, in order to build a centre that is distinctive,
vibrant and endearing, that will reflect the feeling of the community. </p>

memories of Geylang Serai is important not just to the Malay community,
but for all Singaporeans. Geylang Serai is part of both our Malay heritage
and also national heritage. Although the area has a distinctive
Malay identity, especially during the Hari Raya season, many different
groups of people have called Geylang Serai their home for a long
time. It is a microcosm of the multi-cultural and multi-racial life
of our country, one that makes Singapore unique.</p>

Wisma Geylang Serai can continue to provide something that is relevant
to the community and thrive after its initial opening. This is an
important question that will be studied closely by the workgroup

attract public interest and create excitement in Geylang Serai for
a few reasons.</p>

will be managed in a way that is not for profit, but for the community.

offer a range of activities that are both interesting and unique

to promote cultural and artistic activities within the vicinity
of the centre. Over the next few years, the pedestrian mall along
Geylang Road from Paya Lebar Road to the civic centre will be widened
to almost 20 metres while construction is being done in the area.
This space can be used for many types of activities, such as Hari
Raya bazaars, open-air performances and even arts and cultural festivals. </p>

received feedback that it is important that the centre be accessible
and connected to other areas so that it will always be lively. This
workgroup will look at how the centre, market and shopping complexes
can be linked better so that it will be a thriving and distinctive
hub, and find solutions to the various traffic and parking situations
in the area.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to Dr Maliki. I am glad
that Member Dr Maliki agrees that the poor have to be taken care
of. I agree with Dr Maliki that the Government should continue to
do more and economic growth is not the sole objective. The Government
may be judged by how family problems and issues are dealt with,
especially since some of these problems are the results of economic
growth bypassing these very families.</p>

Sir, I do not think there is a direct correlation between economic
growth and family problems. As I mentioned earlier, if you study family
issues, there are many dynamic factors that relate to problems that
families face. Families who do well economically have got family
issues. Families who do not do well economically also have got family
issues. So, there is no correlation or a direct relationship between
economic growth and difficulties in families. These are dynamic factors.
Social workers and counsellors can tell you that these factors are
multi-dimensional and I do not think it is easy for us to just simply
say that economic growth at all costs will translate to family problems.
Sir, I urge the Member to look at these issues of family difficulties
in a more holistic manner, to study the dynamic process that happens
in families and for us to see how economic growth in itself can
help facilitate and help these families get out of the difficulties
they are facing. I think it is more than just that correlation but
there is a whole slew of factors that we have to understand. We want
to continue to understand them and to help families. We will continue
to put in resources as a result of economic growth to help these
families.</p>

Mr Speaker, I have originally intended to devote my entire speech
today to push for the Government to resume building new hawker centres.
To my delight, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr
Vivian Balakrishnan, has announced the building of 10 new hawker
centres on 8 October. I thank the Minister for hearing our voices
and reviewing the policy with an open mind.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 119</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-6e29d4ef-f31c-49fc-8092-d9d2bdb05ace"><!--a--></a>I felt strongly that there
are clearly many areas in Singapore that are under-served by affordable
eateries and there is also insufficient competition in some areas;
resulting in rising food prices at many eating outlets. Hawker centres
are particularly helpful to low-income Singaporeans who are trying
to stretch every dollar they can.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2e93803d-db49-4901-872b-ecd87ada8d14">

hawker centres have become a uniquely Singapore icon, providing
a common space where Singaporeans of all races can come together
as well as a low barrier to entry opportunity for Singaporeans who
want to start a small business. </p>

that will benefit from the new hawker centres, I thank the Government
for the change in policy. It does show that our policies do adjust
with the times and the Government is not too square and fixated
about the ideology. While I agree that by and large, we should leave
it to the "invisible hand" of the market forces to do the job, there
will be instances where the visible hand of the Government is needed and
in areas where there is social impact. I hope this would also herald
the start of many more public goods that the Government will provide
to improve the lives of Singaporeans.</p>

Speaker, Sir, since Independence, our preoccupation has always been
to get our policies right so that we can survive as a small island
state and uplift the lives of our citizens. Many of our policies
in our earlier days were often tough or even harsh, such as the
CPF scheme, National Service, resettlements and so on. But given
the circumstances then, people accepted the pain and united behind
the Government in the unwinding road of nation building. We could
have been another "Greece" if our earlier generations had not gotten
our policies right; and imagine Singapore at the mercy of other
countries to bail us out today. I am grateful to the earlier generations
of Singaporeans for building a stable and safe Singapore, without
which we would not enjoy the good life and happiness we have today.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-245c1abc-d71d-4689-aeef-3c358abc4544">

country has progressed and become more affluent. We are now on more
stable path with the strong foundation built. We are in a strong competitive
position to run the next lap and we have built substantial resources
and advantages to enhance our survivability. However, the social
and political environment today has changed and the next phase of
our development calls for a different approach of Government. Tough
policies, even if they are for the long-term good, would increasingly
be a tough sell. Our citizens expect the Government to do more to smoothen
out the rough edges of policy and reduce any impact to the minimal. Singaporeans
want to be heard and to have a greater say in policies. This is
a natural course of things in a country's political development.
I see this as a healthy progression in our society and in our politics. </p>

day is that we must get our policy and politics right. This is another
way of saying that we just got to do more things better if we still
want to be an exceptional country. People's expectations of the
Government have gone up. Getting our politics right would encompass
various aspects. Among others, the Government would need to strengthen
the emotional connections with the people, see how we re-distribute
the fruits of economic success and so on. And inevitably, it would
also involve decisions on inter-generation distribution of resources;
how we allocate resources between today's Singaporeans and future
Singaporeans or tomorrow's Singaporeans, how much sacrifice we are
prepared to take today for a better tomorrow.</p>

that hon. Members in this House are in agreement that we should
continue to work hard and invest today for a better tomorrow. It
is in our value system; whether it is our household or the country,
we tend to save more for the next generations and take more of the
pains today for a better tomorrow. In Singapore's context, our inherent
vulnerabilities do not permit otherwise. If we do not save or do
not invest and upgrade, we may well have no tomorrow. The grim situation
that Greece and many of the European welfare states are facing are
obviously because they have popularly spent more yesterday than
could be funded by their tax collections and hence piling up enormous
deficits and debts. Some estimated that Greece, with its current fiscal
position, will need something like100 years to service their debt
and I can imagine the financial burden to their future generations.
They have gotten both the policies and politics wrong.</p>

this House would also agree that with the changing social and economic
landscape, we need to spend more on today's Singaporeans than what we
have done in the past. There are already early indications of that.
For example, we are spending more on Workfare, healthcare, social
assistance and so on. I hope we will spend more on public goods
like hawker centres.</p>

to the spending formula on the income of our reserves; which leads
to a higher NIR contribution to the annual Budget, is also to help
reduce the tax burden on today's Singaporeans. There are good, long-term
and "policy-right" reasons why we need to spare more thoughts to
better take care of the well-being of today's Singaporeans. The
global economic race has become more competitive and intense. It
comes, of course, with the social challenges and brings along stresses
and strains to our society. </p>

we have no choice but to take on the challenges and competition

come together as Singapore United to take on the world competition.

to build a dynamic economy. Singapore has to continue to be the
centre of excellence to attract capital and talents across the world.
We have to make a clear shift in our economy where more focus will
be on skills upgrading, innovation and improving productivity. Today's
Singaporeans must feel that they have a stake in this country and can
live a fulfilling and happy life despite the challenges.</p>

This would mean higher Government spending and perhaps lesser to

growth of our reserves as there may be smaller budget surpluses
to be transferred to reserves. And this to me is the new reality
and the new normal.</p>

not cross is that while we want to spend more on today's Singaporeans

It is a difficult discipline and balance. One of the reference base
lines is that we must never dip into our reserves to spend on populist measures
and we must not compromise on our long-term security just to be
popular. And hon. Members in this House can all play a part to uphold
this discipline and balance. </p>

our policy and politics right, a lot hinges on the way we execute
policies. Often, Singaporeans' grouses are not with the intent or
need of the policy but rather how it is being executed and carried
out. In particular, how much thought and care we have put into helping
people who are impacted by the policy changes. Maximising efficiency
and minimising financial costs often come across as the key drivers
and hence the Government may often appear too "cold" or too "straight-in-face"
in policy execution. This could cause resentment and negative feelings
that linger for a long time. This is not helpful in our effort to
strengthen our citizens' sense of ownership of this country.</p>

time of my speech today to speak up for a silent group of Singaporeans
who are most impacted by one of Government's most recent policy changes,
which is the aggressive ramp-up of HDB home building programme.
In the last few years, owing to population growth and the sharp
recovery in the economy in 2009, housing supply has lagged behind
demand resulting in the current housing imbalance. MND and its agencies
have since taken strong and decisive measures to address this and
more flats are expected to come on stream in the next few years.
The Government has committed to build 25,000 HDB flats this year,
with another 25,000 flats next year. There will also be more rental
units as well as private land sales to meet the strong demand. This
is a significant increase in housing supply in a short span of time.</p>

move to build more flats to meet the demand; especially for the
first-time home buyers, and we have to keep the price of new flats
affordable for them. However, I hope the rapid building programme
would also come with equally rapid delivery of the supporting infrastructure
and amenities. Let us take the example of Zhenghua, an estate which
is in the northern part of Singapore, where there will be more than
4,000 new flats from now till 2015. A resident living there described
this as a "BTO tsunami". There has been a series of BTO launches
and more are expected to be announced.</p>

resigned to the fact that there will be less open space, more blockages
of view by the new flats outside their windows. Unbearable construction
noises and dust from the building sites are now their daily irritants.
Most affected are the elderly residents, infants and pregnant mothers
who are not able to rest well and school-going kids studying for
their exams. A resident living in a 3-room flat in Segar Meadows
next to three BTO sites complained that the dust from the construction sites
prevented them from drying their clothes outside. He said he has
to buy a laundry dryer under an instalment plan so that he can dry
his children's white school uniform inside his house. Some of sporting
facilities like the basketball court and archery range have to make
way for new flats planted at close proximity to existing buildings.</p>

prepared with the short-term pain from the construction activities.
However, what they are concerned with is the state of their estates
when these new flats are completed and new residents start to fill
up the blocks in the next few years. Will the existing infrastructure
and amenities be able to cope with the increased residential population?
Already, roads are congested and public transport crowded even without
the new population increase. They expect the transport situation
to get worse in the next few years, unless something is done.</p>

eateries need to be planned and I really hope that there will be
a new hawker centre there. Just like we do not want to grow our

the social costs which are impossible to quantify in dollars and

                     <strong class="ph b">The Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy
Khor Lean Suan)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, we are at the threshold
of a new era in Singapore's political scene. We have a younger electorate
with higher expectations, and who are more outspoken. They represent
a new generation of voters, who are unencumbered by the past. For
good or for ill, this is likely to be the norm for Singapore. Sir,
against this backdrop, allow me to highlight three points, namely,
an inspiring vision, intense debate and indispensable principles,
in response to the President's Address. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-16f6042a-9c45-44e7-8420-806b9fb317cd">
                  <a name="president-address__id-16f6042a-9c45-44e7-8420-806b9fb317cd"><!--a--></a>Firstly, we need an inspiring
vision. As a new Parliament assumes office, there is a need for
an inspiring vision for Singapore – one that unites, forges ahead,
and harnesses the collective will and energy of the people. President
Tan has articulated such a vision, captured in the phrase "A better
life for all." It is a simple phrase, yet one that encapsulates
what any government must set out as its <em class="ph i">raison d'etre</em> – to
create the conditions for every citizen to have a better life. The
better life President Tan speaks of must ring true in every sense
of the word – material, physical, social and cultural. This calls
for a broader definition of what constitutes individual and collective
success and growth. Indeed, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat has
begun to re-shape the school curriculum to emphasise character,
values and other intangibles to reaffirm to Singaporeans that success
has many faces. </p>

at Singapore is its incessant emphasis on economic growth to the
exclusion of everything else, and I think Members have just heard
a couple of these earlier. Hitherto, many people believe that we
have defined our prosperity in largely monetary terms, but in the
process, we might have lost what critics call "our soul". </p>

new. Former NMP Viswa Sadasivan filed an Adjournment Motion during
the last Parliament Session to argue that Singapore should look
beyond GDP as a measure of well-being. In my reply to him, I explained
that the Government's objective has never been to pursue economic
growth whatever it takes. I took some pains to explain that we have
in place re-distributive policies and help schemes to uplift the
lower end of society, including helping them to buy a house. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-081d40ce-efca-4869-b6bd-ce61e5a75d98">

were considered inadequate by some. But it is never the case that
Singapore is just a mean capitalist machine, creating wealth for
the elite. We also take into account the growing desire for alternative
definition of success in education, in career direction, in personal
enrichment, in quality of life, including better environmental quality,
more housing options, more recreational facilities, etc. All of which
contribute to the well-being or happiness of Singaporeans. </p>

had seen it fit and critical to list happiness together with prosperity
and progress as the three key outcomes they want to achieve for
our nation, for Singapore shows that this has been and will always
be what the PAP Government seeks for all Singaporeans. But as President
Tan has said in his Address, "to achieve a better life for all,
our economy must grow." This is basic to improving our lives. I
am sure many Members in this House will agree with me that man or
woman cannot live on fresh air, love or for that matter happiness
alone. One needs only to look at the overriding calls now by the
Americans and many Europeans for their governments to turn around
the economy, create jobs, to know that this is so. In this regard,
I am also wondering if the Member, <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Muhamad Faizal Bin Abdul Manap,</span> is
saying that, to resolve the problems of some families, it is better
to have no growth or slow growth. No growth or slow growth will
make everyone worse off, but it will have the harshest impact on
the poor, the very group that we are all trying to help. The correct
approach is not to dumb down the top but to pump up the bottom.
But, clearly, Mr Viswa Sadasivan's views still resonate among a
significant group of our population: that not enough is being done.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-e65fe41a-47b2-4abc-a0a5-36684ad5fc4b"><!--a--></a>In this regard, REACH's
survey on National Day Rally (NDR) 2011 is very telling. While a
significant 73% of the 841 respondents agreed that Singapore should
not become a welfare state even as it should progressively improve
its social safety net, only slightly more than half (51%) feel that
the Government has done enough to ensure that the vulnerable groups
such as the poor and those with special needs are looked after. </p>

present Government will need to re-double its efforts to demonstrate
to detractors the humane side of our economic growth policies. As
a start, the three key pillars of our social safety net – Workfare,
ComCare and Medifund – can be further strengthened. The recent joint
report by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Department of Statistics
(DOS) shows that the real income growth for low-wage Singaporeans
in the 20th percentile was "flat" from 2001 to 2010. </p>

the fruits of Singapore's economic growth in the good years if not
for re-distributive schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement
(WIS). But as many Members of Parliament and myself have raised
in this House before, we need to further enhance the WIS by increasing
the cash component of the scheme. We also need to increase the frequency
of the payout from half yearly to at least quarterly. Furthermore,
the total quantum of WIS payouts should be reviewed regularly taking
into account inflation and wage growth to ensure its relevance.
In this way, WIS will make a significant difference to the take-home
pay of the low-wage worker. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-5b6cc4de-11e2-49b0-bdad-ff9216f7cef3"><!--a--></a>As regards ComCare, help
should be extended beyond the households with incomes of $1,500
per month and below, which approximates the lowest 10th percentile
of households, to those with incomes of $2,500 per month and below,
which approximates the lowest 20th percentile of households. Our
experience at the CDCs shows that many households in this income
group do need help to cope, especially with the rising cost of living.
At the South West CDC, we have already increased the qualifying
household income ceiling for our local help schemes to $2,500 per
month. The key point here is that the qualifying criteria as well
as the quantum and types of assistance need to be reviewed periodically
and revised, if necessary. The rules should also be applied flexibly to
ensure that no one who genuinely needs help falls through the cracks. </p>

way to help the low and lower middle income workers achieve a better
life is to upgrade their skills for better paying jobs. At the same
time, companies must also embark on best sourcing, instead of cheap
sourcing. They also need to raise productivity and enhance the quality
of the jobs they offer. This will enable them to pay locals with
the relevant skills higher wages. Jobs will then be better matched
to locals, and we will rely less on foreign workers. </p>

core workforce, I am in favour of NTUC's proposal for a tiered S-Pass
scheme with higher qualifying salaries. This will eliminate some competition
for jobs with the locals at the scheme's current minimum salary
of $2,000 per month for semi-skilled workers. NTUC's idea of imposing
quotas for foreign professionals on Q1-type passes should also be
considered as more experienced foreigners may be hired over younger
local diploma and degree graduates. The quota could vary depending
on the industry so as to minimise labour market rigidity and erosion
of competitiveness. </p>

for intensive debate. Sir, the recent two elections, the General
Election (GE) and Presidential Election (PE), have shown that politics
is becoming more polarising and that an increasing number of Singaporeans
want their voices to be heard. Opposition politicians will in all
likelihood challenge many policies. If so, they are doing what they
set out to do, but this could make for a more fractious political
scene. In this context, to keep to the vision which President Tan
has articulated, we need to approach differences and debate in a
spirit of dialogue and civility. Criticism must be welcomed, because
it will sharpen policies. But criticism must also be responsible
and constructive, with the view to improving policies, not merely
scoring political points. Hence, debate, and not just in Parliament,
but also in personal dialogues, in any and every platform, but especially
online, needs to be rational, sensible, well thought-out and meaningful.
Smoke and noise will only befuddle, and not enlighten. But for broad
based intelligent and responsible debate to occur, the Government
will need to step up its engagement efforts both online and offline.</p>

can have open debate and express different but balanced views. But
what is worrying is that only slightly more than six in 10 (62%)
agree that the "anonymous and chaotic nature of the Internet often
lends itself to "negative views and ridiculous untruths, which can
distort reality". This seems to suggest that there is a bias towards
online extreme views which are more tantalising than pro-government

It is simply impossible to engage on all sites. The Government could

this year's National Day Rally show that 76% of the respondents
agree that Singapore should maintain its basic strategic directions
instead of veering towards popular policies. </p>

of both the General Elections and Presidential Election, I find
these responses very heartening. Because they indicate that Singaporeans
by and large do not expect major policy shifts which may endanger
our long-term survival. If populist policies bring short-term relief,
but long-term damage, I believe that such policies will be rejected
by the majority.</p>

principles that we should never jettison? Let me mention three which
have served us well over the past few decades and I believe will continue
to ensure our success.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d4aaf704-208b-4ad9-b5b1-3e5206caa4df">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d4aaf704-208b-4ad9-b5b1-3e5206caa4df"><!--a--></a>Firstly, practise fiscal
sustainability. We must beware the dangers of the welfare state, and
the ruin that comes from unsustainable public finance or excessive
debt. One only needs to look at Greece to appreciate how things
can go awry if we fail to adhere to this. Hence, even as we continue
to strengthen our social safety net, we must not go the way of western
style welfarism which has saddled not just Greece, but many European economies
with unsustainable government budgets. Ultimately, jobs are lost,
wages cut, austerity measures need to be put in place, and the country
suffers.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-e896ce49-f39b-4dbc-b45a-38ee17f98afe"><!--a--></a>Secondly, as the former
Minister Mentor once said, the Government must always keep on moral
and intellectual high ground, and especially the former. In this
new normal with higher expectations from the public, we need to
reaffirm the spirit of public service. Civil servants will have
to re-capture the spirit of their high calling – greater civility
and servanthood in all they do. To enable the Government to better
craft and implement policies with both "the head and heart", every
civil servant that will be involved in policy making should be attached
to community-based and frontline agencies for a period of at least
three months or more, to observe and participate in dealings with
the public. They should not just be sent for cursory visits.</p>

mobility. It is in the nature of things that the cream rises to the
top. We must educate, persuade and cajole the cream to stoop to
lift others, but never hamper their rise in the first place. To
do so will impoverish us all. At the same time, we must do all we
can to ensure social mobility for all segments of the population, particularly
the low and lower middle income.</p>

be put into ensuring that their children have an equal chance to
excel in school, acquire skills and maximise their potential. In
this respect, I am glad that the MOE has affirmed that every child,
regardless of family circumstances and background, will have access
to opportunities. I am also glad that MOE has pledged to create
more pathways to match the interests and aptitude of every student,
including making every school a "good school". Making every school
a "good school" will help reduce the angst of parents when their
children cannot get into a primary or secondary school of their
choice. But, with our strong Asian culture of wanting the best for
our children, it will not be easy to convince parents that all schools can
be "good schools" and that, there are, as what Minister Lim Swee
Say will likely say, "No betterer schools! But, try we must." </p>

short-cut solutions to achieve this, as noted by President Tan.
In fact, the goals will always be moving. But at the same time,
the goal is immensely meaningful and inspiring. Sir, I, therefore,

                  </span>: Mr
Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the Motion for
thanking President Tony Tan for his Opening Address to the Twelfth Parliament.
The President has illustrated a robust overview of the various aspect
of Singapore's society, an inclusive nation where all must come
together as one people to face our challenges with confidence and
build our future together. As a new Member of this House, I am thankful
for the opportunity to serve and I am deeply humbled at the task
at hand.</p>

as a country and as a society. We have very high literacy rate,
the world's busiest airport and seaport, and are one of the most
wired nations in the world. It will be foolish to assume that these
milestones were achieved by sheer luck. Credit must be given to
those who have brought us here. These include our forefathers, our
citizenry who have worked hard, and former Members of this House,
who pored through policies always putting society before self. Allow
me to express my gratitude to them on record.</p>

is the "new normal". The social landscape in Singapore is vastly
different from 10 years ago. However, relevance today does not equate
to continued relevance in this globalised world. As we strive to
embrace and make globalisation work for Singapore, we should never
neglect segments of society that cannot adapt to this rapidly changing
world. Sir, allow me to speak of some issues that affect Singaporeans
today.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-21355f8e-3f7e-4791-801b-048abb661471">

with 530,000 elderly Singaporeans aged above 60 years. The pace
will increase notably next year when the first cohort of the baby boomers
reaches 65 years of age. While the reasons are obvious from lower
birth rates, better health care and longer life span, the solutions
in tackling these issues facing an ageing population are far and
few. Sir, I understand the severity of the task confronting our
policymakers in the face of this insurmountable issue. They have,
on the one hand, worked with the fundamental philosophy that the
family remains the primary unit of care and support, while, at the
same time, develop interventionist policies to tackling the challenges
of an ageing population head-on. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 127</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f7661019-f0df-4d22-845a-d7c872c3b1e3">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f7661019-f0df-4d22-845a-d7c872c3b1e3"><!--a--></a>Sir, I wish to speak on
two issues: retirement financing and elderly healthcare. It is understood
that most health problems develop at older age, with weaker immunity
and a sedentary lifestyle. While healthcare in Singapore is largely
subsidised, to many, it is still a significant financial burden
on families. It is also unfortunate that in many cases, many of
our seniors have little or no Medisave, MediShield or other insurance
coverage. Therefore, they are fully dependent on the younger generation
for payments of medical bills. We have a world-class medical infrastructure.
Similarly, we should also have a world-class framework to alleviate
the burden of medical cost. It is evident that with better quality
of life, health awareness and medical facilities, life expectancy
could continue to rise. Presently, we have 29,000 elderly who are
85 years and above, who are not covered by MediShield. We should
review the extension of MediShield coverage for elderly citizens
beyond the age of 85 years. This will provide greater peace of mind
for the elderly and their loved ones.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-bcaab2f2-2ab2-46e4-856b-1681ac79add5"><!--a--></a>Sir, residents I meet during
the Meet-the-People sessions often lament that the Government seeks
to lock up their CPF funds such that they will never see them. While I
understand why they feel such angst, their understanding is usually
far from the truth. I see wisdom in the Government's rationale in
ensuring there is adequate CPF funds to see them through their retirement
years. However, the truth is that many Singaporeans do not have
enough money to retire. The problem is magnified when a sole-breadwinner
retires and has both himself and his spouse to support. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-606c2b76-d292-4885-84a1-6e6dc906081c">
                  <a name="president-address__id-606c2b76-d292-4885-84a1-6e6dc906081c"><!--a--></a>The typical Singaporean's
argument that the CPF is their money is not wrong. It is an undeniable
fact. Therefore, retirement policies regarding CPF must be relooked.
At the same time, there must be built-in flexibility in the way
CPF is withdrawn when retirement age comes. We must never become
a society, where we "work till we die". While raising the retirement
age is an option, it cannot be a panacea. Retirement is a milestone
that must be respected. Therefore, we must look at the issues surrounding
drawing of CPF monies as well as addressing people's thinking that
their CPF money is being unfairly held back.</p>

be a burden to society. We will get old. It is a fact of life. No one
seeks to be a burden on another person. Similarly, nobody wishes
to be sick and requires regular medical attention. However, unforeseen
circumstances, from illness to disabilities force an individual
to rely heavily on someone for care and assistance. While the family
remains at the forefront of care and support, we must never assume
that the family is sufficient in providing assistance. There is
a real limit to complete assistance by family members. Therefore,
we have to up our game, in providing a holistic care for our elderly.
I applaud the Health Ministry in providing more space for community hospitals;
however, we cannot and must not stop here. </p>

beyond the gates of a community hospital. Many a time, families
are at wits end in caring for elders who are chronically ill, such
as stroke and dementia, and thus may need specialised care, such
as colostomy or tracheostomy. Therefore, I urge the Health Ministry
to look at these cases and frame policies that will extend care
beyond the walls of a hospital to the confines of an individual's
home. </p>

300,000 full-time domestic workers. While a majority of them perform
household chores, there is a significant and growing number hired
to double-up or solely to look after the elderly. While it is commendable
that the families pay lower levy in such cases, we have a problem
at hand. Many a time, families have difficulty getting domestic
help. They are hurdled with long waiting time while they struggle
to care for their elderly sick. Even when they get one, these domestic
helpers are not mentally prepared, physically abled and trained
to care for the elderly sick, making them an occupational hazard.
It does not help that in most cases, the domestic worker is usually
alone with the elderly at home.</p>

homes is limited, more expensive and there are currently severe
shortages in the system. All we have now for elder care financing
is a rudimentary system in ElderShield that needs to be more comprehensive.
Currently, ElderShield pays out only when the insured has deficiency
in three Activities of Daily Living (ADL). In fact, care is also
required when one suffers from two ADLs. But if ElderShield is to
pay for two ADL, the premiums would be substantially higher. So
the Government has to study this very carefully. Until ElderShield
becomes more robust with wider coverage, there will be very slow
development of eldercare services by the private sector. More support
must also be considered for needy elderly and caregivers who face
emotional and financial strains. Perhaps, the Government can endorse
leave entitlements for the caregivers to look after elderly parents
so that the caregivers do not need to struggle with their commitments
at work and provide care for their elders.</p>

of the aged is an important issue that must be tackled now. I urge
the Government to study this issue with a view to enhance easy access,
qualitative home care and family support services for the overall
well-being of our elderly. Elderly issues will become more pronounced
and acute with our rapidly ageing society. I am, however, heartened
to note the President's assurance to elderly citizens that Singapore will
always be their home where they can spend their silver years in
peace of mind.</p>

and touch on the predicaments of small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). The 2011 Budget had provisions for local SMEs to increase productivity,
with cash grants and corporate income tax rebates. Raising productivity
is an important milestone and I am glad the Government sees wisdom
in providing reliefs to encourage SMEs to raise productivity. However,
on the ground, SMEs are struggling.</p>

globalisation has meant a continual struggle for companies big and
small, to maintain their relevance and succeed in a competitive environment.
SMEs, unlike MNCs, have to deal with the three evils of weakening
global economy, manpower challenges and rising business costs. </p>

our workforce and they have been gravely affected by the recent
tightening of foreign manpower supply, particularly in the service
sector. I have met several SMEs and representatives of the Association
of SMEs. They do understand the Government's rationale of tightening
foreign workers, the need to raise productivity and real incomes
of Singaporeans. However, SMEs have stated unequivocally that the pace
of tightening foreign manpower is too fast.</p>

many others in between. They serve as a conduit between the large

two social issues very briefly: the casinos and the problems with

of operation. They are extremely profitable. We are all well aware

of licensed moneylenders. These credit companies have mushroomed
from 160 to about 260 in less than two years. Their methods of advertisements

measures taken by the Ministry of Law to tighten control before
the problem gets out of hand. Sir, I urge the Ministry of Law to
also review the Moneylenders Act 2009 and assess the safeguards
on interest rates and late payment penalties. For example, for loans
amount above $3,000 and income above $20,000 a year, there is no
cap to the interest charged and the interest rate is usually a mutual
agreement between the borrower and the moneylender. </p>

today is at an important junction where traffic is wild with many
blind spots. We cannot assume that no accidents will happen as we
navigate this volatile traffic. The global outlook does not look
very promising, especially in the short term. Nevertheless, tackling
crises is not new to Singapore. We have weathered storms quickly
and effectively before. This is what makes us unique and has allowed
us to maintain a strategic foothold in this globalised world. As
we strive to maintain our relevance and prosper, we must never neglect
the people, Singaporeans, who have for generations, sweat to defend
and provide for this land we call home. I am confident that we will
tackle the challenges ahead with gusto.</p>

linked to one's value system. How one manages expectations and ambitions.
As much as we want the Government to increase our happiness quotient,

Sir, I see several pairs of eyes pleading with me to keep it short
and I will try and raise the happiness quotient of this House by doing
so. I rise to support the Motion. There are many difficult issues
which the Government and this House will have to grapple with in
the next five years. These will no doubt include the rising cost
of living and the widening income gap. In this regard, Singapore
is not unique. These are the very same issues that have reached
a critical point in other countries, as evidenced by the angry demonstrations
we have witnessed recently. What is less clear is what the demonstrators
want changed or how they can achieve it. There will inevitably be
calls for social safety nets to be strengthened. That will give
rise to concerns about welfarism. And we have heard those arguments
in this House.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce6d756c-9b3b-4346-8308-cd13278f3924">

doubt developed out of good intentions, to improve the lives of
people and many people did benefit from it, depending on whether
you lived at the right time. But it is often not appreciated that
the Government has nothing. It funds its programmes by taking money
from A to pay to B, or spending money that it does not have. That
is what many countries have done and the day of reckoning has arrived
for them. I would hope that we have sufficiently absorbed experience
of others not to go down the same path. The definition of "madness"
is to do the same thing over and over again and expecting a different
result.</p>

do not want us to become a welfare state. They recognise the value
of receiving reward for work and living within one's means. They also
do not want the Government to tax them anymore than it needs to.
But most would also like the Government to do more. How can we achieve
all these without sacrificing our core principles? That is a real
challenge because as Milton Friedman once said, "every person is
perfectly capable of persuading himself that what is in his interest
is in the country's interest." Reasonable people will have different
views on this issue and the debate will go on for many years. But
there is one group I believe we can help more without compromising
our values, and that is the elderly. And rather than talk about them
generally, I would like to raise a specific issue.</p>

(MPS) last week, a resident, let us call her Mdm Mary, approached
me for help. Mary is 71, a single. She worked hard as a Personal
Assistant (PA) to a company director for many years and now owns
her own flat in Toa Payoh where she lives with her widowed sister.
They did not receive any form of financial support and had been
living off their savings, and these savings are now running dry. They
are still healthy but understandably worried of what would happen
if either or both of them should fall ill. Mary believes that her
only option is to sell the flat and downgrade to a studio apartment.
That is logical, but it is also not easy to get one as demand far exceeds
supply. She wanted me to secure priority for a studio apartment
and was disappointed that I could not. Hers is not a unique situation.
In my recent block visit to a block of 3-room flats in Toa Payoh,
I met others in similar situations. Elderly Singaporeans who are
asset rich but cash poor. I am sure many in this House would have
as well.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 131</p>

has changed over the last 30 years. One of the institutions most
affected is the family unit. Much as we like to resist it, there
are some consequences which are inevitable. More Singaporeans will
not marry. Those who do will have fewer children. Our fertility
rate has dropped below 1.2. However much money we throw at the problem,
while it can increase slightly, it will never rise anywhere close to
the replacement level of 2.1. The days of large families are over.
This has nothing to do with the "Stop at Two" policy in the 1970s
or any particular Government policy. We are witnessing a world-wide
trend brought about by a confluence of factors and some of these
factors are what we consider positive to us like more women entering
the workforce. So it is not just about rising housing prices. That
is a simplistic way to look at it. But whatever the cost, the result
is that when we get old and retire, we have to depend less on the
younger generation to maintain us. The Maintenance of Parents Act, however
much it was improved recently, can only go so far and do so much. Singaporeans
would have to plan carefully for their retirement and plan early.
But the fact of the matter is, many will not or will not be able
to. In particular, those who earn less may not be able to put enough
away as salaries stagnate and the cost of living rises.</p>

on two main pillars of security – our CPF and our homes. For the
less well-off, these are their only pillars. For many elderly, it
is too late to talk about savings, investments or insurance. They
are from a generation who were less educated but who worked hard
and in difficult circumstances to provide for their families and
to build a better life for their children. By and large, they succeeded.
For one reason or another, they now receive little or no support
from their families. As families get smaller, we will see more Mdm
Marys looking for help. </p>

The monthly payout is not sufficient to maintain a reasonable lifestyle,
particularly in the current environment. It is also inadequate to
deal with the crisis such as medical expenses. Medisave cannot be
used for all treatments and there are limits to drawdowns. This
applies to every Singaporean. So why do I highlight the elderly?
Two reasons. First, unlike the young, most cannot do much to improve
their prospects. Retraining will be difficult and getting a job
– next to impossible. Second, many have means because they own their
own homes outright. They are the beneficiaries of a far-sighted
policy by the PAP Government to encourage Singaporeans to own their
own homes. And because of sound economic management, they have seen
the values of their homes rise significantly. We take this for granted
and some even complain about it. But an entire generation of Singaporeans
is better off for it. As in any policy, the difficulty lies not
with the objective for the policy, but its consequences. Most elderly
today have a major part, in some cases almost all, of their networth
locked up in their homes. The problem is that this benefit remains
locked up and therefore unhelpful in times of need. This is the
problem of Mdm Mary, and many others like her.</p>

looking for handout, just an opportunity to provide for her sister
and herself using her own means. But what options do we provide
her and others like her today? We say she can downgrade. Easier
said than done. It works if she can get a studio apartment, but
those are not easy to come by. So she will need to buy a resale flat
which is expensive. She will not be able to obtain a loan because
of her age. Therefore, most of the proceeds of the sale of a flat
would be ploughed back into her new flat. So that does not address
the problem. Besides, do we really want older Singaporeans to move,
break ties they have developed with their neighbours over many years
and start all over again in an unfamiliar environment. That cannot
be good for their well-being. We want them to grow old among friends
and people they know, people who will look out for them. Second
option, she can sell and then rent a home, but she will be barred
for 30 months from getting an HDB rental flat, and even then, she
is unlikely to get one because she has the proceeds of the sale
of her flat. So she has to rent from the open market which is expensive
and uncertain because she will have to keep renewing her lease and
therefore be subject to market forces. Not a good solution. We tell
her that she can rent out a room to earn income. But Mary does not
have a spare room because her sister stays with her. Again, is it
really a feasible solution for two elderly women or any elderly
person to let a stranger into their home? Further, it may take some
time to find a suitable tenant and the value of the home remains
locked up.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-397eae6e-db83-4970-9389-4d201b61d8f8"><!--a--></a>Sir, a few years ago, we
introduced reverse mortgages to unlock value, but that has not proven
popular. I can understand why. It is very inflexible. It only applies
to 2- or 3-room flats. The monthly payments are low. I asked HDB
for some estimates in Mary's case. Her flat now has a market value
of above $300,000 and has 57 years left on the lease. Mary will
receive an upfront payment of $5,000 and a monthly payment of about $630.
Six hundred and thirty dollars a month is difficult for two elderly
women. Further, there is a number of disadvantages. The payments
are based on the present-day value of the flat as determined by
the HDB, which means Mary does not benefit from any rise in property
prices in the following years. Once she signs on, she cannot sign
out. So she can no longer sell her flat or bequeath it to her beneficiaries.
When she passes on, the flat is taken back by the HDB and the remaining
value cashed out at current prices and given to her beneficiaries.
So what is the point of having a $300,000 home, if you cannot extract
value in times of need? It is a good thing to be asset rich, but
elderly Singaporeans do not want to be cash poor.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4ce741a3-6ae5-473e-8776-8302b223a04a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-4ce741a3-6ae5-473e-8776-8302b223a04a"><!--a--></a>I therefore urge the Government
to come up with a different programme to help older Singaporeans
unlock the value of their HDB flats. One suggestion is to have a
more flexible lease buyback programme. For example, can we not allow
Singaporeans to sell back portions of their lease to HDB at market
value? A 70-year-old couple does not need a 50- or 60-year-old lease.
If they can sell part of the lease back to HDB, say, in parcel of five
or 10 years, that would give them a decent sum. This would have
a number of advantages. A lump sum payment would give them more
flexibility in planning and meeting their immediate needs such as
the cost of an operation or other medical needs. Only a small portion
of their lease would be valued at current prices, which means they still
benefit from rising property prices and the effects of inflation
are reduced. They will continue to have the option to sell their
flat if they want to buy a studio apartment when one becomes available,
or they can leave the flat behind for their loved ones. More importantly
and underpinning this suggestion is that they will not be receiving something
for nothing. They will be using their own asset to support themselves,
and this is consistent with our core principles.</p>

Will too many apply? We can prevent a floodgate of applications
by placing conditions on who will qualify such as imposing an age
criteria for applicants in matching the number of surrenders or
specifying a minimum balance of 10 years to ensure that the lease
will not expire prematurely. Will this not result in flats in the
same block having different tenures? Yes, it will but with technology,
that should not be a problem to administer. Such a scheme would
be in addition to all the other programmes currently available and
would give the elderly more options and greater flexibility to take
care of their own needs. This would strengthen HDB's role, not only
as a builder of homes, but as an important institution in the welfare
of Singaporeans and particularly the elderly. This is what our home
ownership policy was designed to do, not just provide a roof over
our heads, certainly not to provide an asset which one can buy and
sell to make money, but to give every Singaporean a stake in this
country and to provide for their well-being. And what better way
to do that by having that home, benefit and work for Singaporeans
throughout their entire lives.</p>

capable of developing effective programmes to allow the elderly
to make the best use of their homes. Our Workfare and Jobs Credit
programmes show that we can think out of the box and come out with
bold, creative and effective programmes to help working Singaporeans
and our elderly desire no less. Sir, I support the Motion.</p>
