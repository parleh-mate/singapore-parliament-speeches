<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL ESTATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Upgrading)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Heng Chiang Meng -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for National Development when

the  programme  for  the  upgrading  of  private  residential

estates  will be implemented and what form such  a  programme

will take.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposed  scheme to improve private residential estates  aims

to improve the physical environment of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>

these   estates.   Items  being  considered  for  improvement

include  landscaping, play equipment, park furniture and  the

widening of footpaths.  This will be over and above  the  on-going  maintenance  works provided by the various  Government

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had earlier deferred the implementation

of  the  scheme  due  to the economic  downturn.   Since  the

economy  has  recovered, we will proceed  to  reactivate  the

scheme.  The Ministry of National Development is currently in

the  process of working out the implementation details of the

scheme.   The  Committee is looking into the  possibility  of

starting one or two pilot projects in the second half of this

year.   This will enable the Committee to learn the best  way

to   improve   the  physical  environment  of   the   private

residential  estates.  Selection criteria  will  include  the

physical  condition of the estate, and the level of community

bonding and support among the residents in the estate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> May I ask the

Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary, in  the  selection  of  the

private  estates, can I volunteer some of the private estates

in  my constituency because I had actually proposed this idea

some years ago and it had not been taken up?  There are quite

a  number of estates which are quite well organised, in terms

of neighbourliness, and also conducive for this purpose.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

take up his suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, can I

ask   the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  whether  private

estates also include private condominiums?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We are looking into this

suggestion.   We  are thinking of providing this  improvement

project  item to the area outside the condominium.  In  other

words,  we will only put in improvement works on state  land,

not inside the condominium.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the

Senior   Parliamentary  Secretary,  like  the   HDB   Interim

Upgrading programme where $4,000 per unit is allocated, would

private  residents  have a similar budget?   And  can  it  go

beyond  the  MND  budget where they have got  National  Parks

Board  and other statutory boards, like ENV, drains,  and  so

on,  and  where  they can pool together the budget  for  this

upgrading to reach $4,000 per unit figure?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, that

is  indeed  the idea.  I said in my answer that  the  funding

will  be  provided  over and above the  on-going  maintenance

works provided by the various Government agencies, like  LTA,

National Parks, Environment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, my question

relates  to  funding as well.  What is the total  budget  his

Ministry will be allocating for these two pilot projects,  or

other projects related to the improvement of private estates?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

still  trying  to  work out the budget with the  Ministry  of

Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> I think he has not answered my

question.   When he says more than the present amount,  would

it be near the $4,000 benchmark?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> As I said in my reply to Dr

Wang, we are looking into the final details of the budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Given that the scope of

works  contemplated is relatively modest, can we envisage  an

early  start  date for the project and faster  implementation

because we are only talking about things like landscaping and

footpath  widening?   I  do not see this  as  being  terribly

complicated.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We will try to start one or

two  by  the  second half of this year.  We  are  already  in

March.  So the second half can be a few months away.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> The Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has said that, for condominiums, they

will probably do it on public land.  May I take it that it is

a  principle of private estate upgrading that no private land

will be taken?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

could I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary this question?

He  talks  about one of the factors being community  bonding.

Will  it  be  possible for communities that are found  to  be

quite  well  bonded to be helped along with the provision  of

facilities like the RC centre or  clubhouse?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> That depends on the number

of houses or condominium units in that precinct.  The funding

will  be  based  on  X  dollars  per  household  within  that

precinct.  So if there is enough money to do something big, I

think we can consider.  But bear in mind that private estates

are not like HDB estates.  The total number of household size

will be small.  So we do not envisage a big project to be  in

place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> May I urge the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary, in contemplating what projects to implement,  will

high  priority  be given to the public transportation  access

elements,  including covered linkways?  I know  he  mentioned

that  LTA  will be involved.  But I think that would probably

redeem   all  significant  value  added  to  private   estate

residents rather than parks and footpaths.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I think that suggestion

would be taken up.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I go back to my earlier

question to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary.  Like  in  my

constituency, which is actually older than I am, the  housing

estate has got old schools that are abandoned, or about to be

abandoned, and some of these facilities are too small for any

other  public use, except perhaps a little clubhouse for  the

residents.  I am just thinking that perhaps

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>

the Ministry could look into funding, renovation, and the TOL

that we have to pay to the Land Office.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask

the  Member  to  write to me and give me the details  of  his

proposal?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> May I ask

the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  what  happens  if  the

improvement  work  is  on  HDB  land  because  many  of   the

condominiums or private estates are adjoining the HDB estate?

Therefore, the improvement work has to be done on  HDB  land.

Under  the  traditional CIPC grant, if the improvement  works

are  on  HDB land, then this grant cannot be used.  Could  he

clarify this matter?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I think the policy is very

clear.   If  the estate sits on HDB land, in other words,  we

call  it the common area, then we will use CIPC funding.   If

it  sits  on  private  land, then we can consider  using  the

Committee  for  Improvements  to Private  Residential  Estate

(CIPRE) fund.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> I am pointing out this

particular  issue because one of the condominium developments

would  like  to build one of the covered linkways.   But  the

linkway  is actually on HDB land.  In this case, it  will  be

under   HDB's  CIPC  fund,  and  not  under  other  community

improvement  funds.  Actually, the linkway is only  used  for

the private estate.  Could the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

clarify whether or not that can be done?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> If the linkway sits on HDB

land,  then CIPC fund will have to be sought.  If the linkway

crosses  from the HDB land to the private estate  land,  then

you  will  have to apply for money under the CIPRE fund,  and

the  coordination must be done between the MC  and  the  Town

Council.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, may I look forward to the day

of maintenance.  May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

whether  the  private estate improvements will be  maintained

and funded from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>

general  coffers of Government or will there be  any  special

arrangements?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The funding will come from

the Ministry of Finance.  So this is Government's money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Can we start with more private

projects, instead of just two, because I remember we  started

off with four MUP projects?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> MUP is quite different. HDB

has  been  in the public housing business for 40  years.   So

they know what they are doing.  In this case, we are entering

into a new business and we will tread very carefully.  So  we

will  start with one or two projects by the end of this year.

We will learn from these two projects and we can speed up the

number of projects next year, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will

this project apply to all the new and old housing estates?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In theory, yes. But, in

practice, we would like to apply this fund to the old estates

first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> How old is an old estate?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We have to look at each

estate  separately because some old estates  have  just  been

upgraded  by the National Parks Board and Environment.   Some

new estates may not have been upgraded yet.  The cut-off line

is quite blur, unlike HDB estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the proceedings on the Estimates of Expenditure for FY 2000/2001 on 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th March 2000, be continued beyond 4.30 pm, and be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until 7.00 pm on each day; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the proceedings on the Estimates of Expenditure for FY 2000/2001 on 11th March 2000 be continued beyond 4.30 pm, and be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until 5 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because almost 530 amendments will be moved in

the  Committee of Supply this year.  In fairness to the  MPs,

and  in order for them to get the replies, we need the  extra

time to deal with these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the proceedings on the Estimates of Expenditure for FY 2000/2001 on 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th March 2000, be continued beyond 4.30 pm, and be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until 7.00 pm on each day; and

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of

Expenditure of Singapore for the financial year,  1st  April,

2000  to  31st March, 2001 contained in Paper Cmd  No.  2  of

2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience, I shall take the totals for each head

of  expenditure in the Main and Development Estimates as they

appear  in  the  last columns of the schedules  of  estimated

expenditure under the Main and Development Estimates  Outlays

for  FY  2000/2001  on  pages 37 and 38 respectively  of  the

Command Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the "guillotine" times for heads of expenditure,

which I have fixed under Standing Order 89(7)(a), I have also

allotted  the  time for discussion of each amendment  in  the

Estimates.   The  time allotted for discussion  includes  the

replies  from the front bench.  I shall announce these  times

as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have submitted a record number of 529 notices of

amendments.  Perhaps, Members have decided to subject me to a

more vigorous test of my patience this year.  But indeed,  it

shows the seriousness in which we, as legislators, treat this

annual  debate  on the budgets for the different  Ministries.

However,  time  is  a constraining factor, and  Members  will

therefore  not necessarily be given the amount of  time  they

have  requested.  Members are cognizant of the fact that  the

time  allotted for the debate is not enough, and have readily

agreed a while ago to extend the daily sitting hours to  7.00

pm  and to an additional sitting day this Saturday till  5.00

pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will still be hard-pressed for time and

I once again urge Members to keep their speeches to the point

so that we can conduct our business at an efficient pace.  If

not, I must warn Members they risk being  "guillotined".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have not submitted cuts but would like to

join  in the debate on a particular amendment will be allowed

to  do  so  only  if  there is sufficient time  left  on  the

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which  amendments  stand  on  the  Order   Paper

Supplement.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head V - Prime Minister's Office.

Amendment No. (1), Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this cut, I would like to highlight a

difference  in  motivating staff between the public  and  the

private  sectors.   The  private  sector  is  driven  by  the

bottomline,  be  it  profit and loss  or  value-added.   This

philosophy  is  usually embraced by the entire  organisation,

literally  through  thick  and  thin,  through  mergers   and

acquisitions or through industry restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with this, performance targets are in place

for   the   majority   of  private  enterprises.    Employees

contribute  accordingly and generally  cannot  but  feel  the

pulse  of  the  underlying industry.  This  is  most  evident

during the recession and the restructuring of the electronics

sector.   Retrenchment,  as  we  all  know,  was  a   painful

experience  for  those  affected. The reality  was  that  the

profitability of their companies had a direct impact on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token and to complement a fast changing and

technology-driven   economy,   the   public    sector    will

increasingly  be expected to deliver acceptable  value-added.

This  is  particularly  so  as  technology  will  force  more

transparency  on  the  entire  supply  chain,  including  the

delivery of public services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, every public sector employee will soon be forced

to  focus on customer satisfaction at each level, and  to  be

more innovative and entrepreneurial in his approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our limited manpower resources would be another

reason for narrowing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>

any  disparity in the terms of employment between the  public

and  private sectors.  If nothing else, a disparity makes for

difficult  deployment of capable civil servants to for-profit

Government-linked companies or even the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps inevitable that a performance-based

variable may eventually dominate the overall compensation  of

a  typical worker in Singapore.  In the private sector,  this

already  takes the form of actual bonuses paid out  or  stock

options.  An appropriate equivalent would have to  be  worked

out  for civil servants in the long run and, in fact, for all

public sector employees. Otherwise, the call for them  to  be

more entrepreneurial would ring hollow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Prime Minister on how

the  vision of a more entrepreneurial public sector  will  be

realised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the need to

integrate communication and response to the public as part of

the assessment of civil servants, especially among its elite.

In  this  sense, my remarks follow on what the MP for  Marine

Parade GRC has spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have come to expect greater

consultation and participation in public life.  In the 1980s,

the  then  Deputy  Prime Minister, Mr  Goh  Chok  Tong,  made

greater consultation one of the central aspects of the second

generation   government.   Institutions  for  feedback   were

created, consultation increased, town councils were  used  to

devolve more authority and participation to the local level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decade since Prime Minister Goh has come into

office, further steps have been taken. CDCs now try to  bring

Government  even  closer  to the  people.  The  Singapore  21

initiative set up by Prime Minister Goh aims for the ideal of

"active citizens".  This vision is not of a strong people and

a  weak  Government.  Nor is it a vision of  people  opposing

Government.  Singapore 21 envisions the ideal  of  a  society

which  people  and  Government work together,  and  both  are

strong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When future generations look back on these 10 years,

history  may well judge that greater consultation and greater

participation  are part of the legacy left by Prime  Minister

Goh and his team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, there are some who believe that

what we have experienced is more of a function of the present

Prime  Minister's personal style.  Some may  point  out  that

Singapore  21  is  not  explicitly  the  vision  of  a  third

generation  of  leaders.  Many hope that they  will  come  to

embrace  this vision, but there is no guarantee  at  present,

and  this is why I turn to the question of the civil  service

and  institutionalising  their  ability  and  willingness  to

communicate and respond to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a recent debate in the public press which I

shall  not touch on.  However, it is clear that the questions

raised were not simply about the National Library or the Bras

Basah  Park, but broader issues, such as whether there should

be  benchmarks for the civil service in dealing  with  public

consultation  or whether the examples touched  upon  in  this

debate can and should be improved in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I personally remain optimistic. Promises made are

genuinely  meant and the change and improvements  will  come.

But I would urge the processes that promote change should  be

institutionalised. They should be made part  of  a  permanent

way of how we do things and how we assess the performance  of

our   civil  servants.   One  very  important  step  in  this

direction  would be to integrate this aspect of communication

and  response  to  the  public in  the  assessment  of  civil

servants, especially the elite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do this, we are setting the right signal that

consultation  is  vital.   By  including  communication   and

response to the public, we will be moving beyond exhortation.

The  process of consultation will increasingly be part of the

criteria  for  success.  It will no longer be  sufficient  to

ask,  "Is  the  job done, and how well?"   It  will  also  be

asked, "How was it done?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all decisions can be consulted. Some are

market sensitive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>

Others  may  touch  on security secrets.  Exceptions  can  be

justified.  Nor of course does consultation mean that  public

suggestions will always be adopted.  In this regard, we  must

accept  that  consultation is a complex quality  to  measure.

But the effort must be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partial analogy can be drawn to the efforts already

undertaken  by  the Government in improving service  quality.

This  has  focused  on  over-the-counter  services  such   as

reducing  queues  in various departments. Such  services  are

important,  and improvements are relatively easy to  measure.

While  consultation engagements are more complex to  measure,

they  are  no less important qualities.  In fact,  I  believe

that  they  will be increasingly demanded by an  increasingly

educated and cosmopolitan Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because public consultation is more complex, and because

it   would  be  increasingly  demanded,  the  process  should

therefore  begin  now.  Let greater public  consultation  and

participation  go  from  a promise  to  a  basic  premise  of

Government   in  Singapore.   Let  public  consultation   and

participation be institutionalised for the future.  I hope in

this  way, the present Government will lay a foundation stone

upon which succeeding governments and generations of citizens

can build their home.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, for the past

decade,  companies in the United States have been continually

restructuring their operations to make themselves leaner  and

more  profitable.  Now other countries, including Japan,  are

doing  the  same things. In Singapore, we have seen companies

restructuring  not because of economic difficulties,  but  to

become more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and the rapid change in technology are

altering  the way companies operate and the way we work.  Are

we  ready  for such drastic changes to our working life?   We

could  try  to dig in our heels in an attempt to  stop  these

changes.  But this would not serve any good.  If we insist to

resist  change,  we will do ourselves more  harm  than  good.

Instead,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>

we  need to react fast and prepare our workers early to  face

the challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has to be redesigned to successfully meet the new

demands   of   the   knowledge-based  economy   and   sustain

competitiveness.   For example, companies  have  to  redesign

their  work process to be more responsive to customers. Staff

have  to  be empowered with more knowledge and technology  to

create more value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While work redesign is not a new concept, it has taken

on  a  new dimension brought about by our ageing society  and

higher  retirement age.  Presently, retirement age is set  at

62 but, in due course, it will be raised to 67.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides creating greater efficiency in work processes,

work  redesign  can  help workers stay employable  for  life,

through customising work processes for this specific purpose.

Work  redesign will also remove the stigma attached  to  some

low-level jobs.  Moreover, the higher the productivity  gain,

the better chances there are of our workers to receive better

earnings and able to enhance their quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector should also consider ways to

streamline different schemes of service, better deploy staff,

and  respond  to the higher expectations of a  more  educated

workforce and sustain high productivity gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me cite the example of PSB. From 1996, clerical

officers  were  transformed  into administrative  executives.

With  80%  of school leavers going for higher education,  PSB

found it difficult to recruit clerical grades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not just a change in title. PSB redesigned the

work process, in consultation with the union. The job content

was expanded to incorporate higher end administrative duties.

The   salary  scales  were  also  adjusted.  A  comprehensive

training programme was put in place to help existing staff to

acquire  the  new  skills  for the  enriched  role  and  more

responsible tasks they have to perform. This project

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>

enables  PSB employees to pursue more development  programmes

to  enhance  their  employability.   They  are  now  enjoying

better  career  progression path and a  more  rewarding  work

life.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Public Service Division will also consider

such  work design initiative for applicable job areas in  the

public sector to increase the value of the existing jobs  and

provide  structured  training for employees  to  develop  new

competencies.  As our civil servants upgrade their skills  to

take  up  these  high value added jobs,  they  will  be  more

employable  and  be  paid more.  The work redesign  programme

should be widely considered in the public sector, not only to

create  greater efficiency but also to better deploy manpower

to  areas  where  there is staff shortage, such  as  school's

office to help ease teachers' administrative workload.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our model of

governance  has  been  one  of a stable  and  strong  central

government  and civil service, and it was an excellent  model

for  the building of Singapore in the past 34 years.   As  we

now  compete in the world with the world's best countries and

on  a global playing field, the challenges of nation building

and   economic  development  are  completely  different  from

before.   As such, there is a serious need for us  to  review

how our Government is organised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain sectors of governance need to have strong and

central  control, but others can be more open  and  flexible.

And  I  feel  that  the  governance of  Singapore  should  be

outsourced  as  much  as possible with  the  people  and  the

private  sectors taking on more responsibilities than before.

There  is  no necessity for the Government to have  a  strong

hand  in  every  aspect of economic development  and  of  our

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the USA and Taiwan, there are fine examples of how

the  private sector is the key driver of economic development

and  there  is  very little central control exerted  in  many

areas   of   the   countries'  management.    Secondly,   the

transparency of policies and practices will do good for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>

everyone. At the moment, those outside the Government service

have   very  little  visibility  and  do  not  have  a   good

understanding of public policies.  Any attempt  to  get  more

information  typically  results in  a  bureaucratic  form  of

obstacles.  In my opinion, the more the people in the private

sector  know and understand our policies, the more  efficient

the whole system will be.  Things will move even faster.   So

I  urge the Government to be more transparent and share  more

information with Singaporeans when they require.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have excellent and brilliant people in the civil

service.  My experience with them in the last three years has

allowed me to understand them more, and conclude that we have

good and committed people in the civil service.  However, the

private and people sectors assume that the civil service know

all  the  issues facing the world outside the civil  service.

And  the  civil servants assume that citizens  know  all  the

policies  of  the Government well.  The lesson  that  I  have

learned  is  that  this is not true at all.   This  therefore

means that there is an important need for greater interaction

and  exchanges, including the hiring of more people from  the

private sector into the key civil service positions.  We need

to   create  a  true  partnership  relationship  between  the

people/private and the public sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept that the private sector individuals be

involved  in the governance of Singapore should be  seriously

considered.  I suggest that we have two or three  people  who

can  be  involved  in  Cabinet style discussions  to  discuss

policies,  who  are from outside the central government.   My

reason  for  suggesting this is because our  system  is  very

central  leadership focused and key issues are  discussed  at

Cabinet or by a core group of people in leadership positions,

and  decisions are made by the same people.  Similarly,  such

outsiders can also be mirroring the Permanent Secretaries and

senior  civil  servants in some policy discussions.   A  more

rounded  discussion will lead to more polished policies.   In

fact,  in  any  Government position, it is valuable  to  have

people from outside the circle who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>

can  be a source of valuable input and, at the same time,  be

responsible for their suggestions, quite different from using

them just as input tools as we do today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil service reward system also needs to be

looked into, and I feel that they must not be left out in the

booming  knowledge-based economy.  Policy  makers  must  feel

motivated that they should benefit from the booming  economy,

just  as  everyone  else in Singapore.   I  suggest  a  share

ownership  scheme  and  also  a  more  flexible  compensation

package  to  allow them to participate in the  economy.   For

example,  a  unit  trust could be set up for  investments  in

start-up  companies in Singapore, and this can be part  of  a

civil servant's compensation package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need a more aggressive approach of policy making

and  be  willing to take more risks.  My impression  is  that

many  key  civil servants rather not rock the boat  and  they

rather implement safe policies so that their careers are  not

affected  as a result of a wrong or failed policy.  In  fact,

they  should  be  rewarded for daring  to  be  different  and

proposing radical changes, even if the policies are  not  the

best and stable of all the policies implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I suggest that the Government's spin off

value-added components of the statutory boards of  Government

and of GLCs into companies, then fund these new companies and

let the founders and initiators who may be civil servants  to

leave  the  civil service and run these businesses backed  by

funds from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that we have an

excellent  civil  service  in place,  staffed  by  many  good

people.   What I am suggesting is a change in our system  and

not  the  people,  and it is not intended  to  point  at  any

particular group of Singaporeans.  Collectively,  all  of  us

have  a  very important role to play and I think if  we  work

together, we can make a big difference.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, with an aging population and

rapid   business   reorganisation  and  restructuring,   more

companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>

will  retrain  workers  in  order  to  stay  competitive  and

profitable.   Workers who experience periods of  unemployment

in  between  jobs  can  no longer look forward  to  life-time

employment  in  a  single company.  It is  therefore  in  the

workers'   interest  to  make  benefits  provided  for   them

portable, so that they have adequate protection as they  move

from job to job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee medical benefits are prime examples.

Currently, these are not portable in the private sector.   It

makes it harder for older workers to change jobs or find  new

jobs after retrenchment, especially if they have some medical

condition.   New employers would be reluctant to  take  these

older  workers and will take them as a burden  of  the  older

workers with the medical expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has adopted a portable

medical  benefit  scheme for the civil servants  since  1994.

With  this portable Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient  (MSO)

scheme,  our civil servants are given an additional  Medisave

contribution of 1% in lieu of the traditional hospitalisation

benefits.  The officers can use the money to pay for  his  or

his  dependant's  inpatient bill or for a more  comprehensive

medical  insurance such as IncomeShield.  In addition,  there

is  another  subsidy for outpatient expenses for the  officer

and  his  eligible dependants capped at $350 per year.   This

scheme  is  portable as the officer can keep  the  additional

contribution  in  his  Medisave account.   I  would  like  to

suggest  that PSD  also consider making the $350 subsidy  for

outpatient  treatment portable.  Instead of keeping  the  sum

that  is  not  used,  the  balance should  also  go  into  an

employee's Medisave account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MSO scheme has been in place for six years. I

think  it  is timely for the PSD to review the percentage  of

additional Medisave contribution and the $350 annual cap  for

outpatient  subsidy  for  our civil servants  under  the  MSO

scheme.   I  would  also  like to urge  the  PSD  to  work  a

mechanism  to ensure that such provision will be adjusted  as

medical costs increase with time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the cost cutting measure, our civil servants

had  their wages cut by 6.2% through the annual variable  and

monthly  variable  components.  Now that  we  have  "V-shape"

recovery,  the  Government, as an employer, should  recognise

the public sector employees' sacrifices.  As the  recovery is

an uneven one, their pay cut has not been fully restored.   I

hope   the   Government,  as  an  employer,  could   consider

recognising  the sacrifices of the civil servants  by  giving

them a one-off special Medisave contribution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to

thank  the  Member  for  Cheng San  GRC  for  explaining  the

background, as it makes my presentation more easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that the civil service medical benefit is

one  of  the prime selling points for civil servants all  the

while.   In  1994,  the  civil  service  actually  introduced

changes, and these changes were what Mr Yeo had touched upon.

One of the key components of the civil service change was the

aspect of co-payment in medical benefits.  We also know  that

the  private sector is looking to the civil service  and  the

public sector to set the tone, and sees the Government  as  a

role model for staff and welfare benefits.  At the same time,

we  are encouraging the private sector to get on to this  co-payment  scheme  and yet it is not picking up.   One  of  the

reasons why it is not picking up is because the civil service

had introduced this scheme in 1994 and up to now had made  no

revision.   People see it  as a stagnation of  benefits  when

pay  and  wages go up, cost of medical benefit goes up.   But

when  the two aspects of it had not changed, it looks  as  if

the scheme has gone down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to review these

quantums regularly, and now is the time for change.   Changes

can  be  in two aspects.  One is the 1% which goes  into  the

Medisave account under the MSO scheme, and the cap of  $7,000

salary  a  month, which is equivalent to $350  a  year.   The

other  one is a subsidy for outpatient medical treatment  for

an employee's family which is placed at a maximum of $350.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I ask the civil service and the Prime Minister to

look  at  the  review, I also want to say that we  should  do

revisions  periodically.  It is very  difficult  to  get  the

private  sector to accept change when there are  no  changes.

We should not only have changes periodically.  We should also

set  in  place the basis of those changes, what is it  linked

to,  and  how it will go up.  In that way, nobody  will  feel

disadvantaged  in  moving  to a co-payment  scheme  which  is

supposed to benefit everyone.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, today, I have a

proposition for the Prime Minister on making babies, speaking

on  behalf of Singaporean couples, of course.  The package  I

am  asking  the Prime Minister to consider is  just  but  one

small piece of the jigsaw puzzle that we must put together if

we  are to be serious about encouraging more Singaporeans  to

start  families, to grow bigger families and  to  keep  those

families  strong  and  sound.   Government  is  the   largest

employer in Singapore.  If it will take the lead in doing  as

much as it can to create a working environment that is family

friendly, this will go a long way, both in the direct  impact

on  the  tens of thousands of civil servants as  well  as  in

setting the example for other organisations and companies  to

follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service already offers some very good benefits

in   terms   of  sick  child  leave  for  mothers,  part-time

employment and no-pay leave for mothers after child birth for

child  minding, and on-site childcare centres in many of  the

Ministries.   These are wonderful benefits  to  have,  but  I

would like to suggest some enhancements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, sick child leave is currently only for children

up to six years of age.  I believe this must have been chosen

in  relation to the age that he starts going to school.   But

the  kiddie  going  to primary school is  still  not  old  or

independent  enough  to go to the doctor  by  himself  if  he

should fall ill.  I would therefore suggest raising the  cut-off  age  to,  say, 12 years, when the child is of  secondary

school level and more independent.  I do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>

not  believe  that  parents will abuse  the  privilege.   The

benefit should also be made available to either parent.  I am

not  asking for more days per child, just that the five  days

per  child  per  annum  may be taken by  either  one  of  the

parents.  In the not too distant future, I think we may  have

to  consider  similar leave for sick elderly members  of  the

family as well, as the population ages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while I know that a number of civil servants

have  used the part-time employment and no-pay leave  benefit

to  take time off to look after young children, it is also  a

fact  that  the ease or otherwise of organising  this  varies

from department to department, and is often a function of how

supportive  individual supervisors  are.   We  all  know  how

responsive civil servants are to major campaigns if they  are

pushed  with  enough conviction from the  top.    So  if  the

message  to be supportive of and, in fact,  to do their  best

to  facilitate parents who wish to avail themselves of  these

benefits  can be driven as hard as, for example,  the  PS  21

effort,  this  would be most helpful.  Again, availing  these

benefits  to  either  parent would send a  great  message  on

breaking down the rigidities of stereotyped roles.   It  does

not  matter  if  it  is years before many or,  in  fact,  any

fathers  take  up the offer, but the important  thing  is  to

start making change to mindsets.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the issue of maternity leave for the third and

later  children. Our usual position on this  issue  has  been

that  the  generous  tax rebates given to mothers  for  their

third, fourth and more children, more than compensate for the

loss of maternity leave.  But we know that this benefits only

women who are in the higher income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when these tax incentives were put in place

we  were very clear that we were specifically targetting this

group.   But  I  believe  that by  now,  we  are  looking  to

encourage  a  much broader population of women,  couples,  to

have  more  children.  I really think it is time  for  us  to

reconsider this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on the subject of paternity leave.

Let  me say upfront that I do not think that a man's decision

to  have a child is influenced one iota by whether he  has  a

few  days of paternity leave or not. However, it is  part  of

the  overall culture and environment of whether we truly want

to  celebrate the fathering of a child.  Especially, when  on

the  other side of the equation, how many man-days would  the

civil service lose by offering such a benefit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, one old request is revived - a five-day

work  week.  Having two days off in the week would  make  all

the  difference in the world to a harried couple.   It  would

allow  time to get chores done, and it would leave time  left

over  to  relax  with the family.  I am not asking  for  less

hours  in  the  work  week, only that  the  hours  worked  be

arranged  in a five-day rotation. It is also possible  to  do

this and still have Government services available six days  a

week.   All  it  takes is a willingness to be flexible  about

scheduling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be wonderful if the Prime Minister says yes

to  these  small requests, but I suspect that the answer  may

more likely to be no.  And so, before he actually does, I  am

going to ask that he does not say no outright, but will agree

to consider putting these items, together with others that  I

will be proposing over the next week and a half, on a list to

be  put  before,  and  added  to by,  a  central  review  and

coordinating  body,  an Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  the

Family,  to take a holistic approach in a national effort  to

draw  up a comprehensive blueprint to build more, strong  and

sound Singaporean families.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Mrs  Lim,  in  moving  the  debate   on   the

examination of the estimates for the Prime Minister's Office,

focuses  on the performance of civil servants.  I  would  now

like to focus a little bit on the Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have been asking this every year, but I am

afraid I have not got any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>

satisfactory  answers.   I see  the provision  for  political

appointments  for  next year has gone up  by  something  like

$3,159,500.  May I ask what is this increase for?  May  I  be

told where is this money going to?  Secondly, something which

I  have  already raised is, do we really need seven Ministers

in  the  Prime Minister's Office for the tasks of  the  Prime

Minister and his colleagues?  We have five Ministers and  two

Ministers  of State, besides the Parliamentary Secretary  and

two  Political Secretaries.  I have asked time and time again

about  a greater clarification of the duties of these various

Ministers, and I have never been given a proper answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that under the Constitution notification of the

responsibilities  of  Ministers, the  responsibility  of  the

Senior Minister is that he is charged with the responsibility

for  advising Ministers on any of the subjects.  When he  was

the Prime Minister and Mr Rajaratnam was the Senior Minister,

I  asked  the  Prime Minister what exactly was Mr  Rajaratnam

doing, and his answer was, "He advises me whenever I need his

advice."  I thought then he was paid an unduly heavy sum  for

that duty.  May we know what exactly is the duty performed by

the Senior Minister in the office?  The notification says  he

is  charged  with  the responsibility.  Does  he  advise  the

Ministers  when he is called upon for advice?  Does  he  give

directives every day to the Ministries as to how they  should

conduct their affairs and how they should run their Ministry?

May  I know whether the Prime Minister has any responsibility

for  advising  the  Ministers, or it is left  solely  to  the

Senior  Minister?  I think we need more clarification  as  to

why  it is necessary for the Prime Minister's Office to  have

seven  Ministers.  What exactly are they doing and why is  it

necessary to pay them what they are being paid at the moment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year we had a

very  lively  debate in this House during the debate  on  the

Singapore  21 Vision.  During the debate, the Prime  Minister

introduced the concept of the Singapore tribe, a unique group

of  people making a nation. Sir, the key issue is whether we,

as a country, are doing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>

enough  to build emotional bonds among Singaporeans.  Are  we

serious  about  building  a  Singapore  Tribe?   The   recent

Singapore  Press  Holdings' survey on race  relations  is  an

important reminder that we still have some way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, legislation has been used as a key approach to

ensure  inter-racial ties are maintained, but  this  may  not

lead  to greater emotional bonding. A strong Government  able

to  keep peace by creating rules that require its citizens to

live with one another and the fear of breaking the rules  may

give the false impression that things are all right. They may

instead  lead to superficial bonds and we may have the  false

comfort that everything is all right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the mistrust and historical problems

need  to  be addressed urgently and the recent survey on race

relations revealed that while things have improved,  this  is

still  a  lingering problem among Singaporeans.  I feel  that

not  enough  has been done to build a Singapore  identity  to

maximise  the common overlapping areas of all the  races,  as

Prime Minister Goh puts it in the S21 speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practices like the ethnic based self-help groups tell

our  people  that we should only help our own kind  and  that

only  our  own  kind will help us.  This is a  very  divisive

approach, in my opinion, while it may have other benefits  in

all  of  us helping one another.  Sir, my generation did  not

grow  up in such an environment.  We treated different  races

more  as one than today's younger generation and this  is  my

fear  that it might lead to greater alienation of the various

races if we continue this practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, practices in some schools to segregate

children  into  different classes based on the mother  tongue

they  speak, for operational efficiency, are bad.   In  fact,

there  are many cases where students group together and speak

their  mother tongue at the expense of their friends  who  do

not  understand  the  language.   This  may  lead  to  racial

enclaves  in  school.   In  fact, some  of  this  is  already

happening now and we need to address this issue urgently.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really need to do more to develop an integrated

society  and focus more on increasing our overlapping  common

traits  so  that  in the long term a unique  Singapore  Tribe

model  of  diversity  and similarity can develop.   Emotional

bonding  cannot  be  left  to  legislation  but  requires   a

"heartware"  approach.  We need to ensure that the  Singapore

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision becomes a reality for all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, one

positive result of the recent Straits Times' survey  on  race

relations  said most Singaporeans feel that, compared  to  10

years ago, relations between different races in Singapore are

better  now.  They do not foresee a racial riot happening  in

Singapore   in   the  next  10  years.   This  is   extremely

significant because the survey was carried out in  the  midst

of racial problems in our neighbouring countries.  This shows

great  progress we have made in ensuring racial  harmony  and

the freedom Singaporeans have in the system of law and order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the result that half of the respondents do not

think  that  friends of a different race would  protect  them

should  a race riot break out in Singapore, a friend of  mine

remarked  that  it is almost like asking someone  whether  he

would  drink  water  from the tap should a  cholera  outbreak

break  out in Singapore.  There are therefore reasons not  to

be  too pessimistic about it.  However, what is disturbing to

me  personally is the revelation that Singaporeans  generally

have  about only five friends of a different race.   I  think

this  is  far  too  small.  Either we really  have  very  few

friends or we are such unfriendly people.  As we look closely

at   the  various  activities  where  different  races   come

together,  a  large  number of them have meals  together  and

frequently speak to someone of a different race.  But when it

comes  to  more personal activities, like shopping, going  to

the  movies, and sports, many tend to do so with only  people

of the same race.  I find this worrying.  Clearly, we need to

do  more to forge greater inter-racial harmony and one way is

really,  we  have  no  other choice, to seize  all  available

opportunities   for   greater   inter-racial   collaboration.

Because only by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>

doing things together, especially things that typically  have

nothing to do with race, will people succeed in breaking down

racial  barriers.  Because shared activities build bonds  and

trust  among  groups and create a foundation on which  people

can   have   more   personal  and  deeper  understanding   of

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I have a few suggestions for

consideration.  Perhaps it is time for us to consider setting

up a multi-cultural agency, a statutory board under the Prime

Minister's Office, to promote multi-culturalism.  This may be

a  lofty  idea, or a very vague idea at the moment,  but  the

achievement  of this idea is so important that it  leaves  us

with no other choice but to try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the Community Development

Councils  must  be developed to be the focal points  for  all

inter-racial  activities within a municipal area.    However,

to  achieve  this, we may have to review policies that  allow

ethnic  and  religious  based organisations  to  continue  to

provide  an  ever increasing array of services  that,  in  my

view,  may  potentially  retard  racial  integration.    What

cultural values do we expect our young to have if they  spend

their  entire pre-school years mixing around with  people  of

their  own race and religion?  Perhaps, we now have to define

the  limits  on which ethnic based groups can organise  their

activities.   CDCs  can  provide better  incentives  to  draw

social  and  ethnic  based  organisations  to  locate   their

services in CDCs and to carry out activities there.  As  most

have  problems securing funds, I think CDCs can offer  a  lot

more help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I think sport games, festivals and celebrations

are  powerful vehicles for social integration.  For  example,

if  left  on  its  own, only Malays will play  sepak  takraw,

Chinese  will  play basketball and perhaps only Indians  play

hockey.   I  think we should look at some of these activities

and organise sports, perhaps purely for this purpose alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, we have become a society which is tolerant

and respectful of other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>

races and cultures, but we must go beyond to become a society

that  can celebrate our diversity and differences.   We  have

festivals  and  celebrations, but have we really  taken  full

advantage  to  use  these festivals as  a  means  for  social

cohesion  and racial understanding?  Christmas and  New  Year

parties may become common celebrations in offices because  of

the  predominantly Chinese population in work places, but  it

is   precisely  this  that,  unless  we  take  an  effort  to

understand  and appreciate the special festivals of  minority

groups,  we  cannot  fully  become  a  multi-racial  society.

Unfortunately,  Sir,  in Singapore,  on  matters  like  this,

sometimes  it takes Government, itself the biggest  employer,

to  make a start and to be a catalyst of change.  So too with

foreign  talents and immigrants.  We need to take this  extra

effort  to  make  them feel recognised and  valued,  that  we

respect  their  culture and tradition despite  being  in  the

minority, have a place in Singapore and, better still, can be

celebrated  by  all Singaporeans because precisely  we  value

their  differences  and  the diversity  that  they  bring  to

Singapore.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must keep the conversation going and have an

open and honest discussion which, I think, can lead to better

examination  of  attitudes, behaviour and  wisdom  that  will

allow  us  to find new and useful strategies.  We should  not

forget  that only recently, amidst growing job retrenchments,

issues  of  race  and  discrimination in  job  advertisements

surface.   It  is  only because we have an  open  and  honest

discussion here that many of the perceived sensitivities  are

better understood.  And I hope this conversation can continue

even  at  the highest level in this House so that we continue

to  give  our people the hope and confidence that, come  what

may,  multi-culturalism is a value that all Singaporeans will

cherish and protect.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir,

Singapore's  success in the last 40 years  has  been  largely

economic,   to some extent, social.  In the 60s and  70s,  we

used labour capital, we created jobs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>

we attracted MNCs.  In the 80s, we used our financial capital

to  grow, and in 1986 we faced the recession, and we came out

of  it.   The  Economic Committee headed by BG  Lee  and  the

Cabinet  did  very well.  In the 90s, we were moving  towards

KBE   and  when  we  faced  the  last  recession,  the  young

generation  of  leaders  took us out of  it  pretty  quickly.

Socially,  we have done well to some extent; meritocracy  and

social harmony have been key pillars, but we have some way to

go.   We  have  set up CDCs and so on, but our social  habits

still cannot make us a developed nation yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy is opening up tremendous

opportunity  for  the people of the world  -  the  young  and

enterprising can move from rags to riches pretty  quickly  in

what  people call at Internet speed or Internet year.  In  my

definition, the effort is 100 days.  It is moving  very  fast

and many people can become rich.  But having said that, there

are  many  others who would be left behind in what is  called

digital divide and become digital outcast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the larger portion of

Singaporeans.   Many of us have spoken about  why  Government

should do a lot more on the economic front for businesses  in

this   Internet   economy.   I  am   confident,   given   the

Government's track record, that we will do very well  and  do

all  that  is  needed to make Singapore Inc  succeed  in  the

Internet world.  But I think more of us need to speak here in

this  Chamber  about  the  number  of  constituents  that  we

represent who would not make it from rags to riches, but  who

may become digital outcast in the coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the 45, 50, 60, and the 70-year

olds  who,  to them, touching a computer gives them  a  fear,

apprehension, a certain psyche that even with the $25 million

that  MCIT  has started to put forward, which is a very  good

first  step,  but I think a lot more needs to  be  done.   We

cannot  leave this to a statutory board to just  provide  the

facilities  and  hope  that the 70-year  olds  will  pick  up

computers.  Mr Lee Kuan Yew, our Senior Minister,  picked  up

computer at the age of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>

72.   He  is not the norm but an exception, a leader that  we

hope many other older citizens will follow his fine example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to ensure that we give sufficient attention to

this  bigger  problem, which is not just purely economic  but

much  more social and, to a larger extent, political, we need

to  set  up  a  unit under perhaps the PMO  to  address  this

problem.  And we have done this before.  Pollution control in

the  70s or 80s was under the PMO.  The SDU was under the PMO

before.   All  these got relegated to the various  Ministries

once the strategies took off to an operational level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call for the setting up of this unit, a multi-agency unit, under the PMO, which could be driven by IDA and

perhaps  the  People's  Association.  Ultimately,  perhaps  a

Ministerial  committee  should be  set  up  to  address  this

problem of digital divide because the larger portion  of  our

population deserves attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, if you look at Singapore, about 20% will be

called  relatively  poor.  Our fear is  that  this  20%  will

accentuate  in  terms  of  percentage  and  number   as   our

population  grows.  And I think it is timely that  the  Prime

Minister himself paid significant attention, because we  want

to remain as one people, one nation, one Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir,

let me take all the cuts in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua wanted to bring the civil service up to

date   in   terms  of  motivation,  remuneration,  and   even

organisation.  I completely agree with her that  while  there

are  differences between the public and the private  sectors,

because one has more bottomline focus than the other, in fact

there are many similarities too.  Because even in the private

sector,  you  are not just talking about the bottomline,  you

are   also   talking  about  service  quality,   performance,

innovation.   While in the public sector,  we  are  not  just

talking  about  administering our long-term  goals,  although

these  are  important, but also about efficiency  and  saving

costs.   So  there is much which the public sector can  learn

from the personnel practices of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>

private   sector,  the  way  they  reward,  train,  motivate,

organise their people, which we should take on board and also

use in the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically in terms of remuneration, we have already

started having performance bonuses for our more senior  civil

servants.  We had announced last year that we wanted to  move

towards  a  scheme  where  all  civil  servants  would   have

performance bonus as one component of their salary, from  the

top  all  the  way down to the bottom.  We will progressively

introduce this over the next two or three years with the  NWC

awards.  We will put aside some of the NWC awards to build up

a  significant component of a performance bonus, so that each

civil servant will feel that how he does will impact what  he

earns.   It  does make a difference.  And at  the  very  top,

where  presently the senior civil servants have a performance

bonus, maximum of six months, we are reviewing this now,  and

we  should substantially increase that certainly to at  least

12  months,  and  maybe more.  Because if  you  look  at  the

private  sector, for the senior persons, yes, they  are  paid

more.   But maybe only one-third of their earnings goes  into

salaries,  and  the  other two-thirds of their  earnings  are

variable,  depending on their own performance,  depending  on

their   company's  performance,  depending  on  the   overall

achievement of their section of the company, and so  on.   So

we should move, approximate private sector practice, and keep

track.  As the private sector improves, so do we.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Simon Tay asked about communication and

response  to the public and wanting to establish  it  in  our

staff appraisal system.  I think his question is not so  much

about  the  staff  appraisal system.  It is  whether  or  not

communications  involving  the public  and  consultation  are

really  core  to the way the civil service operates  and  the

Government operates.  And I think the answer is yes.   It  is

not  a question of the second or third generation.  It  is  a

question of what is the best way in which to set policies, to

establish the direction, to bring people on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>

board and to work together to improve Singapore, and to  move

forward.   We  have  decided that  in  many  areas,  in  many

circumstances, the best way to do that is to be more open and

inclusive, involving more people outside of the organisation,

talking,  sharing  information, taking on board  suggestions,

views  and  finally reaching a decision which is better  than

what  an  individual department, or even an individual  civil

servant or Minister, is able to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh said just now, the civil service

really does not completely know the way the private sector is

thinking,  and  the private sector often also does  not  know

what  the  civil service constraints and considerations  are.

So the more we can get this interchange and flow, I think the

more  effective  it  will be.  It is not  just  a  matter  of

establishing specific mechanisms for doing this.  It is  also

a  matter  of setting the overall tone for the civil  service

and  making  sure that when we launch something, particularly

something major, this is always at the back of our minds, the

way to proceed.  So when we assess a civil servant, we do not

give brownie points for the number of times he called in  the

private sector to discuss things with them, or the number  of

times  he  went  and gave an explanation, or  the  number  of

letters he wrote to the press, or even the friendliness  with

which he wrote the letters to the press, but, was he able  to

demonstrate  political sensitivity and  certain  openness  of

approach?   And, finally, the bottomline is: was he  able  to

get the job done and the mission accomplished?  If he can  do

that,  then  he is promoted and rewarded.  If  he  cannot  do

that, he can be the most affable person in the world, but  he

is ineffective, he has to be moved out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes our idea of what is a reasonable way to

consult  and take views may not agree with the public's  idea

of  how  much we should consult and take views, in particular

on  the  question of National Library and a few other  things

recently  in  the press.  But that is in the  nature  of  the

process   that   different  parties   will   have   different

perspectives.    Gradually,  I   think   a   more   realistic

expectation and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>

understanding  would  evolve of what  is  possible,  what  is

necessary,  and  what we can achieve from  this  consultation

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that the civil service did mishandle

the  issues which have recently been in dispute.  There  will

always  be  matters which will become hotter than others  and

which  need  to be managed, and we have to do so in  a  calm,

rational and understanding way, and go on, as I think Mr  Mah

Bow  Tan did in Parliament a few days ago explaining how,  as

an  SJI boy, he also had been to the bakery and waited at the

bus  stop.   So  there are many ways, but our  commitment  to

involve  people and to make this a participatory  process  is

quite clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On redesigning work in the public sector, Mr Yeo Guat

Kwang  asked what we are doing.  We agree with him that  this

is  something  which  needs to be done  because  we  want  to

upgrade  our  workers, our staff and we want  to  restructure

their  jobs  so that they have the opportunity for upgrading.

In  fact, we have already been doing job restructuring.   For

example,  last year in April, we restructured and streamlined

the  majority  of the Division IV schemes into broader  based

service   groups,   each  with  its   own   broad-based   job

characteristics  which  help to enlarge  the  jobs  and  help

people to be placed in jobs, and to make progression if  they

are  committed to upgrade themselves.  So we have done  some,

but  it  is  not a static situation because as the population

changes, as job requirements change, we will have to continue

to  restructure and, I am sure, we will do our best  to  keep

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh talked about the need for the civil

service to be open, flexible and transparent.  We fully agree

with  him.   We  have introduced all sorts of schemes  to  do

this.   But  this is a big organisation and it is a continual

effort  to  make  sure that it stays open, it stays  vibrant,

that  it does not settle down, that there is a certain innate

energy, so that new ideas are always coming up and new people

with  fresh  approaches have the opportunity to come  through

the system, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>

not  be  held  down  and stifled by people who  have  arrived

earlier and who may have been active and energetic in earlier

years  but have decided, well, now we are in charge,  let  us

stay in charge for a little while longer.  It is a continuing

effort, but I think if we compare our civil service with  any

other civil service in the world, we are not doing badly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On medical benefits, Mr Yeo and also Mr Thomas Thomas

asked  whether we can review our co-payment and also  we  can

fold  in the $350 outpatient subsidy to be paid into Medisave

Account  for the individuals if it is not spent.   First,  on

the question of revising the medical benefits.  There are two

components  to  this co-payment scheme: (1)  $350  outpatient

subsidy cap, and (2) 1% extra contribution to Medisave.   The

extra  contribution to Medisave is 1% of salary.  So as  your

salary  goes  up, it will automatically go up  together  with

your  salary.   Because  we have not  seen  medical  expenses

increase  much  faster  than salary in  Singapore  in  recent

years, there is no need for us to reconsider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the $350 outpatient subsidy, I have asked for the

data  and  have been told that, in fact, most civil  servants

have  not  been using a lot of this.  In fact, three-quarters

of the civil servants use only $100 or less of the $350 which

they  are entitled to.  On average, the expenditure per civil

servant  was only $74 out of $350.  So there is no  immediate

need to revise the amount upwards.  That is the first point.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the question of philosophy. Our

approach  in  the public service has been to pay  as  far  as

possible  a  clean wage.  In other words, instead  of  having

housing  benefits and significant medical benefits  or  child

benefits  or  transport benefits, we give you a clean  salary

and  you decide how you want to allocate your resources.  And

we  make  sure that the overall salary, the whole package  is

competitive  with other employers in Singapore  and  attracts

the  people  we want for the job.  If we have that  approach,

then to the maximum extent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>

possible,  we  should  cap medical  benefits  in  the  public

service rather than expand them, because really I can have  a

choice  when I expand them.  I can give you the extra  salary

and  you  decide  whether you want to use it for  medical  or

other  purposes, or I can just give you the medical  benefits

and  you have no choice.  Our philosophy has been that it  is

better  to give the civil servants a choice.  So I would  not

say  that we would never adjust this.  But I think that is  a

consideration when we decide whether we need to adjust this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for taking the unused part of the $350 and paying it

into  individual civil servant's Medisave, as I pointed  out,

the average civil servant is only now using $74 of this.   So

if  I  take  it and put it into civil servants' Medisave,  in

effect,  we  are  giving the civil servant another  $270-plus

additional  allowance of pay per year into the Medisave.   So

it  is not something which we can lightly do because there is

a financial implication.  However, I do understand why Mr Yeo

wants to do this.  It is because the private sector has  been

slow  to  implement an alternative medical  benefits  scheme.

Unions  have had difficulties persuading workers to  go  this

way  and to take personal responsibility and to co-pay.   For

the private sector to have this sort of subsidy, perhaps with

a  cap, and then to have the amount paid into the Medisave if

at  the  end  of the year it is not consumed, is a reasonable

way  forward.   So  from that point of view,  it  is  perhaps

useful  for  the civil service to set the example.   We  will

study  this to see if there is an opportunity for us to  move

in  this  direction.  But never forget, we are talking  about

real money, $276 per person, or nearly $9 million per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about female civil servants and

benefits.  We will not say no.  We will consider the  matter.

I would say, firstly, that to go from female officers to male

and female officers is psychologically a big step, and it  is

a  signal  to the whole of the society that we have become  a

different kind of society.  We have been encouraging  parents

to take their share of the burden of looking after kids.  But

we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>

are  not sure yet whether we should give them paternity leave

to celebrate with the mother when the child is born.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the five-day week, we have sought to be flexible

in  the  civil service to follow what the private  sector  is

doing, but not to set the pace for what the private sector is

doing.   Because for us to change ceremonially from a 5  1/2-day  week to 5-day week is suddenly to send a signal  to  the

whole  economy that we are working fewer days, whether it  is

fewer  hours or not, and it will be a change of tone for  the

society.   Some  people say there will be  no  slowdown.   In

fact, we will work better.  We are not sure.  We would prefer

not  to  send such a signal.  But where we can exercise  some

flexibility and allow civil servants some time off, alternate

weekend,  or some time off even during the week if they  need

time  during the week, but maintaining 5 1/2 days as a system

so that the organisations are all open on Saturday mornings - that  we have been progressively doing and, particularly,  in

the statutory boards and semi-Government agencies where it is

easier to have flexibility.  We will gradually move.  We have

not   issued  any  instruction  because  once  we  issue   an

instruction,  everybody  will  straightaway  take   it   that

tomorrow we are in the new world, which we are not.   But  we

have  been practical and pragmatic because we need to  employ

people  too,  and particularly young people and women.   They

tell  us  that working hours and the flexibility  with  which

they   can   adjust  their  working  hours  is  an  important

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked why we need so many Ministers in the

Prime  Minister's Office.  He asked this question last  year.

I gave him an answer.  I think the answer is the same.  There

are  seven Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office.   It  is

really   because  the  Prime  Minister's  Office  encompasses

several different things.  There is the Civil Service,  which

could  be  a  different Ministry, but is in the  PMO,  and  I

happen  to be looking after it.  There is the NTUC  which  is

really  a  separate outfit altogether and is paying  for  the

salaries of the people who are working there, namely, Mr  Lim

Boon Heng, Mr Matthias Yao and Mr Zulkifli.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last two days, Members have discussed the

fast changing pace of the new economy.  The lightning changes

in  technology and the exponential growth in the new  economy

present  both  great  opportunities  and  at  the  same  time

frightening  prospects for us.  Government must grapple  with

many unknowns.  If you take too conservative an approach,  we

will miss out the opportunities.  If we move too fast, we may

ride  on  the wrong bandwagon.  Whatever directions we  take,

one  thing  is  certain,  and that  is,  we  have  even  more

difficulties in updating our legal framework to  help  us  to

plug into the global network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the paradigm shift is so dramatic, and boundaries

between   countries   and   economies   virtually   disappear

overnight,  it  is pertinent to us whether  and  how  we  are

keeping our legal framework up to date.  For example, in  the

fast  changing world of the Internet, are we still  grappling

with trade mark and copyright issues relating to domain names

and  addresses  and such like?  How are we  coping  with  so-called  piracy in cyberspace in which well-known brand names,

or otherwise, are registered on a first-come-first-served

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>

basis  and then offered for sale?  We have read of well-known

personalities having their names registered by  such  pirates

and  then  offered for sale to the rightful  owners.   I  was

searching  for  names for dot.com business  in  the  planning

stage  and  I was amazed and surprised at the kind  of  names

that  have been registered on the Internet.  And I  am  quite

convinced  that the whole dictionary has been registered  for

domain  names.  And I found sites which do trading of  names.

An  interesting example I came across is stocks.com, which is

offered  for  sale for US$7.5 million.  So  people  are  just

registering names that do not belong to them and just selling

on the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question that a legal framework which

is  up  to date and able to cover the issues of the day  will

give  us  a  competitive edge in attracting  investments  and

businesses  done through our logistics and financial  system.

I  am  asking the Minister if he will highlight to the  House

some  of  the legislation and measures which we are reviewing

in  the light of these rapid changes, and our capability  and

ability to cope with the voluminous changes which are  taking

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another cut on conveyancing fees.

Presently, property transactions involve a transfer of  title

and  they  have  to  be transacted through  lawyers.   Hence,

buyers  and sellers of properties have no choice.   In  other

words, they have to use the legal services, unlike selling of

cars.   Since  consumers have no choice,  they  have  to  pay

conveyancing  fees  on the transactions.  Presently,  in  our

system,  there  is a statutory scale and this increases  with

the value of the property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are liberalising the fee structure in most

other areas of businesses, from stock broking to architecture

professional  fees, for example, it is timely to  review  why

there  should be a fixed scale for conveyancing fees.   I  am

asking   the   Minister  if  he  will  move   to   liberalise

conveyancing  fees  and  leave such  fees  to  be  negotiated

between the lawyer and his clients.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the Trustees' Act which was

modelled   after   its  British  counterpart,   the   Trustee

Investments  Act, was put in place to provide guidelines  for

the  management of public money and money under trust.  Since

then, those placed with the responsibility for investing such

money are required to comply with the various limits for  the

different asset classes, purportedly to minimise risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Act has served us well, we now need to

examine  its raison d'etre.  It is interesting to  note  that

the  United  Kingdom  will  be dispensing  with  the  Trustee

Investments  Act  this year, as it is outmoded  and  will  no

longer  serve  a  meaningful purpose.  The  widening  of  the

investible   horizon,  both  in  terms  of  instruments   and

geographical diversity, has rendered the Act restrictive,  if

not  counter-productive,  to what  was  originally  intended.

There  is  a  shift  in  focus from a  rule-based  system  to

prudence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing a similar situation here, in the form

of  an  increasing variety of instruments, beyond  pure  time

deposits  and primary equities.  Although modifications  have

been made to accommodate some of these developments, the  Act

is still restrictive from the perspective of trying to manage

risk through diversification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Trustees Act is still largely Singapore-centric, something which will check geographical

diversification.   The recent crisis has shown  that  a  bias

towards  either certain asset classes or certain economy,  in

this  case  Singapore,  does not make for  satisfactory  risk

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the ideal scenario is for investors to

diversify their portfolios to maximise risk-adjusted  returns

instead of clinging on to the Trustees Act for a false  sense

of comfort and security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to explain whether the

Trustees  Act  is still relevant, given the circumstances  so

described.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, it is the pillar of

our Government that honesty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>

and integrity is maintained at all levels of Government.   To

this,  the  Government has set several systems of checks  and

balances.  It is also good financial policy and prudence that

there  is  transparency  in financial matters.   Transparency

involves  an  open and visible manner of making decisions  so

that the public organisation that one serves can benefit from

the best deal that the organisation can get.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have perused many legislation that have been

passed  by  this House in the past.  I am happy to note  that

many   of   these  legislation  contain  adequate  provisions

requiring  individual members of the responsible agencies  to

declare their interest in any matter considered by them.  For

example,  members of the Boards of HDB, EDB  and  JTC,  among

other Government organisations, are required to declare their

interest  and  not  participate  in  any  decision  that  may

conflict with their personal or professional business.   This

is  one  of  the symbols and cornerstones of our  transparent

system of governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those legislation that one finds the provision

requiring declaration of interest, it is usually found in the

main Act itself, or in the Schedule to the Act.  Perhaps, the

agencies  that I have highlighted above deal with  big  money

and hence the legislative safeguards to protect public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also noted that there are other legislation

where there is no requirement for declaration of interest  in

the main Act, or in the Schedule to the Act,  for example, in

the  Administration of Muslim Law Act,  the Hindu  Endowments

Board  Act,  the  Nanyang Polytechnic  Act  and  the  Nanyang

University Act, among others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising the concern as some of these bodies

that  are created by a statute of Parliament are not  audited

by  the  Auditor-General.  They are in some cases audited  by

private  auditors.   In the absence of clear  law  stating  a

requirement that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>

persons  serving  in these bodies declare their  personal  or

professional interest, one can participate in a decision that

involves  such interest and get away with it.   When  caught,

some may even argue that there is no such requirement in  law

or that they were unaware of this requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of these organisations have large funds and,

in  many cases, funds are raised from the public.  It will be

prudent to place safeguards before a serious incident arises.

I  would  like  to urge the Minister to review  all  existing

legislation and see whether there are Acts which need  to  be

strengthened with the addition of the disclosure of  interest

clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to compliment the Minister and

the  Attorney-General's Chambers for introducing such clauses

in all new legislation that have come before this House.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next topic, Sir, which is the

management of State land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office is the custodian of State land. By

virtue  of  their  special position,  they  have  become  the

biggest  landlord in Singapore.  I understand that  the  Land

Office  releases  its  land to the market  according  to  the

Government  sales programme and the needs of the  Government.

The  buildings of the Land Office are managed  by  a  private

real  estate  firm.  This is good and prudent  management  of

state assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, we have to ensure that

land  that is owned by the State is well-managed and used  to

its  maximum.  Being a sportsman, I know that there are  many

sportsmen  who find it difficult to book football  or  hockey

fields, particularly at weekends.  It saddens me to see young

boys  playing at void decks and even at linked buildings just

because  they  have nowhere else to play football.   In  some

instances,  many  of  our youths end up playing  football  or

sepak  takraw in basketball courts or in carparks.   In  some

private estates, boys even play football on the roads.  There

is  definitely a big shortage of land in Singapore for  open-air

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>

sports, particularly in the HDB heartland and in Singapore in

general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall an incident in my division where there was a

large  plot  of  land  waiting to be  developed  as  a  park.

Noticing the absence of good football fields, I arranged  for

two  football  goal-posts to be placed  on  the  field.  Soon

thereafter,  I  noticed  that the field  became  a  hive  for

football  activities in the evenings and on  weekends.   Then

suddenly,  one  day, the goal-posts were torn down  and  left

there.  On enquiry, I discovered that the land owner, who  is

a  statutory board, not the Land Office, had removed it as no

written  permission  was  obtained  from  them.  Fortunately,

subsequently,   written  permission  was  obtained   and   my

residents are back to playing football on the same field  but

with  a  new  set  of  goal-posts.  I  am  highlighting  this

incident to show that it requires an MP to get this field for

his residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many parcels of State land which are

sitting idle and waiting to be sold later at Government sales

programme. Some may not even be considered for sale for  many

years to come.  The public is afraid of using such land.   It

is not unusual to see signboards being put up stating that it

is  State  land  and  that there can be no  trespassing.   At

times,  there  are even signs stating that no  games  can  be

played on such land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Minister to see how we can

make  better use of public vacant land.  I would like to urge

the  Minister  to  consider ways to make them  available  for

public  use,  be they for sports or other social  activities.

The  Land  Office can be pro-active by putting up  signboards

stating  that  games can be played or concerts  organised  on

such land. The Land Office can also take the lead in ensuring

that idle land is well-used for public purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other landowners like Ministries, statutory

boards and GLCs, they can also take the lead in ensuring that

their  idle  land  can  be used for public  purposes  by  the

public.   Such   action  may  even  motivate  large   private

landowners  to  open  up their land for  public  use  pending

future development.  Such action will certainly be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>

welcomed by the public and help minimise the lost opportunity

cost of not fully utilising such vacant land.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the freehold

apartments  of  two groups of my constituents  were  acquired

towards  the end of 1998 for road widening purpose.   One  of

them was the Elling Court at the junction of Bartley Road and

Paya  Lebar  Road, and the other was along Upper  Paya  Lebar

Road.   The  property  market was  in  a  slump  due  to  the

financial  crisis  at  that  time.   The  owners  were   paid

compensation at market rate at that point of time as assessed

by  the  Chief Assessor of the Land Office.  For  a  freehold

apartment,  they  were given statutory awards,  ranging  from

$240,000  to $300,000 which was not even enough for  some  of

them to purchase an alternative 4-room resale HDB flat in the

open  market. Some appealed for direct purchase of HDB  flats

from HDB but their appeals were turned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the property market rebounded and property

prices  recovered much of their lost ground.   Some  affected

owner occupiers were subsequently given ex-gratia payment  to

top  up  the  statutory awards to make the total compensation

marginally better. Those who had a second property  were  not

qualified for ex-gratia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected owners compared their fate with those affected

by  the  Selective  En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme.  They  felt

strongly  that  they were unfairly treated. Some  who  bought

their  properties at the height of the market had seen  their

CPF  savings diminished and have difficulties repaying  their

bank loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government could have been more generous

in  making  ex-gratia  payments for the  affected  residents,

considering the fact that those citizens affected by SERS are

so  well-treated, where they are not only given a  brand  new

flat  of  equivalent size, but also a good sum of disturbance

allowance.  In the case of private property owners,  some  of

them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>

who  are  retirees are not even allowed to  purchase  a  flat

direct from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there could be a more equitable way of

compensation.  Currently, the compensation is  based  on  the

assessed  market  value  of the properties  at  the  date  of

acquisition or 1st January 1995, whichever is lower.  In this

particular  case, instead of taking the lowest point,  is  it

more  equitable to take the average from the year  1995  when

the  compensation  rate  was last  revised  to  the  time  of

acquisition?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the Government is the

single  largest  land owner in Singapore and  has  many  land

parcels  reserved  for  future  developments.  Although   the

Ministry has made efforts to allow temporary usage of  vacant

reserve land, more can be done to maximise the use of  vacant

reserve land for community and commercial purposes.   I  wish

to seek the following clarifications from the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the percentage of vacant reserve land

being let out on TOL over the last five years? Secondly,  can

the  Ministry  consider allowing grassroots organisations  to

build temporary communal facilities or use these vacant  land

parcels  at  a  preferential  rate?  Thirdly,  what  are  the

measures  taken  by  the Ministry to maximise  the  temporary

usage   of  vacant  reserve  land?  Fourthly,  what  is   the

maintenance policy and cost of maintaining the vacant reserve

land?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to

highlight an aspect of legal aid in Singapore today and  urge

the Minister for Law to look into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Aid and Advice Act is essentially an Act which

seeks  to  render aid to Singaporeans and permanent residents

in  financial need.  Applicants for legal aid have to qualify

under  a  means  test which, in my opinion, is stringent  and

does  not  truly reflect cost of living and salary scales  in

this present time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 8 of the Act, legal aid may be granted

where the Director is satisfied that the criteria, as set out

in the Second Schedule, are met.  The applicant must not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>

have  a  disposable income of $7,000 per year and  disposable

capital  of  $7,000. "Disposable income" for the purposes  of

the  Act  includes that of the applicant's spouse.  Thus,  an

applicant  must  not earn more than $583  a  month  and  this

excludes   the   spouse's  income.  Sir,  this   is   totally

unrealistic, as even certain lowly jobs easily pay more  than

that.  It is too stringent a means test because a family with

two  children and a combined income of, say, $1,000 will  not

be  able to cope financially when even a simple case  in  the

Magistrate's court can easily cost $10,000 in terms of  legal

fees.  In fact, the Director has an unfettered discretion  to

refuse  legal aid even if the applicant qualifies  under  the

means  test. This is reflected in section 8(3) of  the  Legal

Aid and Advice Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14(3) enables the Court to direct the applicant

to pay the costs of the Director, the solicitor and the other

party's  solicitor if the Court feels that the  aided  person

has  acted  improperly  in bringing or  defending  any  legal

proceedings or in the conduct of them.  My view is that  this

is  unfair and punitive. Before the Legal Aid Bureau takes on

a  case,  the  Director will assess the facts to see  whether

such a case is worth defending or litigating in.  It does not

appear equitable to punish the aided person who relies on the

legal  advice  and judgement of the Director  and  Legal  Aid

Bureau's solicitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who are unable to afford lawyers

and  who  are  not  qualified for legal  aid.  Sir,  this  is

unfortunate and the situation can be redressed if  the  means

test  is  made less stringent.  In countries like the  United

States, people are not prejudiced because the legal mechanism

works  on  a  contingency-based system.  In other words,  the

lawyers get a percentage of the "winnings" and expect nothing

if  they  lose. We do not have such a system here  or  it  is

illegal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Law will address this

issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our judiciary has been proclaimed as

one of the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>

judicial systems in the world. People are by and large  happy

that the legal process is expeditious and fair.  However,  it

has  become  clear that increasingly, people are  complaining

that  legal  costs are rising in Singapore.  I  am  not  sure

whether this is due to the cost of our court fees or lawyers'

fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a number of my residents during my meet-the-people sessions who have come to see me both on criminal and

civil  matters  affecting  them.   A  number  of  them   have

highlighted that they cannot afford to engage private lawyers

due  to  their fees.  I have referred some to the  Legal  Aid

Bureau  and some others to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme  run

by  the Law Society of Singapore.  The two bodies that I have

highlighted  have  done an excellent job in  providing  legal

services for free or for a nominal fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt of cases where some of these

residents  come outside the means test set by the  Legal  Aid

Bureau  and,  as  such,  were  not  granted  legal  aid.    I

understand  that the present means test is set at $7,000  per

annum.   In divorce cases, I am told that only the income  of

the individual who is coming for legal aid is looked at.   In

any  other case, the income of the whole family is looked at,

that is, if it exceeds $7,000 per annum, they do not qualify.

I  think that the amount that is laid down for the means test

is  low  and  I  share  the  concern  expressed  by  my  hon.

colleague,  Dr Lily Neo, and I hope and urge the Minister  to

consider  raising the means test level that has been  set  in

the  Act itself and see how that amount can be raised so that

more  Singapore residents, particularly those who  come  from

the lower income bracket, can be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Law Society of Singapore has done an

excellent  community service in providing criminal legal  aid

to  needy Singaporeans. The scheme has been in place for many

years, in fact, since 1985.  Unlike many other countries, our

State  does  not provide criminal legal aid to  Singaporeans.

The provision which was there in the Legal Aid and Advice Act

to provide for criminal legal aid has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>

removed.   The  number clearly shows that the Criminal  Legal

Aid  Scheme has benefited many Singaporeans. The scheme  that

is  run  by  the Law Society has 403 volunteers and  for  the

period  1985 to 1999, 5,752 applicants applied for legal  aid

under  the  Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and 1,318 were  granted

criminal  legal  aid.  Some  of  these  people  who  received

criminal  legal  aid  were acquitted.  Some  have  had  their

charges  withdrawn or reduced. This clearly  establishes  the

necessity  of  providing  for criminal  legal  aid  to  needy

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is fruitful to pursue the argument

that  the  State should provide and administer  the  Criminal

Legal Aid Scheme.  What I would like to urge the Minister  is

whether  he  could consider granting an annual grant  to  the

Criminal  Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) run by the Law Society,  so

as  to  enable  them  to expand their system  to  more  needy

Singaporeans.   I personally know that the Minister  has,  in

his  personal capacity, put in great efforts to  raise  funds

for  the Law Society's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and that  is

something commendable. But it equally shows that the cause is

a  good cause.  I am not asking for a 100% grant for the CLAS

scheme.   Perhaps, the Minister could consider  approving  an

annual  grant to cover at least 50% of the cost of  the  CLAS

scheme  so as to enable criminal legal aid to be extended  to

more needy Singaporeans.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, over the last five years, this House

has  passed a total of 191 Bills.  This works out to be about

<br><br>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills  per year.  In a fast-changing world,  we  have  no

choice but to constantly update and introduce new legislation

to  govern the country.  But we need to understand the impact

of  the  speed of introducing this legislation on the general

public and the business community.  Although the conventional

methods   of  gazetting,  publication  of  the  Hansard   and

newspaper  reporting are utilised to disseminate amended  and

new legislation, the level of awareness and understanding  by

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>

general public and business community may not be high.  As  a

result,  Singaporeans may be penalised for being ignorant  of

these   new   legislation  or  failing  to   understand   the

technicality of these new legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I wish to seek the following

clarifications from the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to keep

the public informed of any amended or new legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there a mechanism to monitor the effectiveness

of  the  above  measures to determine  the  level  of  public

awareness and understanding of amended or new legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the Ministry consider using IT as a tool to

disseminate future legislation?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I take

my two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, we enter an age when we

see  high  global  integration based on  science,  trade  and

industry,  and  the  transformation  of  national  industrial

societies  into  a transnational science-based  civilisation.

Many  of  our  lawyers who are used to High Street  practice,

doing  things  like conveyancing and personal injury  claims,

will have to refocus not only to so-called city practice  but

also  to  international or regional practice.  A  failure  to

upgrade one's knowledge or skills will lead to irrelevance in

the new setting.  The legal practitioner of yesteryear is  no

longer relevant today, nor will today's lawyer be relevant to

the practice of tomorrow if he or she does not make an effort

to upgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New technologies generate new problems that require

legal  expertise  to resolve.  New regional  trading  regimes

require adaptation to and familiarity with legal systems  and

laws that are not the same as ours.  There is also a need  to

know  foreign languages and cultures.  The liberalisation  of

services is also a push factor for our lawyers to consider.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal education in Singapore can no longer be seen as a

discrete   responsibility  of several  institutions   -   the

Faculty of Law, Board of Legal Education, Law Society or  the

Academy  of  Law.   It must be seen as a holistic  enterprise

with  the  first  primary or formal stage  being  the  degree

stage,  followed by a system of coordinated,  continuous  and

even  compulsory legal education throughout the working  life

of a lawyer.  Only in this way, can a lawyer of today prepare

for the practice of tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we train the global lawyer? It is easy to

state  that  the lawyer of tomorrow must not  only  have  the

necessary  thinking  skills, he  must  also  be  vocationally

relevant  and professionally functional.  But the  vocational

training  of  a lawyer is best done after he or she  has  had

several years of practice.  It involves acquiring good street

sense  and  business  acumen, as much  as  specialised  legal

knowledge  in  foreign  tax laws or international  commercial

codes.   I  would therefore like to ask the Minister  whether

his   Ministry  would,  first,  support  a  review  of  legal

education  as  a whole and, second, to examine seriously  the

need  for  continuing  legal  education  in  the  profession,

perhaps  as  a condition to practise.  Second,  even  as  the

demands  of  the transnational scientific civilisation  exert

themselves on lawyers, there is an even greater need for  our

young  lawyers  to  value not just a career  that  they  will

pursue but also the community that they operate in.  In  this

context,  one  of  the  best ways  to  impart  knowledge  and

understanding  of  the  community and  its  problems  to  law

students  is  through instituting a clinical legal  education

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a programme can achieve a number of objectives.

First, it would provide law students with an appreciation  of

real  life  problems and an opportunity for them to  practise

what  they  have  learnt  in law school.   Second,  it  would

heighten  their  understanding of society.   And,  third,  it

provides  them  with a sense of realism.  Finally,  it  would

hopefully  instill  in them a sense of civic  duty,  so  that

before they begin to practise law, before they begin

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>

to  earn their millions, they would be conscious of the  need

to provide legal services to all who come to seek their help,

not only to those who can afford to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask whether the Minister would

support such a scheme.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, my

colleague,  Minister of State Ho Peng Kee, and I will  answer

the  points raised by Members within the time allotted to us.

And  I  hope  if  any points are cut off by  the  guillotine,

Members will file questions at subsequent sittings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Chng Hee Kok asked about our ability to cope

with  the  legal  framework  in  order  to  keep  abreast  of

competitiveness and changes in the business world.  First, as

to  the procedure, let me say that we have established a  Law

Reform   Coordinating  Committee  chaired  by  the  Attorney-General, representatives from the Faculty of Law, Academy  of

Law,  Law  Society and representatives of various  Government

agencies.  The task of this Law Reform Coordinating Committee

is precisely to ensure that our legal system and our laws are

up  to  date, and whatever reforms are needed, they  will  be

undertaken.   The  Committee itself will not  be  the  agency

doing the reforms but it is, in fact, the coordinating agency

to ensure that what needs to be done will be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Attorney-General's Chambers has set up

a  dedicated Law Reform and Revision Division this year.   It

will  fulfil  a long-felt need for a full time dedicated  law

reform  outfit in Singapore.  The Attorney-General, in  fact,

will  be  sending  two  officers from  his  Chambers  to  the

Australian  Law  Reform Commission to pick  up  some  of  the

procedures and methods which are used in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for examples of how we have kept abreast. The

Member  would know that we have in fact passed some important

legislation.  For example, the legislation amending the Legal

Profession  Act had very much to do with fundamental  changes

to  our legal system and legal framework so that it would  be

able to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>

keep  in  tune  with the challenges ahead of us, particularly

the  provisions  on  incorporation of companies  as  well  as

allowing foreign law firms to form  joint ventures and formal

alliances  with local firms.  These are very important  steps

taken recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would also note that we have made important

amendments  to  our  bankruptcy  legislation,  precisely   to

support   the   Technopreneurship   21   initiative.    These

amendments  have  increased  the  threshold  for  bankruptcy,

raised  the debt level for discharge by the Official Assignee

and made it easier for bankrupts to do business and expedited

payments to creditors.  I think this reform to the bankruptcy

legislation is a very good example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred to the challenges posed by cyberspace crimes

and  challenges which they pose for copyrights  and  patents.

Here  again,  we  have made progress because we  amended  the

Copyright  Act  to  meet  these  challenges  posed   by   the

development  of new technology and the increasing  popularity

of electronic commerce.  We improved copyright protection and

enforcement  of measures for copyright owners in  cyberspace,

to  promote  the use of Internet by businesses, and  we  also

provided  greater  legal certainty for both copyright  owners

and   users   of   copyright  works,  not  to   mention   the

intermediaries such as network service providers.  We  had  a

full debate on this not long ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also restructured the Registry of Trade Marks

and   Patents  into  the  Intellectual  Property  Office   of

Singapore  (IPOS).  This is important to maintain Singapore's

competitive  edge,  and  IPOS will  move  away  from  just  a

regulatory  body.  It will ensure a sound infrastructure  for

the    development   of   intellectual   property   and   the

administration of protection of intellectual property rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have done a fair bit, but with the establishment

of the Law Reform Coordinating Committee, I expect that there

will  be  a more coordinated and focused approach to ensuring

that these needs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>

and  challenges  posed  by fast-changing  local  as  well  as

international environment will be met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about conveyancing fees and whether it is

timely  to review.  Members will recall that we last reviewed

the  conveyancing  scale  fees in 1995,  when  the  Committee

chaired by Mr Justice Chao Hick Tin made his recommendations.

At that time, the Committee had considered whether to abolish

scale  fees altogether, but had concluded that it was in  the

public interest to retain a mandatory fixed scale fees but we

had  changes  made to the scale fees.  I said that  we  would

review the matter in about 4-5 years' time.   My Ministry has

not  made  a decision yet on the precise changes to be  made,

but  the  Attorney-General and I agreed that it is timely  to

review this matter now, and we shall in due course set  up  a

committee to look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to which direction the review will take, I would

prefer  to  let  the committee look into this  and  make  its

recommendation.  But Mr Chng Hee Kok knows that I  have  said

several  times,  and  so has the Attorney-General,  that  the

legal   profession   should  prepare   themselves   for   the

eventuality that sooner or later the scale fees will have  to

be abolished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about the Trustees Act and the

changes  made  in  England and her  criticisms  on  what  she

thought  were  outmoded approaches of the  Trustees  Act  and

whether we would review it.  Let me say that we have referred

precisely  these  issues to the Law Reform Committee  of  the

Singapore   Academy   of  Law.   They   have   made   several

recommendations which we are studying with a view to amending

the  Act.  Although the changes have not been finalised,  let

me  say  that,  broadly, the recommendations  do  contemplate

allowing  a  trustee  to invest in any  form  of  investment,

provided   he   exercises  prudence  in   relation   to   the

investments,  probable  income, the capital  safety  and  the

suitability  for  the  trust, which is commonly  known  as  a

prudent man rule.  I think she referred to this.  They do not

recommend  a  complete abolition of the list  of  investments

currently found

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>

in  the First Schedule.  It is proposed that this list should

be   retained  to  serve  as  a  guidance  to  the  trustees,

particularly  non-professional trustees of small  and  family

trusts who could benefit from such guidance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the need for diversification of investments and

for   the   adoption   of   an   investment   strategy,   the

recommendation is that this be considered as part and  parcel

of  the  prudent man rule.  I will take her suggestions  into

account when we look at these recommendations with a view  to

amending the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran referred to the fact that some legislation

have  requirements  for declarations  of  interest  and  some

legislation do not.  We can look into this.  His point really

is  that  there should be avoidance of conflict of  interest,

with   which  we  cannot  disagree.   Why  is  it  that  some

legislation do not contain these provisions?  I am not  sure.

I  guess that those legislation generally are Acts of a  non-operational  statutory board such as institutions  of  higher

learning  where they might have thought that  the  danger  of

acting   in   conflict  of  interest  is   not   that   real.

Nevertheless, I take his point into account and we  will  ask

the  parent Ministries to have a look at it.  However,  I  am

not  sure  I  agree  with him that where the  legislation  is

silent, a member of a statutory board could profess ignorance

and profit from a conflict of interest.  This is because even

if  there is no specific provision in the Act, I believe  the

general  law  places fiduciary duty on members  of  statutory

boards so that if they were to abuse their fiduciary position

and  make secret profits, they will be obliged under the  law

to cough out those profits.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Ravindran talk about the Legal Aid

and  Advice  Act  and the stringency of the means  test.  The

means  test  was last reviewed in 1995 and the threshold  was

increased.  We not only increased the income ceiling  but  we

also  allowed more deductions.  I am prepared to look  at  it

again.   But  let  me  say  that the  Members  ought  not  to

misunderstand the provisions in the Act.  The requirement for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>

disposable  income  of less than $7,000 does  not  mean  that

legal aid will never be provided to applicants who earn  more

than $583 a month because in computing the disposable income,

various deductions are allowed, including deductions for CPF,

rental,  personal deductions and deductions  for  dependants.

Also,  in practice, the income of a spouse is disregarded  in

certain cases, such as where the parties are separated and if

it  is  reasonable  to do so to relieve hardship.   In  fact,

under  the  means test, a sole breadwinner with two  children

who  is earning $1,200 a month ought not to have problems  in

qualifying for legal aid.  In fact, on the average, about 80%

who  applied for legal aid in 1996 and 1997 qualified for it.

There  was a dip in 1998 and 1999 when this figure dipped  to

about  65%, but we think that was because of the sudden large

number  of applicants as a result of the hardship during  the

slowdown in the economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked by Dr Lily Neo about discretion to

refuse  legal  aid.  Let me say first that  this  is  not  an

unfettered discretion because under the Act the Director  can

refuse only if it is unreasonable to grant aid.  In practice,

the  Bureau  will take instructions from every applicant  who

qualifies to determine if there are merits for granting legal

aid.   Decisions  are not arbitrary and  they  are  based  on

careful   evaluation   of   the  facts   and   circumstances.

Obviously,  even if a person qualifies, the Board would  have

to  consider the merits of the case, for example, whether the

costs  involved in pursuing the case would be much more  than

the  amount claimed for.  If the amount claimed for is  $200,

but  the whole process will cost much more, that will be  one

of the considerations that we take into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the seemingly unfair punitive

provision  in  ordering costs against  aided  persons.   Here

again,  there  may  be a misunderstanding.   This  is  not  a

provision applied often and frequently across the board. This

is  to  take care of a very narrow situation where it may  be

found out later that the person who obtained legal advice  or

legal aid actually had acted improperly or even dishonestly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>

He  might have even told lies.  In that kind of situation, it

is  not equitable that a person be seen to have got off scot-free.   So  this is the narrow situation where costs  may  be

awarded against that person.  In fact, as far as I could find

out from the Legal Aid Bureau, they can recall only about two

or  so  instances when an aided person has been asked to  pay

cost under this provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned contingency fee. I am not sure whether

she  was  seriously  proposing that the  Government  consider

contingency  fee  like the United States.   That  will  be  a

fundamental change where it will change the nature of client-solicitor relationship.  Often it has been criticised that  a

lawyer  may become personally and emotionally involved  in  a

case  where his fees are dependent on whether he succeeds  or

not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about the Criminal Legal Aid System.

I  think  I  do not have to repeat the reasons given  when  I

amended  the Legal Aid and Advice Act.  I then spelt out  the

reasons  as  to  why Government will confine  itself  to  the

provision of civil legal aid. But I assured the House, and  I

have  assured  the  Law Society, that my Ministry  will  work

closely with them to support their Criminal Legal Aid System.

In  fact, if you ask the President of the Law Society he will

confirm that the Ministry and myself have worked with them to

raise funds to meet their requirements for the Criminal Legal

Aid  System, including a grant from the Academy  of  Law.   I

myself  have given them ideas and fund-raising projects  were

organised  where  I  was involved, and I believe  that  their

financial  situation has been met, and  I  will  continue  to

support their activity in that regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin raised the question of public education

for legislation.  Basically, he asked two questions:  One  is

making  legislation and policies of the legislation known  to

the  public.   His  point  is where  legislation  breaks  new

grounds,  important policies, people should be made aware  of

them.   I  think  we cannot dispute that.   It  goes  without

saying.  But I would say this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>

has  to  be left to the respective Ministries which are  most

knowledgeable  about the policies which they are  enunciating

or  promulgating  through legislation in  this  House.   Most

Ministries are aware of the need to do so.  If Dr Teo Ho  Pin

feels  that  the  publicity  or  public  education  from  any

particular  Ministry on any particular legislation  has  been

inadequate  he could take up the cudgels with the  respective

Minister.   But,  as a general principle, I support  what  he

says.  It is part of the process of preparing the public  and

explaining the rationale of legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point was whether we can use IT to

disseminate  legislation.  Indeed, we have been  doing  this.

The  Attorney-General's Chambers has  informed  me  that  the

LawNet  Management Committee has agreed to allow free  access

by members of the public to the LawNet statutes database from

terminals  located in the National Library and  its  branches

and  it  is working on the details with the National  Library

Board.   The  LawNet  statutes database  will  also  be  made

available  for  free  to  members  of  the  public   at   the

information  kiosks  in  the Supreme  Court  when  these  are

upgraded  to  be  Web  kiosks in  a  few  months'  time.   In

addition, the Member should know that the Subordinate  Courts

together  with the Law Society and the Ministry  of  Law  are

working on a website on the provision of legal information to

the  layman.  This website will act as a portal from which  a

member  of  the  public  can  be directed  to  the  different

websites  containing legal information about Singapore,  such

as  the  Law Awareness page or the Law Society's website  and

the  information leaflets page of the Subordinate  Courts  as

well  as  the  information page on the  websites  of  various

departments of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two minutes to deal with Prof. Chin's points.

First, I agree completely with him on the need for the  legal

profession  to  upgrade themselves to  stay  abreast  of  new

changes and techniques in law.  In fact, the President of the

Law  Society,  I  believe, in the Opening of the  Legal  Year

address,  said that there should be mandatory legal education

and that the Law Society will proceed robustly in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>

pursuing  this.  It is a point which I would support  and  we

would be happy to work with him to ensure that that becomes a

feature of our legal profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot also disagree with his idea that our legal

education  is  such  that  potential graduates,  before  they

graduate as law students, should be exposed to the real world

aspect of their practice of law.  How do we do this?  I think

the  Ministry  of  Law  and  the Attorney-General's  Chambers

should  discuss  with the Law Faculty.   One  aspect  is,  of

course,  attachment  to various law firms  and  institutions.

Some  countries go beyond this and allow the law students  to

engage  in clinical law practice under the supervision  of  a

practitioner.   To  do  that is a little complicated  because

they have to make sure that it does not run foul of the Legal

Profession  Act  and  it  raises  questions  of  professional

liability  and responsibility.  Will the student,  before  he

graduates,  be  actually signing documents and giving  advice

which  he acted on, or will it be the responsibility  of  the

lawyer  under  whom  he works and under whom  he  supervises?

These  are  some  technical questions which  have  some  far-reaching implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have touched most of the points raised by

colleagues.  I will now ask my colleague, Prof. Ho,  to  deal

with the remaining issues.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will deal with Mr Goh Choon Kang's amendment

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang suggests an alternative method of

calculating  land acquisition compensation.   First,  let  me

state,  at  the  outset,  that the Government  only  acquires

private lands when absolutely necessary.  It is committed  to

paying a reasonable compensation to landowners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition Act is amended from time to time to

ensure  that the compensation rates keep up with the  market,

especially when prices rise.  The current date is 1st January

1995, which in fact is higher than the 1998 and 1999 property

prices of most sectors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate individual owners' financial hardship,

Government initiated an ex-gratia payment scheme in 1982, the

scope  of which has been widened progressively over the  past

18  years.  Let me illustrate how the scheme works under both

good and poor market conditions.  When a property is acquired

at  a  time  when  property prices are  high,  the  statutory

compensation, though pegged at 1st January 1995  prices,  can

be  topped  up  to  current  market value  through  ex-gratia

payments,  if owners meet eligibility criteria, such  as  the

property being owner-occupied.  Indeed, we have widened  this

to  even include owners who own more than one property.  When

a  property  is  acquired under poor market  conditions,  the

compensation,  though correspondingly lower, would  generally

be sufficient to cover the costs of an alternative comparable

property,  as property prices will be depressed.  Even  then,

in  such  a  situation, if the owners suffer  hardship  after

receiving  compensation, ex-gratia payments are  extended  to

them  on a case-by-case basis.  Indeed, many landowners, some

of whom were Mr Goh's constituents, have benefitted from this

ex-gratia  scheme which was widened to include the situation,

as  has  happened to his constituents, where the compensation

amount  was pegged at the actual market rate. So this  is  an

extension of the original concept of ex-gratia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach of combining statutory compensation and ex-gratia payment has worked well in the overwhelming majority

of  cases.  There is no compelling reason to change it to the

scheme  proposed  by  Mr  Goh.  The Member's  proposal  which

involves  averaging out property values over the  five  years

preceding  the  acquisition, and paying that  amount  without

regard  to the market value at the date of Gazette, does  not

give  certainty to the compensation quantum, and  indeed  may

result  in either windfall gains for some owners or financial

hardship for others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because if the average value results in a

compensation that is lower than prevailing market values, the

affected  landowners will be priced out in their purchase  of

an alternative comparable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>

property  in  the  open market.  On the other  hand,  if  the

average  value results in a compensation that is higher  than

prevailing  market  values, affected  landowners  will  enjoy

unwarranted windfall gains at the expense of the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, all things considered, the current approach,

which  is  a tested one, has worked well, and should  remain.

But,  of  course,  Government will  continue  to  review  the

statutory  date  for compensation under the Land  Acquisition

Act,  and  certainly give ex-gratia payments where applicable

to hardship cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other two cuts are by Mr Ravindran and Dr Teo.

Let  me  take their points.  First, let me assure the Members

that it has always been Land Office's policy and practice  to

optimise  the  use  of  our  scarce  land  resource.   Hence,

whenever  and  wherever  State lands are  available,  and  if

supported by the Chief Planner, for interim uses, Land Office

allocates  them  to  both private and  public  organisations,

including  community  organisations,  for  their  use.    For

example, in 1998, Land Office allocated four sites to various

Citizens'  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  for  interim  uses

such  as  street  soccer court, basketball and  sepak  takraw

courts and a hardcourt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for measures taken to maximise the interim use of

state  land  and  maintaining them,  Land  Office  set  up  a

Planning  and Development Unit in 1998 to take stock  of  the

state  land available and systematically plan for the interim

uses  with  the relevant authorities, if the state lands  are

not immediately required for development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head E - Judicature. Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head E of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a subject which I have brought up several

times  in this House.  At the moment, in Singapore,  for  all

purposes,  there  is only a single right  of  appeal  from  a

conviction  sustained  in the Subordinate  Court.   It  is  a

single-tier  appeal.   And similarly, when  a  conviction  is

sustained in the High Court, there is a single tier appeal to

the  Court of Criminal Appeal.  I have said that this is  not

very  satisfactory.  There have been instances in  the  past,

and of course there was my case, where they have been refused

right of appeal.  Somehow I was able to take it up in another

related  appeal to the Privy Council where they said all  the

convictions were wrong.  But it is not to complain  about  my

matter that I have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about the situation where an accused

person  has  been  acquitted  by  the  trial  court  in   the

Subordinate Courts and the Public Prosecutor appeals  against

that acquittal.  The High Court decides in its wisdom to  set

aside the acquittal and substitute a conviction of the man or

woman.  In that instance, unless the Appellate Court, hearing

the   appeal  by  the  Public  Prosecutor,  agrees  to  state

questions  of  law  to  the  Court of  Criminal  Appeal,  the

unfortunate man or woman is left with no right of  appeal  at

all.   He  is convicted after he has been acquitted, after  a

full trial on the merits by a Judge of the court and then  he

is  convicted,  and  he is left with no  redress.   This  has

happened  at least in two cases or more that I can  remember,

and  it is a most unsatisfactory system.  It denies the basic

right  of an individual to have his conviction tested  by  an

Appellate  Court.   I have said that in  a  number  of  other

countries, particularly the Commonwealth

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>

countries, the prevailing norm is a two-tier appeal.  In  our

country,  it is just one-tier, but there are these situations

where  even  this one appeal is denied.  In other  countries,

the  Public  Prosecutor  has no right  of  appeal  where  the

acquittal is on merit but in Singapore, the Public Prosecutor

can  appeal where the acquittal goes simply on the merits and

not on any question of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time we looked at this right of appeal. I

personally would like a review of the whole appellate  system

in  Singapore,  even in the civil cases.  We  passed  a  Bill

quite  recently  denying appeals in  civil  cases  where  the

amount  of  the claim is $50,000 or less, but providing  that

the  person who is aggrieved may apply to the Judge who heard

the  case to grant leave.  May I say from personal experience

that  it  is extremely difficult to get leave from the  Judge

who  has  heard the case on the merits and who  is  satisfied

that  the  decision  is right.  It would  seem  to  be  going

against the grain to later say, yes, I think the decision may

be wrong, I will give you leave to appeal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, do you want to allow time

for a reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as Mr Jeyaretnam himself

says,  he  has made this point many times before and  I  have

replied  to  him  many times before.  All these  are  in  the

Hansard.   The situation has not changed.  The losing  party,

whether  the Public Prosecutor or the accused person,  indeed

has  a  right  of  appeal.   Regardless  of  which  party  is

appealing,  there is only one level of appeal, because  there

must be finality and the process stops there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me continue, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I clarify the point that I am

worried about?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Assoc. Prof. Ho, are you giving way?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Resume your seat, Mr Jeyaretnam. Please

continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So for a magistrate's appeal,

if  the  High  Court  overturns an acquittal  on  appeal  and

convicts  the accused person, there is no reason to  let  him

have  another bite of the cherry before the Court of  Appeal,

because  arguments  would already have been  fully  canvassed

before  the Appeal Judge, which, in Singapore, is  the  Chief

Justice  who hears all magistrates' appeals.  So we take  all

appeals  seriously.  And because CJ hears all these  appeals,

there  is  a  tone that is set - that appeals will  be  taken

seriously,  with consistency in sentencing and  also  in  the

judgments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the appeals process under section 60, Mr Jeyaretnam

is  wont to raise this all the time.  Section 60 is a process

whereby  if the Public Prosecutor considers that there  is  a

point of law of public interest which he wants to clarify for

future  guidance,  he  will ask  the  High  Court  to  set  a

reference to the Court of Appeal to decide the point of  law.

But even if he wins the reference or the reference is decided

in  his favour, the acquittal of the accused person will  not

be overturned.  So that is an important point.  Otherwise, he

will think that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The accused person is taking it up, not

the Public Prosecutor.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If the accused person takes

it  up,  then the law is quite clear what he has to  satisfy.

He  has to convince the Court that there is a point of law of

public  interest,  the resolution of which has  affected  the

outcome of the appeal, and the High Court has to consider the

application.   Even though it is the court that  decided  the

case  - I think we must give it to our Judges - Mr Jeyaretnam

will  not be fair if he says that because a particular  Judge

decided  the case, he will not want that point to  go  up  on

reference to the Court of Appeal, because he must justify it.

It is all in the records.  So people can look at it, read it,

other Judges can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>

look at it, academics can write on it.  So he will be exposed

to  ridicule if he does not comply with the requirements  set

out  in section 60 which incidentally is well-illustrated  in

our cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is "guillotine" time. Mr

Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am not satisfied at all. But,

nevertheless, I will withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $62,764,240 for Head E ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $53,554,500 for Head E ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head B -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head B - Attorney-General's Chambers. Mr

Shanmugam is not here.  Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head B of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question in this House is the propriety of the

Attorney-General's Chambers in withholding  from  an  accused

person  statements  taken from him in the  course  of  police

investigation.  The law is quite clear.  The law is that  any

statement taken from any person, whether it be an accused  or

a  witness, by a police officer above the rank of Sergeant is

admissible  at the trial.  Of course, if the accused  or  the

person making the statement says that it was obtained against

his will, it was an involuntary statement, then the court has

to  consider whether it should be admitted or not.   But  the

law is that it is admissible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite what the law is, the AG's Chambers has

consistently denied lawyers acting for the accused the  right

to  look  at  statements made by their clients during  police

investigation, particularly statements under section  121  of

the  Criminal Procedure Code.  This is where the Police spend

hours questioning the man and then taking his long statement,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>

as  they call it.  The prosecution keeps that statement.   If

they  wish  to  use  it, then they make it available  to  the

accused  just before the trial.  But if they do not  wish  to

use  it because that statement does not help them, but it may

help  the  accused, they refuse to release it to the accused.

That  seems to me, without any doubt, to offend the  rule  of

natural  justice.  It denies to the accused evidence that  is

in  his favour which he can use.  Of course, I shall be  told

by  the Minister of State - I see he is going to reply - that

yes,  we  do  release it, but it is only released  after  the

accused  has given his evidence.  And they make no secret  of

it.   They say they want it because they want to see  whether

they  can  trip  him up when he gives his  evidence,  to  see

whether he has said something differently in the statement to

the  police.   That seems to me to be taking a  very  unfair,

unjust  advantage over an accused person, and that is  coming

from the prosecution chambers in this country.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say to this House, which I have said to the court

several times, that it is no duty, no part of the prosecution

to  win  its cases.  This has been said over and over  again.

The prosecution owes to the accused to be fair and just.   It

has  the duty to see that the accused gets the fairest trial,

not  trying  to  obtain a conviction by means of  withholding

statements which might be able to assist him.  May I quote to

this  House  what a very learned prosecutor  in  England,  Mr

Christmas  Humphreys, a devout Buddhist, said in one  of  his

public  lectures that one of the first things he did when  he

was  assigned a case to prosecute was to ring up the  defence

counsel,  counsel for the accused and say, "Is there anything

I  can do to assist you?  You want any information, you  want

to  know  anything?"   That  is  how  prosecution  should  be

conducted.    Prosecution  should   not   be   conducted   by

withholding information and evidence that might be useful  to

the accused and then springing it on him.  That is simply not

being  fair  to an accused person.  So I would ask  that  the

Attorney-General  be  told  that they  should  consider  this

practice because the law is that it is admissible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked the courts over and over again to rule,

but  the courts have said, "We cannot, because it is for  the

Attorney-General's Chambers.  We wouldn't rule against that."

There  was an observation by Justice Rajendran some time  ago

when  he  took the prosecution to task for not releasing  the

statement made by an accused when the defence asked  for  it.

His  words  were,  "Do you realise that you  are  suppressing

evidence?"   So  that is the position.  May I  ask  that  the

Attorney-General's  Chambers  be  asked  to  give  this  real

consideration  and  see  that they  do  not  try  and  obtain

convictions by any unfair means.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in his usual grain, Mr

Jeyaretnam wants to shift the balance more in favour  of  the

accused.   That is his enduring theme all these years.   Sir,

first, let me say that, in Singapore, accused persons do  not

have a right to copies of statements made to the police apart

from   the   first  information  report  and  the   cautioned

statements they themselves have made to the police.  That  is

a matter of practice which has been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite different from the question of

admissibility.  Admissibility goes to whether a statement can

be  admitted in court.  Here, we are talking about whether an

accused  person is entitled to have a certain statement  that

he  has made.  So that is the first point.  Indeed, there  is

no  provision  in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)  for  the

automatic  disclosure by the accused persons of documents  in

the possession of the prosecution.  There is clause 58(1)  of

the  CPC.   But  this is only where the accused  is  able  to

satisfy the court that the document is necessary or desirable

for the conduct of his trial that he may be able to obtain  a

copy of the statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also remind Mr Jeyaretnam that, in

prosecuting  a  case, the Attorney-General's Chambers,  first

and  foremost, seeks to protect the public interest, not just

to  win cases.  There is a much wider stake that is at issue.

Also, let me remind him that every society must find its  own

balance  between  how  to protect this  public  interest  and

ensuring that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>

accused  has a fair trial.  And the system that  we  have  in

Singapore is a system that is open for all to see, for all to

critique.   The  legal system and all the  processes  in  the

system  are  part  of the criminal justice  system  that  has

received  high praise, not from Singaporeans alone, not  from

PAP backbenchers, but from objective ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> From business enterprise.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Not true, because the latest

poll  by  the  Subordinate Courts polled  not  just  business

people, but Singaporeans.  1,500 Singaporeans were polled and

they expressed full confidence in the fair administration  of

justice.   Other  polls  were  also  conducted.   The   legal

administration in Singapore has also come for high mention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in some countries, the pendulum has swung too

much  the  other  way.   We do not want  that  to  happen  in

Singapore.   For  example,  in  UK,  the  Criminal  Procedure

Investigating Act was enacted in 1996 in part to address  the

imbalance that existed before then, ie, too much in favour of

the  prosecution.  Therefore, remedial steps were taken.   So

let us not go down that path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam knows that, in a criminal trial, in order

to  succeed,  the  prosecution has to prove its  case  beyond

reasonable  doubt.  And this is already a high burden,  which

is  placed  on  the prosecution.  Like I said just  now,  any

trial  is  to uncover the truth, not to trip anyone  up.   So

even if the prosecution does tender the long statement of the

accused during trial, it is not to trip the accused up.   But

it  is  to  uncover the truth, that is, the prosecution  must

impeach   the  witness'  credibility  because  he  has   said

something  which  does not match with the  statement  he  has

given  to  the police.  I think it is beholden on the  Public

Prosecutor  who  seeks the truth and justice to  tender  that

statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current practice on the furnishing of police

statements  to the accused person is already a balanced  one.

In fact, it is evolving over time.  For example, I understand

the  pre-trial  conferences  (PTC)  have  introduced  greater

openness to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>

process.  So during the PTC, the court will generally attempt

to  identify  the disputed issues for trial  and  this  would

include  the  disclosure  of the accused  statements  if  the

prosecution indicates that it intends ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I seek clarification?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I want to finish my speech.

He has taken his full 10 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister is making statements

without having attended any trial conferences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can you return to

your seat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, please continue.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this will include the

disclosure  of  the accused's statements if  the  prosecution

indicates  that he intends to rely on those statements.   But

of  course,  the  PTC judge cannot compel the prosecution  to

disclose  statements in its possession unless the defence  is

able  to show the legal right to it.  So that process in fact

helps also to balance the picture between the prosecution and

the accused person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the courts are also developing

jurisprudence  in this area.  I am sure Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a

practitioner,  must  know the case of  Ronnie  Tay  v  Public

Prosecutor  where  the  Chief Justice said,  in  allowing  an

accused  person's  appeal, that an  accused  person's  police

statement,  even  if not used in the trial,  should  be  made

available  to  the  defence once all defence  witnesses  have

finished giving evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a criminal trial, the prosecution will make

available  certain documents to the accused.  These  are  the

charge, the initial police report concerning the offence, the

accused person's cautioned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>

statement  under  section  122(6) and  indeed,  even  medical

reports,  and such other reports which the prosecution  would

be  seeking  to adduce under section 369(2) of  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code.   All this includes scientific  reports  and

other  reports.  These documents will give the accused person

a  clear  idea of the case which the prosecution has  against

him.   I  think  this is an important point because,  justice

dictates  that a person who has to answer a charge must  know

what  he is charged for.  Hence, these facts which are stated

in  these  various reports will enable him  and  the  defence

counsel,  like  Mr Jeyaretnam, to prepare the defence.   They

are sufficient for the accused to prepare his defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other statements or documents made by the accused

that the prosecution intends to make use of during the trial,

copies of these will be served on the defence.  That again is

fair  because I understand that it is usually served  at  the

pre-trial  conference stage.  These are documents  which  the

prosecution intends to make use of during the trial.  We  are

not  talking about situations where, as I said just  now,  in

the course of the trial, the prosecution adduces evidence  by

producing  the accused's long statement.  That  is  different

because  that  is a situation where the prosecution  did  not

intend to make use of the statement during the trial.  But in

the  course of the trial, because of what the accused  person

said,  which shows him up, that he is not telling the  truth,

the   prosecution,   in  order  to  impeach   the   accused's

credibility,  will then furnish the statement  in  court  and

adduce it in evidence.  By having these other documents which

are given to him, the accused person knows what evidence will

be adduced against him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that if the prosecution does not

intend to make use of the long statements, yes, these are not

furnished to the accused.  This is to avoid the risks that  a

guilty  person would be given the means to tailor his defence

to deceive the court and to do it in a way that is consistent

with  the  statements  he made to the police,  thus  avoiding

detection.  The point which is important to note is that  the

withholding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>

of  a  long statement would not adversely affect an  innocent

accused  person  who consistently tells the  truth  at  every

stage  of  the process.  In other words, if you are innocent,

there  is nothing to fear because you are telling the  truth.

When police is investigating you, you will tell your account,

you  will tell the truth.  So when you are preparing for  the

trial with the defence lawyer, you will tell the truth.   And

at   trial,  whether  under  examination-in-chief  or  cross-examination,  you  will  tell the truth.   But  if  a  guilty

accused has sight of his long statement, in preparing for his

defence,  I am not saying the defence counsel will  go  along

with  that, the accused may decide to tailor his defence,  or

tailor his story for the defence counsel --

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Defend the truth.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If that is the truth, then he

does not need to look at what he has written because that  is

the  truth.  The truth cannot vary.  The truth is the  truth.

So  the  law  evolves.  If there is no risk  of  the  accused

tailoring  his  defence according to the  statements  he  has

previously  given  to the police, and this  is  the  case  of

Ronnie  Tay,  then  the  High Court says  that  there  is  no

objection to disclosing the police statements to the accused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is this. The interest of justice is

served  by ensuring that the truth emerges during the  trial,

not  by  enabling  a  guilty person to escape  punishment  by

looking  at  his long statement and having the  time  in  the

comfort  of his office, or elsewhere, to think of  a  defence

that is consistent with the long statement so that he has  an

advantage. So long as an accused person, as I have said  just

now,  tells  the truth at every stage to the police,  to  the

courts,  he has no need to fear about not being able  to  see

his own police statements before he gives evidence.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this cut, I wish to ask for an update

from  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  on  the  status  of   the

Government's  plan to encourage the merger  of  local  banks.

The Government has announced that eventually there should  be

only two large banks in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is that currently,

there is no evidence of any deliberate move by local banks to

work towards some form of merger.  Banks have appointed their

Nominating  Committees, but nothing much  else  seems  to  be

done.   I would also like to take this opportunity to  better

understand  what  are  the benefits of having  fewer,  though

larger  local banks.  I would like to know why the conclusion

that  Singapore  can  only  support  two  local  banks.   The

question  on  people's mind is which two, and why  only  two.

Why  not  three, why not more?  Is there a target time-frame?

Is  the pace of change going at a rate that the Government is

satisfied with?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I wish to pose is that if there are

eventually  to  be  only  two local  banks,  would  there  be

adequate  service and attention given to the small  companies

and  the  small individuals. Large banks tend to  favour  and

service  large customers. Who is there to service  the  local

customers and the small man-in-the street?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to pose on the banking system

is that, with the advent of e-banking that is, banking on the

Internet,  how would Government regulate this sector?   Would

the usual rules of MAS be applicable for banks, some of which

may  not  even  be  necessarily regulated  by  our  Singapore

authorities operating through the Internet?  Can such banking

practices  and transactions be adequately controlled  by  the

authorities? How can e-banks be regulated so as  to  preserve

the integrity of our banking system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next cut on mergers and

acquisitions (M&As).  In his Budget speech, the Minister  has

mentioned that previously, if an M&A involves the transfer of

less  than 90% of a company's shares, or if the consideration

is  made  in cash, the exercise would not qualify  for  stamp

duty  relief  under section 15 of the Stamp Duties  Act.   To

encourage more M&As, the Minister has decided that these  two

conditions  be lifted and the qualifying limit for  the  main

holding company be reduced to 75%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to laud the Minister for initiating this

move  to encourage more M&As in Singapore.  However, I  would

like  to  suggest that the qualifying limit  can  be  lowered

further to, say, even as low as 51%.  Here, I wish to declare

that  I  am  a  Director of a company and I  am  making  such

suggestions for the general public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many local companies, especially SMEs,

where it would be extremely beneficial to encourage more M&As

amongst  these local companies.  This will enable the smaller

SMEs to merge and create more bulk.  In the process, they can

achieve better economies of scale, streamline operations, and

attain  cost  savings. As companies merge,  it  would  become

increasingly difficult for the main acquiror company to  hold

75%  or  more  of  the combined entity.  There  is  also  the

deterrent  that  the owners of the shares or  assets  of  the

company  being  acquired may be subject  to  heavy  taxes  on

profits deemed to be realised.  In some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>

of  these  cases, there are no actual cash transactions,  but

just an exchange of shares.  Therefore, paying the tax on the

gain will become a great deterrent to the entire transaction,

especially when there is no cash involved but only just paper

gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, since there is a very beneficial effect to

encourage  more  M&As of local companies,  I  would  like  to

suggest  to  the Finance Minister that the local tax  regime,

ie,  the  Stamp  Duties  Act and the  financial  regulations,

should be reviewed to ensure that there will be more M&As  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, recently, there was anecdotal

evidence  of  excessive consumer spending arising  from  easy

credit,  which  led  to bankruptcy for those  who  could  not

curtail their credit card spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the credit card has long been around, and the

dangers of easy access to credit known to issuing banks,  the

advent  of  electronic finance has added yet more convenience

to   securing   consumer  credit  on  two  fronts.   Firstly,

electronic  retailing  or  e-tailing  through  the   Internet

provides   even   more   choices  for   the   consumer,   and

correspondingly,  more  temptation  for  excessive  spending.

Every  transaction  is  only  a mouse-click  away.  Secondly,

Internet  banking is likely to lead to an increase in  demand

for  consumer  credit on-line.  Unless credit information  is

shared readily between banks, the consumer may soon find more

credit at his disposal than desirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This highlights the challenge of curbing excessive

consumer credit via electronic access.  I would like  to  ask

what is the Government's philosophy and approach towards this

potentially tricky problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, intensifying competition in cyberspace

may  mean  a more timely extension of other types of  credit,

beyond  the  more straightforward security-backed  mortgages.

Correspondingly,  credit  risk  management   by   banks   and

financial institutions may eventually lag approvals or credit

extension.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent is obviously an issue, for should there be a

severe  economic  downturn, there would be a huge  multiplier

effect  stemming from an unwitting over-assumption  of  risk.

Can  the Minister explain what measures would be in place  to

build  up  overall  credit  risk management  capabilities  in

tandem with rising demand for timely, on-line credit?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the suspension

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, from the economic

statistics,  we  saw that, though the rest  of  the  business

sectors  improved  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  last   year,

performance  by  small firms actually deteriorated.   A  sub-index  of sales by small companies was minus 52%, as compared

with the plus 35% reported by larger firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members of this House have brought up the

difficulties faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  I

will not labour on these points except to say that Government

grants and tax incentives would not be of much use unless the

SMEs can increase their business revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs have been told time and again that with the

Internet,  the  whole world is their global marketplace,  and

they  can sell their products to customers in every  part  of

the world.  But, in practice, how does

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>

one  actually achieve that?  It is always difficult  to  draw

interested customers to visit your website.  A search  engine

may  throw  up  tens of thousands of related  websites.   And

after that, there is the question of follow-up and delivery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase their marketing reach and business revenue,

SMEs  would probably do well to form alliances, either  among

themselves or with larger firms.  At first glance, one  would

assume  that  Government-linked companies (GLCs) are  obvious

alliance partners for our SMEs.  But, when I mentioned GLC as

a  likely  partner to some of the private sector companies  I

came  across,  I was perturbed by their reaction.   More  and

more, I received the retort, "The GLCs will swallow you  up."

And  this  was said not only by local companies but  by  some

foreign companies as well.  This is not healthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have statistical evidence to prove whether this

is  warranted  or  not.  It is based on what  private  sector

businessmen tell me, and on one particular example.   One  of

my grassroots leaders narrated to me his personal experience.

He  came across a new product in Italy that was superior  and

would  prove  to  be an advantage in bidding  for  a  certain

Government  tender.   Being  a  small-time  businessman,   he

approached a GLC to jointly pursue this Italian contact.   He

thought  he  could  trust the GLC without signing  a  binding

joint  venture contract or non-circumvention agreement.   Was

he   wrong?   When  he  brought  the  Italian  principals  to

Singapore, the GLC partner ferried them away, bought them  an

expensive  dinner  and proposed to deal directly.   With  the

GLC's  immaculate  credentials, it is no  surprise  that  the

Italian  company was convinced to deal with the GLC directly,

and the small guy was excluded from the arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I raised this with some prominent people, the

response  was  that  the business world  is  a  dirty  shark-infested one, especially in doing business with some  of  our

neighbouring  countries.  Our GLCs could not be  expected  to

adopt one set of cut-throat business practices for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>

their  regional  deals and another set of more  accommodative

and friendlier practices in dealing with Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot agree with this. We must encourage our

GLCs  to  adopt  a sense of business decorum,  especially  in

dealing  with our own that will lead to a win-win  situation.

We  should create a more helpful coexistence between GLCs and

smaller players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another private sector complaint about GLCs is that they

are  deep  in  pockets  but shallow on  ideas.   There  is  a

perception that if you propose a good business idea to  GLCs,

they  will  take  it and exploit it on their own  with  their

strong financial resources.  This is not healthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs around the world lament the lack of quality

management and human resources.  People with good  ideas  are

venturing  out to set up their own.   I will be surprised  if

our  GLCs  do  not  suffer the same  brain  drain.   In  this

scenario,  the small guy will have the brilliant  ideas,  the

know-how and the expertise, but may not have the resources to

execute those ideas.  Therefore, it is in the interest of the

big players to work with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a mistake for big corporations to think that once

an   idea  has  been  proposed  and  a  prototype  has   been

constructed, that the inventor who initiated those  ideas  is

no  longer needed.  That person has valuable insights and  an

in-depth  understanding of his invention.   Big  corporations

must  nurture the development of ideas both internally within

their  own  organisations,  and externally, and benefit  from

these ideas by continuing a healthy relationship with the one

who came up with the idea in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at stake is not confined to that particular

transaction  alone.   It  is wider than  that.   It  is  more

important  for  our GLCs to improve their  image  as  a  good

business partner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are some companies more sought after than others as

alliance partners?  For example, why do technology start-ups

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>

seek to get Softbank to invest in them?  I believe management

vision,  corporate  culture  and business  decorum  are  very

important  attributes.  It will be very sad  if  people  shun

GLCs as an alliance partner for the lack of these qualities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have numerous plans for the 21st century - Singapore 21, T21, Manpower 21. Perhaps it is timely to come

up  with  a GLC 21 to spell out the role and desired outcomes

of our GLCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our Government-linked companies were

formed   in  the  1960s  and  1970s  to  spearhead   business

undertakings in spheres where business investments were large

or  where ordinary businessmen would not dare to venture  due

to  many reasons, and also certain industries were set up for

security purposes.  But in the 1980s and 1990s, some of these

GLCs  had decided that, in order to boost their profit level,

they  should go into businesses which are actually the domain

of  the  small and medium size industries.  Some of our  GLCs

have  gone  into  business  like  freight  forwarding,  small

property  development,  even  when  it  is  not  their   core

businesses, and even own croissant businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is something that we should avoid, and it is

perhaps  timely, and I endorse the call made  by  my  learned

friend,  Mr  Ong  Kian  Min, that we should  re-examine  what

exactly should be the role of our GLCs.  Perhaps the Minister

has to establish a committee to identify what is the new role

of  GLCs  in  the 21st century.  I think they  should  become

trail-blazers in the new economy.  They should go on into new

businesses and bring Singapore's economy into new areas where

they  become  leaders,  and also show example  to  the  other

companies which are local as to where the opportunities  lie.

They should become global players, play among the whales, and

not play in our backyard ponds where smaller fish exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I hope that the Minister will ensure

that  our  GLCs do not compete with local businesses  and  go

downstream.  There are many players locally and  try  not  to

take over their business but encourage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>

them  to venture abroad or venture into new businesses  where

there is no competition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have spoken about

our tax system during the Budget debate in the last few days.

As  I  mentioned in my speech on Monday, I feel that  we  can

develop  a  differentiated tax system for different  economic

activities and go away from a "one size fits all" tax system.

I  will talk a bit about this later on when I talk on tax for

technopreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things about our tax

system,  and  this  will  encourage  more  start-ups  and  to

accelerate  the  regionalisation drive.  We should  therefore

review  some of our tax practices to create a more  conducive

environment for this to happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, group offsetting of local and overseas

subsidiaries.   I  know that this has been  brought  up  many

times.   I will not describe the details of how it should  be

done.   My  colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, also  talked  about

this during the debate earlier this week.  I suggest that  we

do  not  worry too much about the tax leakage that may  occur

because I believe that only a small proportion of individuals

or  companies will have the intention to do so.  Most of  the

other  companies will do it for the true and legal  purposes.

The resultant benefit for businesses will be tremendous.   So

we  should not punish the majority to avoid the bad practices

of a small minority of companies that may go about doing this

thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cross-year offsetting of losses should be allowed

for  companies  including start-ups.  This  will  lessen  the

burden  on  investors and shareholders and  we  should  allow

greater  flexibility on how this can happen.  I believe  many

businesses  still  do  not  understand  and  do   not   fully

comprehend the current requirements that allow some amount of

offsetting of cross-year losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that we introduce negative

gearing for individuals.  For example, investment in property

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>

should be allowed to be negatively geared for individuals  in

Singapore.  I believe this is currently practised  in  a  few

countries, including Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also provide incentive for SMEs to merge by

allowing the offsetting of losses and by removing restrictive

legislation   like   ownership  requirements   set   by   the

Government.  I believe Mr Leong talked about this earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area that has also been talked about in

the last few days is the taxation of e-commerce transactions,

as part of our overall tax system.  We need to clarify how we

are  going to participate in this e-commerce arena.  We  need

to put in place a tax system that is well integrated with the

rest  of  the  world  and, at the same time,  facilitate  the

growth of this sector of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, while we worry about becoming a tax haven

if  we lower corporate taxes to below 25%, can we avoid  this

being labelled as a tax haven by highlighting the other  many

taxes  that we pay?  For example, we have GST, property  tax,

fuel  tax, utilities tax, ERP, COE and so on.  And I am  sure

if we add all these taxes, our total tax is greater than 25%.

So if we can highlight all these taxes, then we can lower our

corporate  tax  to  below  25%, and we  can  avoid  labelling

ourselves as a tax haven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I hope that we will be prepared to put in

place   a   differentiated  tax  system  to   allow   greater

flexibility and to encourage certain economic activities that

will be beneficial to our economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I agree with what Mr Inderjit

Singh  has just proposed on the need to do a complete  review

of  the  tax  system and, in particular, to look at  specific

target  areas  that can be changed.  I have  spoken  on  this

subject  of  group  offsetting of  taxes  during  the  Budget

debate.   In  response to this suggestion of  allowing  group

offsetting  of  taxes  made by several of  our  parliamentary

colleagues here, the Finance Minister has given his views  in

his response at the end

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>

of  yesterday's  Budget debate.  However,  I  would  like  to

continue  to  plug  at this issue which  I  feel  is  a  very

worthwhile cause and, hopefully, in the process can crack the

nut  with the Finance Minister.  Raising this issue here will

also give him a chance to explain to us in more detail, if he

does not agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to repeat my suggestion, which is that

the  Government should have taken the line that  although  it

does  not  want  to allow group offsetting  of  taxes  for  a

variety  of  reasons, we should not look  at  it  on  blanket

basis, but more on a specific case by case basis.  Therefore,

I wish to repeat that for specific cases, such as for sectors

where the Government wishes to promote more investments to be

made,  say, in the area of infotechnology and other high-tech

areas, the Government could actually consider allowing losses

of  such  new  ventures to be offset against the  profits  in

other   parts  of  the  principal  business  of  a   company.

Companies  will  therefore be more ready  to  invest  in  new

ventures  and in high-tech areas.  In the process,  Singapore

will gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on taxation of e-commerce. Internet

companies  operate  in a virtual world  where  there  are  no

sovereign  boundaries.  Hence, these Internet companies  have

customers  located anywhere in the world, and  the  companies

themselves  may  not  be registered or  based  in  Singapore.

However,  their  operations and products may be  targeted  at

Singaporeans  or  can  reach  customers  in  Singapore.    My

question  is:  how  could the Singapore  Government,  or  any

government for that matter regulate and control these virtual

companies on the Internet?  In particular, if these companies

turn  out to be very profitable, how do we measure the amount

of profits that they derive from doing business in Singapore,

and therefore the Singapore Government can be eligible to tax

such companies?

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, to promote more Singaporeans

venturing  into  new  start-ups, especially  into  e-commerce

start-ups,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>

I  would  like to ask the Minister whether he could  consider

incentives  to  encourage  these  start-up  companies  to  be

formed.   For example, in the early years of their formation,

can  the Government give them preferential tax status or more

R&D  grants  so that they can quickly complete their  product

development and commercialise their products?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, more could have been done to

encourage  and accelerate our technopreneurship drive  during

this year's budget.  Nonetheless, I hope more will be done as

we progress to the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage entrepreneurs, they should be given more

incentives to own a larger portion of the company  that  they

started   up  without  having  to  worry  about   tax.    The

entrepreneur who brings in $1 million worth of ideas  and  an

investor who brings in similarly $1 million worth of money to

the   business  are  currently  in  our  tax  system  treated

differently.  The investor will not pay for capital gains tax

while  the entrepreneur who brought the idea but has a  share

in  the company has to pay the full tax for the capital gains

that  he  may have got as a result of the gain in  the  share

value.   I  would like to suggest that as part of the  review

and  part  of the announcement that is going to come  in  May

this  year regarding employee stock options, we should review

the taxation of stock options into three categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category of stocks is typically for those new

start-up  companies  where  technopreneurs  are   given  free

shares  in  lieu of their expertise and experience that  they

brought to the table.  Such entrepreneurs should not be taxed

for  these shares at all.  In the beginning, the value of the

shares  cannot be clearly determined because if  the  company

collapses, then the shares are worth nothing at all.  But  if

the  technopreneur  is able to make it  a  success,  he  will

generate  wealth  for  the company and for  the  country  and

therefore  more  jobs  would be created  and  he  would  have

contributed tremendously to the economy.  For these  benefits

that  they bring to the company and to the country,  the  tax

the Government charges on him,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>

the  tax loss as a result of the implementation of no-tax  on

the  employee options on these shares, would be all worth  it

for the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of shares is the stock options given

to founder-employees.  If these are given to the employees in

the  first six months of a new start-up, then I suggest  that

these  too  should be tax exempt or minimally taxed  for  the

same  reasons I gave earlier.  These are quite different from

the free shares that are given at the start of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of stock options is given by

successful  or  listed  companies and these  can  be  treated

differently from start-ups, but I still feel that they should

be  treated  differently from income tax as  they  are  being

treated currently.  The reason for this is that  in the  case

of  income, there is a certainty of income for the  employee,

but  in  the  case  of a given stock option,  there  is  some

element  of uncertainty because if the stock value  does  not

appreciate,  then the employee does not gain very  much  from

it.   For  this  difference, I believe  they  should  not  be

subject to the normal tax system.  This is one example of how

a differentiated tax system can work in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest that we should

encourage  angel  investors  by allowing  them  to  write-off

losses from their income tax when companies they invested  in

fail.   I believe that the current practice allows for write-offs  of losses when shares are sold at a lower price.   This

is  not  attractive enough because when a company  collapses,

there  is  no opportunity to sell the shares.  In  fact,  the

shares are then worth nothing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to suggest that entrepreneurs be

allowed  to carry forward the losses in their investments  in

their future income tax computations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and these are for companies that are required

to raise capital for capital intensive type of companies,   I

would like to suggest that pre-production expenses should  be

tax  deductible because a lot of preparation  is  needed  for

such high-tech

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>

companies before they can go into production. For the capital

intensive  companies,  you  cannot  wait  for  the  time   of

production to collect the money from your investors.  All  of

the  equity is raised very much earlier so that you are ready

to  invest once you are ready to run production. The  current

practice  discourages  the early raising  of  equity  capital

because  the  interest earned for the capital that  you  have

raised and has not been expanded on, the capital that is kept

in  the  bank, is taxed even if a company were to  have  made

huge losses in the whole process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like to suggest that we grant pioneer

status  type incentives for individuals and local  start-ups.

Just  as  we  value  foreign investment capital  by  granting

companies  pioneer  status in the past, we  should  similarly

value  the  intellectual capital brought by these people  and

the local companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am encouraged that the Minister has said that he

would  be  looking out for suggestions on how we can  further

improve  the  system.  I hope that he will take into  account

all  the  suggestions put forward by the Members in the  next

few hours.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just ask Members to bear in mind

when making their speeches that we have a total of 28 cuts on

this  head and we are actually falling behind schedule.   Mrs

Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, in the debate so far on

entrepreneurship, much has been said and argued in favour  of

preferential  tax treatment for individual holders  of  stock

options issued by the companies that employ them.  The recent

concession  to allow tax deferral for up to five years,  upon

assumption of the stock options, is indeed laudable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus instead on the tax treatment

for companies issuing such options.  Increasingly, especially

with  hi-tech  start-ups, ESOPs will figure significantly  as

part  of  staff  compensation.  Actual cash components  would

correspondingly   reduce  in  proportion.    This   has   tax

implications  for  companies,  depending  on  the  scale   of

implementing ESOPs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he would allow

companies  to  tax-expense  the  value  of  options  granted,

subject to acceptable option valuation methods?  And  if  so,

whether he would impose any limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, much has been said about the

competing demands and dilemmas faced by working women,  which

may conspire to incline couples towards not having children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women may choose or would like the flexibility of

being  able  to  take time off work for  a  period  of  time,

following child-birth.  Currently, this involves giving up  a

source of income.  For those who plod on, they can claim  the

usual  child relief and enhanced child relief of  up  to  5%,

15%, 20% and 25% respectively of earned income for each child

order.   There is no in-between compromise, ie,  tax  reliefs

for the family whilst taking time off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether tax

incentives can be extended to husbands instead, of women  who

choose to stop work following child birth?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to echo several Members' call to raise

the current level of tax relief of only $2,000 per child.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has just very

much covered the ground that I wish to also expound on.  So I

shall  not take up more of the House's time, but just to  add

my voice to support her position.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I urge the Finance Minister to

allow  widows the same access to the foreign maid levy relief

as  available now to married women.  At present, widows  with

young dependent children enjoy the relief but they lose  this

right  if  their  children are grown up.   If  their  married

sisters  continue  to  enjoy this  privilege  with  grown  up

children, they wonder why they are treated differently.  Like

their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>

working  married  sisters, they  have  a  home.   Like  their

married  sisters, they have to work outside  their  homes  to

enjoy  this  relief.   If the relief  is  meant  to  be  pro-marriage,  they have also fulfilled this role.  This  is  not

negated  by  the death of their husbands.  If the requirement

is  that the claimant should work by choice, as married women

are  deemed to do so, as they have their husbands to maintain

them, and the relief is to entice them back to the workforce,

then  it  follows  that  a married woman  who  works  out  of

necessity   should be disqualified and widows  who  have  the

means  to  maintain themselves without having  to  work,  but

chose  to  work, should qualify.  Surely, this  cannot  be  a

condition.  Although  children  have  been  advanced  as  the

rationale  for  this relief, this does not  appear  to  be  a

necessary  condition. According to the notes  that  accompany

the  income tax return form, as long as the woman is  married

to her husband and opts to be taxed separately, she can claim

the  relief  whether she has children or  not.   However,  if

having a husband is a necessary condition to enjoy the relief

without dependent children, then I suppose a widow will  just

have to find and marry a new husband to enjoy it. This, I  am

sure, is not one of the  purposes of the relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, if the relief is intended to be pro-marriage, and to encourage our womenfolk to be economically

active,  then  I  urge the Minister to give to  both  married

women  and  widows  equal access to  the  foreign  maid  levy

relief.   A  widow who depends on one income  to  maintain  a

family has as much, if not, more need for the relief.  If the

Minister does not think that widows should enjoy the  relief,

I wonder if the Minister could in his reply afterwards, or at

some future opportunity, enlighten the House as to the number

of  widows not allowed access to the relief and the potential

loss  of relief to the Government if these widows were  given

the relief.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I am trying to cut short my

speeches, as you have requested us earlier.  Sir, the Finance

Minister  currently allows any individual  to  claim  a  very

small personal relief as his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>

income  tax  relief  when  he  attends  certain  professional

courses.  This relief is to allow an individual to deduct  up

to   $2,500  of  course  fees  for  courses  leading   to   a

professional   or   academic  qualification   or   vocational

qualification relating to a person's existing trade, business

or  employment.  I would like to propose that this relief  be

increased  perhaps to $5,000.  The reason  is  that  nowadays

course fees are very high.  Professional or vocational course

fees  can  cost  $10,000 or more.  Hence, to  encourage  more

Singaporeans  to  improve themselves,  a  higher  course  fee

relief  will  encourage  them  to  enroll  into  more   self-improvement education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would also like to propose that these

course  fees be extended to not just professional or academic

qualifications  or  for  other  self-improvement  educational

courses.   Such self-improvement courses will not necessarily

be  related  to a person's trade or vocation.   For  example,

there  may  be  many people who want to attend a  new  skills

course  or new vocation course so as to get a new  job  in  a

different  trade.   Also, there may be  people  who  want  to

attend  IT   or computer training courses but they themselves

are not necessarily IT professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed relaxation of course fee relief benefit

would  be  useful  to ensure that more and more  Singaporeans

attend retraining or self-training programmes of all kinds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as I have proposed in my speech during the

Budget debate, I would like to propose that a grant be  given

to  local  grassroots organisations, such  as  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committees (CCCs), so that they can also conduct

more self-improvement or IT training courses at the community

clubs at subsidised rates.  This will be beneficial to a pool

of  lower income or senior citizens who wish to be trained or

who want to receive more self-education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to propose, as I have said in

my  Budget speech, that a grant or income tax relief be given

to   individuals  to  purchase  PCs.   This  proposal   would

encourage   more  and  more  Singaporeans   to   embrace   IT

technology.  As

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>

a  result,  this  will  speedily  create  an  environment  in

Singapore where an increasingly large percentage of our adult

population  would understand and appreciate the  fast  moving

Internet and e-commerce society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my second cut, I would like to join my colleagues in

speaking on the employee stock option scheme.  Here, like  my

colleagues,  Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, I  would

like  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  more  enhanced

benefits  for employee stock option schemes.  Many companies,

especially new start-up companies,  do not have the funds  to

employ  and  attract key employees who are important  to  the

companies.  Therefore, they use ESOPs as a main carrot.  So I

would propose that the Government consider allowing such ESOP

schemes   to  be given to high-tech companies to be  declared

tax  free,  say,  in the first five years when they  exercise

such  options. Currently, when they exercise such options  in

the  first  five years they are deemed liable to  pay  income

tax.   For such companies, perhaps to attract them and  as  a

form  of  encouragement, maybe it will be useful to  consider

tax free status for the first five years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I move this

amendment  to highlight some of the problems associated  with

estate  duties.  Many Singaporeans have built  up  assets  in

terms of housing, CPF savings and fixed deposits, stocks  and

shares, unit trusts, etc.  Many will die with some assets for

the  family, and some will have to pay estate duties.   I  am

not  asking for the removal of estate duties.  In  fact,  the

estate  duties imposed are not onerous.  But the  process  of

the  IRAS' assessements is lengthy and causes hardship to the

deceased  family.   At  my meet-the-people-sessions,  I  have

complaints   relating  to  this.   All  assets   are   frozen

immediately  at  the  time  of  death,  especially  when  the

deceased  is  the  main  sole breadwinner,  and  this  causes

financial  hardship.  Adding to the distress, the family  has

to  pay  up  in  advance an estimated amount of  tax  and  an

interest charge is imposed if the amount is unpaid, all  this

at a time when they have no access to the estate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>

Obtaining valuations of assets to submit to IRAS is difficult

and  lengthy.  Much work has to be done to obtain  valuations

on  properties, cars, unit trusts, contents of  safe  deposit

boxes,  etc.   IRAS also requires information on transactions

in  bank accounts for the past several years, I think  up  to

five  years.  It is not possible and impractical  for  family

members  to trace transaction details of the deceased  unless

he  had  kept  an  impeccable record.  The  frustrations  are

immense, especially if the family members are not well versed

in managing financial matters.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets are frozen until IRAS is satisfied with the

assessment  and  this can take a long time.  Nowadays,  stock

markets  are  volatile and to a certain extent  the  property

cycle.  Perhaps IRAS can consider allowing assets to be  sold

first   and  held  in  a  trust  account.   This   will   let

beneficiaries take advantage of any upturn in prices  or  get

out of a falling market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual for estate assessment to take one to

two  years  to settle.  Beneficiaries should not be penalised

unnecessarily because of the lengthy process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Supplementary

Retirement  Scheme (SRS) will be implemented  by  next  year.

The  Finance  Minister  has indicated  that  views  from  the

private sector would be sought on the implementation aspects.

I  would  urge  the Government to carry out extensive  public

consultation  among the people sector, especially  the  trade

unions,  so  that the SRS, when implemented, will  gain  wide

support from the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that workers of all ages are encouraged

to  contribute  to  it.   Thus,  before  implementation,  the

concern and misconception, if any, among the workers must  be

addressed.  To save for old age from young, is in  line  with

Singapore  21's recommendations that each of us  should  take

individual  responsibility.  Thus, the concept of the  scheme

needs to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>

explained clearly to the ordinary Singaporeans.  It should be

an easy to join, easy to quit scheme so that ordinary workers

will  have  the  confidence in it.  One  of  the  worries  is

whether the scheme is designed in such a way that it is  very

easy to go in but very cumbersome to come out, as the Hokkein

says, "a jip, buay tzu".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SRS, Singaporeans will be contributing to private

funds.   It  is  a  fact  that  in  terms  of  packaging  and

marketing,  the  private  sector is more  creative  than  the

public  sector.  However, in terms of confidence, as  far  as

money is concerned, Singaporeans trust the public sector, the

Government,  more than the private sector.  Thus,  sufficient

safeguards  against  any  form  of  default  to  protect  the

people's  hard earned savings must be in place.  I  hope  the

Government  can bear in mind this point when formulating  the

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Labour Force Survey 1999, the

economically active female accounts for 50.1% of  the  female

population.    These  include  those  who  are   working   or

unemployed  but  looking for a job.  And those  who  are  not

working  and  not  looking for a job accounts  for  49.9%  or

463,000.   So  many  of  this  group  of  women  are  married

housewives, the homemakers.  Thus, I hope the Government will

encourage husbands to contribute for their wives who are  not

working,  but  looking after the home.  As  homemakers,  they

have  no  CPF savings or little savings.  It is thus  logical

that  husbands should be encouraged to contribute to SRS  for

the  wife.  In this respect, a fixed sum of money contributed

by  the husband for this purpose can be tax-free or it should

enjoy  a  lower  tax  rate.   This  is  to  acknowledge   the

contribution  of  the homemakers who have  in  no  small  way

helped  their  husbands.  It is also to  solve  some  of  the

future  problems of married women who have been  playing  the

role  of  homemakers but are divorced, widowed and  have  not

enough savings for their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are encouraging workers to save from young,

it   is   also  proposed  that  the  scheme  be  renamed   as

Supplementary  Saving  Scheme (SSS)  rather  than  retirement

scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Yesterday, Mr Kenneth Chen talked

about  allowing new start-ups, especially dot.com  companies,

to list on our stock exchanges, and he felt that there was  a

need  for  the  Government to point out  the  risks  of  high

tech/IT   industries  before  Singaporeans  invest  in   such

companies.  He also highlighted how the public will blame the

Government in case they make losses when such companies fail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to tighten the entry requirements

for such companies to be listed nor for the Government to  go

to the public with a warning each time a new company lists on

the  stock  exchange.   I do believe, however,  that  we  can

achieve  the  dual  objectives  of  allowing  easier  capital

raising  by entrepreneurs and start-up companies and  at  the

same  time,  the  public will have an automatic  signal  that

investments in such start-ups could be risky, but could  also

yield very high returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current practice of allowing such company to

list  on  the main board and on Sesdaq is a good first  step,

but the issues are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we still have a number of stringent

requirements that are still not easy to meet for many  viable

companies, because we are allowing companies of all types  to

list on the two boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this has created confusion among investors,

especially among retail investors in Singapore, who  are  not

sure  whether  such companies are the high risk/return  type,

because  listed on these stock exchanges are both traditional

industries  measured by traditional measures as well  as  the

high  risk  start-ups which may yield higher  returns  should

they be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that we need to implement a new board

in   Singapore  for  emerging  technologies  and  for   young

companies who may have good potential but do carry  a  higher

risk  which allow easier capital raising and at the same time

allow  investors to make a conscious decision that  they  are

investing in risky businesses.  This will resolve the dilemma

that we are facing as a result of the current

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>

practice.  So whenever a company is listed on this new  risky

exchange, the investors will know that the potential  returns

could  be  high, at the same time they will make  losses  and

they cannot blame the Government for not pointing things  out

to them very early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a global board, having a different set of

entry  criteria.   I hope that it could be Internet  tradable

and trading in world currencies, 24 hours around the day,  so

that we can have participation in capital raising from around

the world.  And I believe that Hong Kong recently implemented

the GEM to serve the same purpose.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, on this cut, I am

referring  to listing of companies without a track record  of

profit.  I am not referring to the listing of companies  that

the  speaker before me, Mr Inderjit Singh, refers to.  He  is

talking  about  new companies, companies built  on  hope  and

potential  without any measurable financial  returns.   I  am

referring to companies that have been in business for  a  few

years  but  yet to show a profit.  For companies in  the  new

economy,  these  companies  would  have  passed  through  the

venture  capital  stage and are now looking to  expand  their

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relaxation of SGX, companies without proven

profits,  track record, could be admitted to the main  board.

Several  companies have already done so.  I have  touched  on

this  briefly  in my adjournment motion at the last  sitting.

If I run the risk of incurring your ire for repeating myself,

I   believe   I   am   in   good  company   this   afternoon.

Traditionally, where possible, most companies would  want  to

be listed on the main board.  It is a sign of recognition,  a

sign  of success.  Of course, there are also tangible results

such  as  better market recognition, getting a P/E ratio  and

many  companies are indeed, therefore, reluctant to be listed

on  the secondary board.  However, with the advent of the new

economy, the situation is different today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the stock exchange in US - the New York

Stock Exchange and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>

Nasdaq.   While the New York Stock Exchange has been dropping

across the board, in the recent days Nasdaq has been breaking

new  record, heading for higher grounds, despite the repeated

hint  of interest rate hike proposed by the Federal Reserves.

This  reflects the enthusiasm of the investors for  companies

in  the  new  economy, because they are looking for  multiple

time increase in capital gains.  The decline in the Dow Jones

and  the increase in Nasdaq indexes simply reflect the  trend

that many fund managers have been transferring funds from the

old  economy to the new economy.  In fact, today,  Nasdaq  is

the market where a company preferring to be listed would like

to be, that is, to ride the wave of the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I think the link between listing on the

main  board  and the ability to raise money has been  broken.

Yet,  I  think it is still useful to maintain the segregation

of   the   established  companies  and  emerging   companies.

Therefore,  I  would like the Minister to reconsider  how  we

allow companies to be listed on our two exchanges.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

last  year's Budget debate, I raised the question of CLOB  in

this  House.   I pointed out that the Government  should  not

shirk  its responsibility.  I also wanted to know what action

the   self-claimed  capable,  farsighted  and  efficient  PAP

Government  would  take  to  protect  the  interest  of  CLOB

investors.  Unfortunately, a year has passed, yet all we have

are only two schemes recommended by SGX and KLSE. In my view,

the  Government  is  selling out the  interest  of  the  CLOB

investors through these two schemes in an attempt to  resolve

this knotty problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme by Effective Capital proposes to

commence the slow release of shares from July this year.  But

it  would take as long as 13 months for all the shares to  be

released.   On top of that, the investors will have to pay an

administrative fee equivalent to 1.5% of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>

closing  prices of the shares as at the 15th of  this  month.

To  me, this kind of administrative fee is no different  from

the    "protection  money" demanded by  the  gangsters.   The

agreement  between SGX and SCANS of KLSE on  share  migration

cannot  be  enforced.  Migration of shares  has  to  be  done

through   a   private  company,  and  then   they   slap   an

administrative fee on the investors.  This is indeed daylight

robbery!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are areas of concern in this scheme. First, how

do  SGX  and  KLSE  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  Effective

Capital?  What happens, if after taking over the CLOB  shares

and  collecting the so-called administrative fee, the company

collapses  and  goes  out of business within  13  months  and

before  the  shares are fully released?  Who is going  to  be

liable?    Can  SGX  and  KLSE provide  a  guarantee  to  the

investors  against the risk?  Secondly, apart from  the  1.5%

protection  money,  can  the investors  be  assured  of  real

protection?   Will  the  KLSE  suddenly  introduce  some  new

regulations and seek to collect some more money under certain

pretext?   Thirdly,  how are shares to be released,  on  what

criteria and what principle?   What amount of shares will  be

released each time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with the second scheme. For this,

you  would have to wait until January 2003 for the shares  to

be  released,  and it will take a period of nine  months.   I

think  this  is a big joke.  The CLOB market was  closed  for

trading  in 1998.  It would mean a long five years since  the

closure.   Yet, the SGX finds it fit to accept this  kind  of

scheme. Furthermore, how would SGX and KLSE ensure that there

would be no more change of mind?  As the Chinese saying goes,

"yechang  mengduo", (a long night is fraught with nightmares)

meaning, "a long delay means many hitches".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether these schemes are the only

things  the Government could do for the CLOB investors.   Are

they  the  best and most favourable schemes?  When  answering

questions  on the CLOB issues, the Government has  reiterated

that the CLOB investors have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>

their legal rights, and the Government can take the matter up

to the WTO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd January 1999, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien

Loong said in Parliament, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Government has taken advice on possible

proceedings  at  the  World  Trade  Organisation  forum  from

leading  legal  counsel that specialises in WTO  issues.  The

counsel  has  advised that the `CLOB' issue is  within  WTO's

jurisdiction  and  Singapore has valid  grounds  for  seeking

redress at WTO on the matter."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But right now we have not seen Government taking any

effective  action to protect the interests of CLOB investors.

Then, SGX suddenly agreed to this proposed scheme.   What  on

earth is the Government doing?  You say one thing, and you do

another  thing.  Perhaps the Government rather "kow-tow"   to

the  Malaysian side and sacrifice the interest  of  the  CLOB

investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should not forget that in 1989 when the

CLOB  market  was  set  up, it was  to  offset  the  pressure

resulting  from  the  separation of  the  Singapore  and  the

Malaysian stock exchanges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th November 1989, the Minister for Finance, in

answering  questions  on the separation  of  stock  exchanges

between Singapore and Malaysia, pointed out, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the moment, there are 182 Malaysian companies out of

the 329 companies listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.  In

the  short  term, the immediate impact of the  de-listing  of

Malaysian  stocks from the SES is likely to be a  decline  in

the turnover of the SES."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plans are being finalised to trade Hong Kong, Thai and

Australian stocks in the over-the-counter (OTC) market to the

SES electronic trading or CLOB system."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our investors jumped into the crocodile pit and the

members  of the Stock Exchange of Singapore earned a  lot  of

commissions  and the financial service sector grew  steadily.

Both the Exchange and the Government benefited.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Malaysia has crushed the crocodile pit into an abyss

and  the  Government just sits on the fence  and  allows  the

capital  of the investors to fall into a bottomless  pit.  It

even acquiesces in these two schemes which are definitely not

in the interest of the investors.  My conclusion here is that

the PAP Government really has no conscience.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> At the recent sitting of

Parliament,  my  colleague,  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen,  moved   an

adjournment motion wherein he was concerned that  the  bubble

created  by  the  Internet fever may result in  the  ordinary

investors  getting  seriously  hurt  if  the  market   should

nosedive  with a serious correction.  Our DPM Lee replied  by

saying  that  not all dot.com companies would be  successful.

In the market which is run by a regulatory philosophy that is

based  on  disclosure rather than merit, what is  obvious  is

that the responsibility for the choice of share purchase must

surely rest with the investor.  Our DPM advised that when one

invests in the market, one has to do it prudently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what concerns me is the extent to which the public

has  been so overwhelmed by the excitement over investing  in

dot.com companies that they have almost thrown caution to the

wind.   Right now, in Hong Kong, the dot.com fever has  moved

to  frenzy.  Following the successful launch of Tom.com, Hong

Kongers  are  now caught on by the Internet fever.   At  this

moment, investors in Hong Kong are hoping to be able to  make

a punt on IT shares in the hope that, when allotted, they can

sell  these shares for a handsome gain.  Never mind if  these

investors have not read the prospectus.  Never mind if  there

are  enough disclosures of risk factors to scare any  prudent

investors away from the offer.  As long as there is money  to

be  made,  the  investors would be there no matter  what  the

risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth is that there are concerns over the

present  euphoria in the Internet stocks.  Many will  concede

that the Internet stocks today are over-valued.  One

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>

magazine reported that nearly three quarters of the Internet-related  initial public offerings in America  since  mid-1995

now  trade below the issued price.  We know that the cardinal

principle  in any investment is caveat emptor.  However,  the

question   which  we  must  ask  ourselves  is  whether   the

Government's  duty  is  merely  to  provide  a  broad  market

framework  and  to leave investors to make their  own  better

judgement.   At  the  moment, the regulatory  philosophy  has

shifted  from a merit-based regime to one that  is  based  on

disclosure.  In other words, in its present approach, so long

as  the  company meets the listing requirements, chances  are

that the company's application to be admitted to the official

list will be approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the disclosure-based regulatory

regime  is  more appropriate for markets where the  investing

public  is  sophisticated.  The same, however, may not  apply

where  the  investors are not as savvy.  If  this  is  so,  I

believe  that  there is a greater duty on the  Government  to

play  a  greater role in helping to protect the  interest  of

investors.    The  balance  between  a  merit-based   and   a

disclosure-based regulatory regime lies closer to the  former

than  the  latter.   At  the end of the day,  the  Government

cannot  just  rely on the fact that the investors  have  been

warned.  If the market crashed in a catastrophic manner, some

amount  of backlash will follow.  I mean, just look at  CLOB.

As  Mr Low has said earlier, there are many who still believe

the  Government is responsible for the problems of having the

CLOB shares today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is this feeling that there is a certain amount

of residual responsibility that the people will expect of the

Government on the matter.  Therefore, I beg to differ from my

colleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh.   In  some  ways,  I   would

therefore urge the Minister to examine the present policy  to

see  if greater protection can be afforded to members of  the

public.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the wide ranging financial

sector reforms will pave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>

the  way  for Singapore to play a bigger role as a  financial

services hub, at least for the Asian time zones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the existing offering of primarily equity-linked instruments for both capital raising and investment,

the Monetary Authority of Singapore should seriously consider

the  setting  up  of an exchange for bonds,  particularly  an

electronic  trading  platform.  This would  facilitate  bond-trading for both institutions and retail investors alike, the

latter of whom have typically been forced to hold bonds  till

maturity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complemented by the current equity capabilities of the

merged  Singapore Exchange, setting up a bond exchange should

hopefully attract more infrastructural or telecommunications-related  issues  to  Singapore.  Hitherto,  bonds  have  been

traded  on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis in most countries.

However, technology has facilitated electronic trading  to  a

large  extent.  The US market is replete with examples,  such

as   BrokerTec,  which  aims  to  disintermediate   interbank

brokers,  and  Bloomberg Bond Trader which is developed  with

major US banks to focus on  government securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding some inherent problems with creating

sufficient  liquidity,  especially  at  the  initial   stage,

electronic trading promises ultimately lower issuance  costs.

An  added  bonus  would  be the opportunity  to  realise  the

potential  of  the  untapped  retail  segment  not  just   in

Singapore but within the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the MAS to explore the

possibility  and  feasibility of the SGX  taking  on  a  more

active  role  in  the debt market, beyond just  listing  bond

issues.   There  are  synergies to be reaped,  especially  in

terms  of  marketing  more variety  to  the  same  groups  of

financial investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to the next cut on statutory boards - tapping the open market for funds. As part of our efforts at

establishing  a  meaningful  and  vibrant  debt   market   in

Singapore,   statutory  boards,  such  as  the  Jurong   Town

Corporation and the Housing and Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>

Board  had begun to issue bonds, each to the tune of  several

hundred million Singapore dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues not only help to create sufficient critical

mass  by  complementing  the regular issuance  of  Government

papers,  but also allow some benchmarking and corporate  debt

rating  exercises to take place.  This exercise interestingly

raises  the  question of whether selling bonds  on  the  open

market  has indirectly pushed funding costs higher for  these

statutory boards, thereby leading to an inflation of cost  of

services  to be provided by them.  For example, the  HDB  may

pay  close  to  5% on the open market for its  longer  tenure

bonds whereas it typically borrows from the Central Provident

Fund  via the MAS, at a rate which is pegged to fixed deposit

rates.  The disparity could be quite marked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point and question here is, aside from the intricate

relationships  between  pools  of  funds  at  the   different

Government agencies, will tapping the open market  for  funds

change  certain  aspects of public finance?  Will  this  have

implications, for example, for the way housing subsidies  are

and  should  be structured, including the need  to  link  the

interest rates of CPF to HDB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my last cut on investor public education.

Sir, earlier on the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing

Population  Workgroup  on Financial Security  was  trying  to

ascertain the degree of investor awareness and sophistication

among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus was that public education was crucial for

several  reasons:   Firstly, as part  of  personal  financial

planning,  not  just  for old age but also  throughout  one's

life,  to  meet  changing  needs  such  as  family  and  home

establishment in earlier years to retirement provisioning  in

later years.  Secondly, to enable Singaporeans to partake  of

the  increasing  variety of investible instruments,  such  as

direct  stock market investments, unit trusts or the slightly

more  esoteric derivatives, such as index futures.   Thirdly,

to enable Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>

to  assume  greater  control  and responsibility  over  their

individual  financial  well-being  by  having  the  requisite

awareness of the different risks involved and skills to  make

prudent  investment decisions.  Hopefully, this will minimise

investments  in  financial 'lemons' through a  discipline  of

understanding the underlying businesses.  In this regard, the

current dot.com fever is slightly worrying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the

Government's  philosophy  with  regard  to  investor   public

education.   Whilst it is quite clearly in the  interests  of

financial institutions to educate potential customers as part

of  marketing their products, would the MAS drive or  play  a

coordinating  role  in the public education  process?   Also,

would the MAS help ensure that related agencies, such as  the

Central  Provident  Fund  Board and the  Singapore  Exchange,

embark on a wider scale the raising of such awareness?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point

with  the  Minister on the need for his Ministry and  related

bodies,  such  as  the  SGX, to devise new  rules,  laws  and

regulations to regulate Internet companies which are able and

effective  to control and police the virtual Internet  world.

These  Internet companies could well be promoting vice,  such

as  pornography,  gambling, or other unsavoury  products  and

services  on  the  Net.  Moreover, they will  have  a  strong

impact on the minds of our younger population, especially the

students who have easy access to the Internet, thanks to  the

very effective IT education they receive in the schools.  Our

young  children from ages between 8 and 9 years old, are  now

quite  Net-savvy.  I would like to ask the Minister what  can

the  Government do to control Internet companies and the type

of products and services they offer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Finance Minister announced

last  year that the Government intends to pursue company  law

reform  and this is in line with the efforts to make us  more

competitive.  Towards this end, several committees have  been

set up to look into various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>

issues  covering  various  areas,  such  as  the  legislative

framework, corporate governance and accounting practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's initiative in this

regard  as a reform to our Companies Act is timely.   I  have

raised  the issue of the reform before several times in  this

House.  While we do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of

the  various  committees, of which I am a member  of  one,  I

would  like  to  urge  the Government and  the  Minister,  in

particular,  to  consider company law  reform  in  its  wider

context.   In  particular, I hope the Ministry will  consider

the  question  of  the  role of company legislation.   Should

company  law  be  designed  merely to  enhance  shareholders'

value,  or should it be seen as a stakeholder in our  society

and,  together  with  it, carry certain responsibilities  and

obligations towards its employees, members of the public,  or

even  the  environment.  If we accept that the company  is  a

stakeholder in our society, then consequential considerations

follow.   For instance, there could be obligations placed  on

the  directors  to consider the interest of the  environment.

Additionally,   if   it  is  decided  that   companies   have

obligations towards its employees, then provisions  could  be

made to have employees represented on the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reform allows us the opportunity to look at

such issues comprehensively and I certainly do hope that  the

Government will make full use of this opportunity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I refer to the Auditor-General's Report, pages 58 to 60, on the irregular and non-compliance with the procurement procedures by the Board of

Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS).  Sir, due to time

constraint,  I  will  only highlight two  interesting  cases.

Case  one.   BCCS engaged an employee of one of the tenderers

as  consultant to review tender specifications and the tender

was  subsequently awarded to the consultant  employer.   When

Audit   questioned  the  practice,  BCCS  replied  that   the

consultant's who is the employee of the tenderer, acted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>

professionally and declared that he kept his consultancy role

separate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case two. A senior officer of the BCCS approached one

supplier  and offered himself as a partner to a BCCS  project

for  a  fee and he also subsequently advised the supplier  to

lower  his fees for the project to a level that is acceptable

to BCCS.  When BCCS was questioned by Audit, the best part of

his response to Audit was that and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It knew of no rule that prohibits an in-house expert

from partnering an external party."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance what

is  his views on the above replies to Audit by BCCS.  Does he

agree with the stand taken by BCCS?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want to continue with your last

topic, Mr Low?

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, it is important that the

Budget  Book should show at least a clear guide of where  the

monies  are  going.   I see that the head of  expenditure  on

Social   Transfer  and  Subvention  has  no  clear   details.

Although  some Ministries, such as the Ministry of  Education

and  Ministry  of Health did explain them, other  Ministries,

such as the Ministry of Finance itself did not.  I wonder why

is  it not possible to provide the details of transfers  like

development  expenditure  by  projects  on  every  Ministry's

expenditure, or provide an annex, like capital grant in Annex

F, to show the expenditure or where the money goes to.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, many cuts have been made. I

propose  to  answer the cut from Mr Low Thia Khiang  on  CLOB

first  and  then let Dr Hu reply on the Ministry  of  Finance

matters and, if there is time, I will come back to respond to

the other MAS' concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low made a spirited speech on the subject of CLOB. I

last  updated Parliament on this issue in January  this  year

and I have briefed Parliament on the legal obligations of the

parties  involved  and provided Members with  copies  of  the

agreement between the CDP and SCANS.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also informed Parliament then that the Minister for

Finance  Dr Hu had written to his Malaysian counterpart,  Tun

Daim Zainuddin on 13th January 2000. Tun Daim replied on 17th

January  2000, and after a further exchange of  letters,  the

KLSE  met SGX to discuss a mutually acceptable resolution  to

the CLOB issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ensuing negotiations were fruitful and resulted in

the  SGX-KLSE agreement on 25th February 2000. The  agreement

is legally binding and provides two schemes for the migration

and  staggered  release  of CLOB securities  into  individual

investors' securities accounts.  The two exchanges  undertake

to  implement the migration of CLOB securities for trading on

the KLSE under these schemes, fully and unconditionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX and KLSE have jointly presented the two schemes of

their  agreement  as  a comprehensive solution  to  the  CLOB

issue.  This is a major and timely development after the  17-month  impasse  in  September 1998,  during  which  some  1.5

billion  CLOB shares owned by more than 172,000 investors  of

different nationalities were frozen at the Malaysian  Central

Depository (MCD).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In negotiating the agreement, the SGX insisted that it

met  SGX's  and  also  CLOB  investors'  key  concerns.    In

particular, both alternatives have to be legally  binding  on

the  relevant Malaysian authorities, which should acknowledge

their  legal  obligations to carry  out  any  agreement.   In

addition,  the  solution  had to  be  comprehensive,  with  a

reasonable alternative for CLOB investors who did not wish to

accept the private sector offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two key points - firstly, it has to be legally

binding.  secondly, it has to be comprehensive  -  which  the

Malaysian  authorities had consistently refused to agree  to,

are  now  embodied in the SGX-KLSE agreement.  The  agreement

also  confirms that the two migration schemes allow  KLSE  to

meet  its duty to maintain an orderly market for the  trading

of securities in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme, Scheme A, is an amended proposal by

Effective Capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>

Sdn  Bhd (ECSD), which is the only private sector offer  that

has won KLSE's approval and endorsement.  KLSE has made clear

that  ECSB's proposal was the only private sector scheme that

had complied with all of KLSE's and MCD's rules to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors who opt for this scheme will pay ECSB a 1.5%

transfer fee based on the closing prices in the KLSE on  15th

February this year. There will be a three-month set-up period

(for  the opening of individual securities accounts with MCD)

commencing  from  31st  March 2000, followed  by  a  13-month

staggered release of the CLOB securities for trading  on  the

KLSE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheme B, the second scheme, is effected by a

supplemental agreement between CDP and SCANS. Investors  will

have  their securities migrated into individual accounts  and

released  for trading on the KLSE after 33 months  from  31st

March 2000, ie, the migration will begin on 1st January 2003.

The  release will be staggered over 9 months from 1st January

2003 to 1st October 2003.  A 1% administrative fee is payable

to  SCANS. In this case, the fee will be based on the average

of  securities prices on the KLSE over the last five  trading

days of October 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After SGX and KLSE had signed their agreement, the

following day, on 26th February, Dr Richard Hu wrote again to

Tun Daim Zainuddin.  Tun Daim replied on 2nd March 2000 and I

am circulating copies of this exchange of letters to Members.

[Copies of letters circulated to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see from Dr Hu's letter, Dr Hu informed

Tun  Daim in paragraph 3 that "the Singapore Government fully

supports the KLSE-SGX agreement, which meets SGX's desire for

a comprehensive, legally binding solution,  and KLSE's aim of

ensuring  an  orderly market.  The Singapore  Government  had

undertaken  to  ensure that SGX will abide by  the  agreement

reached.    I   would  deeply  appreciate  Your  Excellency's

confirmation,  by  reply to this letter, that  the  Malaysian

Government likewise supports the agreement reached by the two

exchanges, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>

has undertaken to ensure that KLSE will abide by it".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Daim replied, and in his reply, he reiterated the

Malaysian   Government's  stand.   I  read  from  his   third

paragraph,  "I have mentioned in my letter to Your Excellency

dated  14th  February  2000 that  it  is  the  stand  of  the

Government  of Malaysia that CLOB is a wholly private  sector

issue.  As Your Excellency is aware, KLSE is a private sector

organisation  owned  by its members.  The agreements  reached

between KLSE and SGS confirmed this stand."  But he went  on,

"As  this is a comprehensive solution and the agreements  are

legally  binding, I am confident KLSE will  ensure  that  the

obligations  under the agreements are fully  discharged.  The

Government   of   Malaysia  looks  forward  to   the   smooth

implementation of this comprehensive settlement."   In  other

words,  the KLSE-SGX agreement has the full support  of  both

the Singapore and the Malaysian Governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some CLOB investors have written to the local press

expressing  disappointment with the solution reached  and  Mr

Low  has  expressed some of their views just now.  They  feel

that  SGX  and  CDP should have insisted on  CLOB  investors'

strict legal rights and taken a firm stand with the Malaysian

authorities,  particularly as Singapore was  on  sound  legal

ground.   A  few went further to suggest that by agreeing  to

the  resolution, SGX has conceded that CLOB International was

illegal  and  had  merely been "talking tough"  in  the  past

months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX has not conceded any such thing. CLOB International

was never illegal, and SGX's confidence in its legal position

was based on informed legal advice. The Singapore authorities

had  also  taken  legal advice from leading  experts  on  WTO

matters.   Our position was strong, both under Malaysian  law

and at the WTO.  But legal action would have involved further

delay, probably as long as several years, particularly in the

case  of  our  action  in  Malaysian courts.   Meanwhile  the

prospect of delay and uncertainty would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>

have  caused many CLOB investors to feel compelled to  accept

private sector offers which were less favourable and  had  no

legal  assurance  of  being carried out  by  the  KLSE.  This

included,   in   particular,  Effective   Capital's   earlier

staggered  release proposal, which would have  involved  a  4

plus 18 months delay, starting in February this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there were clear and unambiguous legal

rights  involving  more than 172,000 investors  of  different

nationalities,  and that we were prepared  to  enforce  these

rights  as a last resort, were clearly significant in helping

SGX  to  reach  a comprehensive and legally binding  solution

with the KLSE to serve the needs of CLOB investors.  Although

we  did not eventually have to go to Court or go to the  WTO,

the  legal position was important in establishing that we had

a  case and that therefore we were able to deal with KLSE and

reach this agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In getting KLSE to finally negotiate and enter into a

legally binding agreement spelling out specific terms of  the

staggered release of CLOB securities, SGX was acting  in  the

best  interests  of  investors.  The  terms  of  the  schemes

presented  to CLOB investors are significantly improved  from

those  previously  offered.  Each  CLOB  investor  is  in   a

different  situation and has different interests,  especially

with  regard to how long he is able to wait before being able

to  trade  his shares.  No resolution, whether through  legal

action  or  negotiation, could have  met  the  needs  of  all

investors equally. But the final negotiated settlement  is  a

pragmatic one in the circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industries Investors Association of

Singapore  (SIAS)  has,  throughout  this  episode,  provided

independent   representation  of  a  substantial   group   of

investors.  It made clear its members' preferences, and  took

a  resolute stand against earlier private sector offers  that

were to the disadvantage of investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAS has on 26th February 2000 stated its view that the

two  schemes  address the needs of most  CLOB  investors.  It

noted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>

that  its  concerns had been addressed with the reduction  of

the  ECSB proposal's staggered release period from 18  to  13

months,  and  with  KLSE's  legal undertaking  to  fully  and

unconditionally  implement the migration.  SIAS  has  further

explained  on 6th March that although it was not involved  in

the  negotiations, it was providing in-principle  support  to

the  two exchanges' agreement because Scheme A had come  very

close to what SIAS itself had proposed to the KLSE, namely, a

12-month staggered release and a 1% migration fee and what we

have  negotiated  is a 3 plus 13 months release  and  1  1/2%

migration  fee.   SIAS noted that "many investors  have  been

anxious  for  an early settlement and been pressing  CDP  and

SIAS for it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By holding firm on its stance over the last year, SIAS

has   demonstrated   its   effectiveness,   and   contributed

significantly  to the eventual solution to  settle  the  CLOB

issue  fairly  in keeping with the interest of  all  parties.

This is a positive example of civil society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is conceivable that some investors may decide not to

accept  either option. They are entitled to do so,  as  under

law,  neither SGX nor CDP can waive the rights of  beneficial

owners to decide for themselves whether to accept any offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement commits KLSE, SCANS and their related

companies to implement fully the two alternative schemes.  So

long  as  the implementation proceeds as agreed, neither  SGX

nor CDP will have cause to take legal action against KLSE  or

its group of companies.  However, should there be any failure

on  the part of KLSE or its related corporations to implement

either of the two schemes, SGX and CDP will naturally have to

take  action  to  enforce  the  migration  and  release,   if

necessary, through legal means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual investors who still wish to commence legal

proceedings on their own behalf are entitled to do  so.  They

should seek professional advice and decide according to their

individual circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that SGX and the Singapore Government

have done their part to help to resolve this problem and have

not  left  investors in a black hole.  SGX and CDP negotiated

the  agreement to the best of their ability. It believes that

the  outcome  is  in the interests of the  majority  of  CLOB

shareholders.   Investors  must  assess  the  situation   for

themselves to determine the best course of action, and decide

if they wish to opt for either scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some investors have written to request that SGX go

further  and pay the 1 1/2% and 1% fees under the two schemes

on behalf of CLOB investors.  SGX is not able to do so. It is

beyond the scope of SGX's legal duties to defray the costs to

investors  of  the  migration and  staggered  release  plans.

Furthermore, for SGX to do so would raise a serious issue  of

moral hazard, because fundamentally the risk of investing  in

securities on CLOB or other markets provided by SGX,  has  to

be  borne by investors themselves, and not by the exchange or

the  Government.  We have provided the facility,  it  is  for

investors to decide.  This is true of CLOB. This is  true  of

Singapore  shares or any other shares which you  may  buy  in

Singapore  or out of Singapore.  The person who buys  has  to

take  the responsibility for it.  Nobody can be sure that  it

would prosper.  Nobody can be sure that something will not go

wrong.  If something goes wrong in Singapore which is against

the law, or against the rules or monkey business, we will put

it  right.  When it is overseas shares, nobody can  give  any

guarantee.  These  are  sovereign  risks  because   sovereign

governments are entitled to do anything they like under their

own laws.  If they have not followed their own laws, then, of

course,  it is possible for us to seek legal remedy in  their

courts,  and  this  is what we could have  done  had  we  not

reached  a  reasonable  solution  to  the  CLOB  issue.  But,

fortunately, it has not been necessary, and we have been able

to arrive at a negotiated settlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken a constructive approach in trying to

resolve the issue.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>

have  consistently  maintained that an expeditious  and  just

resolution  to  the  matter  is  in  the  interest  of   both

countries,  as  well  as in the interest of  CLOB  investors.

After  almost  one  and a half years,   legally  binding  and

comprehensive  solution,  that  has  the  support   of   both

Singapore  and Malaysian governments, is in place to  resolve

the CLOB issue once and for all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

seek a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Deputy Prime Minister

sure that the KLSE will not change its mind again?  SGX had a

legally binding agreement with SCANS, but what has happened?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a

legitimate  question.   We  have  to  take  it  that  we  are

negotiating with a serious entity, and they have given  their

solemn  word  and  their  Minister of Finance  has  exchanged

letters with our Minister for Finance.  So investors have  to

assess   and   decide.    If   a  problem   arises   in   the

implementation, as I have explained, we will have to  act  in

order to enforce a migration and transfer, and that will have

to  include legal rights.  But I think we will wait and  see.

It  is  premature for us to say that this will not be carried

out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, may I ask a quick clarification?

I  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether  he

feels that this 1 1/2% charge by Effective Capital is fair and

reasonable?   And  after getting the  fee  upfront,  if  they

renege  on  the whole agreement and they do not  release  the

shares, what will happen?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not for me to

decide whether 1 1/2% is enough or not.  That there should  be

some fee for a transfer is not surprising, because there  are

some  expenses  incurred.   As  far  as  the  investors   are

concerned, it is only the fee which matters and not  to  whom

the  fee  is  paid.   In this case, the arrangement  is  with

Effective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>

Capital.   We  accepted  it  as  so,  because  that  is   the

preference of the Malaysian side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if, after having paid the fee, the shares are not

transferred?   The fee is being paid into Standard  Chartered

Bank  and held by a stakeholder, which means that it  is  not

going  to  be  transferred  to  ECSB  until  the  shares  are

transferred  and  released.   And  if  the  shares  are   not

transferred and released, then you can have your 11/2% back.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, looking at the reply from the

Malaysian Finance Minister, I do not see any guarantee on his

part that KLSE will keep to its obligation, as opposed to  Dr

Richard Hu's response that he will ensure that SGX will abide

by  the  agreement.  The Malaysian Finance Minister responded

that  he  is  confident that KLSE will ensure the obligation.

Also,  in  his  letter, he mentioned that KLSE is  a  private

sector  organisation.   In  effect,  he  has  not  guaranteed

anything in his response.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have released the

letters  in  order that the actual exchange of correspondence

be  on  the record.  I have read out the words in the letters

and  so has Mr Inderjit Singh, and I leave it to each  MP  to

make his own assessment and conclusions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister why is it that we

have  not taken this case to the WTO.  Secondly, I would like

to  know whether the DPM would agree with my following  view.

Just  now,  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang's  conclusion  was  a  very

emotional conclusion.  I think we should have a more  logical

conclusion, ie, from now onwards, we should not buy any  more

Malaysian shares.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang

is  also  very  emotional.   Let me  give  Members  a  simple

explanation.  Why is it that eventually we have not taken the

matter to the WTO?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>

Legally   speaking,   whether  it   is   Malaysian   law   or

international  law,  our position is very  strong.   We  have

engaged  Queen's Counsel.  We have also consulted the experts

on  WTO  issues, and they advised us that it is a very clear-cut  case  in our favour.  However, if we were to take  legal

proceedings, there will be some difficulties, because the law

cannot settle matters overnight.  It will take some time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go to the WTO, it may take more than a year.

Furthermore,  the WTO is not an international court.   It  is

only  a  trade organisation.  The WTO can rule that  this  is

against  the  WTO's  rules  or against  something  which  the

Malaysian  has  already subscribed to.  But  the  WTO  cannot

force the Malaysian government to transfer the shares to  the

accounts of the individuals.  So the WTO can only give us the

right to retaliate against them, but not more than that.  But

if we are successful, then, of course, legally or morally, we

are  on the right side.  But then if we go to court, it  will

take 2-3 years.  And after the trial, it may go on appeal and

it  would  take a very long time.  The Member was saying,  "A

long   night  is  fraught  with  nightmares."   So,  to   the

shareholders in Singapore, they will be very worried on  what

the consequences may be.  Now,  there is this company that is

prepared to step in, show you a short cut and says, "I'll buy

over the shares."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your losses may not be just 1.5%. Look at it this way.

If we can avoid going to court and we can try and resolve the

matter  directly  with  the  other  side,  it  is  a  win-win

situation.   We  are  able  to settle  this  matter  because,

legally,  we are in a very strong position.  That is  why  we

could  do it.  But if the legal position is not strong,  then

do  you  think  friendly negotiations  will  lead  us  to  an

amicable settlement?  I do not think so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime

Minister  earlier talked about sovereign risk.  He said  that

the  Government would  be more unequivocal about telling  the

people  of  Singapore that whenever they  invest  in  foreign

assets,  they must take on the sovereign risk of the  foreign

countries in which these assets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>

are  based.  And whether they invest in Malaysian  shares  in

CLOB or in Kuala Lumpur, the shares are nothing but pieces of

paper,  representing  assets  that  are  basically  based  in

Malaysia,  or at least controlled in Malaysia, because  these

are shares of Malaysian companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, perhaps the Government should also be

very clear that it is going on to a disclosure-based type  of

investment  regulations  for the people,  rather  than  merit

based,  because  whenever  the Government  tries  to  be  too

paternalistic  about  this, it is  always  the  case  of  the

investors saying that if they make money, it is through their

own  diligence and smartness.  And whenever they lose  money,

it  is  the  Government's  fault, and  I  do  not  think  any

government can be in that position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I can understand the reasoning behind

the settlement.  You pay 1 1/2% to them or you pay more to the

lawyer anyway.  I say that as a lawyer.  But I think that the

point  DPM  made  about moral wrong must be emphasised.   The

satisfaction  of going to court sometimes is to  say  to  the

other  side that you have done wrong.  And even if we do  not

go  to court, I think that point must be made clear, from the

people  of Singapore to the authorities in Malaysia.  We  may

pay  1 1/2%  to get rid of a thug, just as I, in  a  New  York

park, gave my wallet to a mugger, but I have been mugged.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Mr Tay may have been mugged,

but we made a deal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,

it leaves me with very little time before the guillotine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether the 75% ownership

limit for transfer of assets between associated companies can

be lowered to 51%, and whether the Government can free up tax

regulations  to  encourage  mergers  and  acquisitions.    Mr

Inderjit  Singh  has also expressed similar  views.   I  have

already   discussed  some  of  these  points  in  my   Budget

Statement, in which I said that there will be relief  on  the

transfer  of assets between associated companies at  the  75%

level.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>

granted this in recognition that there are legitimate  merger

and  acquisition transactions and therefore we need  to  make

this concession.  However, moving it down from 75% to 51%  is

going  a bit too far at this stage, but that we will take  it

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOF policies are motivated by different considerations.

Whilst  it  is generally true that we would like our  smaller

companies  to bulk up and become large in order  to  compete,

there  are other commercial reasons why companies merge.   So

we cannot go overboard and make too many concessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all mergers and acquisitions, trading stock can be

transferred  at  cost,  as long as it  becomes  part  of  the

trading  stock  of the transferee company.   The  transferred

company is not required to transfer the trading stock at  the

open  market  price.  For other assets, any  gains  from  the

transfer of such assets are usually regarded as capital gains

and are thus not taxable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has criticised the role of GLCs and made

some  rather  startling comments about GLCs  being  generally

predatory,  have  deep pockets but  shallow  ideas.   I  have

heard  something to this effect, but not quite in such  stark

terms.  Perhaps he could give me more details so that  I  can

follow  them up.  Because if it were true, it would be   most

unfortunate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran is also concerned that many GLCs have in

the   past  gone  into  downstream  non-core  businesses   in

competition with our SMEs.   This, unfortunately, was true in

the  past.   But  Temasek Holdings has now  come  down  quite

strongly   against  GLCs  which  strayed  from   their   core

businesses  and I think, in future, GLCs will be  scrutinised

carefully to ensure that they do not venture into areas where

their  presence  is  not necessary and their  competition  is

unhelpful.   Basically, we would like our GLCs,  particularly

the  larger ones, to seek their fortunes overseas  where  the

markets are much larger, and they are better placed to do so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>

because of their assets and their capacity to expand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of group relief was raised by both Mr

Inderjit  Singh and Mr Leong Horn Kee.  This is  a  very  old

subject which has been raised many times.  Mr Inderjit  Singh

also  made  many recommendations for the reform  of  our  tax

system  which I will take into consideration.   But  at  this

point of time, I have to say that I am still not in favour of

general group relief, although in specific instances, we have

allowed   it,  particularly  when  we  recognise   that   the

applicants  have  legitimate reasons for doing  so.   Members

will  be  interested to know that group relief is not allowed

in  many countries in the region.  Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea

and Taiwan do not allow it.  It is only allowed in UK and US.

In countries where it is allowed, very tough regulations have

been  introduced  to ensure that tax leakage  does  not  take

place.  So I am not sure that group relief is something which

we want to introduce at this point of time.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the

implications  of  e-commerce on our tax structure.   This  is

indeed a very serious problem which is not just of concern to

us  but to many countries in the world, including the US, UK,

Australia,  Canada  and  the European  Union.   It  is  being

studied by all tax authorities because the possibility of tax

leakage  is huge and no one, unfortunately, knows the answer.

For  the  time  being, the volume of cross-border  e-commerce

area  is not very large. Where e-commerce takes place  within

the confines of a country, then tax is not a problem.  It  is

when  transactions  take place across borders  that  problems

arise.  I  can  assure  Members that MOF  is  monitoring  the

situation  very carefully.  As far as Singapore is concerned,

we  believe  that tax leakage through e-commerce is  not  yet

significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that we allow angel

investors to write off losses incurred when their investments

fail  against their personal income tax.  Mr Singh's  concern

is already addressed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>

under  the  Technopreneur Investment Initiative (TII),  which

was  introduced in September 1999.  The TII aims to alleviate

difficulties  faced by high-tech style companies  in  raising

funds  at  the  start-up stage. Under the  TII,  an  eligible

investor,  which  can be either a company or  an  individual,

will  enjoy tax deduction for any loss arising from the  sale

of  qualified  shares  held in approved  start-ups  within  a

qualifying  disposal period, or from the liquidation  of  the

start-up.   The  investor  can  offset  the  losses  incurred

against  his taxable income in the current year of loss.   In

the  event  the  investor's income at  current  year  is  not

sufficient to absorb the total loss, the unabsorbed loss  can

be  carried forward indefinitely to offset his taxable income

in future years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current tax system draws a distinction between

payments which are capital in nature against those which  are

revenue.    Expenses   incurred   in   start-up   phase   are

unfortunately  considered to be capital  in  nature  and  are

therefore not allowable for tax claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee stock options (ESOPs) were raised by Mr

Inderjit  Singh  and Mr Leong Horn Kee. They  have  suggested

that  we should be much more generous in allowing tax  relief

for  ESOPs.   I have indicated in my earlier speech  that  we

will  be  examining this issue in detail and an  announcement

will  be  made  by  end  May  this  year.   We  welcome   any

suggestions   put  forward  and  all  will  be   taken   into

consideration very seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro-family and procreation tax incentives were raised by

Dr  Jennifer  Lee  and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  Mrs  Lim  suggested

allowing  procreation  tax  incentives  to  be  extended   to

husbands  of  women  who  choose  to  stop  work  temporarily

following  child  birth. She has also  suggested  that  child

relief  be increased and Dr Jennifer Lee has supported  these

proposals.  I should point out that there are already several

tax  reliefs  and  rebates to encourage  family  support  and

family formation.  Tax relief serves as a form of recognition

and  is  not  intended to fully compensate for the taxpayer's

expenses incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Asia-Pacific region has been through a series

of  political upheavals and economic meltdown.   Old  leaders

like Suharto have been swept away.  Old icons are gone.   Old

paradigms are no longer valid or relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a new millennium. A new year. The

strategic  parameters have changed.  At the  same  time,  the

situation has somewhat stabilised, after the election of  Gus

Dur  as  the President of Indonesia.  The sense of crisis  is

not so pronounced, though not all issues have been resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then can we make of this new scenario? Where are

the  new  fault lines?  How has the balance of power shifted?

What are the interests and agendas of the big powers like the

United States, China and Japan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the questions and issues I wish to

pose to the Minister.  What is the Minister's reading of  the

current strategic situation?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chinese words for crisis wei chi show, where

there  are  dangers, there are also ample  opportunities.   I

believe  that  Singapore has done  well  and  is  in  a  much

stronger position after the crisis.  By comparison, Singapore

has   emerged  stronger  economically,  remained  politically

cohesive and has the resources to continue to upgrade our own

defence capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, though small, is like the mouse deer: nimble,

agile and strong, able to deal with any tricky situation, and

able to fight back too, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Dr Habibie liked to call Singapore the "tiny

red  dot".  I think he is mistaken.  It is the mighty  beacon

of  light,  shining across the seas for all to see.   But  we

have  to  be  vigilant.  Today's friends  may  be  tomorrow's

enemies.  Nations have no permanent friends or enemies,  only

permanent interests.  And, if I may add, interests may change

over  time.   May  I therefore ask the Minister  what  useful

roles  can  Singapore, as a small country,  play  to  promote

peace,  stability and economic development in our own  region

while at the same time remain vigilant and watchful.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, it might be useful for me to respond to his question on

the  strategic  situation before Members  speak  on  specific

country-related topics.  As to his request for my reading  on

the  strategic situation, I would like to start off by saying

that  the  backdrop  for  our assessment  of  the   strategic

situation is the state of the triangular relationship between

United States, China and Japan.  As I have said in this House

before,  this  relationship  is  critical  for  the  external

environment   in   South   East  Asia.    Fortunately,   this

relationship  is stable for now, but there are  stresses  and

strains  which  could  pose  a  challenge  to  security   and

stability in the Asia-Pacific and it may be useful for me  to

briefly  touch  on  the various aspects  of  this  triangular

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take United States and China relations, which is

the key aspect of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>

triangle,  I  would say that last year, as a  result  of  the

rough  patch  which US-China relationship went through,  this

was  a  worrisome  aspect, particularly as a  result  of  the

bombing  of  the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as well  as  the

failure  to  conclude the United States-China  WTO  agreement

when  Premier Zhu Rongji visited the United States in May  of

1999.    However,  with  the  conclusion  of   the   US-China

negotiations on the WTO more recently, I think we can say the

relations  are  generally back on track  but  there  are  two

issues  which  potentially can seriously affect the  US-China

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Taiwan issue and, second, the granting of

Permanent  Normal  Trade Relations (PNTR) for  China  by  the

United States.  The Taiwan issue is the most sensitive  issue

which  could derail US-China relations.  The stakes are high.

And  we  must  remember  that this is  a  year  of  political

transitions  - with the Presidential elections in  Taiwan  as

well  as in the United States and, therefore, it is important

for  all parties - China, Taiwan and the United States  -  to

make  even  greater effort to keep temperatures low,  and  to

keep relations on an even keel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore hope that all parties will avoid words and

deeds  that  could  potentially lead to an explosive  outcome

which  will  not  be in the interest of all  of  us,  not  in

Taiwan's  interest, not in China's interest, not in America's

interest or the region's interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the Clinton Administration is aware of

the  importance  of  granting PNTR to China.   It  is  making

tremendous efforts to get Congressional approval for PNTR for

China.   We  hope  that the Administration  will  succeed  in

persuading  Congress  because  the  conclusion  of  the   WTO

agreement with China was a very important milestone.  China's

decision  to  join  WTO  is  significant.   It  represents  a

political and strategic decision to integrate itself into the

globalised  world economy. It also demonstrated a  high-level

commitment   to  continue  necessary  but  painful   domestic

reforms.  By concluding the agreement, the US has shown  that

it understands the importance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>

of integrating China into the world economy, and the benefits

to US business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next aspect of the triangle of course is the US-Japan relationship which, I would say, remains strong. The

US-Japan alliance still serves the interests of both parties.

However,  its  future orientation will  be  affected  by  the

domestic  mood  in  Japan  as well as  regional  geopolitical

environment.  We believe that Japan has a key role to play in

the  region  because  of its economic  strength.   Japan  was

active  in  helping  countries in Asia during  the  financial

crisis.  Over the longer term, Japan can play a greater  role

in  the  region,  within the context  of  a  strong  US-Japan

security alliance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third side of the triangle, the Japan-China

relations, they are also an important part.  There are  signs

that  they are trying to move their relations forward.   They

made  significant  progress during  Prime  Minister  Obuchi's

visit  to  China in 1999.  Both countries wish to  set  their

relations on the path of joint cooperation which is good  for

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought we should also mention an interesting

development that there are  signs of warming ties  among  the

Northeast  Asian  powers - China, Japan and the  Republic  of

Korea.  The leaders of these three countries, in fact, had  a

historic  meeting  at the fringes of the  ASEAN+3  Summit  in

Manila  in  November last year, and this was followed  up  by

other meetings.  For example, their Environment Ministers met

twice  in  Seoul  and  Beijing  to  discuss  cooperation   in

environmental  protection.   I  think  this  is  a   positive

development,  if the drawing together of the Northeast  Asian

powers results in rapprochement, the reduction of tensions in

Asia,  and the reinforcement of the US-China-Japan triangular

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengthening of this triangular relationship

between  the  United  States, China and Japan  will  help  to

ensure  a peaceful and stable balance of power in the region.

The US' role is the key to the regional balance. As you know,

Singapore  has  continued to reiterate the  importance  of  a

continued  US presence in the region.  It is the  pre-eminent

power in the region,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>

and  in the world, and only it can ensure that the triangular

relationship remains stable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, in our view, has historically played an

important  role in Asia.  It was so in the years after  World

War  II.  After the Cold War, the role remains important.   A

stable strategic environment in Asia is a pre-requisite for a

prosperous  Asia but which is buttressed by open markets  and

competition.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having given this backdrop of the strategic situation,

let  me also say that there are potential flash points  which

we  need  to  manage very carefully.  I have  mentioned  this

previously,  but  to  update Members,  first,  there  is  the

potential  flash  point of the South China  Sea.   The  South

China  Sea remains a potential flash point because there  are

so many claimant states of various islands, atolls and reefs,

and we saw during the past year some incidents involving some

of  the  claimant  states, not only between  Philippines  and

China,  but  also between ASEAN claimant states, namely,  the

Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.  I do not think  there  is

any  immediate danger of outbreak of hostilities.  But  there

is  always  a concern that accidents can happen,  and  it  is

important therefore that claimant states continue to act with

restraint  to  settle  their differences  peacefully  without

resort  to  use  of  force and, more  importantly,  from  the

viewpoint   of  non-claimant  states  like  us,  to   respect

international laws concerning navigational routes and freedom

of passage.  The ASEAN Regional Forum, I might add, is trying

to work out a code of conduct for the South China Sea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another flash point is South Asia. Relations between

India and Pakistan took a downward turn in the past year over

the  Kargil conflict in May 1999, Pakistan's Chief  Executive

Musharraf's  assumption of power in  November  1999  and  the

hijack of the Indian Airline's plane in December.  Since both

countries have nuclear weapons, events in the region  clearly

could  have reverberations for the rest of Asia, if  not  the

world, at large.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Korean Peninsula also is a potential flash point and

remains unpredictable.  Any tension can quickly escalate  and

can  affect  the rest of Asia, as was evident  by  the  naval

skirmishes  in the Yellow Sea last year between  North  Korea

and Japan, and between North Korea and South Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, efforts to improve the situation have

continued.   Most  notably, US-North  Korea  dialogues  which

started  in  September 1999 have been yielding some  positive

results, such as the de facto freeze in North Korea's missile

testing programme and the plans for North Korean Vice-Foreign

Minister to make the first high level visit from North  Korea

to  the  United  States.  South Korea  on  its  part  remains

committed to President Kim's 1998 Sunshine policy.  Japan  is

also looking to normalise relations with North Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another flash point, of course, is the cross-strait

tensions.   This  is  another area  of uncertainty.   Beijing

has, in the recently released White Paper on Taiwan, formally

made  it  known that it will resort to the use  of  force  if

Taipei  delays negotiations on reunification.  The  situation

is  likely to be aggravated by election politics in  the  US.

However,  since  the  release of the  White  Paper,  Beijing,

Taipei and Washington appear to have exercised restraint  and

not  escalated tensions further.  The role and approach taken

by  the  United States towards both Beijing and  Taipei  will

continue to be crucial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to sum up the strategic situation, I think we

can say that there are signs that Asia is recovering from the

financial crisis.  The triangular relationship among  US  and

China  remains  relatively stable but there continues  to  be

several  potential flash points which we need  to  watch  and

manage carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Dr Ong Chit Chung's question on the role of

Singapore  in  this  regard, I would  say,  first,  that  for

Singapore,  a  small  country, to  be  able  to  develop  and

progress  in  the  future, as we have done  in  the  past,  a

benign, favourable, stable external environment in the region

is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>

critical.   Therefore, we have an interest  in  ensuring  the

engagement  of  all  the key players in  as  many  forums  as

possible.   Thus,  Singapore's role  should  continue  to  be

helpful  in  ASEAN  plus three forums as  well  as  in  ASEAN

Regional Forum (ARF) to try to engage these critical  players

(United  States,  Japan and Korea) as  well  as  others  like

Russia,  Australia, New Zealand which are dialogue  partners,

to  sit  together  at the table and discuss  common  security

issues.   I  notice that there is a cut further down  on  the

ASEAN Regional Forum, and we can discuss further on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the ability of Singapore to be

alert  to changing trends, shifting currents, new alignments,

so  that we will not be caught by surprise - a point made  by

Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung himself.  This is absolutely  important.

International events, alliances and trends are never  static.

They  keep changing.  Singapore must be alert.  We must  note

changing trends, be able to adjust way ahead of time.  If  we

can  do  that, then I think we will be more prepared for  new

situations.  And as I have described, the strategic situation

this  year is quite different from what I described  in  last

year's Committee of Supply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, with your permission, could I

seek clarification from the Minister before we proceed to the

next cut?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the Minister for his very

comprehensive  answer.  But mainly about the  United  States'

role, many are worried that the US may not be so committed to

the  region or may not put all their attention and resources,

distracted  by domestic matters or by Euro or Mexico,  or  so

many  other places that they can engage itself in.  Recently,

there was this Williamsburg Conference in Singapore last week

when  the Foreign Minister and DPM also participated  in  the

Conference.  Is there any conclusion from this Conference and

what would be Singapore's stand on this particular issue?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The Williamsburg Conference discussed

many things, including the continued engagement, presence and

role of the United States in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>

Asia.  I was asked for my views on this matter.  DPM gave  an

important  keynote address exhorting the United  States  that

they should continue to play a key role in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just sum up the gist of the views we and I

expressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in my discussions with other Ministers in the

region  as  well  as  analysts, I  think  there  is  a  clear

expectation  and  consensus  that  the  United  States   will

continue  to  remain engaged in the region.  I do  not  think

anyone  seriously doubts that.  The question  really  is  the

nature of the United States' future role in Asia, whether  it

will  be  based  on consultation, working together  with  the

countries  in  the region and partnership, or as  some  doubt

from  time  to time, whether it will be unilateral imposition

of  views.   If  it is going to be on a partnership,  working

together  with the countries, then the question is:  what  is

going  to  be  the basis and foundation of that  partnership?

During the Cold War when the United States was engaged in the

region, there was a clear basis for that partnership.   There

were  clearly shared strategic interests due to the Cold  War

with  the Soviet Union.  But post-Cold War, it is very  clear

as  to what the other shared interests are.  Singapore's view

and  the views of many other countries in the region are that

there  are  fundamental interests for the  United  States  to

continue to be involved here, both economic interests as well

as  leadership  and globalisation, as well as  political  and

security issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the United States and the Clinton

administration understand the importance of their  engagement

in Asia.  The question is whether the American public and the

Congress have the same interest and the same view.  So  there

is  a  real  challenge, I think, for the US  policymakers  to

build a domestic consensus to support US' strategic interests

in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me about the future of United States'

military  presence  in the region which  we  and  many  other

countries  feel is critical for the maintenance of  stability

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>

the region, it is difficult to gaze into the crystal ball.  I

think they will continue to be here for some time.  What  are

the kinds of factors that might have impact on this?  Looking

at  long  term, I guess we can point to three  factors.   One

would  be the domestic mood in the United States.  I  do  not

think  that  there will be a push for isolationism.   But  if

there is a mood for retrenchment or cut-back, then that could

affect the extent to which United States' military troops can

be  abroad in various parts of the world.  The second  factor

could be, if tensions are eased on the Korean peninsula in  a

significant  way, remote though that may seem to  be  at  the

moment,  then this could have an impact on the United States'

presence  in  Japan, and that in turn can affect  the  United

States'  involvement in the region.  Thirdly, of  course,  is

the US-Japan Alliance which is critical.  The alliance, as  I

have said, is a strong one, but over time, some have wondered

whether  development in both US and Japan  could  lead  to  a

questioning  of  this alliance.  Would a  new  generation  of

leaders  in  Japan look at things in a different way?   These

are very long-term considerations.  But taking matters as  of

now,  I  think  the consensus and expectation of  the  United

States'  presence  will  continue  in  the  region  and  most

countries  in the region clearly consider the United  States'

presence in the past has been a critical factor for stability

and security in the region, and it will continue to be so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Thank you, Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia is our closest neighbour in a geographical

sense.   However,  we  may  not necessarily  be  the  closest

emotionally   or  politically.   It  has  been  a   love-hate

relationship  over  a  period  of  years.   In  the  web   of

circumstances, we must therefore expect ups and downs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the general elections behind them, we hope that the

Malaysian  leaders would be better able to focus on improving

bilateral ties.  There is some light at the end of the tunnel

on  the CLOB issue.  We have just heard this in this Chamber,

though  some  doubt it.  But no solution is yet in  sight  on

water, the Malaysian Railway land, airspace and Pedra Branca.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations between Singapore and Malaysia appear to be on

the  mend.  We can hope for the best, but we must always  not

be taken by surprise by any downturn at any time.  We have to

live  with  it.  I hope that Singapore will not again  become

the  scapegoat  or  whipping  boy  in  the  forthcoming  UMNO

Assembly and party elections round the corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask, in this context, the Minister on the

Government's  approach and strategy on how  to  handle  these

thorny issues in Singapore-Malaysia relationship, and on  how

problems of a bilateral kind could be resolved.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> "So near, yet so

far."   This  saying  perhaps sums up the  Singapore-Malaysia

relationship.    Singapore  and  Malaysia   are   next   door

neighbours.   In  fact,  we  are like  Siamese  twins  linked

together physically by a causeway and a bridge.  Yet, our two

countries'  relationship in recent times  has  been  drifting

further  and  further  apart.   I  sincerely  hope  that  the

relationship between Singapore and Malaysia shall  not  drift

even further apart.  We have drifted apart far enough.  It is

time for the two nations to sincerely seek ways and means  to

come   closer  together  for  the  mutual  benefit  of   both

countries.   Politicians on both sides of the  Causeway  must

come  out openly and declare that they want the two countries

to  cooperate and be friends.  The leaders of both  countries

have  talked enough.  It is time for both sides generally  to

show  that they want to cooperate and be friends.  For  this,

both countries must commit themselves on something concrete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, at one of the Budget debates, suggested that an

economic union be established between Singapore and Malaysia.

The  Sun,  a newspaper published in Petaling Jaya,  Selangor,

picked  up  my  suggestion and ran two articles.   The  Sun's

report showed that, while university lecturers, academics and

businessmen  in  Malaysia favoured the idea  of  an  economic

union, the Malaysian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>

politicians were strongly against the idea.  I do not know if

the  Malaysian  politicians  may  have  wrongly  mistaken  an

economic union for a political union.  An economic union does

not  involve the independent sovereignty of each state.  Each

state   maintains  its  sovereignty.   The   economic   union

envisages a lowering or doing away with tariffs.  There shall

be  a free movement of goods, services and people within  the

territories  of  the  union.   In  this  way,  more  economic

activities  shall be generated with more economic growth  for

both countries.  Both sides shall benefit economically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an economic union, at this point of time, is too big

a  step  for  the  Malaysian leaders to take,  then  I  would

suggest that the formation of an economic union be put  aside

for the time being and both sides agree on something smaller.

I  would suggest that the Singapore and Malaysian governments

embark   on  a  joint  project,  something  like  the  Suzhou

Industrial  Park in China.  I would suggest that the  project

be sited in Johor because of its close proximity to Singapore

and  its  availability  of land.  Both  sides,  I  hope,  are

agreeable  in principle and the details can surely be  worked

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea which Singapore can cooperate with Malaysia

is to extend the MRT line all the way from Woodlands to Senai

in  Johor, where the Senai Airport is situated.  The  linking

of the Singapore MRT to Johor would certainly boost movements

of  people  from  both  sides  of  the  Causeway.   Increased

communication means more business activities.  More  business

activities  mean more trade which can be beneficial  to  both

sides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above suggestions must never, for a moment, be given

the  wrong  impression that Singapore intends to exploit  the

resources  of Malaysia to enrich itself.  Genuine cooperation

cannot be for one-sided gain.  It must be for mutual benefit.

I  hope  both the Malaysian and Singaporean leaders  are  big

hearted   and  go  for  something  big  to  build  a  genuine

cooperation  and friendship between the two  countries.   The

present outstanding issues like the water agreements and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>

CLOB  issue shall then look insignificant.  They may not even

surface  as issues when real cooperation has been established

between the two countries.  I believe that Singapore must use

as much of its resources as possible to help Malaysia improve

its  economy and standard of living.  As long as there  is  a

wide  disparity  of  standards  of  living  between  the  two

countries, it is difficult for the two neighbours to live  in

harmony.   Therefore, it is to the interest of  Singapore  to

see  that the Malaysian economy improves as fast as  that  of

Singapore's economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, since last year,

various  leading  indicators  reported  by  Malaysia  clearly

suggested  that  our  neighbour was  on  the  way  to  robust

economic recovery.  This heartening news was boosted  by  the

latest   impressive  growth  figure  of  5.4%  which  further

confirmed that the Malaysian economy did well in 1999 and the

positive trend is expected to continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such good news certainly puts all of us in an

optimistic  mood, including Mr Chiam.  But will  Singaporeans

be  overly  optimistic  to  look forward  to  improvement  in

bilateral relations with our neighbour now that the Malaysian

economy is looking bouyant?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of years, we have been at the

receiving  end  of  too  many  incredulous  accusations   and

allegations thrown at us from across the Causeway.   We  were

blamed  for  Malaysia's economic woes,  blamed  for  economic

sabotage,  blamed  for the CIQ issue,  blamed  for  the  CLOB

issue,  blamed  for giving too much publicity  to  the  Anwar

case.   The  list simply goes on and on.  In fact,  Singapore

has become such a regular bogeyman in the Malaysian political

landscape  that  I  am  not surprised  if  Singaporeans  have

actually come to expect Singapore bashing to be in the nature

of bilateral relationships between the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would very much like to take a more optimistic

approach  in Singapore-Malaysia relations.  I would  like  to

think, as the Malaysian economy improves, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>

neighbour  would  see  benefit  in  establishing  a   win-win

relationship with us, based on mutual cooperation and  mutual

respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore greatly disappointed to find my optimism

misplaced.  The recent spate of strongly worded letters  from

Mr  Malik  Tahir of Malaysia was a rude shock  and  a  timely

reminder that some Malaysians still view Singapore with  deep

acrimony.  Worse, Mr Malik's letters give the impression that

Singapore-Malaysia   relations  are   perceived   by   Malay-Malaysians  in  racial terms.  His use of emotive  words  and

phrases like khianat (treason), high animosity, high level of

hatred  by  many Malay-Malaysians towards Singapore  and  his

pointed  emphasis that Singapore would always  be  a  younger

brother  to Malaysia and his undisguised threat that Malaysia

should  terminate the water agreement and any other  contract

that are good for Singapore, certainly make it difficult  for

Singaporeans  to  respond in any other  way  to  his  letters

except in annoyance and anger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was and am still disturbed by Mr Malik Tahir's

letter.   Because of the depth of the emotions  expressed,  I

cannot  help  but  wonder if Mr Malik's letter  typifies  the

general   feelings  of  Malay-Malaysians  towards  Singapore.

Perhaps,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs might be  able  to

give  this  House his Ministry's assessment of this question.

If Mr Malik Tahir's letter did typify the general feelings of

Malay-Malaysians towards Singapore, surely,  this  must  have

implications on the way Singapore deals with Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like the Minister to keep this

House  current  on  the  present state of  Singapore-Malaysia

relations,   particularly  with   respect   to   the   latest

development  on the CIQ issue and also on the Singapore-Johor

bridge   that   the  Malaysians  propose  to  construct.    I

understand  from  press reports that the Prime  Minister  has

been  briefed  by the Malaysians during his recent  visit  to

Johor.   Perhaps, the Minister could give us some details  on

the proposed Johor-Singapore bridge as well as to give us  an

idea

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>

whether Singapore can expect any improvement in the bilateral

relations with Malaysia in the foreseeable future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, like my colleague before me, I am

equally  disturbed by Mr Malik Tahir's letter to the Business

Times  recently and his commentary on the state of  relations

with Malaysia.  In his letter, Mr Tahir sought to explain why

there  is,  according to him, a high level  of  hatred  among

Malay-Malaysians towards Singapore.  I find  the  explanation

given  by  Mr  Tahir somewhat amusing, if not  bizarre.   His

explanations,  simply  stated, are  based  on  perception  of

wrongdoing  on  the  part of Singapore and its  relationship.

What are some of these reasons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he said we published pictures of Anwar in our

newspapers  and  this seemed like an unfriendly  act,  as  if

these  pictures were not published in their local newspapers.

Secondly,  Mr Tahir said that we sabotaged Malaysian  economy

by  short-selling, as if he did not realise that this  is  an

endemic  problem with many stock exchanges around the  world.

Thirdly,  he  said that our failure to control high  interest

rates  resulted in a flight of capital from the country.   Mr

Tahir  does  not seem to know that our MAS does  not  control

interest rates here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tahir's tone in his letter is somewhat for the

belligerent.  He made at least two references to war  in  his

letter.   There  was  also  a cavalier  attitude  about  this

message, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore has chosen through this route of subtle

annoyance of Malay Malaysians (regardless of whether it is in

response  to Malaysia's initial acts) and we Malay  Malaysian

panglimas accept the challenge."



In  a  subsequent  letter,  Mr Tahir  actually  thought  that

Singapore-Malaysian  relations  should  be  premised  on  the

principle  of abang-adik relationship, that is,  Malaysia  is

the  abang  and  Singapore  is the adik.   This  relationship

suggests  that  Singapore must always play the  part  of  the

humble  supplicant seeking approval for its conduct from  the

elder brother at all times.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our repeated explanations, I am saddened

that  we  still  have  people like Mr Tahir  expressing  such

perverse   views   about  our  intentions.    Such   opinions

unfortunately  arise  at  least  from  a  lack  of   balanced

information  going  to the masses.  I certainly  hope  indeed

that the perception and attitude of Mr Tahir is not shared by

his  fellow Malaysians.   Mr Tahir must recognise and  accept

that  Singapore is an independent sovereign country.  We  are

not  beholden to anyone, neither do we have to be servile  to

anyone  in  our dealings.  If that is the expectation  of  Mr

Tahir, I am sad to say he will be disappointed indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, is whether the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs is doing more to put clearly across to the Malaysians

so that we will be better understood.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, Singapore-Malaysia

relations  have been described as close neighbours living  in

semi-detached houses.  What one neighbour does may affect the

other.   There  seems to be some truth there judging  by  the

occasional bickerings and disputes between the two countries.

It  is  a fact of life that even in a close-knit relationship

there  would be differences as long as both parties agree  to

advance   areas  of  mutual  benefits  and  interests   while

promoting  individual national interests.  We can  still  see

progress in our bilateral relations.  But one thing  must  be

stressed, that is, our bilateral relations must be  based  on

mutual  respect  and equality, not one of "big  brother-small

brother" relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the indignation of our two colleagues, Mr

Charles Chong and Mr Sin Boon Ann, over the letters and views

expressed  by  Mr  Malik  Tahir,  a  Malay-Malaysian  in  our

newspapers.  I do not think that is the kind of statement  we

would like to see from our neighbours and definitely, we look

forward to a more stable, respectful relationship between our

two  countries.  And what we would like to see least  is  the

souring  of  relationship of the ordinary people of  Malaysia

and  Singapore.  We have seen some progress in our  bilateral

relations  with  Malaysia with the  settlement  of  the  CLOB

issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the

outstanding issues between Singapore and Malaysia  which  the

two  Prime Ministers have agreed to settle as a package.  How

much  progress  have  we  made  in  settling  the  issues  of

continued   water  supply  for  Singapore,  the  CIQ,   joint

development  of  the Tanjong Pagar Railway  Station  and  the

Malayan Railway Land, claims over Pedra Branca, withdrawal of

CPF  savings  of  West  Malaysian workers  and  the  use  and

management of air space?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to think

and  hope  that  Mr  Malik Tahir does not represent  a  large

majority  of  Malaysians.  Neither am I as optimistic  as  Mr

Chiam about our state of bilateral relations with Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past one year, relations between Singapore and

Malaysia,   in   my  view,  have  been  both  difficult   and

problematic.   I think it will continue to be  difficult  and

unpredictable.   Yet,  when I look at the  Budget  Statement,

under  the  operating expenditure budget, while  it  is  made

specifically  clear  that  there  will  be  higher  operating

contributions  to  international  organisations  and  foreign

technical  assistance programme, there is no mention  of  any

specific programme or funding, especially on one of our  most

problematic areas, relations with our immediate neighbour.  I

am  asking  for special attention to be given to this  matter

because I think more can and should be done to develop a more

sustainable people-to-people relationship. While relations at

the   political   level  are  important,  it   is   at   best

unpredictable  as it will be determined largely  by  domestic

agenda.  Singapore can and has become a convenient  political

scapegoat.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have a common history with Malaysia, it does

not mean that we will continue to see things the same way  or

from  a  similar  perspective as we become more  and  more  a

product  of  our  own distinctly different environment,  that

even  the  same family with members in Malaysia and Singapore

will find that they differ in outlook, attitude, social

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>

and   political  values.   In  my  view,  the  inability   to

appreciate these differences has been and will continue to be

a   source  of  difficult  problems  between  Singapore   and

Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think people-to-people relationship can be

better  enhanced.  I suppose we have no other choice  because

one  thing  we  cannot change is our geography.   I  am  also

requesting for more and generous funding to institutions like

the  Singapore  International Foundation  and  the  Singapore

Institute  of International Affairs and other civic societies

so  as  to  allow them to develop programmes that would  help

bilateral  relations.  New technologies allow civil societies

to  be better connected and the growth of civil societies  in

our neighbouring countries makes this a potentially effective

vehicle to develop better relations between our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, sometimes you need money to make

friends,  especially in this instance.  For example,  members

of  civil  society  can  tell you  how  embarrassing  it  can

sometimes  be  when  they are unable to reciprocate  visiting

groups  from neighbouring countries with the same  generosity

and  hospitality.   Ironically, for civil  societies,  it  is

usually easier to obtain funds from foreign institutions than

from  local  donors.  Besides, there are other  uncomfortable

implications  for civil societies to obtain foreign  funding.

With  more  money, civil societies can help enhance cultural,

educational  and sports exchange because it is  only  through

people  that  we  are  able  to  let  others  have  a  better

perception  of  us.   Because what  others  think  of  us  is

important, although ultimately, it is who we really are  that

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, a lot of the perceptions of who we are

depend  on  what our neighbours hear from their  leaders  and

what  they read in the media.  Very often, this is less  than

complimentary.   For  example,  when  we  meet,  say,  for  a

business  meeting, for someone who does not have the  benefit

of   a  personal  relationship,  he  is  more  likely  to  be

influenced  by  the  political stance  adopted  by  political

leaders.  People are going to look for signs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>

signals and gestures as an indication of their attention  and

commitment to this issue and I therefore urge the Minister to

allocate  the  required resources through civil societies  to

enable  a larger group of Singaporeans to be effectively  and

actively  involved  in  this  process  of  developing  better

relations with our neighbours.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore's relations with

Indonesia  have improved significantly after  Dr  Habibe  was

replaced  by  President Abdul Wahid. We want  to  be  a  good

neighbour  of  Indonesia, another close  neighbour.  We  wish

Indonesia  all  the  best,  and  hope  Indonesia,  under  the

leadership of President Abdul Wahid will have a new beginning

in the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent crisis, Singapore has willingly given

support  and economic assistance to Indonesia. May I ask  how

and  to  what extent has the economic package of  loans  been

utilised?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Indonesian situation has changed radically.

President Abdul Wahid is asserting his leadership vigorously,

while  the  military  is in retreat politically.   There  are

religious  riots  and local independence  movements  in  many

parts  of  Indonesia.  One wonders who would ultimately  call

the shots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some analysts have speculated that Indonesia might break

up,  with  various regions competing for power, for  example,

Aceh  and  Irian  Jaya. I hope not.  We  want  a  stable  and

prosperous Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for his assessment of the

Indonesian  situation and its impact on  bilateral  relations

and, furthermore, very recently, very close to our shores, we

have  demonstrations and riots in Bintan and  Batam.   Can  I

know  how  that  would affect our investments in  the  nearby

islands?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there is no problem in the

Indonesia-Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>

relationship.  It was just going on fine until we read in the

papers  that  trouble  has erupted  in  Bintan  Island  where

Singaporeans have investments there.  Apparently, the problem

was the compensation paid to the villagers for their land was

not enough. The villagers want more compensation. They rioted

and  staged sit-ins and threatened that if their demands were

not met, some drastic action shall be taken by them.  Student

leaders  from  Jakarta took up their cause  and  helped  them

organise  the sit-ins and their demands for compensation  for

their land.  That incident highlights the serious problem  of

investing  in  Bintan  and  the other  islands  in  the  Riau

Archipelago.   The  incident alone  highlights  the  seething

problems  in Bintan and the other Riau islands. When people's

stomachs  are  empty, there shall always be problems.  Future

would-be  investors may not want to put their money in  those

islands if the situation in those islands does not improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the situation in the Riau islands

shall  not  improve since the central Government  has  enough

problems  in  its  hands.  We have  read  of  the  break-away

problems  in  Aceh and other parts of Indonesia.  Indonesians

appear  to  have  been  angry at the  Timorese  for  claiming

independence  for  themselves.  But at  heart,  they  may  be

happier  for not having to continue to subsidise that country

anymore.   It  is  a  great strain on  their  already  scarce

financial resources to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such are the circumstances in Indonesia, the

Indonesians  may be amicable to a suggestion by Singapore  to

lease  to  Singapore  one  of the  Riau  islands  nearest  to

Singapore.   I  know  this  is a very  sensitive  issue.   If

wrongly  handled,  it  could  cause  a  lot  of  problems  in

Singapore's dealings with Indonesia.  Singapore must make  it

clear  to  Indonesia that it does not want to annex the  Riau

islands  or  any  of  the nearby islands to  Singapore.   The

suggestion is purely a business suggestion which can  benefit

both parties.  The suggestion is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) One of the main islands, either Bintan or Batam be

leased to Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>

for,  say, 99 years or longer at a price to be negotiated  or

based   on  a  valuation  by  a  firm  of  land  valuers   of

international repute;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon leasing the island to Singapore, Singapore

shall have the full charge and control over it which includes

all security matters; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Indonesian citizens shall be allowed to travel

freely  in  and out of the island so that they shall  not  be

deprived  of working there or start business in that  island,

subject  to  the  right  by Singapore to  stop  criminals  or

trouble-makers and bad elements from entering the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if such an arrangement can be made, the economic

benefits  accruing to that island and the ripple  effects  to

the  neighbours shall be tremendous.  Singapore  is  a  small

island  and  needs  more land for its population  growth  and

Indonesia  is  cash-strapped. The leasing of  one  island  to

Singapore  is  beneficial to both countries  and  it  can  be

nothing  but  a win-win situation. The Indonesians  must  not

take  the  move  as  Singapore wanting to colonise  the  Riau

Archipelago, or to win concessions from them.  But  it  is  a

purely  business view between two countries and  they  should

take it in that light.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, let me touch on the recent

situation   in   Bintan  in  respect  of  Singapore-Indonesia

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent riots in Bintan is a setback for Indonesia in

its bid to attract more foreign investors into the country to

play  its part in economic recovery.  It is unfortunate  that

foreign parties with investment in that island got caught  up

in what appears to be a domestic issue, that is, the people's

unhappiness with the compensation given by a local party  for

the  loss  of their land. Some quarters have pointed  to  the

shady  outside  hands being involved as part of  the  overall

plan  to  destabilise President Abdurrahman  Wahid's  regime.

The truth may, however, never be known.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riots raised serious concerns over the ability of

the Government to provide safety and security for the foreign

investors. The Indonesian Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>

has  asked us for assistance in procuring foreign investments

for  the country.  Unfortunately, the recent riots in  Bintan

have failed to inspire much confidence in investors.  If  our

Government  intends  to promote Singaporeans'  investment  in

Indonesia in general, and in Riau in particular, there  is  a

corresponding duty, I believe, on the part of our  Government

to  seek  more solid assurance from the Indonesian Government

that  law  and safety to both life and property will  not  be

placed at risk through riots and mayhem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that our policy has always been one of

non-interference with the way others govern and manage  their

internal  problems.   However, in this  instance,  I  believe

there is some expectation from foreign investors on the  part

of the Indonesian Government to do more to protect investors.

Unlike Mr Chiam, and I do not think the solution is to  lease

the island from the Indonesian Government because, apart from

leasing  the  island,  you have to deal  with  the  long-term

problem  of people inhabiting the island for long periods  of

time.  And what to do when the island finally reverts to  the

Indonesian authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Indonesian

government  has  given  our Government  better  assurance  of

protection of life and property and, if so, what details have

been decided upon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, in the case of

Singapore-Malaysia  relations,  I  asked  the  Minister   for

Foreign  Affairs for time, money and effort to  assist  civil

society to bridge people-to-people relationship.  In the case

of  Indonesia, the situation is such that I can only ask  the

Minister  for  more time, more money and more help  to  civil

society to do exactly the same.  I think civil society has  a

large  capacity, will and enthusiasm to help.   But  I  think

money in the pocket will really help.  We have seen how civil

society  groups,  like  UNIFEM, that  is  a  group  of  local

doctors,  have helped, on their own initiative  to  meet  the

chronic needs of medicine and food in places like Bintan.  So

I  can  only  repeat  my call for the Minister  to  give  his

special attention to civil society groups.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> It is widely believed that the

political   situation  in  Indonesia,  one  of  our   closest

neighbours, has improved since the Presidential election  was

held  at  the  end of 1999. The fear of a military  coup  has

subsided  the  racial and religious strife in  the  different

areas  in Indonesia has reduced somewhat and the economy  has

shown  signs of recovery.  But Singaporeans have  reasons  to

continue  to  be  concerned about the  political  development

there as political and economic instability in Indonesia will

have  implications on the stability and economic  development

of our region, and indeed Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that similar questions have been asked before but

considering  the importance of the issue to Singapore,  would

the  Minister  give  his  assessment  of  the  political  and

security situation in Indonesia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move to the situation in Batam and Bintan, where

much of the investments from Singapore is located.  With  the

substantial Singaporean investments in Bintan and  Batam,  it

was  with  concern  that  I read the  press  reports  on  the

threatening  situation in Bintan just a little  more  than  a

month ago, and I listened to questions raised and answered on

the  issue  in our last Parliamentary debate in February.   I

agree  with the Minister for Trade and Industry that much  of

the  solution  to what happened in Bintan and,  I  would  add

Batam  too, depends on the Indonesian government.   I  am  in

admiration of the strength of President Abdurrahman Wahid  in

facing the herculean task of forging a new path for Indonesia

in  the  aftermath of not only the economic crisis, but  also

the  adjustment to a new political era.  I have no doubt that

he would prevail given time and the support of his people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that, even when the President succeeds to

stabilise  this  situation, we will face the  situation  that

whatever  changes  that occur in the political  landscape  of

Indonesia may impact, in varying degrees, on the two  islands

and  on Singapore investors there.  In seeking protection for

our investors, perhaps, we could look at ways whereby

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>

the  Government could assist in some way to limit the  impact

of   political  ripples  in  Indonesia  on  investments  from

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the two governments work out an arrangement that

could  help our investors operate in a condition of sustained

peace  and  stability where investments are  given  an  added

protection? This arrangement, I believe, should benefit  both

Singapore and Indonesia, and the workers on the two  islands.

Needless  to say, for Singaporeans, there is added protection

and an assurance that these problems will not recur.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, before I proceed, can I seek

your permission to seek some clarification from Mr Chiam  who

has  made two very interesting proposals today?  Mr Chiam has

talked  about having an economic union with Malaysia, in  the

first  instance,  and then proposed that  we  lease  a  whole

island  from  Indonesia.  May I ask whether  he  proposes  to

lease  the  island  first or to have an economic  union  with

Malaysia  first?  And does he realise that it is so difficult

just  to operate an industrial park, whether it is in Bintan,

Batam  or Suzhou?  How then does he propose to lease a  whole

island  from  an  independent  and  sovereign  country   like

Indonesia  which has tremendous pride in its own country  and

sovereignty?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, when he spoke about an economic union with

Malaysia,  he  seems  to blame Singapore  for  having  a  gap

between   Singapore's  standard  of  living  and   Malaysia's

standard  of  living.  Are we to be blamed if the  Malaysia's

standard  of living is lower than that of Singapore?   Is  he

proposing that we Singaporeans lower our standard of  living,

so  that  we are on the same common denominator as Malaysia's

standard  of living so that there will not be any problem  of

any kind?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, do you wish to reply?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am thinking of the long-term

effects  of  our relations with our neighbours.   As  I  have

said,  if there is always a disparity of standard of  living,

there  can  never  be real harmony between  neighbours.   One

neighbour  would  look at the other with great  jealousy  and

somehow  or other, trouble will be caused to us.  As  regards

our  present  relationship with Malaysia, we have  found   no

solution  at all to any of the outstanding issues.   Not  one

issue has been resolved.  Why is that so?  It would appear to

be  more politically motivated than really wanting to  settle

the  matter  and  be good neighbours.  I think  that  is  our

problem.   We must find ways and means of having a  long-term

stable  and good relationship with our neighbours.  Maybe  Dr

Ong  can  make better suggestions than I, but I think  if  we

look into this matter, maybe in one, two or a few years' time

something successful may come up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, please proceed with your topics.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore has sent a peace-keeping and support contingent to East Timor. We were among

the  first  wave which arrived at the shores of  East  Timor.

Our logistics support was excellent.  We are indeed proud  of

the Singaporean officers and men who have performed very well

in a very difficult situation and at such short notice too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister if this mission suggests that

there  will be more such missions or involvement by Singapore

in  other  parts of the world.  Do we have the  manpower  and

resources to mount and sustain such operations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On East Timor, Singapore can help in the reconstruction

and development of  the country through technical cooperation

and assistance, eg, in providing expert advice and programmes

on  training of the civil service, infrastructure development

and the management of airports and seaports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the UN is in place in East Timor and the

situation has stabilised

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>

somewhat,  will East Timor become independent soon and  apply

to  join  ASEAN?   What would be the stand of  Singapore  and

ASEAN if East Timor applies to join the ASEAN body?  How long

will it take the East Timorese to set up their infrastructure

and services and reorganise themselves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, East Timor has embarked on its route

to  recovery.   The  visual pictures on television,  however,

clearly show that there is not much of an infrastructure left

in the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations transitional administration on East

Timor  faces  an uphill task in rebuilding the  software  and

hardware for a new East Timor.  I am happy that Singapore has

contributed  significantly to-date to East Timor.   Singapore

has  shown its support to the United Nations by participating

in both the UNAMET and the present UNTAET.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF's logistics and medical supplies were well

utilised  for  the benefit of the people of East  Timor.   We

have  been  through the same process.  We had  been  a  young

nation  before  and  we  had undergone  a  similar  traumatic

experience when we left the bigger federation.  We have  also

faced  similar  economic and security  uncertainty  when  the

British pulled out.  Sir, we should empathise with the  needs

of  the  East  Timorese.  In fact, whether by coincidence  or

not,  both  Singapore  and  East  Timor  share  similar  nine

alphabets in their names, and I do not know whether  we  have

to undergo this painful process in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to study the

needs  of  the East Timorese and consider extending  as  much

assistance to the East Timorese, because East Timor is within

the  region and I think they will appreciate and remember who

are  their  friends who have helped them when  they  were  in

need.   I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  we  have

received  any  specific request or assistance from  the  East

Timorese  and  what  is  our response  and  whether  we  have

independently  offered any other form of  assistance  to  the

East Timorese.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I would like to ask similar

questions  as  my  two colleagues have done.   Singapore  has

helped  East Timor through our participation in international

peace keeping forces and through the UN.  How would Singapore

help East Timor in its preparation for independence and after

it  becomes a sovereign state?  Like Dr Ong, I would like  to

know  whether  Singapore would support  East  Timor  when  it

becomes independent and wants to join ASEAN.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore-Philippines relations

have  improved  tremendously in recent years, culminating  in

the  visit  to Singapore recently of the Philippines  Foreign

Secretary, Mr Domingo Siazon.  All parties appeared  to  have

buried their hatchet after the Flor Contemplacion's case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade and investments have increased significantly.

Within ASEAN, Singapore and the Philippines share much common

interests and there is a congruence of views on many things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Philippines can be a good ally and balance

within ASEAN.  May I therefore ask the Minister what more can

Singapore  do  in  terms  of promotion  of  bilateral  trade,

investment and cultural exchanges?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, it has been two years since Myanmar

joined  ASEAN.  I would like to ask the Minister to  give  an

update  as to what is the benefit and the problems that  have

arisen  as a result of admitting Myanmar into ASEAN and  also

to  give  us an update as to what has constructive engagement

by  ASEAN  resulted  as far as the internal  developments  in

Myanmar are concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, you can take your two cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore's relations with Japan

have been warm and friendly.  Japanese investments, trade and

technology  have been flowing in, and Japan has  the  biggest

expatriate community and largest Japanese school in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  Japanese presence also serves to balance that  of

the other regional powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many Japanese businessmen and managers like to be

posted  to Singapore.  They find Singapore comfortable,  safe

and an interesting city to live in.  I am sure, not least  of

all, many of them like to play golf in our many golf courses,

and also to mix with the local population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of bilateral relations, Singapore and Japan

would be examples extraordinaire of free trade in the region.

Singapore  and  Japan could cooperate closely in  free  trade

arrangements,  and  this  would possibly  inspire  the  other

neighbours to follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether there is any progress

with  regard  to the proposal on the free trade  arrangements

between Singapore and Japan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's relations with the People's Republic of

China have always been warm and positive.  Singaporeans  have

extensive  investments in China, and the Chinese  economy  is

growing.   At the same time, we have good trade and  economic

relations  with  Taiwan.  Indeed, some  of  the  cross-strait

conferences and meetings between the PRC and Taiwan were held

in Singapore.  We are friends to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation over the Strait of Taiwan is not

very  comforting.  China has issued a White Paper on  Taiwan,

which  is  undergoing a presidential election.   One  wonders

what  would happen to cross-strait relations.  Is  it  sabre-rattling  or will there be an exchange of blows and  missiles

across the Strait?  Many in Asia are alarmed by the prospects

of hostilities in the narrow strait, and the spillover effect

on us politically and economically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope that wise counsel will prevail and the

issues  can be resolved amicably.  I wish to ask the Minister

on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's stand on the cross-strait relationships and  what

impact  it has on trade and development, and whether  we  can

play a role in this relationship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the East Asia Latin America Forum

(EALAF) was the brainchild of our Prime Minister.  East  Asia

is  a  region of significant economic, political and security

importance.  It will also grow in greater importance and,  as

such, it is critical that East Asia maintains links with  all

parts  of the globe, with both individual countries and other

regions.  Similarly, Latin America and South America are fast

growing  regions.    They are also equally important  in  the

economic, political and security arena.  Sir, it is important

that  the  links  between  the  two  blocs  be  enhanced  and

strengthened.   I  would  like the Minister  to  outline  the

developments on EALAF and the future plans for  EALAF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, ASEAN, since its establishment,

has  provided  Singapore and other South East  Asian  nations

with  a good regional platform for internal consensus as well

as a springboard for dialogues with other regional bodies and

big  powers.  We are all indeed very proud and fond of ASEAN.

We say ASEAN this and ASEAN that, but times have changed.  Mr

Suharto was the anchor for ASEAN unity and stability for many

years,  but he has stepped down, and it signalled the end  of

an era for ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has indeed served us well. ASEAN has grown. It

is  still  growing,  growing and  growing.   But  it  is  now

somewhat  tattered  and in disarray.  The  question  is:  has

ASEAN  outgrown itself?  Does it still have a vital  role  to

play?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was the Chairman of the ASEAN Standing

Committee in the most difficult of times in the region.   May

I  ask  the  Minister  on how Singapore  helped  steer  ASEAN

through such troubled waters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of trade and investments, are there any

progress  with  the  ASEAN  investment  roadshows?    As   an

organisation  and with the benefit of recent  experience,  is

ASEAN better equipped and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>

organised  now  to  deal  with future outbreak  of  financial

crises or any other political issues that might crop up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I share the concerns of Dr Ong

Chit  Chung  on the future of ASEAN.  I had recently  browsed

through   several  news  databases  to  read  up  on   recent

developments concerning ASEAN.  And what surprised me was the

number  of articles written in the past year which questioned

the   credibility  of  the  organisation  and  its  continued

cohesiveness and relevance.  These articles have appeared  in

various  newspapers  in Hong Kong, Japan, Australia,  France,

among   others,  and  many  were  blunt  in  their  analyses,

highlighting  the so-called serious weaknesses in  ASEAN  and

casting doubts on ASEAN's potential to act positively to meet

future challenges.  ASEAN's credibility had been dented as  a

result  of its failure to respond to the economic turmoil  in

1997-1998 and was an issue our own Prime Minister and Foreign

Affairs  Minister had publicly alluded to at ASEAN  meetings.

It  is essential and urgent that all 10 ASEAN members address

the problem head on to restore confidence in the organisation

and  the  region.   This  will  reassure  investors  who  are

beginning to return to the region to take a longer term  view

of their presence here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to

update  the House on the steps ASEAN had adopted in the  past

year to rebuild its credibility and salvage its international

image.   What  are  some of the problems and  obstacles  that

ASEAN  faces  in  its  effort to restore and  strengthen  the

grouping's  reputation.  At the same time, will the  Minister

also  give  an  assessment  of the success  of  the  measures

implemented by ASEAN thus far?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, ASEAN has undergone severe stress

over  the  last two years.  The regional economic crisis  has

seriously dented its reputation.  New tensions between  ASEAN

countries  have appeared under the stress of the  crisis  and

many  have complained that ASEAN is seen as lacking  a  clear

vision and a common

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>

strategy of overcoming a common enemy in the economic crisis.

Sir,  further  questions have arisen as  to  whether  ASEAN's

expansion  with new members  who are at different  levels  of

economic  and political developments has made decision-making

in ASEAN clumsier and slower.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a serious question has arisen among other critics

as   to  whether  ASEAN  continues  to  remain  as  a  useful

organisation and as a beneficial forum for regional issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Minister served as the Chairman of the ASEAN

Standing Committee during the last year and presided over key

ASEAN  meetings.   I would like to ask the  Minister  whether

this  perception of ASEAN as an organisation in  disarray  is

justified.  Was the economic crisis the main cause of ASEAN's

problems and whether ASEAN can overcome these problems? Also,

whether there are existing mechanisms within ASEAN where even

bilateral problems can be resolved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> The recent economic crisis affected

each  ASEAN  country  differently  and  there  were  internal

developments that gave rise to frictions in relations between

certain   ASEAN  countries,  notably  in  relations   between

Singapore  and  Malaysia,  and to a certain  extent,  between

Singapore  and  Indonesia.   Sir,  each  ASEAN  country  also

responded  to  their crisis with different  solutions.   More

importantly,  it  appeared as if ASEAN, as a  regional  body,

either  did  not or could not react fast enough  to  aid  its

member nations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sense that each country acted independently

and  all  thoughts for regionalism were put in cold  storage,

only to be taken out at a more convenient time.  In contrast,

just  prior to the crisis, ASEAN regionalism appeared at  its

strongest  and  this was coupled with ASEAN's expansion  from

six  to  nine,  and then 10 members.  Despite  the  different

economic levels of development of the new members from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>

that  of  the  original six, it seems that ASEAN  was  strong

enough to adapt to these circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these recent events in mind, ASEAN states are

poised for steady growth.  What lessons have ASEAN drawn from

the economic crisis and what are the prospects of ASEAN as  a

regional  body in the 21st century.  In addition,  Sir,  what

were   the   highlights  of  achievements  of  ASEAN   during

Singapore's  tenure as ASEAN Standing Committee  Chairman  in

1999?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to Myanmar, with its admission into

ASEAN,  despite  strong objections from the  US  and  Europe,

ASEAN  states  went  ahead with the  policy  of  constructive

engagements  believing  that  an  international  solution  of

Myanmar  would  have  the opposite effect  on  any  hope  for

political  change  in the country.  In the last  three  years

since   Myanmar  joined  ASEAN,  has  ASEAN  been   able   to

successfully engage Myanmar?  What are the changes that  have

taken place in Myanmar that are in line with the objective of

ASEAN in admitting Myanmar into ASEAN?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)

is  an  important  security  architecture  for  multi-lateral

security   cooperation   and  dialogue.    ARF   has   firmly

established   the   mechanism  for  security   dialogue   and

confidence-building measures within the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARF also plays a pivotal role in relation with the

external  powers,  like the United States, China  and  Japan.

Indeed, some of these external powers use the ARF sessions to

meet each other and to float ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Desmond Ball of the Australian National University

wrote recently that the ARF has emerged as the centrepiece of

security  architecture in the region.  So far, so good.   But

ARF  should  move  beyond security dialogue  and  confidence-building  measures  to the next stage of conflict  prevention

and  preventive  diplomacy, whereby  incipient  problems  are

nipped in the bud.  May I ask if the Minister would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>

actively  encourage  ARF to take on new  directions  and  new

roles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the ARF has evolved as an informal,

consultative  and  consensus  building  forum.   Its  biggest

contribution has been enhancing  confidence among its members

and its dialogue partners.  The ARF has also played a pivotal

role  in  keeping the large powers engaged in a  consultative

mood.   I  was  happy to hear from the Minister earlier  that

partners  who would not on their own accord meet and  discuss

problems have met during the meetings at the ARF.  So what  I

would  want to ask the Minister is: can the ARF progress  and

take  on  the  role  of  preventive  diplomacy  and  conflict

resolution?    Could the Minister also give us an  update  on

the ARF held last year and the future direction of the ARF?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to focus on the progress in

developing  the ASEAN Regional Forum  (ARF) and the  practice

of   preventive  diplomacy,  suggestions  which  I  hope  the

Minister will consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already said how important it is for

Singapore  to have a peaceful region.  When there  was  peace

there were long uninterrupted years of rapid growth.  In  the

crisis,   there  was  greater  instability  and  uncertainty.

Economics and security go together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small state, there are limits to what we can do on

our own.  Multilateralism is therefore very important, and so

is  the  ARF.  It complements but does not replace  bilateral

security  arrangements.  Nor is the ARF a  military  alliance

like  NATO  in  Europe.   It  uses  discussion  and  dialogue

instead. The aim is to deepen understanding  and ties between

the  nations, and to reinforce the habit of settling disputes

peaceably,  and of managing disputes so they do  not  in  the

first  place erupt into violence.  Others have already  asked

about the ARF last year.  I hope the Minister will share  his

thoughts.   I  want to propose something to the Minister  and

consider  the  practice  of  preventive  diplomacy  and   how

Singapore can play its role in pushing this forward.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive diplomacy is a set of diplomatic measures

that,  without  the use of force, seeks to prevent  conflicts

from   turning   violent,  or  incidents  of  violence   from

escalating  further.   The practices of preventive  diplomacy

include  early detection and warning of rising  conflict  and

tensions, the use of fact-finding missions and the  offer  of

good offices and mediation by third parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Minister will agree these are

laudable  aims.   If  the ARF can take  up  the  practice  of

preventive diplomacy, it would be a great step forward  to  a

new  stage  in  this  young  institution.   It  would  be  an

important  step forward generally in our favour, as  a  small

state in a world of much bigger states.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister, therefore, to commit our

country  to making progress on this issue.  We should support

preventive diplomacy in principle, and more can and should be

done.   We  should  support  the  development  of  preventive

diplomacy  by  helping  initiate the necessary  institutions.

There  are two of these that deserve early attention.  First,

would  be  an  effort  to build systems and  programmes  that

examine  the roots of conflict and look out into  the  future

for flash points, like a satellite looking out over the earth

below.   Second, is a system of consulting fellow ARF members

in  between  annual meeting, as and when danger  signs  rise.

Together, early warning and consultation would help  us  look

forward  ahead  and try to gain consensus  on  what  can  and

should be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, Sir, will take considerable effort and some

funding.  But they are, I believe, worth doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I hope the Minister will consider

that  Singapore  should  set an example.  It  should  show  a

willingness to undertake the practice of preventive diplomacy

when  appropriate.   We cannot in this regard  stand  by  the

sidelines when problems arise.  We should show commitment  to

helping  within  the constraints of our human  resources  and

numbers.  Our commitment should be exemplary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may recall that in 1998, on a previous

occasion  in  this House, I debated on the issue of  Cambodia

with  him.   I  called  on  the Minister  to  send  a  larger

contingent  to  observe and help ensure  the  safe  and  fair

conduct  of the Cambodian elections. Singapore met  with  the

minimum  number  suggested  by  the  UN.   But  the  Minister

declined my suggestion to do more in that case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, I was glad to observe our support, much

more  fulsome  support, for our multilateral  force  in  East

Timor.   I  would encourage the Minister to do more. Together

with  our  ASEAN  partners, though we are  mainly  small  and

medium sized states, we can take positive and proactive steps

to prevent the outbreak of violence and to police the peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a great power, Sir. There are things that we

can  do in concert with others.  Indeed, in many cases, small

and  medium  sized states are able to do better in prevention

because,  by  our nature, when such smaller states  offer  to

mediate  or undertake fact-finding missions, we are  hard  to

accuse of having ulterior motives or to try to exercise undue

pressures on other states.  Preventive diplomacy, as such, is

suitable for the small and the neutral, and we should take up

this role where we can in the ARF, be willing to prepare  and

provide   support for institutions and practices and do  what

we can for our region, and therefore ourselves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, ASEAN-EU relations have gone

through  a rough patch.  ASEAN wishes to be close friends  of

the  Europeans.   However, meetings are  always  held  up  or

bogged  down by the Europeans' stand on Myanmar.  Very often,

double standards are applied.  ASEAN, on the other hand,  has

been  consistent  and  operated on the  basis  of  unity  and

consensus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether he could persuade the

Europeans to come to our point of view.  The message is  that

multilateral  relations should not be held  hostage  by  some

bureaucratic or misguided conception, and we should let  long

term interests prevail.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, as mentioned by Dr Ong, I

understand  the  ASEAN-EU relations have been complicated  by

Myanmar's membership in ASEAN since 1997. The EU has objected

to Myanmar's presence in any ASEAN delegation in its dealings

with the EU.  Could the Minister brief the House on the state

of  ASEAN-EU relations and tell us when and where  would  the

next ASEAN-EU meeting take place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister foresee further complications in the

relations  as  a result of Austria's Freedom  Party  being  a

coalition  member  of the Austrian Government,  and   Austria

being  an  EU  member,  would  ASEAN  member  countries  have

difficulty  granting  visas to an  EU  delegation  comprising

members of Austria's Freedom Party?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran is not speaking. Mr Simon

Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, in talking about the United Nations,

it  is  well  known that we are attempting to secure  a  non-Permanent  seat  in  the  Security  Council  for   the   year

2000/2001.   In previous sittings, the Minister has  reported

and  updated  us on the progress in achieving  the  necessary

political support for the achievement of this voted seat.  It

will  be  the  first time if we succeed that we  are  on  the

Security Council. The Security Council is, of course, a  very

important  body   in the United Nations.  At  this  point,  I

would  like the Minister to go beyond politically forecasting

whether we will or will not get the seat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw the Minister out on what it is that

Singapore can contribute, if and when it becomes a member  of

the  Security Council.  I ask this particularly  because  the

importance  of  the Security Council relates chiefly  to  the

ability  of  the states to contribute towards the maintenance

of  international peace and security, as the  name  "Security

Council"  implies.  In this context, does a small state  like

Singapore have a role to play?  I myself think we can do  so.

We   have   a   role  in  peace-keeping,  we   have   standby

arrangements.   I would like the Minister to spend some  time

telling us how it is that a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>

small  state  like  Singapore can play in such  an  important

role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to the role of the Security

Council  in  making  law. Decisions of the  Security  Council

under  Chapter  7  of the UN Charter can be  binding  on  all

nations.   Sir, in the thaw after the Cold War, the  Security

Council  has actually produced many more resolutions than  in

the  past.  These resolutions have been criticised often  for

being partial, selective and sometimes not thought out enough

and  given enough resources to be actually effective  on  the

ground.   Will Singapore take on these resolutions?  Will  we

take  the principle, the moral stand, or will we tend  to  go

along with the bigger powers, because they are after all  the

bigger powers with the veto?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I join Mr Simon Tay in

discussing  Singapore's bid for a seat  on  the  UN  Security

Council  for the year 2001.  Can the Minister assure us  that

we have a good chance of clinching the seat?

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that a seat on the UN Security Council

will  give  us  important mileage, better access  to  various

countries, and more importantly, insights on how the Security

Council functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience will stand us in good stead when there

is a crisis in the region or when we run into some problem or

the other.  And also I would like to ask the Minister, if  he

could  take  this  opportunity to give training  for  younger

Foreign  Service  Officers to be involved  in  this,  and  in

particular when we have a seat in the UN Security Council.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin is not here. Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the need to

review   Singapore's  policy  in  providing   technical   and

development assistance to other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us are aware that as Singapore's income has

increased, so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>

have   calls   to  increase  our  donations  to  multilateral

financial   institutions  and  development   agencies.    Our

Government  has  generally not done  so.   We  have  taken  a

different approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of money, Singapore has in recent years

increased  our efforts to make greater contributions  to  the

community   through  training  and  capacity  building.    In

particular,  our  programme to provide technical  cooperation

and  assistance to other countries has grown.   I  understand

some 1,200 foreigners or so have come to Singapore under this

scheme of late.  This scheme should continue and grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, urge the Ministry to consider other and

additional   ways  of  providing  technical  and  development

assistance.  There are several reasons for this.  Let me just

touch on two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that our training programmes are very

labour  intensive.  Quite typically, we attach these trainees

to  a  Government  department, such as the HDB  or  the  port

authorities,  in  order for them to  observe.   This  is,  of

course,  an  important approach.  It is  practical  but  very

labour  intensive.  The effort made is considerable  and  can

sometimes  distract  the operations of these  very  important

agencies.  As such, there are limits on how many we can train

in this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason we should do things differently is

that our present policy is open to misunderstanding.  This is

because  the  training  tends to happen  here  in  Singapore.

Thus, the funds that we do provide are largely spent here  in

Singapore for lodging, and for other costs.  This is open  to

criticism  by others as "tied aid", that is to  say,  we  are

helping  our  own economy when we help others.  This  is,  of

course,  not our intention, I believe.  It is the  nature  of

training, but it can be misunderstood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons for us to consider new and

additional  ways  of providing assistance.   In  making  this

call,  I  am,  of  course, mindful of  the  interdependencies

between our country and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>

others,   as  certainly  it  was  featured  in  the   Finance

Minister's   Budget   Statement.   From   the   crisis,   all

Singaporeans understand that when Indonesia or others in  the

region do poorly, we will also be affected.  We can also  see

that positive steps are taken forward, such as the ASEAN Free

Trade  Area (AFTA) and ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) agreement,

and    we   should   also   benefit.    When   we   recognise

interdependencies, we would stand to gain more by doing  more

to help others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean we should throw money at these problems,

Sir.   The  world has come a long way in rethinking  the  way

richer  countries help.  But we should not think in terms  of

bandage  or charity.  We should do more so that we  serve  as

true  partners to our neighbours.  There is much for our good

in  the longer term, as for theirs.  In this partnership,  we

have  to ask our partners to see the need to help themselves,

even as we do what we can to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeting assistance to specific areas is important.

Trade  and  investment  too are important.   Private  capital

flows  today  are much larger than government  to  government

assistance.   So  we  should  encourage  the  right  economic

policies and put them in place.  But in the shorter  term,  I

hope  the Minister will see that some of these countries will

lose revenues when they try to put the right policy in place.

Therefore,  there is resistance to these policies which  will

benefit them in the longer run.  So Singapore should do  what

we  can  to  encourage and enable our neighbours to undertake

the right policy reforms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many innovations that other countries are

reviewing.   Sweden,  for  example, has  only  recently  gone

through  this  process,  to develop new  policies  for  their

assistance  overseas.  Our own country has  been  encouraging

assistance to the less developed countries, both in ASEAN  as

well  as  in  the WTO.  Sir, a bit like NMP Dr  Jennifer  Lee

earlier,  I am not asking the Minister to say yes  or  no  at

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>

point  in time.  What I am asking is for a study and that  we

re-look  at this policy.  This is particularly so because  it

has been about a decade since we stepped up our programme for

technical  cooperation and establish  a  directorate  in  his

Ministry for this purpose.  Much has changed in the world  in

the  last 10 years.  Among these are new initiatives such  as

AFTA  and AIA, as well as the enlargement of ASEAN itself  to

include newer and much less developed members.  Singapore too

has  taken on a new profile, a higher profile in the  UN  and

the WTO.  I hope for these reasons the Minister will consider

undertaking a fuller review of our existing policy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the final item of debate on the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget will bring some cheer  to

our  Foreign Service staff and officers.  It is not really  a

budget cut as such, but really a boost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Foreign Service Officers constitute the core of

our  diplomatic representation overseas.  There are now  many

alternative  careers for bright, young graduates coming  into

the  market.  The Foreign Service's terms and conditions must

therefore be attractive enough to enable the Foreign Ministry

to  recruit  and retain the best graduates to  serve  in  its

ranks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also make it easier for our diplomats to educate

their children when they are posted overseas.  Upon return to

Singapore, they should not be disadvantaged in finding places

for  their  children in Singapore schools.  Also particularly

important, the children must be prepared for second languages

as they have to come back to Singapore eventually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Foreign Service Officers should also be given

extensive training in foreign languages, so that they can  be

effective when they are posted overseas.  I would like to ask

the  Minister  what  are the schemes or incentives  for  such

foreign language training in Singapore for our staff.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, on behalf

of  my  Minister, allow me to answer the questions raised  on

Singapore-Philippines relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Philippines relations today are excellent and

warm.   Bilateral interaction, exchanges, visits and economic

cooperation have intensified to surpass the pre-Contemplacion

level.   Political  relations have also  improved.   This  is

manifested  in the good rapport and high comfort  level  that

exist  between key leaders of the two countries.  PM Goh  has

been  to the Philippines three times in the last four  years,

most  recently to attend the third ASEAN Informal Summit last

November,  and  President  Estrada  paid  a  state  visit  to

Singapore in October 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Minister has a good working relationship with

Philippines Foreign Secretary Mr Domingo Siazon who came here

on  an official visit in late January/February.  Last but not

least,  a  major milestone was the decision of both countries

to  launch a Philippine-Singapore Action Plan (PSAP)  to  put

the bilateral relationship on a more solid footing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine-Singapore Action Plan, if I may elaborate

on  that, having strong and broad-based linkages, will reduce

the  susceptibility of relationship as a whole being  wrought

by  any  single  bilateral issue.  The idea of  the  PSAP  to

provide  a  comprehensive framework of bilateral  cooperation

under  which  we could work together to diversify,  intensify

and institutionalise bilateral linkages arose during PM Goh's

official  visit  to the Philippines in June 1997.   The  PSAP

proposal  was elaborated upon and formally endorsed  on  14th

December  1998 at the sideline of the sixth ASEAN  Summit  in

Hanoi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSAP covers cooperation in the areas of trade and

investment,   information  technology,  education,   culture,

defence and people-to-people exchanges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>

Much  has  been achieved in bilateral cooperation  under  the

PSAP.  For example, the Singapore TDB mounted seven trade and

investment  promotion  missions  to  the  Philippines   while

Singapore  also hosted several visits by business delegations

from  the  Philippines  Economic Zone Authority  and  various

Filipino chambers of  commerce and business clubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Memorandum of Understanding on IT Cooperation was also

signed  in  July 1999 during the visit of Minister for  Trade

and   Industry  BG  George  Yeo  to  the  Philippines.    New

mechanisms have been set up between agencies from both sides,

for  example,  between  MTI  and  the  Philippine  Board   of

Investments,  or between the NCB (which is now  renamed  IDA)

and the Philippine's Department of Science and Technology, to

better  consider  and  coordinate  bilateral  cooperation  in

targeted areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance educational exchanges, Singapore's Ministry

of  Education has made a visit to the Philippines last August

to  explore  new  initiatives, and MOE has  also  awarded  20

Secondary Three scholarships under the PSAP.  As part of  the

people-to-people exchanges to improve understanding  of  each

other's  way  of life, there has been exchange of  visits  by

senior  pathologists from both countries, while a  number  of

journalists from the Philippines have also visited  Singapore

last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, both countries are also working on a

proposal, which President Estrada had raised during his state

visit  to Singapore, to set up a centre in Singapore to cater

Filipino   workers   in  Singapore.   Singapore   has   since

identified a site that could be used to set up such a centre,

and we are now discussing with the Philippines authorities on

the steps it may take to operationalise the use of the site.
