with  the  provisions  of  Section  62  (2)  of  the

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>NAVAL BASE AT LABUAN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister

what  information  he  has on  the  subject  of  the

creation of a naval base at Labuan.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, my

information is that there is no foundation  for  the

report that Her



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



Majesty's Government intends to create a naval  base

at Labuan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Can the Chief Secretary inform

us  whether any work of that nature has been started

at Labuan at all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Whether there is work in Labuan or not,

Sir, I am not aware. There is no foundation for  the

report  that Her Majesty's Government are  intending

to create a naval base there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LONDON TALKS AND COMMONWEALTH VISIT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  he will make a statement giving details  of

his discussion in London with the Secretary of State

for  the  Colonies and of his visit to  Commonwealth

countries en route.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Yes, Sir.

I  will be making a statement after Question Time. I

would  like to assure the hon. Member that I am  not

seeking  to  avoid supplementaries.  It  is  a  long

statement, Sir, and it is inappropriate to  make  it

at  this juncture. May I have your permission,  Sir,

to explain that, should the hon. Member or any other

Member of this Assembly seek to elucidate any aspect

of  that statement, he is at liberty to ask  me  any

questions after I have made the statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I might inform hon. Members that that

is  permissible  at  any time. Whenever  a  Minister

makes  a  statement,  questions  may  be  asked   to

elucidate  anything that might  arise  out  of  that

statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANT MINISTERS' DUTIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government Policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  he is satisfied that it is in the interests

of  the  country  for 3 Assistant  Ministers  to  be

members  of  the City Council in addition  to  their

ministerial  duties; and whether he will  state  the

policy of the Government in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir,

Government considers that the posts of the Ministers

and  Assistant Ministers are full-time  occupations,

but   that  Ministers - and  this  includes  Assistant

Ministers - should  not be precluded  from  giving  of

their  time  to public service outside their  normal

duties.  The work of the City Council, Sir, is  work

in  the  service  of the public,  but  I  personally

consider it inadvisable that City Councillors should

be  Members of this Assembly, let alone Ministers or

Assistant Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are conscious of the fact that we have

inherited this position of City Councillors together

with  the Rendel Commission's recommendations  about

that   body;  that  Government  has  rejected  those

recommendations; and that we have repeatedly had  to

extend  for  short  periods the  life  of  the  City

Council.  It  seemed  to  us unreasonable,  Sir,  to

deprive  the people of their elected representatives

who  are  Members of the Assembly, and some of  whom

are  Assistant Ministers who are also  on  the  City

Council,  without  the possibility of  by-elections,

Sir,  because  no one would stand for a  by-election

for just a matter of 3 or 4 or 5 months; but we have

before us the McNeice Report on local government and

the matter will now be, we hope, shortly regularised

by legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Hon. Chief

Minister  aware that one of the Assistant  Ministers

is  a nominated Member of the City Council and could

quite easily be replaced?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indeed, Sir, and my

answer   to   that  is  this:  that  it  does   seem

inappropriate  to  remove one man  and  to  nominate

somebody for just a short period of 4 or 5 months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does not the

Chief   Minister  agree  that  this   position   was

envisaged  as  early  as April  last  year  when  he

decided  to  abandon  the  Rendel  Report  on  local

government, and that the period would have been  one

and a half years?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, Sir, because there was

then  no  question of the Members becoming Assistant

Ministers. I would like to add this: that as regards

the Assemblymen themselves, Government has not taken

a  decision.  I  am  merely  expressing  a  personal

opinion  and it cannot be said that there is  really

any great strain on the work that they have to do if

they   have  to  serve  both  bodies.  My   personal

objection is that it is my desire to see the maximum

possible   number   of  people  partaking   in   the

democratic process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is this personal opinion referred

to  by the Chief Minister supported by those who are

Members of this Assembly and of the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am sorry I cannot understand

the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can the Chief Minister tell us

whether  his personal opinion is supported by  those

Members of this Assembly who are also Members of the

City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Unfortunately, Sir, much as I

would  like to, I cannot penetrate the hon. Member's

mind and read what his views are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Has the Chief Minister not

enquired from them?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANT MINISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Expression of views in City Council)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister if

he  will  state whether the views expressed  by  the

Assistant Ministers in the City Council are also the

views of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it is important for this

House  to  draw a distinction between the  Assistant

Ministers in the discharge of their duties  as  such

in   Government  and  the  same  persons   as   City

Councillors. Government has never sought,  does  not

seek  and will never seek to control the conduct  of

the   Assistant   Ministers  or   any   other   City

Councillors in the discharge of their duties to  the

City Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Is it not important, Sir, for

Members  of the Government, whether they be  in  the

Assembly or in the City Council, to express the same

line of policies?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The same policies, Sir, are not

necessarily  right  and  the circumstances  are  not

normally the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are we to understand from the

Chief Minister's reply that the Labour Front has  no

consistent policy for local and national government?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> As usual, Sir, my hon. and

learned Friend understands wrongly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Is it not a fact that the

Labour  Front  City  Councillors have  approved  the

conversion of the Geylang Serai trade fair  into  an

amusement  park and that the Labour Front Government

have refused it on Police grounds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Point of order, Sir. I think reading a

supplementary question is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Whose side are you on?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did not notice that the hon. Member

was reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Is it not a question of policy

in this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The matter has not come up to

Government level, Sir. If there has been a  refusal,

I am unaware of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RULES GOVERNING ASSISTANT MINISTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Minister whether

he  will  give details of any rules which have  been

framed by which Assistant Ministers are required  to

relinquish   their   interests   in   business   and

professional activities during their term of office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am happy to inform the

hon.  Member  that  a  complete code  governing  the

conduct  of Ministers was published and laid  before

the  Legislative Council in 1954 as Sessional  Paper

No.  Cmd. 88 of 1954. No doubt the hon. Member would

find it easy to seek access thereto.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Am I to understand from the Hon. the

Chief   Minister  that  the  code  of  conduct   for

Ministers  is also applicable to Assistant Ministers

throughout?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The answer is in the

affirmative, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNION WITH THE FEDERATION (Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister if

he will make a statement on his discussions with the

Chief  Minister of the Federation of Malaya  on  the

subject of Union with the Federation; and whether he

will   further   state  what  are  the  Government's

intentions regarding such a union.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes. Sir, it had been my

intention - and I have made it public - to make  a  full

statement  to  this  Assembly  on  this  matter   in

connection with various interviews that some  of  my

colleagues and I have had with the Chief Minister of

the  Federation  and some of his  colleagues  on  an

informal basis. I would add, Sir, that I have reason

now  to  believe that it would be highly inadvisable

to  make any statement at this juncture and until  I

have  had  a  further opportunity, with some  of  my

colleagues,  to  see  the  Chief  Minister  of   the

Federation  on his return. I would ask  this  House,

which  is  aware that I have always  dealt  with  it

fully and frankly, to give me its indulgence and  to

be patient for just one month. This is a matter that

is very vital to the welfare of Singapore and I say,

Sir,  do  not  let us try to deal with  it  at  this

precise moment when it is still in the balance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is in the balance, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It may well be, Sir, that as a

result of the forthcoming discussions, there may  be

other  decisions arrived at than have  already  been

arrived  at. I do know, Sir, that there is a  desire

on  the  part  of  the Federation that  this  matter

should not be preceded with today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZEN (Definition)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister if

he  will state how far the Government has progressed

towards  the definition of a Singapore citizen;  and

whether he will make a statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, my hon. Friend is aware

that a Bill has been drafted embodying the views  of

the  Labour Front Members of the Government on  this

question  of  granting  citizenship  rights  to  our

domiciled  non-British communities.  This  Bill  has

been  fully  discussed with our  colleagues  of  the

Alliance.  It  has  also  been  discussed  with  the

Secretary of State for the Colonies. In view of  the

considerations   which  I  shall  indicate   in   my

statement on my London trip, this Bill is not  being

proceeded with temporarily, and if hon. Members wish

supplementaries, may I respectfully suggest that they

reserve  them till after they have heard me  on  the

reason why we are postponing consideration?

<div align="center"><b>DEFINITIONS OF "MALAYAN" AND "EXPATRIATE"</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Minister if he will

state  what is the Government's definition of (a)  a

Malayan and (b) an expatriate.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, pending

consideration  of  the Report of the  Malayanisation

Commission, the Government has in the past ten months

proceeded  on the basis that expatriates  are  those

who  are  receiving  or  should  receive  expatriate

allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does not the Chief Minister feel

that  the  person  most  qualified  to  answer  that

question is the Member for Tanglin himself?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>VETERINARY OFFICERS (Shortage)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry in view of the  shortage  of

veterinary  officers to cope with the needs  of  the

farmers,  whether  he will take immediate  steps  to

increase  appreciably the staff  of  the  Veterinary

Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I fear it is

a  long  reply,  because I believe  in  giving  full

information.   May  I  respectfully   suggest   that

sometimes,  unless there is special  reason  to  the

contrary,  it  would be helpful to the Assembly  and

save  its  time if questions could normally  be  put

down for written answers? However, here is my answer

to   the  hon.  Member's  question:  Yes,  Sir.  The

Government  is  fully aware of the  urgent  need  to

expand the veterinary services available to farmers,

and, as you will see, active steps have in fact been

taken  and are being taken at the moment to increase

that staff. Increases in the staff of the Veterinary

Department were approved in the 1956 Estimates  last

November.   Four  junior  officers  are  being   now

recruited. They will have a van and will be able  to

operate as a mobile unit from village to village.  A

new  post of storekeeper is also being filled. We are

taking steps to recruit a team of 24 farmers - I hope

this will appeal to hon. Members - who will be trained

by the Department in poultry inoculation work. These

farmers  will  be  used full-time with  departmental

staff for only two days a week and they will be paid

for that work. The rest of the week will be spent by

them  on their own farms. The idea, Sir, is to  seek

to  bring  to  the  farmers a full understanding  of

these processes. In addition, Sir, arrangements  are

being  made  to recruit eight temporary  inoculators

and   two  van  drivers  and  to  equip  them   with

transport. These services will be used to  help  the

existing  staff  to  combat the recent  outbreak  of

swine fever in the northern part of the island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following steps have been taken to strengthen

the  senior staff. Two assistant veterinary officers

are  studying overseas for qualifications which will

enable  them  to be appointed to veterinary  officer

posts  in  1959. Three veterinary scholarships  have

been  awarded for study abroad to students  of  whom

two  should  return in 1957 and one  in  1959.  Four

further veterinary scholarships will be awarded this

year  for  study  abroad,  and  the  recipients  are

expected to return in 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it because

the   Chief   Minister  finds  these   arduous   but

constructive  duties as Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry difficult that he has decided to ask to  be

relieved from his duties as Minister



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a different question.

to  give  these inoculations. I really have not  got

leave  for  that statement or those  figures  to  be

the  discussions with the officials of that Ministry

on   the  question  of  the  grant  of  Commonwealth

preference   duties  on  exports  of  produce   from

buildings.  In the first instance, instruction  will

be   given   in  the  following  subjects:  English,

Mathematics, Commercial Arithmetic, Elementary Book-keeping  and  Commercial Geography.  Later,  classes

will  be  arranged, if possible, to provide teaching

in  Mandarin  and  Malay. As the Department  already

provides technical and commercial subjects  for  the

older  students  at  the  Junior  Trade  School  and

Raffles   Institution,   these   classes   will   be

restricted to boys and girls of secondary school age

July to December, 1954, and 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is no registration in

Singapore   of  unemployed  persons  as  such.   The

Government employment exchanges register any persons

who   seek   assistance   in   finding   employment.

Registration for this purpose is entirely voluntary.

Most of the persons who seek assistance through  the

exchanges are undoubtedly in need of employment, but

some who are in employment and merely wish to change

their  jobs  use the exchanges, and it is  therefore

not  possible  in  all cases to distinguish  between

them. The number of persons registered for the first

time  at Government employment exchanges during  the

months  July  to December, 1954, and  1955  were  as

follows:



<pre>

 July 1954          2,069

 July 1955          1,246

 August 1954        1,593

 October 1955       1,221

 November 1954      1,708

 November 1955      1,302

 December 1954      1,731

 December 1955      1,479

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counts of persons, Sir, who register at Government

employment  exchanges  and  known  to  be   actively

seeking  employment assistance  have  been  made  at

regular intervals with the following result:



<pre>

 July 1954         figures not available

 July 1955         5,581

 August 1954       figures not available

 December 1955     4,686

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As registration for employment at Government

employment  exchanges  is  entirely  voluntary,  the

number  of persons on the live register at any  time

does  not  depend solely on the number of unemployed

in  Singapore. For example, it has been  found  from

experience that probably transport difficulties have

caused   many   persons,  believed   to   be   still

unemployed,  to let their registrations lapse.  When

the  exchanges have a few vacancies to  offer,  some

persons  who  are unemployed cease  to  renew  their

registrations  and the count of the persons  on  the

live  register falls. Similarly, when the word  goes

round  that the exchanges have vacancies  to  offer,

people  rush  to renew their registrations  and  the

count goes up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Will the Minister agree that

possible  opportunities to stimulate new  employment

and  to train workers for more skilled jobs. It  has

under  consideration  various medium  and  long-term

the development of vocational training, both through

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  what   steps   the

Government have taken or intend to take, in view  of

the   protest  by  S.I.T. tenants,  regarding   the

increase  of  water rates charged by  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the fixing of water meter charges is a  matter

within  the  discretion of the Singapore Improvement

Trust,  which  is a statutory body  set  up  by  the

Singapore Improvement Ordinance. Government  has  no

intention,  and  indeed no power, to interfere  with

the Trust in the exercise of its statutory function.

Government has, however, urged the Trust to expedite

the  conversion  to  individual  metering  of  those

premises  which  have  been  installed  with   block

meters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Minister tell us what

is the result of the urge from the Government to the S.I.T.?

that  all  the  Trust flats which are now  installed

with  block  meters will be serviced with individual

meters in about a year and a half's time.

an  agreement reached between the City  Council  and

another  one  and  a  half  years  to  complete  the

conversion?

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the question of reduction of rentals of S.I.T.

houses  is  closely connected with the reduction  of

interest  on S.I.T. loans. Government has given  its

fullest consideration to the matter, and I am  happy

to  state  that,  subject to the  approval  of  this

Assembly, Government has decided that as  from  the

1st  of April this year all interest on loans to the

Singapore Improvement Trust will be reduced  to  two

per cent. The Trust will be asked to submit a scheme

to  indicate the manner in which this saving can  be

utilised.  This will mean a saving of  approximately

$1,200,000 this year and greater savings thereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What would that mean in terms of

<div align="center"><b>RESETTLEMENT OF FAMILIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing to state the  reasons

for the delay in moving families from the Beach Road

area to Tanjong Rhu and to give details of the terms

of resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the clearance of this area is an operation  of

considerable    magnitude    involving    the    re-accommodation of 815 families and 180 businesses and

small industries. During 1955, 609 families were re-housed  in  the Guillemard Housing Estate which  has

been  specially  allocated  for  this  purpose.  The

resettlement of the businesses and light  industries

presented a difficult problem and after consultation

with the associations representing the undertakings,

it  was decided that the most suitable area for this

purpose  was Tanjong Rhu. Before this area could  be

used,  it  was  necessary to fill it, drain  it  and

provide it with access roads. Financial approval  to

proceed with these works was obtained in March 1955.

Filling  was completed during the year and the  main

access  road  was ready for use by the  end  of  the

year.  It  had been anticipated that the  businesses

concerned would move to Tanjong Rhu as soon  as  the

sites were ready. This did not prove to be the case,

amongst  other  reasons, owing  to  the  differences

amongst  the members of the associations  themselves

on  the  question of allocation of sites. Experience

has  shown that it is always a very difficult matter

to  remove  from the land people who  have  been  in

occupation,  even  though on a Temporary  Occupation

Licence,  for  very many years. It is  now  expected

that   the   clearance  scheme  will  be   completed

immediately after the Chinese New Year holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the terms of resettlement, sites are being

offered,   in  the  first  instance,  on   Temporary

Occupation Licences, rentals being fixed at four  per

cent per annum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



of  the value of the land, with an additional charge

of  $20 per lineal foot of sea or road frontage.  It

is  a  condition of the licence that the land should

only be used for firewood and charcoal stores, boat-builders extra.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Is the Minister aware that

considerable  dissatisfaction has  arisen  over  the

allocation of sites for businesses, and can he  give

an  assurance  that  all these differences  will  be

settled as soon as possible?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is a different question.

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I  seek  your indulgence  to  advise  the

Assembly   of  certain  aspects  of  matters   which

transpired  during the journey which I indicated  to

the  Assembly at the last sitting which  may  affect

the welfare of the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the official purpose of our journey was to

arrange  with the Colonial Office for a date  for  a

constitutional conference at which we are to seek  a

fresh  constitution for Singapore and to  prepare  a

tentative agenda. I have the pleasure to inform hon.

Members  that it has now been agreed by the Colonial

Office  that  the  constitutional  conference   will

commence on the 23rd of April next and provision  is

made for its continuance for two to three weeks. The

tentative agenda, Sir, includes the following items:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Definition of internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make it very clear, Sir, that the phrase

"internal    self-government"    was     used     in

correspondence with the Colonial Office long  before

I  arrived  in England, but when I was in  London  I

indicated to the Secretary of State for the Colonies

that,  as  a  result  of  my  discussions  with  the

statesmen of India and Ceylon, I had gained a  wider

understanding of our problems and our  role,  and  I

desired it to be clearly understood that the  phrase

"internal   self-government",  although   used   for

convenience,  should not be deemed  in  any  way  to

limit  the  nature or the status of the constitution

which Singapore may seek at the April talks. Without

in  any  way committing Her Majesty's Government  to

expression  of  views on any aspects of  the  issues

involved  in  my  statement, the Colonial  Secretary

agreed  completely  that the  term  "internal  self-government" is used for purposes of convenience  and

is  not  intended in any way to limit the nature  of

our  proposals or the consideration to be  given  to

them at the constitutional conference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A date for the introduction of internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was agreed to on the understanding that Her

Majesty's  Government was in  no  way  committed  in

advance  to  the  principle that a  date  should  be

given,  but  that  the whole issue would  be  freely

discussed at the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The question of the structure of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The question of the future of the Public

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The question of external relations and

external defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during our later discussions a sixth item was

added - and  that is, citizenship, on  which  I  have

more to say later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed that both the Colonial Office

and  the Government of Singapore may add any matters

to this agenda until the date of the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the constitutional conference, Sir, my

colleagues   and   I   sought   certain    immediate

concessions.  The  first  was  multi-lingualism.  We

requested that the provision in the Singapore  Order

in   Council  that  English  is  the  only  official

language  of  the  Assembly should be  deleted.  The

Secretary of State for the Colonies warned us of the

practical  difficulties involved but finally  agreed

that the Assembly should have the right, as soon  as

possible, to decide for itself the question  of  its

own   procedure,  including  the  question  of   the

languages  to be used in the Assembly. He  indicated

his readiness to recommend an amendment to the Order

in Council to delete Section 55 completely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item two, Sir, was the question of national

servicemen  and  control.  The  Secretary  of  State

conceded  that  it was only right  and  proper  that

national   servicemen,   comprising   citizens    of

Singapore,  raised  by Singapore  and  paid  for  by

Singapore,  should  be  under  the  control  of  the

people's  representatives and  not,  as  heretofore,

under  the  exclusive control of His Excellency  the

Governor.  I  am happy to inform hon.  Members  that

this agreement has now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



been fully enforced by the Singapore Colony Order in

Council  dated  2nd  February,  1956,  which  passes

control of national servicemen from the Governor  to

the Governor in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to my departure, I had received certain

complaints from local service officers that they had

only  right  of  access to the Chief Secretary,  and

that  if  they  were  dissatisfied  with  the  Chief

Secretary's decision, they had absolutely  no  right

of  access to the Chief Minister. I consider that an

untenable  position, and I am happy to  report  that

the  Secretary of State for the Colonies appreciates

the  situation  and has accepted our representations

that  civil  service staff associations should  have

the right of approach to the Chief Minister, through

the  Chief  Secretary, on matters affecting  general

conditions of service and public policy relating  to

the public service. This rule is now in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial Secretary further agreed to recommend

an amendment to the Order in Council to increase the

number of appointed Ministers from six to seven,  so

as  to  allow  the  Chief Minister  to  be  Minister

without  Portfolio, to concentrate in this formative

period on questions of co-ordination and orientation

of  policy,  and to deal with the vital  issues  now

before   us   arising   out  of   our   desire   for

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir, which was not given

publicity  at  the  time and which  has  since  been

finalised   is  the  agreement  with  the   Colonial

Secretary  to  recommend  that  Section  25  of  the

Singapore  Colony  Order in Council  be  amended  by

deleting  the words "Ex-officio", so that in  future

the Chief Minister is enabled to preside at meetings

of  the  Council of Ministers in the absence of  the

Governor,  the  Deputy  Governor,  or  the   Officer

Administering the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more than delighted to know that the

only   contribution  that  the   hon.   Member   who

represents the P.A.P. can make to the achievement of

my  mission is a sneer. An important matter that was

raised  during the talks concerned the  question  of

citizenship for Singapore. It was represented by  me

and some of my colleagues to the Secretary of State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



that,  in  the  light  of the comments  he  made  in

Singapore, it was vital that we should know  whether

the   Citizenship  Bill  which  the   Labour   Front

Ministers  had  prepared, of which he  was  given  a

copy,  would,  if passed, be disallowed  under  the

provisions  of  the  Royal Letters  of  Instruction,

Section 7 (1) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> 1 (1).



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do not take corrections from

the  hon.  Member, Sir. My friend and colleague  the

Hon. the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing  (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) made  it

clear  that he opposed the Bill, that his colleagues

and  considerable  sections of the population  drawn

along  racial lines were opposed to the question  of

two  types of citizenship - one, a Singapore  citizen,

and  the other a British national. In the course  of

the  discussion that ensued, Sir, it was made quite

clear  by  my hon. Friend on his own behalf  and  on

behalf of U.M.N.O., and he assured me that we  would

have  the  support of the people he had in mind  who

objected  to the Citizenship Bill, that  if  at  the

constitutional  conference in  April  Singapore  did

achieve  the  status  of  an  independent  territory

within  the  Commonwealth and could then  create  a

single  Singapore citizenship, he and his colleagues

would  fully support a Bill to provide for a  single

Singapore citizenship, comprising all true Malayans,

both the British subjects domiciled in Singapore and

the long domiciled aliens in Singapore, subject only

to  the conditions of an oath of loyalty and an oath

abjuring  any other national loyalty. Sir, in  these

circumstances, and particularly realising during the

course  of  the  discussion that I was  placing  the

Secretary  of  State  for the  Colonies  in  a  very

invidious  position of indicating whether  he  would

waive  in  advance  the rights  of  Her  Majesty  in

Council  in respect of legislation coming under  the

provisions of Section 7 (1) of the Royal Letters  of

Instruction,  and  rather than embark  upon  a  Bill

which  would  divide Singapore, I  decided  that  it

would  be  preferable to wait for a  matter  of  six

months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



until  the  results of the constitutional conference

were   known,   because  this  is  an  issue   which

unquestionably would rouse, and has in  a  mild  way

already  threatened to rouse, some racial  emotions.

It  is in these circumstances, Sir, and knowing  the

people  of this country and the forbearing  patience

of  the domiciled races who have for years and years

and   years   sought  to  attain  their   legitimate

aspiration  of  full citizenship  in  this  country,

knowing  their  reasonableness,  I  felt  that  they

themselves  would  prefer to wait these  six  months

rather  than  anticipate what may be a full  victory

for  all without racial divisions and without racial

antagonisms.  Sir, it is in these circumstances  and

with  the solemn assurance of my colleague the  Hon.

the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

that I did propose at that juncture - a proposal, Sir,

for  which I take responsibility - that this  item  be

adjourned to the April meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add, Sir, that in our discussions

and  negotiations  with the Colonial  Office,  which

lasted  between the 10th and the 16th  of  December,

the  atmosphere was both cordial and  friendly,  and

there did seem to be a genuine desire on the part of

the   Colonial   Office  to   seek   to   understand

sympathetically  and  to meet our  very  modest  and

legitimate requests. The keynote, Sir, of the  whole

talks  was one of reasonableness and that  goes  for

both sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the talks with the Colonial Office, I

had  interviews with the Treasury and  the  Bank  of

England  officials, who indicated their  willingness

to  support Singapore in any legitimate proposals it

had  for  enlarging  trade with Indonesia.  I  spoke

particularly  of Indonesia's request for  additional

hard  currency  allocation in respect of  re-exports

from  Singapore of imports of Indonesian produce.  I

must  confess, Sir, that I met with a reception which

gives  me  every hope that this will be  fully  met.

Both  the Bank of England and the Treasury indicated

that  they  would  be  happy to  send  observers  to

cooperate  with  us  in the Pan-Malayan/Indonesian

Ministerial trade talks which we expect soon to take

place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though the British Prime Minister, Sir

Anthony Eden, was ill in bed, I did wish to see  him

on  one  matter and he had the extreme  courtesy  to

receive me and to assure me that he would give every

sympathetic consideration to my suggestion  that  an

all-Party parliamentary delegation should be sent to

Singapore prior to the April talks. My anxiety there

is  this,  Sir. I  do not wish British  Members  of

Parliament or the British people to feel  that  they

are  getting  a one-sided picture of Singapore  from

those  who  are  its  Ministers  and  therefore  are

special  pleaders. I want them to realise that  what

they have heard from us is the truth. I want them to

send  their own men - independent investigators - and  I

want  that  they  should have every  opportunity  to

discover  the  truth of our desires, our  abilities,

and  the modesty, reasonableness and justness of our

aspirations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sounds very reasonable!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I would like, Sir, to express

the  appreciation of my colleagues and myself,  with

which  I  hope hon. Members opposite, including  the

leader of the P.A.P., will wish to be associated, to

the  British Government for the hospitality and  the

courtesy shown to us during our stay in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to inform hon. Members that on the 15th of

December the Secretary of State for the Colonies and

Her  Majesty's Minister of Works, on behalf  of  Her

Majesty's   Government,   presented   to   us,    as

representatives of the Singapore Government, in  the

presence of a gathering which comprised the Chairman

and  Secretary  of  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary

Association, a stone which was part of the fabric of

the Palace of Westminster. It is more than a hundred

years old, Sir, and is in the form of an elaborately

carved  Tudor Rose. It was salvaged from the  damage

of   the   Victoria  Tower  in  Westminster  Palace,

inflicted  by  the air-raids during  the  last  war.

Prior to my departure for England, I did mention  to

hon.  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House   the

possibility of the offer of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



stone.  May  I  say, Sir, that I did appreciate  the

fact that all Members on the Opposition Benches,  as

well  as on the Government Benches, rose above their

natural  anti-colonial feeling and appreciated  this

gesture for a genuine act of friendship and courtesy

that  it  is. I accepted the stone with appreciation

and I hope, Sir, to have the pleasure of handing  it

to  you on an occasion that you may arrange, so that

you  will receive it on behalf of the Members of the

Assembly  and  make arrangements for  its  permanent

incorporation in the fabric of this building. I know

that  all hon. Members will wish to join us  in  our

thanks  to the British Government for this symbolic

gesture  of  friendship and unity  between  the  two

Assemblies  of  Westminster  and  Singapore  in  the

traditions of the democratic process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to one other aspect of our visit to

England - our main task as we saw it - and that  was  to

make  the  British people conscious of the truth  of

our   position   and  the  reasonableness   of   our

aspirations,  and  to  create, in  anticipation,  an

atmosphere  of  goodwill for our  forthcoming  April

conference. The Information Officer in Malaya House,

Mr  John Batten, and Mr S. C. Lim of Radio Malaya,

whom I took with me as Public Press Liaison Officer,

did  magnificent work in preparing a most  intensive

programme  of daily talks, meetings, broadcasts  and

television interviews. I understand it is  estimated

that  almost  every Member of the House  of  Commons

heard  us  at some time or another; that some  seven

million televiewers heard and saw us; and that  the

radio  audience was far larger. In so far as letters

received  and Press reports indicated, the  reaction

was  very,  very sympathetic. We were received  with

real  interest  and with friendliness.  The  British

Labour  Party, Sir, and the Fabian Society  made  us

feel  very much at home, but to my mind perhaps  the

outstanding  incident of that visit to London,  Sir,

was   a  very  large  meeting  of  the  Conservative

Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association   and   the

Conservative   Commonwealth  Association   which   I

attended and which I addressed. I realised the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



fact  that they were seasoned politicians  and  that

the  only way to deal with them in the short time  I

had  was  to indulge in the blunt truth. I addressed

them, Sir, with very considerable frankness. I think

I  would like to report to this House - it took me  by

surprise  and I hope it gives hon. Members the  same

pleasure  as  it gave me - that speaker after  speaker

from that responsible Conservative organisation rose

up  and  emphatically rejected the doctrine  of  the

"nobility  of colonialism" with which we  have  been

plagued.  They  said, "Mr Marshall,  Colonel  Blimp

does not live here any more."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Where has he gone to?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He is in Singapore. This

responsible  group of Conservatives, Sir,  expressed

earnest sympathy for our aspirations. I will confess

that these sentiments were unexpected. I started off

by telling them that I understood that they were the

bottleneck to the attainment of our aspirations, but

I  do  say this: Having heard them and having spoken

to  them  in  private, I do believe them  and  I  am

hoping that the constitutional talks next April will

prove that they were not merely polite but that they

were  genuine and sincere. Frankly, Sir, nowhere  in

London  did  I  meet with that antagonism  and  that

petty-fogging   objection  to  our  aspiration   for

independence   which   we  traditionally   meet   in

Singapore.  I  could wish - and  I  say  this  in  all

earnestness - that  the  warm sympathy  shown  by  the

normal   decent  Englishman  in  England   for   our

constitutional  aspirations could  be  reflected  in

some   small  measure  by  his  compatriot  in  this

country.  That  would contribute very materially  to

the general welfare, stability and harmony essential

to our progress. Independence we will have, or chaos!

It is a question of choice of sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst in London, Sir, one of the most delightful

experiences  was  meeting the  Malayan  students  in

Malaya Hall. It was a really enjoyable gathering and

I  hope that hon. Members who will be going with  us

to  the constitutional conference in April will have

the privilege of meeting them, and I know they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



will have the same thrill and pride in those sturdy,

enthusiastic  and happy people who are the  students

of Malaya in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to our journey through the

Commonwealth nations - no less important  an  aspect.

In  fact, I consider it perhaps the most vital  part

of  our travels. In Colombo, Sir, I was the guest of

Sir  John Kotelawala, the Prime Minister of  Ceylon,

and  had  the  privilege  of meeting  the  Governor-General, Sir Oliver Gooniteleke, one of the  doughty

warriors of independence of Ceylon. Yes, it is  easy

to sneer, we who walk in their footsteps, who do not

know the struggle which they went through for years,

and  who now seek to tell us so and to obtain,  with

ease  sitting  in  our arm-chairs, that  which  they

sweated through generations to obtain. It is easy to

sneer. I do not. The Prime Minister of Ceylon,  Sir,

asked  me to express to the people of Singapore  the

best  wishes and the sincere and active sympathy  of

the   people   of   Ceylon  for  our  constitutional

aspirations.   The  Government  of  Ceylon   further

indicated  that,  should we require any  assistance,

they would be glad to accommodate us, whether in the

realm  of  expert Tamil educationists  to  meet  our

vernacular education requirements or in the  way  of

advice   on  our  Central  Bank  or  our  Industrial

Development Corporation, which subjects I  discussed

in  a  very  fruitful interview with  their  Finance

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two days that I spent in Colombo, Sir, I

went  some  distance to inspect the work  of  a  Mr

Middleton of the United Nations Technical Assistance

Administration, an expert who has dedicated his life

to  bringing low-cost housing to Asian countries.  I

confess, Sir, that I was impressed by his work. I am

no  technician, but the figures he gave and which  I

passed on to my colleague the Hon. the Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing are impressive.

Arrangements have been made to ask for Mr Middleton

to be loaned to us by the United Nations, and it may

well be that he will be here, Sir, at latest by  the

end of this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bombay, Sir, I was the guest of the Governor-General and had the pleasure of meeting that very

remarkable  person,  the Chief  Minister  of  Bombay

Presidency, and his colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Delhi my colleague the Hon. Mr J. M.

Jumabhoy  and I were the guests of the President  of

India.  During our four days' stay in New  Delhi  we

had  the  privilege  of meeting the  President,  the

Prime  Minister,  Mr  Nehru,  and  several  of  his

Cabinet  colleagues. On the 6th of  December,  1955,

Mr    Nehru,   that   dynamic   leader   of   Asian

independence,  gave to the Singapore Press  for  the

Singapore people a message. I know, Sir, that it  has

been fully publicized, but for the pleasure, I hope,

of  Members in this Assembly and for the  record,  I

would  like  to repeat two small parts. In  one,  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sure that the problem of Singapore and the

Federation  of  Malaya  will  be  dealt  with   more

adequately when the people there have the  sensation

of freedom and have to shoulder the responsibilities

that follow it. I wish therefore all success to  the

people of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya  in

their march to freedom."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further, Sir, just one more passage:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We carried through our struggle for freedom over

many  long  years  in  India, but  did  it  through

peaceful  methods.  We are firm believers  in  these

methods not only because they yield results but also

because  they  do not leave trails of  conflict  and

bitterness behind them and they help build a united

nation.  The  dominant urges in Asian countries,  as

well  as  in African countries, are nationalism  and

social  advance.  Both  are  essential.  Nationalism

leads to political freedom. In view, however, of the

backwardness  of many Asian countries, the  question

of  social  advance  and betterment  of  the  people

generally is one of vital importance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One tangible result, Sir - since hon. Members love

tangible  results - of  our  visit  to  India  is  the

assurance received from the Government of India that

they  would  be glad to help us, whether  under  the

Colombo  Plan  or  otherwise, by  way  of  technical

assistance  whenever  we  should  require   it   and

whenever they are in a position to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report to you, Sir, and to hon.

Members that information has been received from that

good friend of Singapore, the Commissioner for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



India  in  Singapore, that the Indian Government  is

making  available to the Singapore Government  their

most senior official on government organisation  and

methods   in   order   to   investigate   and   make

recommendations  on  the  best  means  for  a   most

efficient  and  economic civil service organisation.

The  officer  in question, Sir, is Mr  S.B.  Bapat,

Establishment  Officer and Director of  Organisation

and   Methods  and  Vigilance  Department   of   the

Government of India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pakistan my colleagues the Minister for Labour

and the Minister for Local Government and I were the

guests  of  the Governor-General, and met the  Prime

Minister, Mr Choudhri Mohamed Ali, and his  Cabinet

colleagues. I am happy to inform this House that the

Prime  Minister of Pakistan asked me to  express  to

the   people  of  Singapore  his  sympathy  for  our

aspirations,  which he considered  to  be  perfectly

natural.  He also assured me that the Government  of

Pakistan  would be glad to assist us in the  way  of

study  facilities for our students  in  any  of  the

specialised subjects which they have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was a stirring journey of which the most

important    achievements   are    intangible    but

nevertheless vital to our future welfare. The  Press

and  public  reaction in England was most favourable

and  created  an  atmosphere which I believe  augurs

well  for the constitutional conference next  April.

The  friendship of the peoples of India, of Pakistan

and  of Ceylon for Singapore found public expression

and  it is very heartening, Sir, to be conscious  of

the fact that these great Asian nations are eager to

welcome  Singapore  amongst  the  great  family   of

independent  Asian countries. It is my  humble  hope

that  Singapore can look to these new-found  friends

to  support  her  in  her desire  to  be  an  equal,

independent   member   of  the   Commonwealth.   The

bitterness   of   racial   domination   and   racial

exploitation which they have suffered as colonies is

a  matter  of recent memory to them. They  remember,

though they do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



hate,  in the true spirit of their immortal  Gandhi.

They  have forgiven. Their friendship for Singapore,

I  honestly  believe  to be absolutely  sincere  and

absolutely disinterested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for myself, I look to them from the

depths of their experience to champion the cause  of

Singapore in its efforts to obtain independence  and

to  champion  that  cause  at  the  meeting  of  the

Commonwealth  Prime Ministers next  June.  We,  Sir,

have  not made any official approaches. We have  not

asked for any commitments, nor have we received  any

commitments.  You are conscious, I  hope - I  am  very

conscious,  very - that under the Rendel  Constitution

the  question  of our relationships  with  not  only

foreign   countries   but  even   members   of   the

Commonwealth  is  in  the  portfolio  of  the  Chief

Secretary  and the reserved power of His Excellency.

It   is  the  present  constitution.  That  is   not

democracy which is what we are seeking. My appointed

colleagues and I, Sir, intend, however, to seek  the

permission  of  our  official  colleagues  and   His

Excellency  to approach all Commonwealth  countries,

not only those great Asian nations with whom we have

established relations of warm friendship,  but  also

European  countries. I would like to  approach  them

directly as soon as we are ready with memoranda of a

precise   nature  on  the  subject  of   Singapore's

aspiration. If we are to succeed in being  an  equal

independent  member of the Commonwealth,  the  other

members  of  the  Commonwealth are  entitled  to  be

consulted,  because they are affected. I  hope  that

they  will  be  fully  consulted  before  the  April

conference  so  that there will  be  no  unnecessary

delay should they wish to make their positions clear

in the relevant quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection I would like to say this.

Our  approach  to these Commonwealth countries  must

await  the  formation  of the  all-Party  delegation

which  I promised to this Assembly in gratitude  for

the wonderful support we received at the time of the

constitutional crisis. It must await an agreement - or

at  least a recognition of any disagreement - by  that

delegation on the broad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



basis  of our representations. I will say this.  Two

constitutional advisers have already been appointed.

There  will  be no delay on that side, and  we  hope

shortly  to  appoint  a  leader  who  is  a  man  of

considerable eminence as a constitution maker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to express the

warm  appreciation of the Government  of  Singapore,

with  which I hope all Members in this Assembly will

associate  themselves, to the Governments of  India,

Pakistan   and   Ceylon  and  their   very   helpful

representatives  in Singapore for  the  considerable

courtesy,  and  the  warm and  friendly  hospitality

which they showed to Singapore's representatives out

of  love for Singapore, although we were nothing but

shadow Ministers of a colonial Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I always face the truth! Sir,

I  would also like to express the appreciation of my

colleagues   and  myself  and  the   Government   of

Singapore  to  the British Foreign  Office  for  the

courtesy,  the assistance and the hospitality  which

we  received from the representatives of the  United

Kingdom  in  every single city at which we  touched

and in which we stayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do apologise, Sir that I have to take up further

time in this Assembly. I have a statement to make on

our  Baling talks. I would like to make  it  today

unless hon. Members prefer to have it tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is up to you, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Very well, Sir,I shall

proceed and make myself -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could we -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Chief Minister has not

given way yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it might be

more convenient for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



Opposition  if we could clarify the Chief Minister's

statement on his pilgrimage to London before we move

on to another subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - pilgrimage to our neighbours

and  visit to London. Sir, I am indebted to my  hon.

Friend. I have completely forgotten that aspect  of

it.   Of   course,   they  are   entitled   to   ask

supplementaries  and certainly they  will  have  the

opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Sir, is the Chief

Minister prepared to enlighten this House by  saying

what  he  meant when he and his Government used  the

terms 'dominion status', 'complete self-government',

and  'internal self-government and independence'  in

relation to Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, that is not an appropriate

question  for discussion here. I would like  to  say

this very briefly. In Singapore, as a result of  the

initiative  of  U.M.N.O.,  led  by  my  friend   and

colleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing, a meeting was called of all  political

Parties  in  Singapore - those  represented  in   this

House, those not represented, and even those not yet

formed - and  we all agreed upon what we  sought.  The

phrase  used  was  'internal self-government'  which

means a fully-elected legislature in control of  all

government machinery other than defence and  foreign

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during my 'pilgrimage', as my hon. Friend the

leader of the P.A.P. has so justly put it, I learned

to look at it from an oppositive angle. In London  I

merely  put  it in this fashion - that  for  myself  I

would  not be prepared now to seek that status which

still  remains colonial, but that I would  rather  a

more  positive approach be taken - independence within

the Commonwealth, subject to concessions in external

defence and external affairs. I am happy to say, Sir,

that  I  have  my  colleagues of  the  Labour  Front

completely with me and I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



a  mandate from my Party. I am also happy to  report

that  my  friend  and colleague the  leader  of  the

Alliance  has  indicated his full support  for  this

approach. The exact details I would like to work out

in  private  at  this all-Party  conference  and  in

consultation  with the constitutional adviser  whom,

if  we find it necessary, we could ask to come  down

to Singapore before our departure.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Chief  Minister's statement has raised  various

questions  in  our  minds. Will the  Chief  Minister

allow  a  debate on the statement that he has  just

made instead of our only asking questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I can see no purpose in a

debate, but naturally hon. Members are at liberty to

place  a  motion before the House and I  can  assure

them that they will find no obstruction from me. But

I  do not think they ought to ask for the initiative

from  me.  I can see nothing controversial.  It  may

well be that they do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Can the Chief Minister clarify

a  report  in the local Press not long ago  that  he

preferred dominion status for this Colony?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Hon. Members must

remember that questions at this stage must  only  be

directed  to  the  statement in order  to  elucidate

certain  matters  which  have  been  raised  in  the

statement itself, and we cannot have any debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, did not the

Chief Minister realise that, if he wanted to lead  an

unanimous all-Party delegation, the introduction  of

something new like dominion status, and speaking for

himself  to  the world Press in London, was  perhaps

not the best approach to the problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Chief Minister has just

said  that  he had discussions about internal  self-government  with  the Secretary  of  State  for  the

Colonies, which subject will be on the agenda of the

coming conference, that is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



if  the  Opposition  agrees to  that.  What  is  the

difference  between  the self-government  which  the

elected  Members of this Assembly passed unanimously

and  his  internal  self-government?  Is  there  any

difference?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I would like to make my

position  clear to hon. Members. I did  not  discuss

with the Secretary of State what this Assembly would

seek. I had to tell him what was in my mind so as to

avoid  having  the constitutional conference  pinned

down  to  discussing  internal  self-government.   I

wanted  to  make it clear that that phrase  did  not

limit  us, and in order to explain why, I  told  him

what  was  my  personal  view:  that  there  was  no

question of discussion or obtaining views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question of the

Member   for   Telok  Ayer,  Sir,  there   is   this

distinction: the internal self-government  which  we

were  considering to seek still left us  a  colonial

status  and  still left us a Governor with  reserved

powers - it  is a negative position. We  are  still  a

colony.  I  want  an  end to colonialism.  It  is  a

positive approach to the problem - independence within

the  Commonwealth.  You are a  free  territory,  and

freely  and voluntarily you make an agreement ceding

aspects of defence and foreign affairs. That is  the

difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I ask this question

arising  out  of the statement which  the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister has just made? Suppose a  delegation

goes  to  London and if they discuss self-government

or dominion status or independence, will they refuse

to  discuss those questions that have not  been  set

down?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is something that arises in the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Would this new type of a nation,

which becomes free and then voluntarily becomes part-slave   by   surrendering  a  vital  part   of   its

independence,  be entitled to send a  representative

to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think there has been too much

debate. I will not allow that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> While I

realise,   Sir,  that  the  question  might   invite

personal  annihilation,  I  should  like  the  Chief

Minister  perhaps  to elucidate  what  he  meant  by

saying  that Colonel Blimp is no longer  in  England

but is indeed in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is a delightful English

proverb that says: Where the cap fits, wear it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> The Chief Minister

in  his statement stated that there was an all-Party

conference  on  the  definition  of  internal  self-government.   Would   he  not  confirm   that   that

conference  was  called  just  to  define  what   is

internal  self-government and that the  chairman  of

that  conference did signify that it had nothing  to

do with the December London mission?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, Sir. It was quite clearly

emphasised  repeatedly  that  the  purpose  of  that

meeting  was  to clarify what was intended  by  this

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, on the

question of our visit to Baling, today sees the  end

of  the five months' amnesty offer to members of the

Communist  Party  which we made in conjunction  with

the Federation and which we, in conjunction with the

Federation, are withdrawing now. Sir, we gave notice

of this decision on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



31st  of December last and the reason for it is tied

up  with our talks in Baling on the 28th and 29th of

December, when the Chief Minister of the  Federation

and I, as his guest, and Dato Sir Cheng-lock Tan met

the Secretary-General of the Malayan Communist Party

and  two of his colleagues. Sir, the House may  wish

to know some of the details, some of which are known

and some of which were not published. I will be very

brief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist representatives sought strenuously

to  obtain  recognition  of  the  Malayan  Communist

Party.  This was firmly rejected, but I must confess

that on the evening of the first day I gathered  the

impression that they seemed to be prepared to accept

the   statement  of  the  Chief  Minister   of   the

Federation  that he would not recognise the  M.C.P.

but  that  he  would permit members of  the  Malayan

Communist  Party, who, after a loyalty  check,  were

freed  and allowed to rejoin their families,  freely

to  join  any political Party or to form  their  own

political Party so long as that political Party  was

not   Communist.  However,  that  was   a   mistaken

impression,  and  the next morning we  learned  that

there  was  no  question  whatsoever  but  that  the

Malayan  Communist Party was not prepared to  accept

the  term  of the amnesty which required  a  loyalty

check   of  those  who  surrendered.  The  Communist

representatives   did   indicate,   Sir,   that   an

appreciable number of their people may  wish  to  be

repatriated to China and the Tunku and I agreed that

we  would  not insist on the investigation of  those

who  would  be  leaving the country  under  official

supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister of the Federation, Sir, went

even further in his sincere desire to put an end  to

this regime of violence which is causing unnecessary

suffering to the people. He said to them that  if  a

majority  of  their leaders and a  large  number  of

their   followers   were   prepared   to   opt   for

repatriation to China, then he might reconsider  the

question  of limiting investigation by requiring  of

the   remainder,   who   stayed   in   Malaya,    an

investigation which amounted to periodical visits to

the   police  for  report.  The  answer   from   the

representatives of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



Communists was that to report to the police  was  to

imply surrender. "We will never surrender!" Sir, the

Communist  representatives  had  the  grace  to  say

openly  that, despite their Freedom News and  their

underground   propaganda,  they  did  realise   that

neither  the  Tunku  nor I was a British  stooge,  a

running   dog,   or,   what   you   may   call   it,

- [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You see, Sir, how close my

hon. Friend is - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They did admit freely - they had

the   grace  to  admit -  that  the  Tunku   and   I

represented  the elected government of  the  people.

They  did admit, surprisingly, that their activities

of  violence  were causing suffering to the  people.

They  seemed inclined to admit, Sir, that we may  be

achieving   independence - only   may - by   democratic

processes,  but they could not answer  the  question

why,  in  those circumstances, they were  continuing

the  struggle. They said, "We will not discuss  that

now."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the discussions at the second session

on  the  29th,  it  seemed as though  the  Communist

representatives  were  prepared   to   cease   their

activities of violence unconditionally in  the  near

future. Chen Tian, who was the interpreter, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as you obtain...".



Then  it  was clarified. He said he would  not  even

wait  for  Singapore. He was quite prepared  not  to

wait  for Singapore, in case the Tunku thought  that

Singapore might be slower. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as the Federation obtains complete control

of internal security and local armed forces, we will

end  hostilities, lay down our arms and disband  our

forces."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that seems to be rather important. It is true

it  gave  no  hope for today but it  gave  hope  for

tomorrow  and it was unconditional surrender.  So  I

asked  him  to repeat it. I wrote it down  verbatim,

and  in order that there should be no question about

its accuracy, I sent that paper across and I said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chin Peng, you read English. Is this it?"



<br><br>It  then  transpired that there was no  question  of

unconditional surrender and they added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not amount to acceptance of the amnesty

terms."



<br><br>However,  we  promised that that  would  go  to  the

Press.  It went to the Press as emanating  from  the

Communist  Party. Then, Sir, we went  down  to  what

they  meant. They meant the same as they  mean  now.

They   meant   that  even  if  the   Tunku   obtains

independence,   before  they   would   cease   their

activities   of   violence,   they   would    expect

recognition  of  the  Malayan  Communist  Party,  no

loyalty  check, no detention, unconditional amnesty,

complete  freedom,  and  facilities  for  those  who

wished to go overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, one more thing transpired which rocked

even  the placid Tunku - and quite surprisingly. They

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, when we speak of laying down arms, it

does   not  mean  to  surrender  the  arms  to   the

Government. That is in the amnesty terms which  just

say  'Lay  down arms'. To 'lay down arms'  means  to

cease activities of violence. But we expect, when we

are free, to have the right to retain our arms."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Tunku:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can start shooting me when next you

disagree with me?"



<br><br>He made it quite clear that there would be never any

question at all of the right to retain arms by those

free to rejoin society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did try to bring the question round to a

clarification  of a possible time-limit  of  loyalty

checks and of conditions that might be acceptable in

respect  of the loyalty checks. That was  what  they

objected to, but they would not discuss the question

in  detail,  nor  would they seek  conditions  which

might  be  acceptable.  They said  flatly - the  words

were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no authority to accept amnesty terms which

include a loyalty check."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did plead, Sir, that hatred and violence

produces nothing constructive. I appealed to them to

think  of  the welfare of the people as a whole - more

than  seven  million. I asked them not  to  set  the

question of face, pride and the mild humiliation  of

their small group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



in  the path of the welfare of the people which they

pretended  to seek. I seemed to be talking  to  deaf

ears. The reply I got was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have said we have no authority whatever to

accept loyalty investigations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as Singapore is concerned, the

representatives made it quite clear that  they  were

in  complete  control  of the  Communist  Party  and

Communist  sympathisers  in  Singapore.  Before  the

meeting ended, Sir, and with the concurrence of  the

Chief  Minister of the Federation, I stated that  if

they  would sink their pride and the matter of  mild

humiliation  in  the  name of  the  welfare  of  the

people,  if they could see their way to a change  of

heart,  the  Tunku and I would be prepared  to  meet

them again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform this House that I went to these

talks  believing  that there was an element  amongst

those  in  the  jungle who were genuine,  frustrated

nationalists;  believing that we  might  reach  them

because we are about to achieve independence through

the  democratic  process  and  we  need  all  honest

citizens, all sincere nationalists, to pull together

at  this  period; believing that some of them  might

respond  to an appeal to their decent instincts  not

to  hamper the economic and political advance of the

people  of  the  country  by  their  activities   of

violence.  Maybe  I  was flattering  myself,  Sir - it

looks  as  though I was, but I did hope to  persuade

some  of them. I would like to say this: I have come

away  from  this meeting - and I do not say  this  for

propaganda purposes in respect of those who are  not

here to defend themselves, but because I think it is

my  duty that the people of this country should know

of  this,  whatever some hon. Members  opposite  may

think; I want them to know, those who believe in  me

will  believe  I am speaking the truth,  Sir - I  have

come  away from this meeting believing with  all  my

heart  and absolutely convinced in my own mind  that

neither  the  independence of these territories  nor

the  welfare of the people matters in the  slightest

to  the Malayan Communist Party. They do not care  a

hoot! All they want is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



to  obtain control of the country. All they want  is

the expansion of their own imperialist Communism and

their  own foreign ideology. They have more contempt

for the people than Colonel Blimp!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this, Sir. There we have an

appeal  to  the  Members of  the  Assembly,  to  the

responsible Press and to the people. I am  satisfied

that   the   Malayan  Communist  Party   and   their

sympathisers  will  only cease their  activities  of

brutality  against  the  people  and  against  their

governments,  against their economic  and  political

welfare, by means of violence, only when the Malayan

Communist  Party is convinced that it is losing  the

sympathy of the people by continuation of these foul

tactics.  It is for the people and for the Press  of

this  country  to  make  it  clear  that  under  the

democratic  process  we  are achieving  freedom  and

prosperity, and we want none of the brutality  which

is  the  hallmark of the Communist  Party.  You  can

smile,  Sir. We will not tolerate - and I do not  care

what Press it is -  the violence and intimidation which

is being perpetrated upon the people of this country

by  those  who call themselves Communists.  In  this

connection  and  in fairness to my outburst  against

that  person  sitting in the Strangers'  Gallery,  I

would  like to say this: I was very pleased to  read

editorials in the Chinese Press condemning,  in  the

strongest terms, the recent grenade outrage  against

innocent  members of a force that seeks  to  protect

the  peace of the people. I say let us have more  of

those   editorials.  Let  us  have   open,   public,

spontaneous expressions of the disgust of the people

at  this Communist regime of brutality. That is  the

only  way,  Sir, if we are ever to have  an  end  to

Communist violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Baling talks, Sir, the

Chief  Minister of the Federation indicated  to  the

Communist  representatives that since they,  in  the

name  of  the Malayan Communist Party, rejected  the

amnesty  terms, he could see no further  purpose  in

continuing  them  and  he asked  them  whether  they

concurred, and in those circumstances, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



the  Chief  Minister and I agreed that  the  amnesty

terms  should be withdrawn after reasonable  notice.

The  Chief  Minister fixed the date after  informing

the  Government  of  Singapore,  and  the  date   is

today - five months after its inauguration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, take this opportunity to express, on

behalf of the Government and, I hope, the people  of

Singapore, our appreciation and thanks to the  Chief

Minister  and  the Government of the Federation  for

their  courtesy in inviting us to be represented  at

these  talks, and for the hospitality and  excellent

arrangements  they  made  for  the  comfort  of   my

assistants and myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Was the Hon. the Chief Minister

present at these talks as a guest?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I do not understand these

constant jibes. The hon. Member is fully aware  that

I  was  present at these talks as the guest  of  the

Chief  Minister of the Federation on his invitation.

That  has  been repeatedly said here. It  is  simple

single-syllable English.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Was it proper for a guest to

have done so much talking at these talks?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, that is not a proper question.

Mr Chew Swee Kee, I believe you have a statement to make?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE REPORT ON CHINESE EDUCATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Yes, Sir. I have only a short statement to make,

Sir,   and  that  is  in  regard  to  the  All-Party

Committee Report on Chinese Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all Members know, the Report has been published

as  Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 9 of 1956. Hon. Members

will remember that in May last year, a Committee was

appointed  with the consent of this Assembly  to  go

into   the  question  of  Chinese  education.   This

Committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



comprising Members of all political Parties in  this

Assembly,  sat  under  my  chairmanship  on   twenty

occasions,  not including the visits, of course,  to

the  schools.  I am glad to report to this  Assembly

today  that the Report itself in its final  form  is

ready and presented for the information of all  hon.

Members of this Assembly as well as the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go any further, I would like to thank

publicly,  as I have done in the Report,  those  who

took  part  in  the deliberations,  those  who  gave

evidence  and  those who sent in memoranda.  I  wish

also  to thank personally our Secretary, Mr  L.  C.

Goh,  who was responsible for documentation  of  all

the  memoranda submitted to the Committee and  other

detailed information obtained from various sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main recommendations in summarised form are

found  at  pages  47 to 50 of the Report.  It  is  a

matter of gratification to know that the Report is an

unanimous  one and it is hoped that the  House  will

give  it  the  blessing  that  it  deserves.  It  is

possible  that a Government White Paper on education

policy,  based on the Report, will be tabled  before

the  House.  As the Report touches on  questions  of

grave  importance and implications, full opportunity

will be made available for Members to debate on  the

subject at a later date.

<div align="center"><b>FLOODS AND FLOOD RELIEF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour and Welfare)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members of this House

will  doubtless want me to give them a statement  on

the  recent  floods  which occurred  on  Friday  and

Saturday, the 27th and 28th of January.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be able to say that the floods this

year  were not so widespread or serious as in 1954.

In  all, about 7 inches of rain was recorded at  the

Meteorological  Station, Singapore  Airport,  but  5

inches in most other places,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



on  the  two  days,  the 27th and 28th  of  January.

According to records, storms such as these are  not

unusual  at  this  time  of  the  year.  The   Bedok

resettlement and Ulu Bedok areas suffered most,  and

as  the  water  rose  in these areas  it  was  found

necessary  on the night of Friday the 27th  and  the

following   day  to  evacuate  some   62   families,

totalling  330  adults  and  children.  The   Social

Welfare  Department established a relief  centre  at

the Bedok Boys' School on Friday night, the 27th  of

January,  where  the  evacuated flood  victims  were

accommodated  and given hot meals for  a  period  of

four  to  five  days. In all, 3,600  hot  meals  and

snacks were provided, while Government officers  and

voluntary   officers   gave   medical   and    other

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other areas, such as Lorong Tai Seng, Geylang

Serai,  Jalan Eunos, Tampenis Road and one  or  two

other  small  isolated areas,  minor  flooding  took

place  but no families from any of these areas  were

evacuated, and damage was small. In view of the fact

that Bedok is a resettlement area for squatters from

Paya  Lebar who were resettled there when work began

on  the  Singapore  Airport, Government  accepted  a

special responsibility towards them. Government  has

also  decided  to  accept  a special  responsibility

towards the families at Ulu Bedok where the flooding

this   year   was  largely  due  to   new   drainage

construction works in the vicinity. These  works,  I

understand, will be completed soon and it  is  hoped

that  no flood damage will occur there again in  the

future. As regards the other areas where only  minor

flooding  took place, Government must  regard  these

minor  elemental disturbances as the normal  hazards

of farming life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Government's special attitude to the

Bedok  resettlement  area and the  Ulu  Bedok  area,

assessment   teams  completed  on   Wednesday,   1st

February,  their  investigation of losses  sustained

and,   based   on   the  findings,  Government   has

subsequently  authorised relief  and  rehabilitation

payments to flood victims amounting to $43,001. This

amount was paid out by the Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



Welfare  Department  on  Monday  afternoon  and   on

Tuesday  morning,  the  6th  and  7th  of  February.

Meanwhile, drainage constructional work,  which  has

been  in operation since the second half of November

last  year, is going forward and it is not  expected

that  the  Bedok  resettlement  area  will,  in  the

future, suffer flood damage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department, the Social Welfare Department and the Police Force answered my call

immediately to start rescue work. However,  morning

tea  was not served to the refugees until the  next

day  at  two  o'clock. The Hon. the  Minister  for Communications  and Works is  the  one  I  wish  to

attack, because I remember that in July I raised  a

question   urging   the  Hon. the   Minister   for Communications -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I would like

to  comment on the Government survey team which went

round  assessing the needs of the flood  victims.  I

<div align="center"><b>CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE TO CHIEF MINISTER OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION ON SUCCESS OF MERDEKA MISSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is a

great  day for the Federation and I would ask  leave

of  you,  Sir,  and  of the hon.  Members  to  waive

Standing Orders in order to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that Mr Speaker do

convey  to  the Chief Minister of the Federation  on

behalf  of  the Assembly and the people of Singapore

our  sincere congratulations on the success  of  his

Merdeka  Mission and the certain prospect that  soon

our   brothers  across  the  Straits  will   be   an

independent   people  within  the  Commonwealth   of

Nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the Chief Minister the assent of

the Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, and in

view of your ruling, I have the honour to inform you

that  I  have  the  consent of  His  Excellency  the

Governor to move this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that we have not got before us the

full   communique  and  the  full  details  of   the

particulars of the success of the Federation Merdeka

Mission, and perhaps in the normal course, we should

have  waited for another day until we were conscious

of  its  full  implications before we expressed  our

congratulations and our joy; but, Sir, today,  if  I

may  bring in a personal aspect, is the birthday  of

Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,  the  Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one newspaper has already put it, he is

the chief architect of a new nationhood in the world

family  of  independent nations. I  have  personally

known  him for six years and during those six years,

I  have  known him as a tireless worker  with  quiet

wisdom  in the single-minded thoughts of the freedom

of his country. That his country is now on the verge

of freedom is, in no small measure, due to him and I

trust this Assembly will understand when I say  that

it  is appropriate that these congratulations should

have  a personal aspect - congratulations not only  to

the people of the Federation but to the Tunku - and it

is  for this reason that I anticipate and seek  that

we  should send these congratulations to him on this

day, which has personal significance for him as well

as   great   significance  for  our   brothers   and

neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is enough information from reliable

Press sources to indicate that he is happy with  the

achievements of this Mission; that, in  fact,  there

is  every  likelihood that our brothers  across  the

Straits will achieve freedom next year. Sir, this is

the  triumph  of a sincere man and of a  people  who

have  the  sense  to recognise his ability  and  his

sincerity - a people who gave him unstinting support.

There is no P.A.P. in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been, Sir, and there are matters of

irritation, matters of difference between  Singapore

and the Federation. Probably there will be for quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



some  time. In what family are brothers in  absolute

and   complete  harmony?  Basically,  Sir,   we   in

Singapore  are  at one with the Federation  and  its

people.  Their  troubles  are  our  troubles,  their

welfare our welfare, and their joy our joy. We  feel

for  them - I  feel  for them - more than  a  matter of

respect,  something that goes deeper than affection,

and   on  this  great  and  thrilling  day  for  the

Federation, all irritations and all differences  are

swept aside and I know we will all join together  to

tell  the  Federation and its great  leader  of  our

unbounded  joy  and our unalloyed gladness.  In  the

normal course, Sir, we would be happy to hear of any

country   that  escapes  the  vulture  clutches   of

colonialism,  but when it comes to our brothers  and

the  Federation so near to us, Sir, this is a moment

that is deeper than words can express.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask and I hope that by its unanimity

the  House  can show its feelings, though the  words

are  poor, that you do, in the name of this Assembly

and of the people of Singapore, express to the Chief

Minister  of the Federation and through him  to  the

people  of  his country our joy, our congratulations

and  our  good wishes. May their freedom come  soon!

May it mean peace, prosperity and a glorious future!

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I stand in this Assembly as the

representative of the newly formed Liberal-Socialist

Party.   You  will  have  noticed,  Sir,   that   the

Progressive  and the Democratic Parties have  become

one, and today I speak as the leader of this largest

group of Assemblymen in the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hurrah!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Certainly, Sir, all Singapore

will rejoice at this, save the destructive P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Wait till you get fixed at the

next election!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> As the Hon. the Chief Minister

has  said,  today  is indeed a great  day - a  day  of

rejoicing. We, who are living in Asia; we, who  have

seen  many countries being dictated to from  foreign

lands,  are  indeed glad that today  the  Tunku  has

announced  that the Federation of Malaya  will  soon

throw  away  the  shackles  of  foreign  power   and

domination. Our sister across the Straits  is  about

the  nearest  land to us, and we know that  the  two

territories are inter-dependent on each  other.  The

Federation  is now on its way to freedom.  We  hope,

Sir,   that  we  will  be  on  that  same   road   to

independence.  We have fought and we  will  keep  on

fighting  to  attain independence. The  announcement

today  gives  us courage in this House  to  keep  on

fighting and see that we get even greater things. We

have  always  led in such matters of  constitutional

advances. We hope, Sir, that we will keep that  lead

and  that  we  will  come  out  as  two  independent

territories. In all probability, Sir, later  on,  we

will  have  a Confederation of Malaya. I  therefore,

Sir,  feel that it is not only a duty but a  joy  to

support this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

somewhat  different occasion from the last one  when

the Hon. the Chief Minister moved a resolution which

was seconded by this side of the House. In times  of

stress  and  strain, they look  to  the  P.A.P. for

support.  In times of joy and rejoicing,  they  look

for   fair   weather  friends,   those   who,   like

themselves, enjoy the flesh-pots of life. They  look

across  to  the newly-formed Socialists  to  support

this resolution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Better men -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hope the Chief Minister of the

Federation,  when  he receives  this  message,  will

understand  that  we wish him, and through  him  the

people of the Federation, every success not only  in

winning  Merdeka but in making it work. But I  would

refrain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



from joining the Hon. the Chief Minister in taking a

personal   line   in  congratulating   Tunku   Abdul

Rahman - not because I think less highly of  him  than

the Hon. the Chief Minister does, but because I feel

that in the fight for freedom it is not individuals,

however  great, however illustrious,  however  able,

who  make  the difference. It is the whole movement.

It   is   the   spirit  which  inspires  the   whole

generation. The people of the Federation have  shown

unequivocably  in  the  last  ten  years  since  the

British returned to Malaya that they will have  none

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also notice that on occasions such as this, our

new-found  Socialist comrades on this  side  of  the

House  talk  of fighting for freedom. They  want  to

lead  the  fight.  I  often  wonder  whom  they  are

thinking of fighting, because they have been so long

in  this game that I think they have forgotten  whom

they  were  fighting  against, for  what  they  were

fighting, and for whom they were fighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had this morning a glimpse of the old

Chief  Minister when he told us that he was  ashamed

of  this  constitution, that he  was  but  a  shadow

Minister, and that we must fight and struggle on for

independence. I knew that sooner or later  he  would

come  back to a complete circle. First he downs  it.

Then  he says, in moments of elation and joy, "I  am

the  Government. We are the Government. We represent

you." Then in moments of depression he says, "We are

shadow  Ministers. Things are not working. Out  with

colonialism!"   Every  time  they  say   "Out   with

colonialism", we are with them; but every time  they

say  "We are the Government", we stand on the  side-lines  and watch them and ask, "How long will it  be

before he goes back one complete circle?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing about the Federation's Chief

Minister - this  is perhaps the only personal  note  I

will  touch  on  in referring to that  distinguished

gentleman - is  that  he  has  the  great  quality  of

knowing when not to say anything.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



That is a great advantage, because it saves him  the

inconvenience  of having to deny what  was  said  or

what   was  said  wrongly.  In  spite  of  all   his

difficulties, he has succeeded, in a matter of  fact

way, in bringing home to the people of Malaya and to

the   Government  in  Britain  that  there  are  two

alternatives  for  the British in  Malaya.  One,  to

fight  the nationalists and the Communists, in which

case  there will be, as the Hon. the Chief  Minister

of  Singapore has said, chaos. Two, to take  a  more

sensible  approach and say, "This fight is finished,

and should have been finished years ago. Let us sort

it  out.  Let us give back to the people  of  Malaya

what has been taken away from them for so long."



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> What about the Communists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am told, Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He is a boot-licker!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do wish that

if the Hon. the Chief Minister wishes to hurt me, he

should do so in words that are full of dignity, full

of passion -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Commissar!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir that has neither dignity nor

passion.  I could, if he wished, compile  a  set  of

words which I think he might find useful whenever he

is annoyed with Members on this side of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Teach yourself!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief

Minister of the Federation and his Government has  a

gigantic  task  ahead of them. No one  knows  better

than  he himself and his colleagues, how great  that

task  is. He has got to make half independence  work

in  order that he can get full independence, and  he

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



to  do  it  under  the  most difficult  and  adverse

conditions. But he has this one great advantage.  He

has  an organisation, and it is to that organisation

that  he  owes  the  great success  of  his  Merdeka

Mission.  We are confident that he will  succeed  in

his  talks and we wish him the very best, for if  he

fails, then we are not likely to succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who sometimes talk of unity and

confederation  do not understand that  Singapore  is

the  shop-window of Malaya. This is the little place

where  people  come and do their  buying  and  their

selling.  This  is also the little laboratory  where

the  British,  the nationalists and  the  Communists

first  try  out their tactics, because  if  anything

goes  wrong, it goes wrong on a small scale. But  in

the  Federation, they go back to have the  showdown.

So  when  we say that we want to get closer  to  the

Federation, what we really mean is that we should do

away  with  this mockery of two independent  states,

two  "independent" colonies - one  a  colony  and  the

other  a  sui-generis protectorate-cum-colony.  But

one of the most damaging -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Cum, cum, let us finish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do wish that

the Hon. the Chief Minister would -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order. Is the speaker speaking to the motion? Cum,

cum!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been wondering whether what is

being  said is relevant, but perhaps the hon. Member

will come to the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

commenting   on  what  my  friend  the  Member   for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) had said. He had said

that   he   wanted  confederation  after   the   two

territories  have become independent. The  point  is

that  if  the  two  territories  become  independent

separately,  they  will  never  get  together.   The

chances of the two territories ever combining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



after  they have both got a vested interest in their

own  different kinds of independence would  make  it

impossible  for  any confederation in  the  near  or

distant future. So whilst we send the Chief Minister

of  the  Federation our sincere congratulations,  we

must  remind ourselves that now is the time to begin

associating  more closely with the  success  of  the

democratic process in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heartily support this motion

to wish the Tunku and his colleagues all success.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion before the House. The Member  for

Serangoon,  leader  of  the  newly-formed   Liberal-Socialist  Party,  has  already  said  that  he   is

seconding the motion before the House on behalf  of

his  Party, of which I am one of the members. But  I

am also sure that the two Labour Members on our side

will also join when I am speaking for them -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Join which Party?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Have they gone over?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Will you please allow me to

speak, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have called the Assembly to order,

Mr Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Members of the Labour Front

who are on our side, is that quite clear? Sir, while

congratulating the Tunku and his people, I must  say

that  the  achievement was due to his  hold  on  the

people by getting 99 per cent of the elected members

on  his side. No government on earth can ever refuse

such  a  man his demand for freedom. He has achieved

this, and achieved rightly, because he has the whole

people's backing behind him -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And so, Mr R. Jumabhoy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, the time might come when

the  Government, aware of its responsibility and out

of  respect, feels that it should not be leading  or

ruling  this  country with the help of the  colonial

power -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We will not have to, because

of our self-respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not a matter of whether the

Hon. the Chief Minister wants me or not.  I  am  in

this  Assembly by my own right. I do not stand  here

at his pleasure or anybody's pleasure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear! Fight him!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, before the election I

happened   to  meet  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman   in   the

Federation,  and he told me, "Mr Jumabhoy,  I  will

never dare to form a Government unless I have  a  75

per  cent  majority on my side." To the surprise  of

all, he has got 99 per cent. Who can say No to him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing more, Sir. From this platform that I am

speaking,  I will ask the Tunku a question  when  he

returns.  Is it a credit to U.M.N.O. that his  Party

in   Singapore   should  support  this  undemocratic

Government prevailing over here?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr R. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, when is this -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I consider him to be a - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I do not - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Do you allow this word, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I never heard that word. I want to

have  order in this Assembly. I have certain  powers

and I think hon. Members know the powers I have when

I  am  presiding in this Assembly. I will  not  have

unseemly  utterances, unseemly words and  irrelevant

speeches. I pulled the hon. Member up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



before  the Chief Minister because I thought he  was

perhaps  getting  a  little irrelevant.  The  motion

simply is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that Mr Speaker do

convey  to the Chief Minister of the Federation  our

sincere congratulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all. I cannot see how any remarks about

other  Governments can be relevant, and therefore  I

ask  the hon. Member to stick to the motion and  let

us get on with our business.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Is it

creditable   for   the  Hon. the  Chief   Minister,

representing the Government, to use such words to  a

Member of the Assembly? I did not know, Sir, that you

did not hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order, let us have some order.

I would first like to hear of the word that has been

spoken.  Will  you please repeat that word,  Mr  R.

Jumabhoy?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> You had better ask him, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, you tell him!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must have some order in this House.

If  any  hon. Member rises on a point of  order,  he

must  first explain his point of order. I  will  not

ask any other Member to explain that point of order.

If the Member for Telok Ayer wishes to raise a point

of order, let us have it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, continuing with

this   motion  before  the  House,  I  have  already

described what power the Tunku holds over his people

and  I  am  glad  that with that power  he  has  got

everything that he wanted.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the first instance, I thought that it was not for me

to  speak  on  this motion since the leader  of  the

Government  and  the leaders of the Opposition  have

already voiced their agreement with this motion, but

because  both Members of the Opposition have  stated

that they are speaking for their Party, I think that

it is a good thing to speak as an Independent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret, Sir, that this motion has been the

subject  of  very bad remarks coming from  both  the

Government and Opposition Benches. I think, Sir, that

Members  of  the  Assembly should always  be  broad-minded in their remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must rule that that is completely

irrelevant. It does not touch at all on the  motion.

Let us get on with

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I was only suggesting that we

should not have adopted a cat and dog policy in this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully associate myself with the sentiments

expressed  on this motion. There is one  outstanding

thing which I would mention in this debate, and that

is  that the Federation has achieved self-government

in  a  most  orderly  manner, without  violence  and

without much difficulty. The Chief Minister  of  the

Federation  also  has the support not  only  of  all

Parties   but  also  of  all  the  people  in   that

territory.  We  in  Singapore look  forward  to  our

independence  under the guidance  of  the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister and the delegation which  will  very

shortly be proceeding to the United Kingdom,  and  I

hope   that   this   Assembly  will   have   another

opportunity for joyful congratulations when  we  get

our independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

frankly  speaking I had no intention of speaking  on

this  motion, because a motion of this  nature  will

definitely  receive the support of every  Member  of

this House, irrespective of what political Party  he

belongs  to.  But what prompts me to  speak  is  the

remark  made  by the Member for Telok Ayer  (Mr  R.

Jumabhoy)  that  he was speaking on  behalf  of  the

Member  for  Farrer Park (Mr A.  R.  Lazarous)  and

myself.  As a matter of fact, the Member for  Farrer

Park  and  I have not allied ourselves to any  Party

yet. Though from the Labour Front and though we have

crossed the Floor, we stand as Independents  and  we

take  issues  independently,  according  to  our  own

conscience and our own views.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message to the Tunku is the real keynote of

this House in that it will indicate to the people  of

Singapore  that,  following in the footsteps  of  the

Tunku,  we  will  achieve independence  in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Member for Farrer Park and myself,

I do wish the Tunku every success and congratulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>MUSLIMS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have the consent of the Governor

under Standing Order 33 (1) (a) to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now, I regret to say, several years since

representations were first received on behalf of the

Muslim  community  in Singapore,  through  the  good

offices  of  the Muslim Advisory Board,  asking  for

legislation  to remedy the unsatisfactory  state  of

affairs   regarding   Muslim   divorces   and    the

administration  of the law of Muslim  marriages  and

divorces.  I had hoped, Sir, to get such legislation

enacted  in  the previous Legislative  Council  but,

unfortunately, it could not be got ready in time. In

fact,  it  was only in November last year that  this

Bill was ready for introduction to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main cause of concern amongst the Muslim

community  in  Singapore is the very  high  rate  of

divorce amongst Muslim marriages. Investigations  in

1953 revealed a divorce rate of about 60 per cent of

the  corresponding marriage rate - a  very  disturbing

figure.  Muslim marriages and divorces are regulated

by the Muslims Ordinance Chapter 57 of our Laws, and

as  the law stands at present, any one of the twelve

Kathis in Singapore, as a Deputy Registrar of Muslim

Marriages, can register a marriage or a divorce  for

any Muslim person who has been resident in Singapore

for more than four months. Each of these Kathis also

has  the power of a civil court to enquire into  and

adjudicate  upon  claims for the payment  of  dowry,

maintenance  and  such  matters.  These  Kathis  are

appointed  by the Governor, but they are  not  paid.

They  retain the fees for solemnising marriages  and

registering  divorces,  and  appeals  against  their

decisions  go  to the Registrar of Muslim  Marriages

who is not himself a Muslim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it is generally admitted amongst the

Muslim   community   here  that   there   has   been

considerable  laxity  in the administration  of  the

Muslim law of marriage and divorce. There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



some  conflict of jurisdiction between  the  Kathis,

and  there is a tendency, perhaps not unnatural, for

a Kathi to register a divorce rather than to attempt

to  effect a reconciliation between the parties; nor

has there been adequate supervision of the Kathis by

the  Registrar of Muslim Marriages. It has therefore

long  been recommended that fresh legislation should

be  introduced  to establish Muslim Courts  for  the

better  administration of the Muslim law of marriage

and  divorce,  and the necessary legislation  is,  1

hope, provided in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill repeals the present law - the Muslims

Ordinance  (Chapter 57) - and, while re-enacting  many

of  its provisions, makes provision in addition  for

the  appointment  of, firstly, a  Chief  Kathi  with

jurisdiction over the whole of Singapore and certain

special  powers; and, secondly, for the  appointment

of  a  Shariah Court under the Registrar  of  Muslim

Marriages who is himself to be a Muslim, with  power

to  determine  issues  between Muslims  relating  to

marriage and divorce in connected matters, and  with

power  to  hear  appeals from the decisions  of  the

Kathi; and, thirdly, it provides for the appointment

of  an Appeal Board to hear appeals from the Shariah

Court.   There  are  certain  particular  provisions

which,  I think, perhaps could better be dealt  with

at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of this Bill, I am assured, are

warmly welcomed by the Muslim community and they are

recommended  by  the  Muslim  Advisory  Board.   The

detailed provisions of the Bill involve a number  of

points  of Muslim law and procedure, and even  after

all   these   months   of   preparatory   work   and

consultation,  I  am still receiving representations

for amendments on points of detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay translation of the Bill has been

published, which I hope will enable persons, who are

not  able  to  understand the Bill  in  the  English

language   and  who  have  experience   and   expert

knowledge  in this matter, to study it  and  I  hope

that if any one has any further comments to make  on

the  Bill,  they  can  be sent  to  me  as  soon  as

possible; for I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>

am anxious that there should be no further avoidable

delay in enacting this piece of legislation which  I

am sure is for the benefit of the Muslim community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most practical way of finalising the

details of the Bill will be to refer it to a  Select

Committee  of  this House. This will have  one  very

particular  advantage in that the  Select  Committee

will  be  able to hear evidence from experts  should

there be any particular point of difficulty on which

doubts have to be resolved. I shall therefore at the

appropriate stage move that this Bill be referred to

a  Select Committee, and I very much hope that  that

Select Committee will be able to report the Bill  at

our March sitting so that we can proceed with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

congratulate the Muslim Advisory Board in asking the

Government  to  put  before this  House  legislation

which is overdue and which is very necessary.  I  am

glad that the Hon. the Chief Secretary has very ably

put his points before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to speak on the principle of the Bill.

As far as the registration of marriages and divorces

among  Muslims and the establishment  of  a  Shariah

Court are concerned, I wonder if any one would  want

to  postpone  these  for even a single  minute,  but

clause 47 is something very new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-known lawyer Mr N. A. Mallal, who is a

Muslim  by faith, has sent some suggestions  to  the

Muslim  Advisory Board. I am glad that the Hon. the

Chief Secretary has already announced that this Bill

will   be  committed  to  a  Select  Committee   for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point also - Muslims of age can

make  their  own  will. I hope the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary might be able to help by pointing out  the

relevant  clause. In this tropical country,  Sir,  a

boy and a girl can reach the age of puberty, say, at

the age of 14, 15 or 16



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



and to allow these minors to make a will is rather

not proper -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Clause 46.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Clause 46, thank you. Sir, I hope

the Select Committee will also consider this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to clause 47, Sir, if a Muslim dies

intestate, it is quite right that the estate  should

be  administered according to Muslim law. But  if  a

Muslim has left a will - and this is a Colony and  not

a Muslim state, in which there should be freedom for

any  individual  to  make  a  will  in  any  way  he

likes - then  he should not be interfered  with.  That

freedom  should be given to him. That  is  the  main

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other clauses in this Bill, such as

the one relating to voluntary settlements, which are

governed  by  the  English law. If  it  is  so  that

certain  clauses  are  to be governed  according  to

English  law,  why  should not  clause  47  also  be

governed according to English law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, as I have said, that the Bill is to be

committed   to   a  Select  Committee   where   full

discussion can take place before decisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir. I

wonder  if  the hon. Member will be good  enough  to

make it clear to me whether his comment on clause 47

was  that a Muslim should be allowed to make a  will

other than in accordance with Muslim law?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It was.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  in support  of  the  Second

Reading of the Muslims Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, this Bill deals with the

fate  of  a  particular community. For a  long  time

now - in fact, for decades - Muslim leaders in Singapore

have bemoaned the fact that there are no laws in the

statute  book  of  this island which  are  effective

enough to deal with the growing complexities of  the

way of life of the Muslim people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill deals with two main aspects of Islamic

law. The first affects the ques-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



tion of marriages and divorces, and the second deals

with  the question of inheritance. Although  in  the

past  the  Muslims of Singapore have been guided  by

the laws of the Koran, there are no means within the

concept  of our existing laws by which these Koranic

laws  could be effectively carried out. As a result,

there  has been a considerable degree of abuse.  One

has  only to read the statistics of Muslim marriages

and  divorces in Singapore to realise the  magnitude

of  this  problem. The Hon. the Chief Secretary  has

given  us figures for 1953, but I can quote you  the

latest  figures  on Muslim marriages  and  divorces,

that  is,  for  the year 1955, where the  number  of

Muslim  marriages totalled 2,472, and the number  of

divorces 1,247.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state of affairs creates other problems as

well. Children born out of these marriages are  left

without  one  or  the  other of  their  parents  and

invariably  without  the means of  subsistence.  The

reasons are obvious. Divorces are apparently made so

easy when husbands realise that the decisions of the

Kathis in respect of alimony and maintenance are not

easily enforceable. It is to right these wrongs that

this  Bill is now before us. I hope Members  of  the

Assembly  will  give their fullest support  to  this

piece of legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope

I  am not rushing in where Muslims fear to tread but

I  think  that,  as the Bill is going  to  a  Select

Committee, I should draw the attention of Members to

something  I saw in the London Times the  other  day

which said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Pakistan Constituent Assembly today, Mr

Zahiruddin, of the Awami League, proposing that  the

draft  constitution  Bill be referred  to  a  select

committee,  raised  a pertinent issue  when  he  was

asked  who  was  to  decide who was  or  was  not  a

Muslim."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in the draft Bill here it merely says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muslim" means a person who professes the religion

of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article in the London Times goes on to say,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Zahiruddin quoted from a well known Lahore

case  where  he  said that the learned  Judge  asked

eight  learned theologians the definition of Muslim,

and each one of them gave a different definition. It

was, he said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



very  important for the Constituent Assembly to  lay

down  the definition of a Muslim. There are  Sunnis,

Shias,  Wahabis, and Quadianis and some of  them  do

not recognise the others as Muslim."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> It may be of interest to the

Assembly and I offer it to Members.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  fully  support  the Bill  now  before  this

Assembly.  It  is  perhaps the  first  time  in  the

history of Singapore that such a Bill, which affects

a  section of the community, has been introduced  in

the  Legislature of the island. But this  is  not  a

piece  of  legislation which is unknown  in  Malaya.

Most,  if  not  all,  of the  Malay  States  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya  have  on  the  statute  book

similar legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims of Singapore are fully aware of the

desirability  to regularise their mode  of  conduct,

particularly in relation to marriages and  divorces,

and also the question of inheritance. Sir, I support

the Bill in principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  great  pleasure in rising to  support  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my experience on the Bench as a magistrate,

one  of  the things that gave me the biggest trouble

was  those  unfortunate women  who  came  to  me  to

enforce  maintenance orders against  their  husbands

who had left them. In those days before the war, the

problem  was  not as grave as it is today.  Divorces

then  were  not at such a high rate,  but,  all  the

same,  some  of the cases really gave  me  sleepless

nights. If my recollection serves me correctly,  the

only obligation the husband has towards his wife  is

to  support her for 100 days after the date  of  his

talak. I hope, by this Bill, all these practices and

misuse will be abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<div align="center"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill, be committed to a Select committee

of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will you indicate the composition?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Is not that for the Committee of

Selection?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled in the past that the

Standing  Order dealing with Select Committees  does

not apply to a Select Committee on Bills. So, if you

will  move  that the Bill be committed to  a  Select

Committee  consisting  of  Mr  X  as  Chairman  and

perhaps five or six Members to be nominated  by  the

Committee  of  Selection, then that  will  meet  the

case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am sorry about it, Sir, but I have

not  consulted the other side of the House  whom  we

are  to put on the Select Committee. Is it in  order

for  me to nominate four Members from my side of the

House and leave the other side to put on three?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The method I think to be adopted is

the  one  which I have indicated, and which probably

is  the  method that will be accepted, and that  is,

name  whoever  you think should be the Chairman  and

then  leave  the selection of the actual Members  of

the Select Committee to the Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, but I

understood you to say that that could not be.  I  am

happy   to  move  that  there  should  be  a  Select

Committee  on this Bill under your chairmanship  and

with  such  Members  as  may  be  nominated  by  the

Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Without any limit as to number?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

with  the  Speaker  as Chairman and  members  to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection.

<div align="center"><b>LANGUAGES OF THE ASSEMBLY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Appointment of Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the 7th

of  April,  1955, to the 8th of February,  1956,  we

have had ten tumultuous, dynamic and fruitful months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



and   during   that  period,  Sir,  we   have   been

responsible for measures of which we are very  proud

and there are many other measures which will shortly

come  before  this  Assembly and to  which  we  look

forward with pride.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst them we will have a new, honest

educational structure, free legal aid and advice, an

island-wide complete land freeze, nationalisation of

transport,  an effective system of local authorities

and  public utilities, and, on the horizon, as  soon

as  the  Committees have reported, we hope  to  have

measures   before   this  Assembly   for   effective

Malayanisation to give Malayans their rightful place

in the service of their people and effective control

of the government machinery. We hope to have further

employer/employee  legislation  and  to  introduce

efficient means of avoiding unnecessary strikes  and

providing better machinery for mediation without  in

any  way depriving the worker of the ultimate weapon

of the strike to be used in extreme cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, Sir, we are looking forward to measures

to impose provisions of basic standards of living to

maintain  the  worker in conditions compatible  with

the dignity of a human being and with .our financial

resources.  But  of all these measures,  Sir,  I  am

proudest  of this motion which I have the  privilege

of  moving in this House today, and I move it,  Sir,

in  all  humility, not as Chief Minister but as  the

elected  representative of the people of  Cairnhill.

This  is not a Government measure. There will be  no

Whip,  Sir, on our side of the House. Every  man  in

the Labour Front and every one of our colleagues  of

the Alliance will speak from his heart and according

to  his conscience. The principle of this measure is

one which has guided and which will always guide the

conduct  of this Government and which, I hope,  will

guide  the conduct of all future governments of  the

territory of Singapore. In essence, the principle is

one of equal justice for all races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1953, when the Rendel Commission was

sitting  and invited representations, though  I  had

neither   political  affiliations,   nor   political

ambitions nor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



thought  of any - I was a private citizen - I  did  take

time off to write to that Commission and appeal  for

recognition  of  the principle of  multi-lingualism.

There was then no talk about multilingualism, not  a

word  in the Press. The silver tongue of our friend,

Mr  Yap Pheng Geck, was otherwise engaged.  But  to

any  one,  Sir, who sought to look beyond the  black

pall  of colonialism to our problems when we finally

are  able  to  live our own lives, the  problem  was

obvious and monumental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore are a conglomeration of several

fully   developed  races  living  in   culture-tight

compartments under the dead hand of colonialism. All

Asian communities suffer equal injustice under  that

regime, but once colonialism is lifted off our necks

and  we are able to lift up our heads, where  do  we

seek  equal justice? Equal justice for all races  we

must have, Sir, or else the agony will be worse  and

certainly no better than that through which we  have

passed  and through which we are passing.  Today  we

live under the domination of one race. What does  it

benefit  us  to  change masters and live  under  the

domination of a different race? To live fully and to

be  free,  there  must  be  an  end  to  all  racial

domination,  whether  European  or  Asian.   It   is

essential  that the foundation be laid  whereby  all

races will be equal partners in the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language, Sir, has been and is an instrument of

racial culture. To impose one language on the  whole

population is to impose the domination of  that  one

race.  In  this plural society of ours, if  we  seek

justice for all, we must reject mono-lingualism  and

accept  the principle of multi-lingualism. We  must,

Sir,  give  equal respect to as many  of  the  major

languages as meet the essential needs of the people.

I  am  advised  and  I  believe that  Mandarin  will

satisfy our Chinese people of all dialects.  I  know

that  Malay will satisfy our Malays and Indonesians.

I   believe  that  Tamil  will  satisfy  our  Indian

domiciled  community, and English will  satisfy  the

Eurasians,  the domiciled Europeans, of  whom  there

are a few, and other English-speaking groups. Sir, I

am not unconscious that, in this fascinating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



city  of  ours,  we have many other races  and  many

other languages but like true Singaporeans, they are

reasonable and they realise their small numbers and,

by  virtue of the progressively growing difficulties

of  additional languages, it would be impossible  to

give  consideration to more than four  languages.  I

ask this Assembly therefore that we should recognise

the  four  principal  cultures of  this  country  by

accepting as official languages for oral debate  the

four principal languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the matter was broached to the Secretary

of  State  for the Colonies, he sought to  draw  our

attention, in a friendly way, to the many  technical

difficulties  implied in such  a  procedure,  and  I

freely confessed to him, "Of course, we are going to

have  difficulties."  I  anticipate  that  for  many

years,  Sir,  our service for translations  will  be

inadequate to cope with keeping our records in other

than  one language. I anticipate that when  we  have

Ministers  who do not speak English, they will  have

to  have  highly  qualified  personal  interpreters,

perhaps more than one to each.



I  anticipate  that we will have some difficulty  in

getting highly trained interpreters who have  to  do

simultaneous interpretation, which is an  art,  Sir.

We will unquestionably lose something of the nuances

in  debate  and  I  fear that, for  the  non-English

speaking, they are going to lose a lot of the fun of

the interruptions of the hon. Member for the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They will still come in any

language!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> But, Sir, these are minor

difficulties and if they were all, I for  one  would

sleep   peacefully.  But  I  think  that  we  should

recognise there are more than difficulties. There is

one   danger - a  grave  danger - involved   in   multi-lingualism and we should face it. Language has  been

traditionally the principal unifying factor  in  the

formation of nations. How are we, with equal respect

for  four  parallel cultures and four languages,  to

form  one  nation?  Are we going to  build  up  four

warring groups in a pocket handkerchief area? I  am,

Sir,  all too conscious of the explosive content  in

linguistic conflict. I think hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



Members  are aware that but recently we have watched

with  anguish the riots which have taken a  toll  of

more   than   two  hundred - week-long  riots - in   the

Presidency  of Bombay - where the Chief  Minister,  by

the way, is one of the strongest and one of the most

experienced  politicians I have  ever  met - and  they

rose,  Sir,  out  of  linguistic  conflict.   I   am

conscious  of,  and I think other hon.  Members  are

fully  aware and watching with concern, the  growing

tension   in   Ceylon  arising  out  of   linguistic

conflict.  Is  this going to happen  here?  Are  our

racial  cultures going to develop so selfishly  once

they  are  freed from colonial restraint?  Are  they

going  to bring destruction instead of construction?

That is the danger - a very real danger. Is there  any

precedent  for such an experiment as  that  which  I

seek to ask hon. Members to embark on? I have sought

to  find an analogy, Sir, and the nearest I can find

is that in Switzerland where they have four national

languages - German, French, Italian and Romanish - and

where,  despite  the  diversity  of  languages   and

cultures, they have a united nation. It is true that

they are racially not as diverse as we are here  but

there,   there  is  an  example  of  unity   despite

linguistic  and cultural diversity. Can we  hope  to

produce, Sir, men of sober political sense,  men  of

cool judgment who will maintain peace and racial co-operation and harmony, as is done in Switzerland?  I

say  we  must have faith. I have faith, Sir. I  have

lived  here since my birth and I have faith  in  the

extraordinary adaptability, the resilience  and  the

friendliness of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one doubt. Neither the Swiss nor any other

nation  that I know of in similar circumstances  had

to  cope  simultaneously  with  Communist  and  pro-Communist  activities. Here  in  Singapore  we  have

watched  them and it is true that wherever there  is

any  question  of disagreement, wherever  they  can

destroy  stability, wherever they can seek  falsely,

maliciously,  by  extortion or  otherwise,  to  bring

disrepute  upon established organisations,  wherever

there  are  little disagreements racially  which  we

would, in the normal course, if in Switzerland or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



elsewhere, without these infernal people, have  come

to  a  friendly conclusion, these disagreements  are

tortured  and  whipped  up by their  Communists  and

their  friends with one end in view - and that is  the

destruction  of stability, an attempt  to  keep  the

country  constantly off-balance  in  the  hope  that

ultimately  the  accumulation  of  their   carefully

planned campaign of bitterness would one day blow up

into  chaos  and  give them and their  comrades  the

opportunity  of having Commissars. We are  conscious

that   these   forces  are  not   without   men   of

intelligence,  are unscrupulous, and not  themselves

ideologically inclined but seeking to ride the band-wagon that they think will lead them to success - self-interest. The sympathizers are the dangers. We  have

seen  the  Communist forces and how they work  under

the cloak of democracy during the time of the Public

Security  Bill, and we will see more of them.  Sir,

can  we  in  Singapore with this element  constantly

trying  to keep us off-balance maintain the  balance

necessary, the racial harmony without which  we  are

destroyed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is being asked to undertake an

experiment   no  other  country  has  attempted   in

circumstances without analogy anywhere. But what  is

the  alternative? The alternative, Sir, is to adopt,

and  perhaps adapt, the existing colonial system  and

make English, and perhaps Malay, just as a sop,  the

official languages. Would that work? I have  sought,

Sir, within my abilities, which I do not pretend are

extensive, with some of the experience that  I  have

gained in the last ten months to assess that, and  I

say that, in my own view, Sir, we could survive with

the  help  of  the bayonet and the bullet  in  those

circumstances  for  about three to  four  years  and

thereafter   the  forces  of  cultural  and   racial

frustration   of  the  servient  communities   would

explode  this island like a burst hand-grenade.  Are

we  to  sell,  Sir,  the  possibility - and  it  is  a

possibility - of a glori-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



ous  and  harmonious  future of  unity  between  all

races,  of the success of this unique experiment  in

these  unique  difficult circumstances?  Are  we  to

sacrifice  them for a few years of uneasy peace  and

thereafter certain extinction? That would be the act

of  a coward. I believe we must have the courage  to

face  the  tribulations  of  growth  along  natural,

honest lines. Inter-racial tribulations, let  us  be

frank, I fear there will be, but I believe Singapore

will,   because  Singapore  must,  produce  men   of

stature, respected leaders of the various races with

immense   patience,  immense  tact   and   unlimited

goodwill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fully conscious, gravely conscious of the

dangers inherent in this motion and the grave effect

of  its alternative, I ask the House to move forward

towards  an  honest era, because the  acceptance  of

this motion is the acceptance of the cornerstone  of

all  legislation for our future - the  principle,  now

and forever, of equal justice for all races.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> As the Master Plan has yet to be approved by the Government, it would be premature now to consider any scheme or resettlement that may be necessitated by the Plan. As the Honourable Member is aware, Government has had in operation for some time resettlement schemes for people who have had to be moved from areas required for public development by the Government and will continue to operate such schemes where necessary.
