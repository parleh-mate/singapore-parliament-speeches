&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Member has, under the provisions of

subsection (2) (g) of section 42 of  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, obtained from

the Speaker, permission to be or to  remain  absent

<br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Geylang West), Minister for Education - from 29th March to 2nd May, 1962.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT ACCOMMODATION FOR REVENUE OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND MARINE STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  is  the position  with  reference  to

Government   accommodation  available  for   Revenue

Officers and Marine Staff of the Customs and  Excise

Department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

Customs  and Excise Department there are at  present 376  Revenue officers of all grades and  115  Marine

Staff.  Under  their terms of service,  the  Revenue

Officers  may be required to reside in institutional

quarters,  and 207 of them are occupying  Government

quarters.  Although  the terms  of  service  of  the

Marine  Staff  do  not  require  them  to  stay   in

institutional  quarters, 58 of  them  are,  however,

occupying quarters. The remaining 56 quarters Out of

a  total of 321 under the control of the Customs and

Excise Department are occupied by other grades.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister indicate whether

any  assistance would be given by Government, or any

contemplated provision by Government, for increasing

the  accommodation for both the Revenue Officers and

the Marine Staff?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Expansion of quarters is being

provided  for  in the State Development  Plan.  This

year another 24 Division III quarters would be built

for  the  accommodation  of  Revenue  Officers,  and

another 32 quarters next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REPORTS ON STEEL MILLS AND ON INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether it is the Government's intention  to

table  (a) the Schereschewsky Report on Steel  Mills

and   (b)   the   Winsemius  Report  on   Industrial

Development, and when will they be tabled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the

intention  of  the Government to publish  these  two

Reports. Both Reports were made to the Government on

a confidential basis and cannot be published without

the  consent  of  the  U.N, agencies  to  which  the

experts belong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schereschewsky Mission made recommendations on

the  establishment of a steel industry in  Singapore

which  could  be  carried out in three  phases.  The

first  phase  is  to start immediately.  The  second

phase  is  to  be  implemented when  conditions  are

favourable and after certain technical studies  have

been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time has been lost in carrying out the

recommendations of the steel mission in  respect  of

the first phase. The steel plant is in the course of

establishment at Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Winsemius Mission made recommendations on the

establishment  of  certain  specific  industries  in

various    fields.    In   addition,    they    made

recommendations on general economic policy  as  well

as  a  review  on  present  potential  strength  and

sources and weaknesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert missions sent by the United Nations are

of   value   only   if  they  are   able   to   make

recommendations to the best of their  judgement  and

ability.   They  must  not  be  inhibited   by   any

possibility  that their analysis of the problem  and

recommendations as to solutions would be the subject

of public political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



controversy.  For this reason the Government  cannot

publish the Reports of the two expert missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical details of the Winsemius Report,

such  as  the  type  of  industries  that  could  be

established,   the  scale  of  plant,  manufacturing

processes suitable to Singapore, and other technical

details  are  being made available to investors  who

are contemplating setting up a factory in Singapore.

This work is carried out by the Economic Development

Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister seems to have given two

reasons. I do not know whether they are exclusive or

supplementary. Do I understand that  the  Report  is

not  confidential  to the Singapore  Government  but

confidential to the United Nations agency which made

it? Or do I understand that, in fact, the reason  is

that it is a policy of the Singapore Government  not

to  make  public reports by United Nations agencies?

If  it  is  the second, is the Minister  aware  that

there   has  been  publication  of  United   Nations

agencies' reports on other topics?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Basically it is a decision of

the Singapore Government not to publish this Report.

If  we  decided to publish them or if we  wanted  to

publish  them, we would have to obtain the agreement

of  the United Nations. They may or may not have any

objections,  but  we have never reached  that  stage

because no such application has been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports of United Nations missions that have been

published  are generally studies made by experts  in

broad  fields  where  either no issues  arise  which

could  lead  to public or political controversy,  or

else  do  not contain information or data or  policy

guidance  which  would be in the  interests  of  the

Government concerned to keep confidential  at  least

for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does the Minister not consider that

it   would   be   helpful   to   inform   interested

industrialists  of the contents of  this  Report  by

making  it  available so that they should  know  the

data  and  the position as indicated by an impartial

world body?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said  in my reply, technical data on industries  and

economic  appraisals  on potential  development  are

being   made  available  to  industries.  But  broad

recommendations on policies or strategies  that  the

Government should follow - that part of it  we  should

keep confidential.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister has made reference to the steel  plant

that will soon be coming up. Can the Minister please

inform  this  House of the extent of aid  which  the

Government has granted to this steel plant, in terms

of percentage of capital?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are assisting the plant in

two  ways. First, by speeding up work at the  Jurong

sindustrial site. It is a pity the Member for  Cairnhill was not in the party that visited the site last

Sunday,  but the Member for Anson was, and he  could

testify that work is being vigorously carried out to

level the site and make it ready for occupation. The

second  way is by share participation. This  is  not

done  by the Government directly but by the Economic

Development  Board  and,  subject,  of  course,   to

correction,  my  recollection is that  the  Economic

Development Board is participating to the extent  of

20 per cent of the total paid-up capital.

<div align="center"><b>LEGISLATION TO COUNTERBALANCE DISPOSAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF ESTATES BY WILL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Law  whether Government  will  consider

introducing  legislation  in  this  Session  (a)  to

counterbalance,  for the protection  of  dependants,

the complete freedom of disposal of estates by Will;

and  (b)  to  meet the position whereby part  of  an

intestate's estates is taken by the State where  the

deceased leaves only a widow and no next-of-kin.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Bills to curtail

the  complete freedom of disposal of estates by Will

by  making statutory provision for the protection of

the families and dependants of deceased



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



status,  and  to make changes in the law  regulating

intestates' succession and the right of the State to

bona vacantia where the deceased leaves only a widow

with no next-of-kin, have been drafted and have been

sent  to  the  Singapore  Bar  Committee  for  their

comments.  These  Bills will be  introduced  in  the

Legislative   Assembly  after  the  views   of   the

Singapore  Bar Committee have been obtained.  But  I

cannot  assure  the House that these Bills  will  be

introduced during this Session.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE ORDINANCE, 1956</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Legal Assistance in criminal matters)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Law whether Government has any plans  for

implementation of the provisions of  the  Legal  Aid

and Advice Ordinance, 1956, for legal assistance  in

criminal matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

no.  It is not considered that the time is opportune

for  the  implementation of the  provisions  of  the

Legal  Aid  and  Advice Ordinance, 1956,  for  legal

assistance  in  criminal matters. The  need  at  the

moment  is  for  the  raising  of  the  standard  of

prosecution in criminal cases. No request  has  been

received  from the Singapore Bar Committee  for  the

implementation  of the provisions of  the  Ordinance

for legal assistance in criminal cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does the Minister really consider it

necessary  that the Bar Committee, the economics  of

whose  individual members would be affected  by  the

implementation, would seek implementation  of  those

provisions?  Is  he  going  to  wait  till  the  Bar

Committee  asks  for  the  implementation   of   the

provisions  of Part II which were passed  six  years

ago?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not really a

case of our waiting for a request from the Singapore

Bar  Committee. I know that a prosperous lawyer with

a  lucrative practice like the Member for  Anson  is

not interested in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



workings  of  the Legal Aid Bureau.  But  there  are

other counsel who are prepared to accept briefs from

the  Legal  Aid Bureau. So I think it is  unfair  to

insinuate that the reason why the Bar Committee  has

made  no  request  for  the  implementation  of  the

extension of the Ordinance to criminal cases is that

it   has   vested  interest  in  not   making   this

application.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am asking the Minister: will he

indicate the reason why provisions which were passed

six  years  ago  are not considered appropriate  for

implementation today?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was prepared for

this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of the Ordinance regarding

legal aid assistance in criminal cases which are not

in force, a Judge is obliged to grant free legal aid

if  he  is  satisfied that the applicant is  without

adequate  means and that it is in the  interests  of

justice  that  he  should be assisted.  It  is  also

provided  that  any  doubts  with  regard  to  these

matters must be resolved in favour of the applicant.

The  system  also provides for legal  assistance  in

bringing   appeals  against  convictions,   and   in

resisting appeals brought by the Public Prosecutor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the State Advocate-General and the

Solicitor-General, there are 10 Crown Counsel  fully

employed in the State Advocate-General's Chambers in

criminal work, and 5 legal officers in the Legal Aid

Department to deal with purely civil matters. If the

State were to provide for what amounts to free legal

aid  in nearly all criminal cases by virtue of  that

presumption  which I have referred to, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, the size of the Legal Aid Department would have

to  be expanded considerably, and the State would he

obliged, in effect, to undertake the defence of  all

those  whom it prosecutes. A substantial  amount  of

the  work  in the Lower Criminal Courts is concerned

with  private prosecutions for offences against  the

Penal  Code  and  the Minor Offences  Ordinance  for

which  no  assistance is provided by the  State.  If

legal  aid  were  to be extended to criminal  cases,

these  cases  could also be brought and defended  at

public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



expense. At present free legal assistance is granted

to all persons accused of capital offences. The duty

of  Government should be to improve the standard  of

prosecution before introducing legal aid in criminal

cases.  There is provision in the Estimates for  the

recruitment  of an experienced officer to  undertake

the prosecution of more important criminal cases  so

that  we  can have a prosecutor to match the  Member

for  Anson. But up to date we have not been able  to

get a suitable person to fill this appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am indebted for your indulgence. I would like  to

ask  the Minister whether he would not consider,  in

the  light  of  the  number of graduates  now  being

turned  out  by the Faculty of Law of the University

of Singapore, whether this is in fact an appropriate

time  to  consider the implementation of  provisions

which would, it is true, require the enlargement  of

both  the State Advocate-General's Chambers and  the

free Legal Aid Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this will take time.

These  graduates are very junior. They  have  to  be

trained  in  the  work. I think  when  the  time  is

opportune - it may not be within this Session - we  will

be able to do something in that direction.

<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF STAFF NURSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Law what is the number of staff  nurses

who  have  left Government Service since  1st  June,

1959, and the general reason therefor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of

staff  and student nurses who have left the  service

since 1st June, 1959, is 228. They resigned for  the

following reasons:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 resigned on marriage;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52 left to go to the United Kingdom;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49 returned to their families in the Federation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29 went on oversea study courses and resigned when

they were either in England or Australia;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 resigned for personal reasons;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 to improve their prospects;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 died;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 were medically boarded out of the service;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 went abroad to Borneo, Jesselton and Japan to

settle down there, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 gave no reasons for leaving the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same period, 617 student nurses and staff

nurses were recruited. The approved number of  posts

for  staff nurses and student nurses as at February,

1962,  is  1,319.  The  actual  strength  is  1,060,

leaving 259 vacancies still to be filled.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would ask the Minister whether the

number  given of 228 is abnormal, and if so, whether

the  rate of remuneration is more favourable in  the

Federation,  thereby attracting our  nurses  to  the

Federation service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that the

rate  of  remuneration was better in the  Federation

until  recently  when  the  variable  allowance  was

restored. The position has reversed since. The terms

of  employment are better now in Singapore than they

are in the Federation. Those who left the service to

go back to the Federation did so for family reasons.

They wished to join their families there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Retention of remuneration from private consultations and operations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Law whether he would make a statement  as

to   the   retention  of  remuneration  by   Medical

Practitioners  in Government Service in  respect  of

private consultations and operations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government medical

officers  and specialists do not retain consultation

fees  or  operation  fees.  Consultation  fees   and

operation fees earned by Government medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



officers are paid to revenue. A consultation fee  is

$25,  but is $35 if a consultant has to make a  home

visit.  Operation fees ranged from $25 to $500,  and

the  fee  payable  depends  on  the  nature  of  the

operation  and  the accommodation  provided  to  the

patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu of the fees previously earned by

Government  medical officers, Government specialists

are  paid  specialist allowances.  These  specialist

allowances vary from $200 to $500 according  to  the

grade  of  specialist  post the  officer  holds  and

whether  the  appointment  is  a  clinical   or   an

administrative one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain miscellaneous fees earned by Government

medical  officers,  such  as  attendance  at  court,

preparation   of   medical   reports   and   medical

certification of workmen's compensation claims,  may

be  retained by Government medical officers up to  a

maximum of $250 a month. Anything above this is paid

to   Government  revenue.  The  fees   charged   for

attendance  at  court are based  on  a  schedule  of

charges  approved by the Registrar  of  the  Supreme

Court. These fees are applied to the High Court  but

are  used  as  a  guide by Heads of Departments  for

determining fees for the lower courts.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would inquire whether the Minister

would   consider   giving  these   specialists   the

incentive of retaining or receiving part of the fee,

because  most of the consultations are done  outside

their  normal time in addition to their  very  heavy

work.  Does  the  Minister  not  consider  that   an

incentive  would  be helpful in respect  of  private

work from which Government benefit financially?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a lot of

abuse   with   regard  to  these  consultation   and

operation  fees prior to 1958, and  as  a  result  a

Committee  was  appointed to  look  into  the  whole

question.  A new procedure has been evolved  whereby

clinical specialists get a higher allowance in  lieu

of  fees, and non-clinical specialists get  a  lower

allowance,   and   yet   a   lower   allowance   for

administrative  medical officers.  This  system  has

been operating well, and in view of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



past  experience, it would be most  in-advisable  to

reintroduce  conditions  which  led  to  such  abuse

before.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand the Minister then to

indicate   that,   in  fact,  the  specialists   are

satisfied with these new terms and, if not, would he

be prepared to consider representations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Up to date I have inquired into the

position  and  I am not aware of any dissatisfaction

with   these  specialist  allowances.  As   far   as

specialists   employed   by   the   University   are

concerned, they have the option of either  receiving

consultation  fees, as Government  medical  officers

did  before, or, if not, negotiating separately with

the  University for a higher pay. The provisions  of

the  Government circular with regard  to  specialist

allowances  do  not  apply  to  specialist   medical

officers   employed   on  teaching   work   in   the

University.

<div align="center"><b>COMPLAINTS OF POLICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BRUTALITY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a) what is the number of persons  who,  to

the  knowledge  of  the police, have  complained  of

police  brutality  since 1st  June,  1959;  and  (b)

whether he would consider making arrangements  that,

in cases of such complaints, the complainants should

be  given  an  early  opportunity  to  identify  the

alleged assailants and to make a note of their names

and ranks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have

been  268  cases of complaints of assault by  police

officers  since 1st June, 1959. Of this number,  the

vast  majority, that is, a total of 205 cases,  were

completely unsubstantiated. They include cases where

complaints  were  investigated  and  found   to   be

completely false and malicious, and cases which were

subsequently withdrawn by the complainants.  Of  the

other  63  cases, 34 cases resulted  in  appropriate

disciplinary  action  taken  against  the   officers

concerned. In seven of the cases, the officers found

guilty  were dismissed or discharged from the Force.

Nine   cases  resulted  in  court  summonses  issued

against the officers concerned. In three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



cases the summonses were subsequently withdrawn, and

in  three  cases the officers charged were acquitted

by  the  court.  The balance of 20 cases  are  still

under investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, it

has  been  the  practice for the  police  to  afford

complainants every opportunity of identifying  their

alleged   assailants   in  all   cases   where   the

cornplainants have stated that they either could  or

might  be  able to identify them. Where  any  police

officer  has  been  so  identified,  there   is   no

objection to his name and rank being supplied to the

complainants   concerned   for   the   purpose    of

instituting court action where required.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand the Minister to give

us  an  assurance  that,  in  fact,  at  every  such

identification  parade  the  name  of  the   officer

identified will be given to the complainant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, it will be supplied.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister consider whether

it  is  appropriate  for complaints  against  police

officers  to  be investigated by some separate  body

rather than by the police themselves?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a

question  which I have been toying for the last  two

and  a  half  years. In view of the  fact  that  the

police  is a disciplined force, professional  advice

is that it is most unwise to do so.

would  say  that  there is not  only  no  reason  to

that the permit should not be issued.

surprised that the Member for Queenstown still fails

to   understand   the   constitutional   set-up   of

Internal   Security  Council  consisting  of   three

parties,  and  that although it is the  Government's

intention  to release by batches all those detainees

detained by the former Government, consent from  the

other  two  parties is necessary. We may advise  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara to release the detainees, but

it  is up to the other parties to give their consent

as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Has any attempt been made to

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I

that  not less than three batches have been released

since  the  Deputy Prime Minister made his statement

in the last Session of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Does the Minister mean to say

that  in  three batches the Government has  released

one person has been released in three batches.

Minister  that,  notwithstanding the  stand  of  the

British Government in the Internal Security Council,

the Government will issue orders for the release  of

the  detainees in batches, there has, in fact,  been

no  attempt  to  obtain their  release  against  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

question  as  put  by the Member for  Anson  whether

persons trained as teachers for primary schools  are

teaching  in Government secondary schools,  a  short

answer would be "no". But I think that would not  be

a  fair  answer. So may I explain a little  for  the

information of the Member for Anson?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons wishing to take up teaching as a career

are  expected  to  have  certain  basic  educational

qualifications. After appointment, they are expected

to  undergo  a  training  course  at  the  Teachers'

Training  College and thus become trained  teachers.

Persons  so trained at the T.T.C. are not classified

as being either trained for primary schools or being

trained for secondary schools. They are just trained

teachers. As a general rule, however, if College  or

University  graduates  are available  they  will  be

posted to teach in secondary schools. Out of a total

of  1,740  teachers in secondary schools,  excluding

those  in  full  schools - I may also explain  that  a

"full"  school  means  an elementary  and  secondary

school  combined into one, and they  do  not  supply

figures  as  to how many are in the primary  section

and  how  many  in  the secondary section - more  than

1,098 are in Government secondary schools as at 30th

of September last year. Those are the last available

statistics.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand the Minister to say

then,  in  fact, that there is no such  thing  as  a

primary  school teacher trained to teach in  primary

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have explained that we do not

call   them  trained  primary  teachers.  They   are

teachers  posted  to  primary  schools  or  teachers

posted to secondary schools.

<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   yesterday   at   the   moment   of

interruption  I  was developing the point,  made  in

passing by the Member for Farrer Park, that the full

requirements  of  parliamentary democracy  would  be

completely  satisfied  if  the  Government  were  to

proceed  with merger and complete the constitutional

arrangements  for  it  with the  Government  of  the

Federation   without  further   ado   and   without

submitting the matter to a referendum. On the  issue

of  merger,  this holds particularly  true  as  this

Government was elected on a platform in which merger

with the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



was  a  basic  issue.  We are  therefore  completely

justified  if  we  proceed  forthwith  with   merger

arrangements. Indeed it has been represented  to  my

colleagues  and  to  me that we should  do  so.  The

people  have  asked, "Why have a referendum  at  all

when  the Government was elected with a full mandate

for  merger?" Though in constitutional principle our

position  would be unassailable if we  proceeded  in

this manner, politically such a move is unsound. The

reason  is  that  we  would  then  be  evading   the

challenge  mounted  by  the  Communists  and   their

stooges  in the Barisan Sosialis who claim that  the

people  are  against merger. It must, therefore,  be

demonstrated beyond all doubt that the  majority  of

the people want merger and it must be shown that the

efforts of the Communists and their stooges  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  to  fight  merger  will  come  to

nought.  We  cannot  evade  the  challenge  of   the

Communists on this vital issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park referred to the under-currents which he detected in the course of the

debate  between the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

and  the  Members of the P.A.P. He  was  puzzled  by

these  under-currents. I shall refer to  this  at  a

later  stage because it is important that the  whole

position  should  be fully explained  both  to  this

Assembly and to the public at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to deal with some issues raised by

Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis.  There  are  two

points of some importance. I will not deal with  the

trivial and carping criticisms of various clauses of

the Bill. These will be disposed of in the Committee

stage  or in the final address by my colleague,  the

Minister  for Home Affairs. The first point  relates

to  the  interval of time between the issue  of  the

referendum  notice  and the actual  holding  of  the

referendum  itself. Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

have  said  that the period allowed is  short.  They

want  a  long  referendum campaign. Everybody  knows

that  this referendum will be on merger, and  merger

has  been the outstanding political issue before the

country, even many months before the publication  of

the White Paper which was debated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



this Assembly last November. In fact, merger was the

issue  on  which  the  Communists  decided  to  part

company  with the P.A.P. We wanted merger  and  they

opposed   it  for  reasons  of  their  own  physical

survival.  So  for  nearly  a  year  now  since  the

Communists  parted company with  us,  the  issue  of

merger has been put before the electorate. In  other

words, the political campaign on the issue on  which

a  referendum is to take place has been running  for

nearly  one year. This being the case, the  argument

that  a referendum campaign is unduly restricted  in

time is sheer nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to blank and uncertain

ballot  papers.  The Government view  is  that  such

ballot  papers  should be considered to  indicate  a

state  of  mind  in  which  the  voter  himself   is

undecided and will therefore be content to leave the

issue to be decided in a manner in which the elected

representatives in the Assembly had already decided.

Some  Members  complain that this  is  undemocratic,

since there is no precedent for a procedure of  this

kind  in the referendum practice of other countries.

This  does  not prevent the same hon.  Members  from

making  a proposal which itself has no precedent  in

the  referendum laws of the countries they  mention.

That is to say, they want Opposition Members to have

a voice in the framing of the questions submitted to

the  referendum.  The detailed arrangements  of  the

referendum are a matter for the Government  and  not

for   the  Opposition  in  Singapore  as  in   other

countries.  Now why was the clause on  blank  ballot

papers  introduced? The reason does not rest on  any

constitutional  or legal principle. This  clause  is

necessary  to  safeguard against the possibility  of

abuse  of the referendum by the Communists and their

stooges in the Barisan Sosialis. Let me explain what

I  mean by this. These persons have been campaigning

against merger ever since the idea was mooted at the

Anson  by-election. The Communists  know  that  they

cannot  oppose  merger because  it  is  historically

inevitable and is in accordance with the  wishes  of

the people. So they try to confuse the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



people by saying that they want more merger than the

P.A.P.  They  resort  to all manner  of  deceit  and

duplicity  in  their  public  statements,  at   mass

rallies  and in the newspapers. The lies  that  they

have  spread  in their propaganda campaign  are  now

coming  home  to roost on them as the Government  is

tracking down each one of them and explaining to the

public  the  malicious falsehoods of the  Communists

and  their  stooges  in  the Barisan  Sosialis.  The

position of the Communists on the merger issue is  a

completely false one. They are opposed to merger but

they  pretend  that they want more merger  than  the

P.A.P. They have therefore not been able to get people

to  oppose merger or to get excited over the  P.A.P.

merger  proposals. The series of mass meetings  that

they have been carrying on for the last five or  six

months to fight merger has been a series of complete

flops.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Minister indicate how

this particular part of his speech has any reference

to the general merits and principle of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am trying

to   explain  why  the  clause  on  blank  votes  is

necessary.   It  is  because  of  the   Government's

anticipation of what the Communists will  do  during

referendum  week. The Communists have  succeeded  to

some  small  extent  in confusing  some  people.  We

expect  that, during the referendum campaign proper,

they  will try to mount a sharp and intensive effort

in  confusing  the  minds of the voters,  and  their

capacity  to  do so is quite considerable.  We  have

never  under-estimated the strength of their  ground

propaganda  organisation. This last-minute  campaign

which  they will mount will not succeed in  bringing

the  majority of voters against merger, but  it  may

confuse many people to such an extent that they  may

easily be led into thinking that the best course  of

action  for  them is to send in a blank paper  since

they are uncertain of the merits or demerits of  the

issues  placed before them. They will  certainly  be

encouraged by the Communists to do so,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



and  then the Communists will claim that this  blank

paper  shows  support for the anti-merger  campaign.

The  truth,  of course, is that it shows nothing  of

the  sort. It merely shows that the people who  send

in  blank  ballot papers are reduced to a  state  of

indecision and that they are unable to make up their

minds.  This  being  the case, it logically  follows

that  they are prepared to accept the decision which

their  elected representatives in the  Assembly  had

made  on  the  main merger issue. There  is  nothing

morally  wrong  or constitutionally  wrong  in  this

treatment  of  blank  papers.  It  closes  a   vital

loophole which the Communists can exploit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Nee Soon, in this connection,

stated  that  if  a person were to draw  an  obscene

marking  on  a ballot paper, it would  be  wrong  to

count this as support for the Government. I heartily

agree with him. The remedy is for him to propose  an

amendment whereby obscene markings on ballot  papers

can   be  considered  as  support  for  the  Barisan

Sosialis' point of view. Should he proceed with this

amendment, I would be gratified if he would indicate

just  what kind of obscene symbol he considers  most

appropriate  to  the  Bansan  Sosialis  anti-merger

point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out yesterday the differences between a referendum and a general election. He pointed that in general the issues before a referendum are such that a decision one way or another cannot be construed as victory or defeat for the Government and, consequently, the Government does not resign on the result of a referendum. He has quoted examples - New Zealand and the West Indies.

This  remark  has  been  distorted  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis in the most mischievous way. They say  that

the  Government has stated that one of  the  reasons

why  they  wished to resign after Hong Lim was  that

the  prospects  of  merger and  the  possibility  of

solving  the basic problems of Singapore  were  then

remote.  Consequently they claim that the Government

should resign when the referendum on merger is lost.

They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



even  went  further to insinuate that the Government

has lost confidence in itself and that we are merely

trying to hang on to power at all costs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> How true!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is a tireless repetition

of a falsehood that will deceive nobody.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We can prove it too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The people of Singapore do not

believe  that  we  achieve any personal  benefit  by

staying  on  in  power.  Everybody  knows -a nd   this

includes Members of the Opposition - that this  is  an

incorruptible Government. [Interruption] I think  we

hear some asinine laughter across the Floor and I am

not quite sure about the meaning of this laughter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Corruption can be

in many forms. Political corruption is one of them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we gave the

Barisan   Sosialis   full   opportunity   to    make

allegations  of corruption - nepotism or any  form  of

mismanagement by this Government - provided they  were

prepared  to repeat under oath the allegations  they

made  under  privilege in this House. What  was  the

result,  Sir? There was not a pip-squeak from  these

people. Let us have none of this nonsense. Everybody

knows  that this is an incorruptible Government.  We

do  not  make a cent through our official positions.

Our  only income is from the salaries we receive and

these are declared in the annual Estimates. Most  of

us  can  earn  much  more  outside  our  ministerial

positions. We remain in office not for any  personal

benefit, nor do we relish the sensation of power  as

one  ex-Chief Minister of Singapore has stated  that

that  was  what  he wanted to enjoy.  We  remain  in

office  to  carry  out the pledge  we  made  to  the

electorate, that we will reunify Singapore with  the

mainland.  This is the basic political objective  of

the nationalist movement, and as nationalists we see

the great objective on the verge of realisation.  So

we shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



see merger through. The Communists and their stooges

in  the Barisan Sosialis dread the moment of merger.

What  misfortunes merger will bring upon their heads

is  a matter that is now exercising their minds. The

brightest among them have a pretty good idea of what

lies  ahead, and even the duffers are waking  up  to

the  fact  that something has gone awry  with  their

original expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I return to the subject of the under-currents in this debate which have puzzled the

Member  for Farrer Park. The hon. Member  is  not  a

fool.  In  fact,  he  is,  I  understand,  eminently

successful  in  his profession, and this  calls  for

some measure of ability. So if the Member for Farrer

Park  is  puzzled, then it follows that  many  other

people  may  be puzzled. It is important, therefore,

that  the position be clarified. One of the  reasons

why  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is  unable   to

comprehend  the  position  is  that  he  takes   too

legalistic  a view of what this Assembly stands  for

and  what  it  does  and how it should  do  it.  The

constitutional fiction is that this  Assembly  is  a

group of honourable Members elected by the people to

deliberate  on  issues facing  the  country  and  to

arrive  at  the wisest decision in the interests  of

all.  So  the Member for Farrer Park regards Members

of  this  Assembly as a body of experts  and  laymen

seriously   addressing  their  minds  to   a   legal

document,  i.e, the  Bill  before  the  House.   He

expected  rational  arguments,  legal  analysis  and

honest debates. When he found that this was not what

was forthcoming, he was naturally puzzled. But if he

will  for  one  moment disregard the  constitutional

fiction which I have described and instead look upon

the  present  proceedings in this House  as  another

step  in  the  fight between the nationalist  forces

wanting  merger and the anti-nationalists - the  anti-merger  forces - represented  by  the  Communists  and their  stooges  in  the Barisan Sosialis,  then  the reason  for  the under-currents becomes obvious  and very clear. The anti-nationalist forces fight merger to  save  their own skins. But, as I have  explained before,   they  dare  not  oppose  merger  directly.

Therefore, they have to resort to duplicity such  as

pretending they want more merger. Hence, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



enormous  output  of double talk which  may  confuse

people  who accept what the Communists say at  their

face  value. The simple fact of the matter  is  that

the  Communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis have been fighting a losing battle  against

merger.  They have tried to undermine the Government

through  all kinds of ways. I have already  referred

to  Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in which they  suffered

ignominous  defeat  in  each and  every  round.  The

Barisan  Sosialis are now reduced to  such  a  state

that  they suspect a trap in each and every move  of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of the Member for Queenstown clearly

shows his apprehensive state of mind. He sees poison

even in the most innocuous clauses of the Bill.  The

Barisan  Sosialis is now like a frightened dog  that

is  afraid even of its own shadow. This explains the

querulous, nervous and petulant approach to the Bill

before the House. The Member for Farrer Park should,

therefore, not be misled by the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Nor by the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He will have noted that the

bouncing  confidence  of the early  days  when  they

spoke  of  the  October  Revolution  has  completely

vanished,  and we can hardly expect the position  to

be   otherwise,   for  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have

blundered  from  one  debacle  to  another.  At  the

referendum  that is to be held after  this  Bill  is

passed, we may see them make their last gamble,  and

thus plunge into the final cataclysm.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in discussing the National Referendum

Bill today, I propose to make four suggestions which

are  also  my four hopes. I hope that the Government

can at least show the minimum democratic spirit. The

Minister for Finance has made two points about this,

and I regret it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the reason and motive of

the Government in introducing this Bill. We all know

that  the  reason  for the Bill  is  that  it  is  a

development from the P.A.P. type of merger,  because

the  P.A.P. type of merger has been strongly opposed

by  Opposition Parties in this House, in  form,  the

P.A.P. type  of  merger has been approved  by  this

House.  The Minister for Finance made his speech  on

this  Bill  in a tone of regret. He also quoted  the

Member  for Farrer Park who spoke yesterday,  saying

that  the Member for Farrer Park had said that  even

without  putting  the question to the  people  in  a

referendum, the Government had the right to carry on

with merger, since the Assembly had approved it.  He

also  said  that  that showed  the  courage  of  the

Government  in the face of a Communist challenge.  I

would  say that it is wrong, because as soon as  the

Government  introduced the White Paper proposals  on

merger  and  asked for them to be  approved  in  the

Assembly,  the Government were faced with  criticism

and  pressure  and opposition from  all  sides.  The

Government  found  it rather difficult  to  get  the

White Paper passed. That is why the Government  have

thought of a new method, by bringing up this Bill to

inform  the  people and to let them make  the  final

decision  on this question. That is the  motive  for

bringing  up this Bill today, that is,  to  let  the

people  decide whether they want the P.A.P. type  of

merger  or  whether they do not want it.  Therefore,

the  Government should not ask the people  too  many

questions. That is the true spirit of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point

of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b> resumed her seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like to ask the Member for  Stamford

whether  she  is afraid to be judged by the  people,

and whether she is afraid that the people will judge

the Barisan type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since the Prime

Minister  has  asked me this question,  I  think  he

ought to answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



it  himself, because the Bill has been introduced to

let  the people decide on this question. It  is  not

for  the people to decide on other things. The  main

purpose of the Bill is to ask the people whether  or

not  they  want the P.A.P. type of merger,  and  the

Prime Minister should not introduce other issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we can well understand the motive and

spirit  of  this Bill, I would like to propose  four

suggestions, or four hopes. The first is that I hope

the Government will respect the spirit and principle

of  this  Bill. In other words, the Bill is for  the

purpose of letting the people decide whether or  not

they  like  the  P.A.P. type  of  merger,  and  the

question  should  not include any irrelevancies.  If

they try to include other matters irrelevant to  the

issue,  then  it will be contrary to  the  Bill,  in

other  words,  they will be trying  to  confuse  the

people, i.e., they will be making things  difficult

for  the  people, so that the people  will  find  it

difficult to choose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hope is that Government will withdraw

one of the amendments introduced by the Minister for

Home Affairs. The amendment says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose ballot paper -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is unmarked; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is uncertain



<br><br>shall  be  deemed to be a person who accepts  or  is

willing  to  accept the decision of the  Legislative

Assembly...'.



<br><br>This  is  very  unreasonable. I hope the  Government

will withdraw that amendment [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The difficulty is the

interpretation.  I  ask the Prime  Minister  not  to

interrupt if he can help it.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister

for Finance also says that any person who leaves his

ballot  paper  unmarked or marks it in an  uncertain

manner  shows that he cannot decide for himself  and

that  he  leaves it to the Government to decide.  By

his argument this type of ballot paper will count in

favour  of the Government. That will amount to  two-thirds  of the total votes cast. So for the sake  of

democracy - and  I  think the Prime Minister  is  very

concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



about  true democracy - I hope the Minister  for  Home

Affairs will withdraw this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third hope is that the Government can

specifically provide that the Opposition Parties  be

given  every  chance and freedom of campaigning  and

propaganda  work,  and  canvassing,  and  be   given

facilities  in their applications for permission  to

campaign.  According to the Bill, seven days'  notice

should be given.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have reminded hon. Members

that  there has been a certain amount of repetition,

and  the  hon.  Lady  is doing  just  that.  She  is

repeating  all the arguments that have already  been

advanced by the Opposition. If she has anything  new

to  contribute,  she may do so. But  I  suggest  she

should  not repeat what has already been said.  What

she can do later on is to vote in favour of what has

been said.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

accept   your  ruling.  But  I  feel  that   certain

questions are important and rather inimical  to  us.

That  is  why  I  find it necessary to  stress  this

point. I did not like to analyse in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is my last point. It is my last

suggestion  too. My colleagues have also touched  on

that,  but  I have something to stress. I  hope  the

Government  will give the Opposition Parties  enough

time   to   canvass,  because,  according   to   the

provisions  of  the Bill, the seven  day  period  is

actually  too short a time. I can give a very  short

example  to  show  that this kind  of  provision  is

unreasonable.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to the hon.

Lady that if she wants to give examples, she can  do

so  in  Committee  when we come to  deal  with  that

clause.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I feel that what I want to say is not much.  If

you  will not allow me to continue, then I will make

my speech during the Committee stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is not a question of not

allowing  the  hon.  Member  to  continue.   I   was

suggesting  that  the  hon.  Member  need  not  give

examples now.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

U.P.P, supports the Referendum Bill  in  principle.

There  are  several undemocratic provisions  in  the

Bill  which could be fought out if the Bill goes  to

Select   Committee.   Sir,  it   is   important   to

distinguish  between these two issues. Firstly,  the

question  to be put before the voter, and, secondly,

the  referendum machinery. We should not  waste  too

much   time  in  discussing  the  details   of   the

Referendum  Bill  because that will  only  help  the

P.A.P, to  confuse  the  people.  The  undemocratic

provisions of the Referendum Bill can be fought  out

in  Select Committee. We should put all our energies

into  pressing the Government to set up an All-Party

Committee to decide on the question to be put before

the people. The vital issue is, what is the question

to be put before the people? If the people are asked

by  the  Government to choose whether  they  like  a

rotten duck egg or a rotten chicken egg, what is the

difference if the Opposition is allowed not one week

to canvass but even one year to canvass? That is why

my colleague, the Member for Hong Lim, has asked for

two things. First, an All-Party meeting to decide on

the  question  to  be put before  the  people,  and,

second,  the details of the Referendum Bill  can  be

thrashed  out in Select Committee. We can spend  two

weeks  seeking publicity and, therefore, arguing  on

the  details of the referendum machinery. But if  it

is  the Government which decides the question to  be

put  before the people for a vote, what is  the  use

even if we have the most democratic machinery in the

world?  Are Members of the Opposition going to  tell

the  people at mass meetings, over the radio and  to

the  Press,  and  by house-to-house canvassing  that

they  prefer  a rotten chicken egg to a rotten  duck

egg? The only provision in the Referendum Bill which

requires our present attention is the amendment  pro

posed by the Government to consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



all  people  who abstain from voting  for  either  a

rotten  duck egg or a rotten chicken egg  as  people

who  have  voted for a rotten egg, just because  the

Government  prefers a rotten duck egg. This  is  not

only absurd but stupid. Sir, the Bill should be sent

to  Select  Committee so that we  do  not  help  the

P.A.P. to confuse the real issue. The real issue is,

what is the question?



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Bill before us is a Bill of vital importance. It  is

so  important that it affects everyone living in the

State.  It  affects the lives of the people  in  all

fields,  such as our economic problems,  our  labour

problems, our educational problems and the  problems

of  our national culture. This is the first point  I

want to make clear. This referendum is proposed  for

the  people  to decide whether they want the  phoney

merger proposed by the P.A.P. or the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the phoney

merger  referred to is the merger proposal  accepted

by  this Assembly? If that is so, the hon. Member is

completely  out  of order in calling  the  merger  a

phoney merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, as I have said just now,

this referendum is proposed for the people to decide

whether  they want merger or not. It is the same  as

the   referendum.   Merger   affects   everyone   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Most of all the Communists!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> It is therefore clear that a

referendum  is  far more important  than  a  general

election, because in a general election, the  people

can  elect a government and can overthrow it  within

five  years. This is the second point I want to make

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having made these two points clear, I shall

now  criticise  the  faults of the  Bill.  Since  my

comrades have touched on all the important points, I

would  like  to stress certain important points  for

the  people to know. Sir, as you know, in a  general

election, we have four to five



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



weeks to canvass for votes and to campaign -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Why did you not start last year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> In the Hong Lim and Anson by-elections, the P.A.P. had seven weeks to canvass for

votes,  whereas in this national referendum, we  are

only  allowed one week to explain to the people what

is  a national referendum. Sir, in addition to this,

there  are  many restrictions imposed on  us  within

this   week.  Sir,  the  P.A.P. leaders  in   their

desperate mood, still think this is not enough. They

add another new clause. That is New Clause (A) to be

inserted after clause 28. Sir, this new clause says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose ballot paper is unmarked or is

uncertain shall be deemed to be a person who accepts

or is willing to accept the decision of the

Legislative Assembly...'.



<br><br>Sir,  the  words  "Legislative  Assembly"  mean  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Why do you want to question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member for

Changi  is not now embarking on a repetition  of  an

argument which has been made by every speaker of his

Party so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, to me this is very

important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think every Member in this

Assembly realises how important it is to the Barisan

Sosialis  as  well  as  to  other  Members  of   the

Opposition. But the point has been made, and  it  is

up  to  the hon. Member to vote against that  clause

when we deal with it in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a blank

cheque  is  not  valid. Therefore,  a  blank  ballot

paper  must  be  declared null  and  void.  But  the

P.A.P.  Government  says that such  a  ballot  paper

must be deemed -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would ask the hon. Member to

turn his page.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

general  election I saw one ballot  paper  on  which

these words were written: "Down with the Lim Yew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



Hock Government." That ballot was put aside and

cancelled. Suppose if such things happen again, the

people write -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will read Standing Order 54

once again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention  to the conduct of a Member, who  persists

in  irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his

own  arguments  or of the arguments  used  by  other

Members in debate, may direct him to discontinue his

speech.'



<br><br>I do not intend at the moment to ask the hon. Member

to  discontinue his speech. But I ask him not to  be

guilty of repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in drafting

this  Bill,  the  P.A.P. is trying  to  deceive  the

people  that  it is democratic enough to  allow  the

people  to decide whether they want merger  or  not.

But,  in actual fact, the Bill is so worded that  it

forces the people to accept the P.A.P. merger.  They

have no other choice. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have  all

the time seen the P.A.P. Government doing things  in

a  very undemocratic manner, both inside and outside

the Assembly. All this has shown the insincerity and

hypocrisy of the P.A.P. Government in the  way  they

settle matters concerning the interest of the State.

Desperate  politicians in the P.A.P. are  now  doing

desperate  things  which  are  very  dangerous   and

harmful  to the people of Singapore. But  we  cannot

let  bygones be bygones. We want the P.A.P. leaders

to  face the people, and the wrong things they  have

done in the past must be answered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member indicate

how  those remarks have any relation to the  general

merits  and principle of the Bill which we  are  now

discussing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember

the Deputy Prime Minister said -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like the hon. Member

to  answer  my  question as to how his  remarks  are

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

cancelled that portion of my speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember

the  Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday  that  the

Bill  was postponed in order to allow the Opposition

to  submit their amendments. That is not true,  Sir,

because  all  the amendments of the Opposition  were

submitted before the postponement. He also said that

the  P.A.P. is not going to bear the responsibility

for  any delay in passing this Bill. That is a  very

irresponsible remark, because the P.A.P. has already

delayed the Bill for two months and is now trying to

refer  the Bill to a Select Committee. Now they  say

they want the Bill to go to a Select Committee. That

shows  they are democratic enough. But the important

point  is not whether the Bill is going to a  Select

Committee or not. The important point is whether the

views  of the public will be accepted in the  Select

Committee. As we have seen before, the views of  the

public submitted to the Government are not accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says the P.A.P. can go on with its proposed merger. But he must remember that the people of Singapore want a true merger and not the P.A.P. type of merger. They want a merger whereby all the citizens of Singapore can become citizens of the Federation. But in the P.A.P. type of merger it is not so. Sir, during the last general election the people elected the P.A.P. but not

because they supported the P.A.P. merger alone. They

supported the P.A.P. in many things. Sir, it is just

like  two eggs, one good and one rotten. During  the

general election the P.A.P. gave a good egg and sold

to the people, saying, "I'll give you the good egg."

After  they were elected, they gave a rotten egg  to

the people, and the people certainly refused it.  If

I  had  a rotten egg here, I would throw it over  to

that side and ask them to taste -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Changi is now

becoming  very disorderly, desiring to throw  rotten

eggs  across  the  Chamber. I hope that  will  never

happen. Let us carry on with the general merits  and

principle  of  the Bill. I think this is  about  the

third  time  I  have  said that to  the  Member  for

Changi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, I am going to conclude my

speech in a few words. What the P.A.P. wants in this

Bill  is  this. If the people fail to go  and  vote,

they  will be fined. If they go and vote, they  must

vote   for  the  P.A.P. because  the  question   is

such - whether they vote A or B; if they vote A,  they

will die; and if they vote B, they will also die. So

tile people might choose to put a blank ballot paper

in  the  box. But once they put blank ballot  papers

into  the box that also will support the P.A.P.  But

if they are so angry that they tear the ballot paper

into two parts, they will be fined or imprisoned for

two years. From this we can see how undemocratic the

P.A.P. Government is.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to support the Bill in principle.  But

you  will agree, Sir, from what we have beard,  that

there  are many matters and clauses which  have  not

been  acceptable  to  the  Opposition.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  has  shown disagreement  in  a  number  of

things  and we too disagree with two amendments,  in

spite of the Minister for Finance's attempt to prove

to  us, in respect of the blank votes, that they are

to prevent abuse of the referendum by the Communists

and,  to  quote  him  also, by the  stooges  in  the

Barisan Sosialis. We feel that whatever the excuses,

it   will   not   justify   Government   introducing

undemocratic  means of carrying out the  referendum.

We  have other objections, Sir, which we will  raise

when the time comes, but I would like to remind  the

House  that  this  Referendum Bill will  become  the

machinery  not  only in respect of  the  merger  and

Malaysia  questions, but also as  the  machinery  to

find  out the views of the public on other important

national  matters. Therefore, we must see that  this

Referendum Bill, when it becomes an Ordinance,  will

be  a  democratic machinery dealing out justice  for

all  concerned. We have our chance here. We sat  for

two  months or three months the last time,  debating

merger  and  airing our views. We  can  debate  this

Referendum Bill thoroughly. Sir, the public too have

their  objections and their views. They too want  to

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



a say in this matter which is of national importance

and  which is going to affect the lives of  everyone

in  Singapore.  Therefore, I  do  not  see  why  the

Barisan  Sosialis is against the idea  of  referring

this  Bill to a Select Committee in order  that  the

public may have a chance to air their views. I  will

repeat, we have our chance here, but the public  are

not entitled to come here and air their views unless

we refer this Bill to a Select Committee. Sir, it is

normal  parliamentary  practice  that  Bills  of  an

important and far-reaching character are referred to

Select  Committees.  I  cannot  understand  why  the

Barisan  Sosialis should be against this, especially

when they are not satisfied with the Bill. Could  it

be  that  they  feel that the public should  not  be

given  a  chance to air their views, or  have  their

views  considered by the Select Committee? Or is  it

that  by  referring the Bill to a Select  Committee,

there  is  very  restricted opportunity  of  playing

politics? I am sorry to have to say that,  Sir,  but

from  what we have seen last night, there have  been

attempts made to exploit the plight of fire  victims

for  political propaganda. I am not surprised,  Sir.

The  Barisan Sosialis, as I have said before,  is  a

splinter  P.A.P. They have got their  training  from

the  P.A.P.  Therefore, they  play  the  same  game.

Whatever  it is, no matter how important a  national

problem  it is, there will always be party  politics

first.  The Barisan Sosialis say that if we  have  a

Select Committee, what is the use? Is the Government

going  to  implement  or give consideration  to  the

opinions  of  the public? If the public  give  their

opinions,  would  the  Government  give   them   any

consideration? Sir, the point is to give the  public

a  chance  to air their views. When they have  aired

their  views, those views will be published  in  the

report  of  the Select Committee. If the  Government

dare  to ignore the opinions of the public, let them

do  it at their own peril, Sir. The point is to give

the public a chance to air their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the Government anticipate what the

Barisan   will  do,  they  have  introduced  certain

amendments   which,   in  my   opinion,   are   most

undemocratic.    Because   the   Barisan    Sosialis

anticipates that the Government are going to ignore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



the  opinions of the public, they say  we  must  not

have   a   Select  Committee.  Because  the  Barisan

Sosialis  thinks that the public are to be  deprived

of an opportunity of airing their views -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of explanation, if I may

be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> resumed her seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Barisan Sosialis is not

opposed to the Bill going to a Select Committee, but

we  do not think a Select Committee for this Bill is

suitable,  because the Government has  delayed  this

Bill  for some considerable time and the `Government

also  wants to blame the Opposition for any  further

`delay  on  the Bill. We want to make it very  clear

that  we will not be associated in any way with  any

possible delay in the passing of this Bill, and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Queenstown is entitled to make another speech. But I

might  say  something procedurally. If  the  Ban-san

Sosialis have those fears, all they have to do is to

abstain when the motion, "That the Bill be committed

to  a  Select  Committee" is proposed. Procedurally,

that is the way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is our intention, Sir,If

ever  it  is  put to the vote, we will  abstain.  We

consider  it is more suitable that all the pros  and

cons be aired and ventilated in the Assembly now So

that  all the people will know exactly the pros  and

cons.  If  further  explanations are  given  in  the

Select Committee -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Queenstown is now embarking on a speech. He has made

his point. Mrs Seow.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

surprised  to  hear  the Member  for  Queenstown,  a

Member  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  who  claims  to

represent  the  people, say that in regard  to  this

matter which is, we all agree, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



national importance and which is going to affect

everybody in Singapore, it is not suitable for the

public to air their views. I do not understand,

Sir. It really puzzles me to hear him say here. I am

surprised!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

There seems to be a misinterpretation of what I

want -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Carry on!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Can I continue, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, Sir. The other point he

made was a matter of delay. Sir, it is true. But  if

you look at the Order Paper, we have a motion in the

name  of the Member for Anson dealing with this,  to

ensure  that the Government ascertain the wishes  of

the  people  before a closer relationship  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya  is implemented.  I  am  just

giving a precis of it. Well, there is the safeguard,

Sir, which means that the referendum must be carried

out  before  merger  and that is  what  the  Barisan

Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it the hon. Member is

anticipating  that  the  motion  will  be   carried.

Perhaps she will preface her remarks and say, if the

motion is carried. I think the Member for Anson will

be delighted to know that he is receiving support.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

anticipating that the motion will be carried, but it

answers the question of delay. The question of delay

will be settled one way or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that every Member in this House should

support  the motion - as it has already been suggested

by  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim - that  this  Bill  be

referred   to  Select  Committee  and  I  hope   the

Government will accept it. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



event of the Government turning it down, Members can

resume   the   attack  more  vigorously   and   more

effectively on the Third Reading of the Bill.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Singapore National Referendum Bill

concerns  people  in all walks of  life  and  their

economic and political future. That being so, I have

to air my own views on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the debate during the past few

days. I have discovered that many representatives in

this   Assembly  have  attacked  the   unreasonable

provisions  in  this  Bill.  They  have  torn  these

unreasonable  provisions into pieces. This  fact  is

not  only ridiculous in this House but it will  make

the  people  outside this House angry. I think  even

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, have the feeling  that  the

amendments are really unreasonable.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is not

justified  at all in saying that. He must  not  drag

the  Speaker  into any controversy. The  Speaker  is

here  just  to listen to the speeches, get impatient

sometimes and see that order is maintained.  He  has

no views whatsoever on the amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your indication, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the debate on this Bill

over  the  past  few  days has produced  two  facts.

Firstly, the political principles of the P.A.P. have

gone  bankrupt. Secondly, the P.A.P. is  trying  to

adopt cunning political tactics again to deceive the

people.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in order to substantiate

these  two  facts, I feel obliged to quote  passages

from  the speeches made by Members in this House  in

the  past few days. In the first place, I would like

to  say  that the political principles of the P.A.P.

have  al, ready gone bankrupt. How can I prove this?

Well,  I  would like to quote from the Sin Chew  Jit

Poh  as reported in page 1 concerning the amendments

to be moved by the Minister for Home Affairs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main point of these amendments is that if a

blank  vote is cast by a voter, or if there  is  any

uncertainty about the vote itself,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



or  if there is an uncertain mark on the vote,  then

the  P.A.P. Government will deem it to be a vote  in

support of the Government.'.



<br><br>From  this point, we can safely say that we must  do

what  is right to get the support of the people  and

that   we   cannot  deceive  them  with   irrational

arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said that the political

principles   of  the  P.A.P. have  gone   bankrupt.

Furthermore, the P.A.P. have come to know that their

speeches  in  regard to merger and  other  deceitful

activities  relating thereto are really unreasonable

and  cannot stand up to argument. So I feel that  it

is  necessary  for me to remind the P.A.P.  Members,

especially  the  leaders,  that  their  unreasonable

theories  and  reactionary  arguments  have  already

estranged  them  from the people. I  would  like  to

advise  them  that they should stop their  political

manoeuvres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to expand my second point, I

would  like  to quote the speech made by the  Deputy

Prime  Minister yesterday. He raised certain  points

to  show that the Government were trying to  play  a

game in order to achieve merger. He replied directly

to  the  Chairman of my Party who said that when  he

was closely related to the P.A.P. leaders he knew of

their  hypocrisy, and that was why he was keeping  a

close  eye  on  their behaviour.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister  raised  certain points  in  reply  to  the

doubts  raised by my Party Chairman. He did this  in

order  to  divert attention from the real issue.  My

Party  Chairman  wanted to know  the  basis  of  the

question  to  be posed to the people: whether  there

would  be one, two or three questions. He said  that

it would be ideal for the House to study the wording

of  the question to be put to the people in order to

satisfy all the Parties concerned and to hold a just

referendum  for  the people. But  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister refused to agree to our request. Instead he

quoted  examples from other countries to  show  that

there had been no precedent where the wording of the

question  was  the responsibility of the  Opposition

Parties.   He   said   it  has   always   been   the

responsibility  of  the  Government  to   word   the

question  that is to be posed to the people.  I  say

that  this is not right. It has been pointed out  by

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



Hong  Lim  that two questions may be  posed  to  the

people:  "Do  the  people want the  P.A.P. type  of

merger? Or do the people want a merger on the  basis

of Penang or Malacca?". If these questions are to be

posed,  it will mean that the P.A.P. will be  placed

in  a  very  advantageous position  over  the  other

Parties.  If  the people are to be asked  to  choose

between  these two questions, they will very  likely

want  to  put in blank votes because, no matter  how

they  vote, they will be supporting the P.A.P. type

of  merger. So it is important for me to expose this

intrigue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noticed that there is an issue arising

out  of the two points raised by the Member for Hong

Lim.   At  the  last  sitting,  I  learned  from   a

conversation  between some Members of the  Party  in

power  and myself that it was most likely  that  the

questions would be framed in this manner. The people

would  be asked whether they want to have the P.A.P.

type  of merger or a merger in which Singapore would

be going in on the basis of Penang or Malacca. I say

that  in whatever form these two questions are  put,

they  mean the same thing. So I told them that  they

would be deceiving the people. In reply, I was  told

that  the  Barisan  Sosialis themselves  raised  the

question  of  Singapore going in  on  the  basis  of

Penang  or Malacca. Then I told them that it is  our

Party  stand to have a type of merger in  which  all

Singapore citizens will automatically become Federal

citizens  after  Merger Day. I even told  them  that

there is some difference between the merger we  have

in  mind  and  merger  on the  basis  of  Penang  or

Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it necessary to persuade the leaders of the

P.A.P. to perform more good deeds for the people  so

that they can have a good name later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this

opportunity  to deal with the points raised  by  the

Minister  for  Finance. Two of  my  colleagues  have

dealt  with certain points he raised, but I feel  it

is  necessary  that  I should deal  with  his  other

points.  The  Minister for Finance  touched  on  two

points  which  were more or less  similar  to  those

raised  by  the Deputy Prime Minister. I  would  say

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



Deputy  Prime Minister is a more honest and  a  less

cunning   person  than  the  Minister  for  Finance,

because  the latter said that there were  Communists

in   the   Barisan  Sosialis.  This   was   actually

irrelevant  to the Bill, and I could see  that  you,

Mr Speaker, Sir, were quite impatient with what  he

was saying and you even had occasion to pull him up.

He  is  very cunning but he can only fool the people

once,  and  not  all  the time.  If  any  Member  is

successful in fooling anybody once, then  the  other

people will be keeping an eye on him in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

greatly exaggerated certain details. He says  he  is

an   expert   in   law  and  he  knows   all   about

parliamentary democracy. From my point of view,  and

from  the point of view of the people, I say  it  is

all  a  bluff.  Although it is true  that  a  lawyer

should know law, he should not play with the law.  I

can  point  out here that yesterday when the  Member

for  Farrer  Park made his speech, he  attacked  the

Barisan  Sosialis and distorted the worries  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis as a sort of under-current between

us  and  the  P.A.P.  He  even  levelled  criticisms

against  our representatives, especially the  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon who said that the people  were

awakened  politic, ally and so there  should  be  no

fear on our part about the national referendum.  But

we are here to point out the Undemocratic provisions

of  the National Referendum Bill. We feel it is  the

duty  of  the people's representatives to do  so  in

this  House. The Member for Mount-batten also agrees

with   us   that   there  are  certain  undemocratic

provisions  in the Bill. From this we can  see  that

the Member for Farrer Park has the same attitude  as

most  reactionary people in the P.A.P, have. I would

like to prove my point in this manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year before last I was still in the P.A.P. At

that time the Member for Cairnhill was trying to get

us around -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have, in fact, been very

patient. But could the Member indicate to the  Chair

how  the so-called reactionary conduct of the Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



Farrer  Park  has  anything to do with  the  general

merits  and principle of the Bill? We are  debating

the general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> He

has his notes!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I know this has

hardly anything to do with the Bill. But in order to

prevent the Minister for Finance from confusing  the

people,  I  will  say that when he  was  making  his

speech he was just rambling on about the Communists,

this and that, in order to confuse the people. So  I

was just trying to explain his intention so that the

people will not fall into his trap. At this juncture

I  had to mention the Member for Farrer Park because

the  manner of his speech was the same as that of  a

P.A.P.  Member,  because they  have  already  become

allies. We can see they always agree on major issues

in this House. So I was just bringing up these facts

to prove my point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Up to that point, the Member

for  Jalan Kayu is probably just about in order. But

if  he goes into instances of how, to his mind,  the

Member  for Farrer Park is reactionary, then  he  is

going completely far away from the Bill. I think the

Member  has made his point. Will he please now  come

back  to  the  general merits and principle  of  the

Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I will accept your ruling not to elaborate  on

this  point.  In  any case, I feel I should  explain

certain  points raised by the Minister for  Finance,

when he talked about the under-currents between  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the P.A.P. Let us now view  it

the  other way round. These so-called under-currents

between the P.A.P. and the Barisan is a term used by

the Member for Farrer Park. I say there are no under-currents  whatsoever  existing  between  these   two

Parties. It is a question of whether or not we  have

the  real intention of serving the people. We in the

Barisan Sosialis were formerly in the P.A.P. We were

elected  by the people on the same platform  and  we

made many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



election  pledges during the general  elections.  We

talked  about how to serve the people in their  best

interest.  All these are the pledges  we  made.  But

since  the P.A.P. came to power, they have  entirely

forgotten about their election pledges. So if  there

are  any  under-currents at all, these will  be  the

under-currents. The question is whether  or  not  we

want  to serve the people. If you want to serve  the

people, there should not be any unnecessary dispute

or  argument. But the leaders of the P.A.P. have  no

intention to serve the people. That is why there was

all  this trouble, and we had to part with them.  So

we  have  to  go to extremes. When we wanted  to  do

something, they said we could not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I remind the hon. Member

that  he  has  been  speaking from  a  quarter  past

four - for 20 minutes - and he has not as yet touched on

the general merits and principle of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Kosong! [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May the Speaker share in the

joke?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  you  want to know, let me  tell  you.  The

Minister for Education said it is all nonsense. So I

told him it is not nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> On a

point  of  order,  Sir,I see the  Member  has  been

fiddling with the earphone, and I am not quite  sure

whether it will wreck the whole sound system.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether it is a point

of order or a point of disorder. But I think that is

quite  in  order  because he will find  the  Speaker

doing  that sometimes, and I do not think that  will

damage the earphone.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, please excuse me for taking up more time of the

House. Just now the Member for Mountbatten said that

we  are  opposed  to the Bill being  referred  to  a

Select Committee. She pointed out clearly why we  in

the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis oppose that move. But actually we  are  not

opposing  the  Bill  being  referred  to  a   Select

Committee. What we would like to clarify is that  if

the  Bill  is referred to a Select Committee,  there

are  certain  ulterior motives connected  therewith.

First,  you  yourself can see that  when  the  Prime

Minister  was replying to the Member for  Hong  Lim,

there  was a condition imposed. So we can  see  from

this that the discussion and examination of the Bill

in  the Select Committee and the composition of  the

Select  Committee  will not be  disclosed  to  other

people.  Very  often the views  of  Members  of  the

Opposition are not entertained.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I correct a procedural

error?  I think the hon. Member has been interpreted

as  saying  that the names of Members of the  Select

Committee  will not be disclosed. That is completely

wrong. The names of Members of the Select Committee,

if   a  Select  Committee  is  appointed,  will   be

published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  know the Member for Mountbatten said  that

reference  of  the Bill to a Select  Committee  will

enable  members of the public to submit their  views

for  consideration. But in my experience, there  are

many views which it is very difficult to submit.  So

we  feel  this point has to be clarified. If  it  is

clarified,  then we will not oppose the  Bill  being

referred to a Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is a procedural point

which  the  Member has raised. Perhaps I might  just

read the relevant Standing Order which provides  for

advertisements and an invitation to  the  public  to

send  in  their representations. Standing  Order  75

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unless the Assembly otherwise orders, up on a

Bill  being  committed  to a Select  Committee,  the

Clerk   shall  as  soon  as  practicable  thereafter

advertise  in  such newspapers as  the  Speaker  may

direct, inviting written representations on the Bill

to  be sent to him within not less than a period  of

fifteen days from the date of the advertisement  and

requesting  the representors to state  whether  they

are  prepared,  if  invited, to  appear  before  the

Select Committee to give evidence in support  of  or

supplementary to their written representations.'



<br><br>This is the position under our Standing Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, that being the case, I will not dwell on it any

more. When the Bill is being discussed in Committee,

I shall bring up the matter again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Finance also said that

he is a nationalist, and that is why he continues to

stay in office. He even went to the extent of saying

that   by   being   Ministers   they   were   losing

economically,  because they could  make  more  money

outside.  I will tell him that he should not  praise

himself.  Self-praise is no praise.  He  must  allow

other people to praise him. It is not proper for him

to  praise  himself,  and his  praise  will  not  be

accepted by outsiders. For example, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order.

I think the Member is still talking things which are

irrelevant to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The impression the Chair has

is  exactly  the  same as that of the  Parliamentary

Secretary.  But I suppose the Member for Jalan  Kayu

is entitled to take - to use a colloquialism - one crack

at  the  Minister for Finance in his speech,  and  I

think he has taken that crack!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This was

mentioned by the Minister for Finance, so I was just

making a reply to his points. Since you do not  want

me to reply to him at length, I will stop at that in

order to save the time of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of the Barisan

Sosialis, a referendum is a constitutional device by

which a controversial issue of public importance can

be  put  by  the Government to the people for  their

consideration and decision. There must be  a  proper

organisation   provided  by  law   to   enable   the

Government  to  put the issue to the electorate  and

there  must be adequate safeguards provided  by  the

law  to ensure that the vote of the people is  taken

in  a fair and just manner. This is exactly what the

Bill  before the House sets out to do. Machinery  is

being provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



by  this  Bill to enable  the  referendum  on

merger to be held in a fair and just manner. But the

Barisan  Sosialis  are accusing  the  Government  of

wanting to wreck the machinery of the referendum, to

set  booby-traps  for them and for  the  electorate.

They  have demanded that the issue of the referendum

on merger should be set not by the Government but by

the  Legislative Assembly. The issue of  merger  has

already  been debated at very great length  in  this

Assembly.  On  the  Government's motion  asking  the

House to affirm and declare that the first objective

of  all  true  patriots of Malaya is to achieve  the

reunification of the two territories in a merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, the Barisan

Sosialis  moved an amendment calling for  a  genuine

merger  for Singapore with the Federation of  Malaya

with  Singapore  entering  the  Federation  as   the

twelfth    State   and   with   all   its   citizens

automatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger

Day.  On  the  6th  of December last  year,  as  all

Members  will remember, after the amendment  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  was defeated in  the  House,  the

Member  for Anson moved for the adjournment  of  the

debate  on  the  original  motion.  When  this   was

refused,  the  Barisan Sosialis walked  out  of  the

Legislative Assembly with the Member for  Anson  and

the  Members  of  the  United People's  Party.  They

walked  out  of  the Assembly in the knowledge  that

there  was  also on the Order Paper for  debate  the

motion  of  the Prime Minister on the Federation  of

Malaysia and on the White Paper on the reunification

of  Singapore  and the Federation of  Malaya.  I  am

mentioning  all  this, Sir, to show to  the  Barisan

Sosialis   that  they  have  had  more  than   ample

opportunity to say all that they had wanted  to  say

on  the issue of merger in this Assembly. It is  now

the  duty  of  the Government to put  the  issue  of

merger  to  the  people  as clearly  and  simply  as

possible  and  to ask them to make up  their  minds.

Surely  the  Barisan Sosialis are not now  demanding

that  there should be yet a more lengthy  debate  on

the  issue  of  merger  in  this  House.  I  do  not

understand  why they should now seek to press  their

claims  for a further debate on this issue  in  this

Assembly when they themselves walked out when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



motion which I have just referred to was before  the

House.  It  is  now quite obvious that  the  Barisan

Sosialis have worked themselves into such a frame of

mind  that they see booby-traps where none, in fact,

exists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, who is a very astute

politician, has reminded the House that the  Barisan

Sosialis,  in one of their many shifting  stands  on

the  issue  of  merger,  have advocated  that  there

should be merger on the same terms as for Penang and

Malacca,  and that if they were to be held  to  this

stand,  the consequences in the referendum  held  on

this  issue  might be rather unfortunate  for  them.

This may or may not be so. However, they cannot,  in

all fairness, claim that where such stands were made

of  their  own  volition on the  merger  issue,  the

Government  have laid traps for them.  What  is  the

logic and sense in such imputations? In framing  the

issue  of  merger,  it is quite legitimate  for  the

Government  to draw the attention of the  electorate

in  very simple terms to what the implications would

be for themselves if they voted in a particular way.

There  is nothing unconstitutional in providing  for

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to deal with the objections of the

Member for Anson and the Barisan Sosialis to the two

new  provisions  of  the Bill, on  the  counting  of

unmarked and uncertain ballots tendered by voters in

the  referendum, and on the presumption of law  that

persons  entering  or seen to enter  more  than  two

houses  or  places of work of electors in  the  same

polling  district  other than  their  own  homes  or

places  of  work on polling day, shall, unless  they

prove  to  the  contrary, be presumed to  have  been

guilty   of  canvassing  on  polling  day.  In   the

Singapore     Legislative    Elections    Ordinance,

compulsory voting has been provided for. The name of

a person whose name is in the electoral register and

who  fails to' vote on polling day is taken  out  of

the  electoral register and put in a separate  list.

He  has then to apply for restoration of his name on

to  the  electoral register. If he has a good reason

for not voting in the general election, his name  is

put  back  on the electoral register after  inquiry.

But if he has no good reason for having failed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



to  vote, he must first pay a fine of $5 before  his

name  is  restored to the electoral  register.  Sir,

compulsory  voting as such is against the  grain  in

the  liberal  tradition of democratic  parliamentary

procedures.  But  yet it has had  to  be  introduced

locally.  In the same way, the Government  would  be

failing  in  their duty to the people and  would  be

acting foolishly if they did not take the elementary

precaution  of preventing the referendum from  being

manipulated by what would amount to a boycott of the

referendum  through  the  tendering  of  blank   and

unmarked  ballot  papers which can be  organised  to

serve the ends of those Communists and pro-Communist

groups  who  are hostile to merger.  This  issue  of

merger  is  of  vital concern to  every  citizen  of

Singapore,  and  on  such  a  vital  issue   it   is

reasonable to provide that those who cannot make  up

their minds will be deemed to accept the decision of

the  Legislative Assembly on the matter referred for

the  referendum. Sir, all voters are completely free

agents  to make up their minds as they please.  They

are  free  to go to the polling station to  vote  if

they  want  to  or to keep away. They  will  not  be

pressured  into  voting in any particular  way.  But

when  they cast their vote, they must make up  their

minds.   It  would  be  making  a  mockery  of   the

referendum  procedure on such a  vital  issue  if  a

citizen  were  to  tender a ballot paper  indicating

that  he had no views of the issue or that his views

were  uncertain.  If that were truly  his  state  of

mind,  there is nothing to prevent him from  keeping

away from the polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the presumption of law, to which the Member

for  Anson  has  taken exception, is  just  a  legal

presumption  to  ensure that  there  can  be  proper

enforcement of the law against canvassing on polling

day.  Without such a legal presumption, it would  be

more difficult to enforce the law against canvassing

on  polling day. Sir, there is no intention  on  the

part  of  the  Government  to  lay  booby-traps  for

anybody.  I  commend this Bill to  the  House  as  a

reasonable and fair measure providing the  machinery

whereby   the  views  of  the  electorate   can   be

ascertained,  in a just and proper manner  when  the

referendum on merger is held.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have

explained  at  great length about  the  undemocratic

provisions in this Bill and I am not going to  touch

on  them  again. Just now the Member for Mountbatten

has  mentioned  that we object to  this  Bill  being

committed  to  a Select Committee. I  feel  she  has

misunderstood us. Our feeling is that if  this  Bill

is  committed  to  a Select Committee,  we  will  be

blamed  for  delaying its passage,  because  it  was

introduced  two months ago. Why was it not  referred

to  a  Select Committee two months ago? It has  been

delayed for two months. We do not want the people to

say  that we are the cause of the delay of this Bill

being  passed  in  this  House.  Secondly,  we   are

debating  the  merits and demerits of this  Bill  so

that  the  people could understand the  undemocratic

provisions  therein. There are  provisions  in  this

Bill  which are meant to deceive the people.  If  we

refer  this  Bill to a Select Committee, the  people

will  not  be able to see the true picture  of  this

Bill  and  the  debate in this House as  to  who  is

wrong. We know that if this Bill is committed  to  a

Select  Committee, it means we will have to waste  a

lot  of  time. If this Bill is committed to a Select

Committee, there will be a very thick report and the

people do not have the time to study the defects and

the  undemocratic provisions of this Bill,  and  the

suggestions  and Opinions advanced by  the  people's

representatives in this House. We welcome  reference

of  this  Bill to a Select Committee so as to  allow

the  people  to air their views on it  provided  the

Government can assure us that the views put  forward

by  the  people  will  be  accepted  by  the  Select

Committee.  Why did the Government delay  this  Bill

for more than two months? Why did the Government not

refer  this  Bill to a Select Committee earlier?  In

debating this Bill, we want the people to know  what

will  happen to their future if this Bill is passed,

and to make sure that they are not being sold out by

the  Government. In principle, we do not oppose this

Bill being committed to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



Select Committee. I feel the Select Committee should

ascertain  the  views  of  the  people  as  soon  as

possible so that the passage of the Bill will not be

delayed.  However, our Party Chairman has said  that

we will abstain from voting when the motion to refer

this  Bill to a Select Committee is put to the vote.

From  talking about the merits and demerits of  this

Bill, we know that the Government did not originally

want  to introduce this Bill because the members  of

the  Party  in power had conflicts among themselves.

Some  of  the Back-benchers have been criticised  by

the  people.  Therefore,  they  had  to  urge  their

leadership to bring out this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The whole argument should be

in  relation to the general merits and principle  of

the  Bill. I think the hon. Member has already  made

his  point  that the passage of the  Bill  has  been

delayed and he has criticised that delay. Whether he

supports  the  Government  or  not  is  a  different

question.  If  he has anything to  say  now  on  the

general   merits  and  principle  of  the  Bill   as

contained in the Bill, he can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This National

Referendum   Bill   was   introduced   because   the

leadership were pressed by the people to do  so  and

because  they were under pressure from some  of  the

Backbenchers.  Having  introduced  this  Bill,  they

thought  out  all  sorts  of cunning  techniques  to

ensure that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is now repeating

what  has  been said by several Members of  his  own

Party.  That line still has nothing to do  with  the

general merits and principle of the Bill. There  are

50  clauses  in the Bill. Let us try and concentrate

on  the  Bill and not on the question of  delay.  We

have dealt with that aspect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I just want to

sum  up  briefly my speech. The Government want  the

people  to choose between two bad things - one way  is

leading to the tiger and the other way is leading to

the  lion which is waiting to eat us up. If  we  are

not going to follow either of these two paths and go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



backwards, then the P.A.P, will eat us up.  That  is

the meaning of the blank vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today we are debating the  Singapore

National Referendum Bill. This ought to be a  simple

and  meaningful  Bill.  Its purpose  is  to  reunite

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. This  Bill,

laying  down  the procedure for holding  a  national

referendum, can be said to have been introduced  for

the  first time in the history of Singapore. If  the

Bill  is passed, we can use it as a means of getting

the  views  of the people. We can say it is  a  very

good  means  of testing the views and  sounding  the

opinions  of the people. We can say that the  P.A.P.

is  an  open-minded and responsible  Government.  If

there  is  anything important which will affect  the

interests  of  the people, we will let them  decide.

That  is why today we have brought this Bill to this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech made by the

Minister  for  Home Affairs, we  can  see  that  the

Government have accepted various amendments  by  the

Opposition  Parties. The Member  for  Queenstown  is

rather  worried, uncertain and unsafe when he  finds

that  the  P.A.P.  Government have  introduced  this

Bill. He will cast doubts and suspicions on anything

which  is  introduced  by us for  the  good  of  the

people.  Actually this Bill is quite different  from

the   Legislative   Assembly  Elections   Ordinance.

Because of his worries and his disposition,  he  has

found  it  necessary to propose some  amendments  in

order  to  console his own spirit and soul.  He  has

raised the point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



that  polling agents and counting agents  should  be

nominated  by  the  political  Parties.  As  polling

agents  and  counting  agents are  rather  important

people in a referendum, the Government have accepted

the amendments to effect this. The political Parties

will  have  a chance to nominate such people  to  be

stationed  at the various polling stations  so  that

they can be rest assured that there will not be  any

foul play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has also suggested that

the  sealing of ballot boxes should also be done  by

the  agents  with their party seals. The  Government

have also accepted this suggestion. But the language

used  by  certain Opposition Members in  criticising

the  Bill  is  rather  clever. They  can  give  very

eloquent  speeches in this House, but if we  analyse

what they have said, we can see that they are merely

shouting  empty  slogans. They hope to  confuse  the

people  on the question which will gradually  affect

the livelihood and future of the people. They try to

create the impression that the P.A.P. Government  is

an   undemocratic  Government,  in  order  to  cause

misunderstanding among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I remember there was a story prevailing among the Chinese folks. It tells of two painters. On a certain occasion they went to a temple to try and compete with each other to see who could draw a snake faster and more like a snake. This was to show who was better than the other. That was the chief purpose of the competition. They invited the elders of the village and many others to

witness their competition. One of the artists was an

impetuous  and  hot-tempered youth.  The  other  was

rather  dispassionate  and  more  rational  in   his

thinking.  When  the youth had completed  drawing  a

snake  on the wall, he found that the other  painter

had  not  completed his drawing. He found there  was

ample  time  to add four legs to the snake  to  show

that he could do better and that he had done it much

faster  than  the  other chap. The Barisan  Sosialis

similarly  are also trying to show they  are  better

than  the  P.A.P.  Government by  doing  unnecessary

things.  Their attitude is just as what I have  just

now described. They are like the impetuous youth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



However  they may try to argue and to make speeches,

they  cannot hope to confuse and mislead the people.

They  will  never succeed. They brag about  theories

and  principles. They say they support the  Bill  in

principle,   but  certain  provisions  therein   are

undemocratic. They have misunderstood the purpose of

the  introduction  of  this Bill.  If  parliamentary

democracy  is  to  be  interpreted  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis, they will say, "We are the masters and you

are  our subjects. We shall rule over you." That  is

their  concept of parliamentary democracy. They  say

the  P.A.P. is  limiting the  people's  freedom  of

speech.  This  is a very strange argument.  How  can

this  be  possible?  If this were  so,  the  Barisan

Sosialis would not have been able to speak  in  the

many  rallies  that they have held. There  are  many

instances to show how they have acted. The  property

of some P.A.P. branches have been taken away and yet

they say the P.A.P. is undemocratic.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary is

in  danger of going off the rails. Let us come  back

to the general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was only

trying  to  touch on what the Barisan Sosialis  have

said. They have described us as undemocratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a radio forum, the Member for Queenstown said

that  the people were not intelligent enough to  see

what  is  right  and what is wrong.  This  fact  was

brought  out  by  the Minister for  Finance  in  his

speech,  that the Member for Queenstown  had  taken

the  people  to be fools who could not see  what  is

right  and what is wrong. The Barisan Sosialis think

that the people can be fooled by their lies. I think

this has something to do with principle. Before they

stood  for  election at the last general  elections,

they took an oath to serve the P.A.P. loyally.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that can come

under   "principle"  at  all.  I  suggest   to   the

Parliamentary  Secretary that he  now  come  to  the

general principles of the Bill and not carry  on  in

this manner which is completely irrelevant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, since you have ruled that it is not relevant to

touch on the points raised by them, I will talk

about something else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Queenstown said that

the  Bill provides for a short period of only  seven

days  from the date when the order is issued to  the

day  when the national referendum is held.  Sir,  we

know that the debate on the merger motion took quite

a  long  time.  Many people outside the  House  were

confused  by the lengthy debate which took place  in

this  House so that in the end they were  not  clear

about the whole picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the criticism that the Government

will  be  giving the Opposition Parties insufficient

time,  the Member for Queenstown says that his Party

will  be restricted in their propaganda campaign  to

prepare for the national referendum. I believe  they

are  trying  to  show that they are  supporting  the

principle,  but  in  fact  they  are  opposing  many

things. They have accused the P.A.P. of selling  out

the  rights of the people. The strange thing is that

the  Barisan  Sosialis Members  speak  in  the  same

fashion  as Mao Tse-tung who is thousands  of  miles

away.  Even  Chairman Mao who had  sworn  under  the

picture  of  Stalin  has never  dared  to  criticise

certain things. That is their actual attitude.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering how criticism

of  Stalin  has  anything to do with the  Referendum

Bill.  Shall we come back to the general merits  and

principles of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the purpose

of this Bill is to build a strong nation. We hope we

can  bring about a strong united nation through this

Bill  so  that  we  can  resolve  all  the  problems

affecting our people in a united Greater Malaya. But

the Barisan Sosialis hope to destroy everything that

is in the interest of the people in order to achieve

their own purpose.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



up  in  January  but the debate on it was  postponed

subsequently because the P.A.P. wanted to resort  to

delaying  tactics  in  order to include  unnecessary

provisions  in the Bill. That is why the  debate  on

this  Bill  has taken two days and it is  likely  to

take some more time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Home Affairs, the

contents   of  this  Bill  have  been   drafted   in

accordance   with  the  spirit  of   the   Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance.  We  have

looked  through  this Bill and  we  have  found  the

majority  of  the  provisions to be quite  different

from  those  in  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance.  We can  see  there  are  many

undemocratic principles in the Bill before us today.

These  provisions  seek  to  restrict  further   the

freedom of speech of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a national referendum is

generally  taken as a good thing in other countries.

There  have been instances where national  referenda

have  been  held.  A  referendum  is  held  when   a

resolution  has  been  passed  in  Parliament  whose

Members   themselves  are  not  sure  whether   they

represent  the  people's opinion. That  is  why  the

question  passed  in Parliament is referred  to  the

people for a final decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of this Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers

that it is in the public interest to do so he may by

order  direct  that any matter he submitted  to  the

electors for a referendum.'



<br><br>From  this  we are unable to know what  is  actually

meant by "public interest". Does the phrase refer to

what is passed in this House or to a question to  be

posed  by  the  Government for the decision  of  the

people?  So from this, we can see there has  been  a

great  departure from the spirit of a true  national

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, there are

provisions  in  the laws of other countries  to  the

effect  that if a resolution is passed in Parliament

and  the people themselves feel that its passage  is

not  truly  representative  of  their  opinions  and

desires, they have the right



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



to  request  the  Governments  to  hold  a  national

referendum.  But this provision is not  included  in

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is trying to

include  a  very  serious provision  in  this  Bill,

namely,  the new clause which provides that unmarked

or  uncertain ballot papers shall be deemed to be in

support  of the Government. You cannot find  such  a

provision in law in any part of the world.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before the hon. Member

continues  in  that strain, may I  remind  him  that

every speaker from his Party has criticised the same

point in so many words? Will the hon. Member now try

not to repeat what his own Party Members have said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we can see that this Bill is detrimental to the true

spirit  of  democracy  in a national  referendum.  I

believe you know that in the history of Singapore  a

Bill    concerning   a   national   referendum    is

unprecedented.  It is the first of its  type  before

this House. That is because we are an infant in  the

history  of democracy. The people are just beginning

to experience a national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in the Bill saying that

within  a period of seven days, a decision  must  be

taken  by  the  people.  I  say  this  provision  is

unreasonable.  Let  me give an  example.  Under  the

Rendel Constitution the people were given the  first

opportunity  to  vote their own representatives  and

they  knew their sacred duty. But at that time there

were  still  some people who were not aware  of  the

significance and the effect of their votes. So there

was the necessity for an explanation to be given  to

the  people over a long period of time - telling  them

the  importance and significance of the  votes  they

were  going  to cast, and which might  affect  their

destiny. So I say that this provision of seven  days

is  far too short. There is no other provision as to

whether  there is any allowance for meetings  to  be

held. This is very undemocratic because it does  not

enable  the people to understand and grasp the  real

state of affairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past three days, from

the  speeches made by Members of the Government  and

Ministers,   we  are  unable  to  say  whether   the

Government  have any intention of withdrawing  these

unnecessary and undemocratic provisions contained in

their   amendments.  If  the  Government   have   no

intention    whatsoever   of    withdrawing    these

unreasonable provisions, then I will say  that  this

show  of democracy by ascertaining the views of  the

people outside this House will not lead us anywhere.

It  does no good at all. If the Government insist on

including    the   unnecessary   and    unreasonable

provisions in this Bill, it only goes to  show  that

they  are just having a show of democracy by  saying

that  they want to ascertain the views of the people

before they do anything decisive. I say this attempt

is  just made to prolong the democratic process  and

to  force the people to choose a thing which they do

not like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ardently hope that the Government will give a

clear-cut  indication whether they are  prepared  to

withdraw such undemocratic provisions which you  can

never  find  in  other democratic countries  in  the

world.   In  the  meantime,  the  Government  should

shoulder  all  the consequences as a result  of  the

delay of this Bill.



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, at the last sitting in

this  Assembly,  there  has been  a  great  deal  of

hypocritical  exhortation about  democracy  and  the

democratic  process  made by the  Barisan  Sosialis,

people  who  are the least qualified to  talk  about

democracy. They have invoked democracy to  establish

the  right of Communists to cause confusion,  spread

falsehoods, and try to prevent merger. They are  the

very  people who are furthest removed from the ideal

of  government  by  the free  will  of  the  people.

Perhaps  the  Member for Thomson has forgotten  that

during the P.A.P. conference in May last year, after

the  Hong  Lim  by-election, he  was  the  strongest

advocate for taking the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



Cuban line. Like Fidel Castro, he strongly advocated

the  abolition  of  all future  elections  as  being

unnecessary  and  stupid.  The  Member   for   Upper

Serangoon  was then trying to dissuade my colleagues

and   I  from  ever  contemplating  resignation  and

returning  the mandate to the people. At that  time,

with  no  merger and no common commodity  market  in

view,  we  saw  no political solution to  our  basic

problems of economic expansion. The Member for Upper

Serangoon  went  so  far as to  say  that  what  was

important  was not whether the people knew  that  we

were doing good for them, but whether, in fact, what

we  were  doing  was good for them.  He  capped  his

argument  by  saying  that  if  Mao  Tse-tung,   the

Chairman of the People's Republic of China,  had  to

stand  for  election  after  the  hardships  of  the

Chinese  communes, he would probably have  lost  his

deposit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Referendum Bill has been brought in to

determine the wish of the majority of the people  on

the  mode and manner of the inevitable reunification

of  these  two  territories. To  put  it  in  proper

perspective, let me remind the Barisan Sosialis  and

the  Member for Anson that the Government are  under

no  obligation,  morally  or  legally,  to  hold   a

referendum. We had a mandate from the people in June

1959  in  clear and categorical terms  to  implement

merger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya.   In  fact,  all  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis

Assemblymen were elected on the P.A.P. platform, the

main  plank of which was merger. They had all signed

solemn  pledges  that  they  would  resign  if  they

departed  from the Party programme and were expelled

from  the  Party. Next we have a mandate  from  this

Assembly,  of 33 unanimous votes with no Assemblymen

being bold enough to be present to vote against  the

proposals  of merger contained in Paper Cmd.  33  of

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Communist front leader

who   is  manipulating  and  coordinating  Communist

policies  in the Barisan Sosialis and the  Communist

front unions, has openly told a meeting of Committee

members of several union officials, who taxed him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



on  this point, that the Government have full  legal

and  constitutional rights once these proposals have

been passed in the Assembly, to carry out the merger

of   Singapore  with  the  Federation   of   Malaya.

Therefore,  let  us be clear in our minds  that  the

Government  are  under no compulsion  to  have  this

referendum and that there is no necessity to  resort

to  trickery,  as  the  Member  for  Queenstown  has

suggested.  Later, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will  explain

the  considerations  which have led  the  Government

firmly  to  the view that a referendum on merger  is

both  desirable  and in the long-term  interests  of

peaceful and stable conditions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at the outset make public the position of

the  P.A.P. and  of the Opposition Parties  on  the

question  of  merger and this referendum.  Sir,  the

UMNO-SPA  Alliance have openly said here  that  they

want  this  merger to go through without any  hitch.

What  they  have stated openly here  is  honest  and

consistent with what they have said privately,  that

this referendum is an unnecessary risk. Two of their

Members,  the Member for Farrer Park and the  Member

for  Tanglin,  have stated here publicly  that  they

consider  the Government have a right and should  go

through  with  merger  without  the  bother   of   a

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim and his United People's

Party, the inaugural meeting of which has yet to  be

held  and  a proper Committee has yet to be elected,

privately want merger established and the Communists

curbed by a strong Central Government. He sees  very

clearly  where  his  interests lie.  He  has  openly

rejected any call for general elections made by  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  The last thing  he  wants  is  a

general  election  before the Communists  have  been

dealt with. It is open knowledge - and he has admitted

it  to quite a number of Members on this side of the

House - that  he has lost most of his kaki or  runners

to  the  Communists in the unions  and  the  Barisan

Sosialis. He has not got the wherewithal to  contest

and  win  a general election now. He has lost  these

runners and kaki partly through persuasion that  the

Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis  were  on  the point of  forming  the  next

government  and  partly through intimidation.  Under

present circumstances, he therefore does not want  a

general election. He wants to ensure merger, when he

knows  that the Communists will be removed from  the

scene. And he continually encourages Members on this

side   of  the  House  to  expose  and  attack   the

Communists in and outside the Barisan Sosialis. But,

at the same time, he hopes to ensure that the P.A.P.

would be weakened by the smears and false charges of

the  Communists, which he is helping  to  propagate,

that  we  are  going to sell out the rights  of  the

people.  All these smears for the purpose that  when

the Communists are contained, he hopes to emerge  as

the strongest single Party. Therefore, he opposes  a

general election now. But he is also hoping that the

Government  will  take the odium for  the  Communist

smear  of selling out a Chinese Singapore to a Malay

Federation.  He  would be quite  happy  to  see  the

Government   carry   through   merger   without    a

referendum.  Of  course, since the  Government  have

decided  on  a referendum, he has also attempted  to

claim  that the referendum has been forced upon  the

Government because he has demanded it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Anson, the Chairman of

the  Workers'  Party. He made an astonishing  remark

yesterday which admitted that although his Party has

been captured, he has not been captured. His private

view  is that the Government should go through  with

merger and not bother about a referendum. But loudly

and publicly he demands guarantees for a referendum.

What  game  is  all this about? I suggest  it  is  a

transparent one, Mr Speaker, Sir. Unlike  the  more

subtle  Member for Hong Lim, he blatantly  seeks  to

identify himself with the Communist popular  causes.

I wonder often whether it could be that he is hoping

that when their political front organisations become

defunct,  he  would  inherit the  support  of  their

remnant branch organisations. He has admitted to the

Minister   for  Health  and  Law  in  a  moment   of

frankness, after what I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



thought  was a mere threat to indulge in  fisticuffs

outside  this Chamber between the Member  for  Anson

and  the  Member  for  Crawford,  in  a  moment   of

remorse - he felt so sorry - he said, "Imagine  two  men

with  grey  hairs boxing each other!"  And  he  said

anyway  he  knew his fate was at the  mercy  of  the

Communists  and that they could pull the  carpet  on

which  he stands and he would be finished.  That  is

what he said. He has no organisation of his own. Nor

is he in a position to make any appeal to the people

on  his own without Communist support, which support

includes  the translation of what he says before  it

can  be  understood by the Chinese, Malay and Indian

masses.  He makes a hue and cry about democracy.  He

has  talked  rashly  of  "blind  chickens"  and  the

"canvassing of the dead". He also wants  merger.  He

knows  full  well  that without merger  the  country

would be ruined and lie would have no place in  this

society, both in his profession and by virtue of his

race.  I  used  to believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

perhaps  he has the courage of his convictions.  But

after  his  debacle  at the Kuala  Lumpur  Communist

front  conference in January, I am somewhat hesitant

in  this  belief.  In the Malaysia  debate  in  this

House, he parted with the Communists on the issue of

Malaysia. Here in this Chamber he supported  it.  He

went  to Kuala Lumpur and, in the Steering Committee

concealed from public gaze, he told them that he was

for  Malaysia  and  would have nothing  to  do  with

merging with Indonesia as the heartland of Malaysia.

He  has  told us in this House that for professional

reasons  he  left for Brunei before  the  resolution

opposing  Malaysia was passed by the conference.  So

it  was that lie was saved the final humiliation  of

being present when his Party disavowed him and voted

with  the  other Communist front delegates  opposing

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, on the other hand, do not

want  a  referendum. What they wanted was to capture

the Government by either seducing or intimidating 26

Assemblymen   into  supporting  them.  That   having

failed, they want general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



elections, to destroy any government that  seeks  to

establish   merger   between   Singapore   and   the

Federation of Malaya, which would be fatal to  their

plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown repeated his futile cry

for general elections when he made his speech on the

Referendum Bill the day before yesterday. He said at

the  radio  forum  last  year  that  the  people  of

Singapore   were  politically  immature   for   such

advanced democratic processes like a referendum, and

that  general  elections were far better,  in  order

that  there can be no single Party emerging  with  a

mandate  to carry out merger. Since he has lost  the

argument  and  since his plea for general  elections

has not found any support from either the Member for

Hong Lim or, for that matter at that time, from  the

Member for Anson - I do not know now, because, as  you

know,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson  from

time   to   time  changes  his  mind - or   from   the

U.M.N.O./S.P.A. Alliance, he now has to try his luck

to  create mischief in the referendum. He has  asked

whether the Government would resign if they lose the

referendum.  Sir,  it  is  my  unpleasant  task   to

disabuse  his  mind  of the very silly  notion  that

there  is such a thing as the Government winning  or

losing a referendum. A referendum is a process - these

are  carefully chosen words for the benefit  of  the

Member  for  Queenstown - by which  we  ascertain  the

wishes  of  the majority of the people, since  there

can  never  be any unanimity, however imperfect  the

method may be. The people's representatives in  this

Assembly   have  already  endorsed  the   heads   of

agreements  for  merger between  Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya. I am reasonably confident that

this  accords  with wishes of the  majority  of  the

people  as  being the best terms and  conditions  to

suit  our  circumstances. But if it SO happens  that

the majority of the people want a different mode and

manner of achieving the inevitable reunification  of

the  two territories - by way of illustration, if, for

instance, they do not wish to have local autonomy in

education and labour - then, of course, it will be the

duty of the Government to fulfill their wishes.  And

so  the  question of winning or losing a  referendum

does not arise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger

being  frustrated  and  the  country  plunged   into

disaster   by  the  activities  of  the   Communists

manipulating a referendum, let me say that it  would

be  criminal folly on the part of the Government  to

hold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and

Malaysia   to  be  imperilled.  If  that  were   the

position,  if the risk existed, then, regardless  of

what  benefit the Member for Hong Lim or the  Member

for Anson may reap by the Government having to carry

the  odium  of  living down the Communist  smear  of

trying  to sell out a Chinese Singapore to  a  Malay

Federation,  it  would still  be  the  duty  of  the

Government to go through with it to ensure that  the

peace,  security  and happiness of the  people,  not

just of Singapore but of Malaya and of Malaysia, are

not  jeopardised. But we are in the happier position

of  not embarking on any such risks, and there would

be  no risk of the Communists, partly by their being

too  clever by half, being able to frustrate  merger

and Malaysia whatever they do in a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because we are confident of this that

we could consider whether the overall position would

be  better  if we carried through merger  without  a

referendum than with a referendum. The conclusion we

have  come to is that in the long term, it would  be

foolish  to  help  the  Communists  in  their  smear

campaign  that  merger  between  Singapore  and  the

Federation  is  a sell-out of Singapore,  where  the

Chinese are in the majority, to a Malaya, where  the

Malays are in the majority. It is needless for me to

refute  the  absurdity of this pro, position  other

than  to  point  out that the Communists  themselves

have stressed time and time again that the Tunku and

the  Federation Government do not want  merger  with

Singapore  without  Malaysia  and  merger  with  the

Borneo territories at the same time. All I need  say

is  that  it  is strange indeed that  if,  in  fact,

Singapore  were being sold or given away,  that  the

Federation is not anxious to take a gift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a sane and

rational  analysis  of  Command  Paper  33  of  1961

indicates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



beyond  any  doubt  the  fair measure  of  political

influence  that  Singapore, as  one  of  the  twelve

States  in  the  Federation and  the  third  largest

represented  in  the Central Federation  Parliament,

will bear on the political policies of the whole  of

the  Federation of Malaya. Sir, there may be certain

groups  of  people  who may be influenced  by  these

reckless communal smears and lies. To implement  the

heads of agreement for a merger without giving  them

the  ultimate choice of the mode and mariner of  the

inevitable  reunification would  be  to  assist  the

Communists  in  spreading this evil lie  by  lending

credence to these rumours. The final position  which

we  want to achieve is not just merger but a  merger

under which the various races in Malaya will live in

peace  and  harmony.  If the Chinese  in  Singapore,

through news reporting of the Chinese Press by  pan-Malaysian newspapers like the Nanyang Siang Pau  and

the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh, which circulate  throughout

Malaya  and  Malaysia, from Perlis in the  North  to

Borneo  in the East, are infected through  lies  and

falsehoods   into  believing  that  in  merger   and

Malaysia the Chinese are being sold out to a  Malay-dominated  Federation, then an unpleasant  situation

will  arise in the Federation and in Singapore.  Let

us  never  forget that there are, after  all,  about

three  million  Chinese in the  Federation.  However

politically immature the people may be - a point which

has been made by the Member for Queenstown - they will

have to face the realities of life in Singapore,  in

Malaysia  and indeed in South-East Asia.  They  will

have  to  make  the choice of either  having  merger

peacefully  by  consent, or not so  peacefully  with

unpleasantness  caused by the  relentless  logic  of

military,   economic,  geographical  and  historical

forces. It is the duty of the Government to try  and

bring  merger  and  Malaysia  about  peacefully   by

consent,  with the maximum of goodwill and  of  give

and take. As for the small percentage who are unable

to  understand the issues because it is beyond  them

or   because   the   Communists  have   deliberately

distorted and twisted the issues, they can abide  by

any decision made in this Assembly. This percentage,

Sir, was less than one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



per  cent  of  the  votes cast in the  last  general

elections. The Member for Anson has said that  this

Assembly  means the Government. Sir,  if  that  were

completely  so,  why  do  he  and  the  Member   for

Queenstown propose amendments in the Referendum Bill

which  seeks  to let the questions to  be  posed  be

decided  in this Assembly and not by the Government?

Obviously,  Sir, there is a qualitative  difference.

We -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of

explanation if the Prime Minister will permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The answer is that the questions

would then be fully debated here. The meaning of the

questions would be made known through the  Press  to

the  people, and it may well be that we  could  even

persuade  the  Government under pressure  of  public

opinion to have fair questions. That is the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I would suggest to the Member

for Anson that he should cease to be SC) naive, that

even  the  Speaker  of  this Assembly  is  now  well

seasoned  to the harangues of the Barisan  Sosialis,

and that the net result -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Prime Minister

not  to drag the Speaker into this controversy.  The

Speaker is endeavouring to be as patient as  he  can

he. He has been, I hope, up till now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, since you do not wish it,

I  need  not commiserate with you when from time  to

time you SC) politely beseech Members of the Ban-san

Sosialis  not  to  repeat themselves.  But  I  think

nobody  in his right mind is in the slightest  doubt

that  the net result is not that the Government will

he  swayed  by public opinion, and better  questions

will be put, hut that the Barisan Sosialis will hope

to  achieve  complete  and utter  confusion  of  the

issues  and  SO  defeat  any achievement  which  the

referendum  would give of popular  approval  to  the

reunification of these two territories.  The  Member

for Anson is not that naive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not able to accept his proposal that

this  Assembly of 51 Members, who are most  unlikely

to  reach any unanimity or any agreement since  they

all   have  opposing  objectives,  should  put   the

questions.  Sir,  the Member was  not  here  when  I

described what those opposing objectives were, but I

hope  he  will  have the pleasure  of  reading  them

sometime in the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> In tomorrow's

paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I hope. Sir, one simple point

I  have  made to the Member for Hong Lim and  I  now

make  it to the Member for Anson. Give us one single

precedent of a referendum statute or an enactment in

any   democratic   country - Australia,   Switzerland,

anywhere  you like - where the questions to  be  posed

are  determined  by  a  body  which,  ex  hypothesi,

includes the Opposition, which, ex hypothesi, cannot

have  unanimity. If a precedent could  be  produced,

consideration  would be given to  it.  But  I  could

produce precedents here of legislation in countries,

which   the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  has  said   are

democratic,  where  the  questions  to  be  put  are

decided by the Government. Sir, it would be silly to

allow the Communists in the Barisan Sosialis to  try

and wreck the referendum by causing confusion in the

framing of the questions. But I suggest that  it  is

logical  and rational that those who are  unable  to

make up their minds shall be deemed to abide by  the

decision  of  the people's representatives  in  this

Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment has been proposed after

careful  consideration of the amendments  that  have

been  put  in by Members of the Opposition,  and  in

this particular case an amendment by the Member  for

Anson  one  of  them,  Sir, seeks  to  allow  voters

intentionally  to deface and mess up ballot  papers.

An amendment to clause 31 of the National Referendum

Bill, i.e., after "or" where it secondly occurs,  to

insert "being a person other than a voter in respect

of  his  own  ballot paper". Sir, under the  present

legislation - and   one  under  which   all   previous

elections  have  been held with proper  decorum  and

person shall deface or destroy his ballot paper. Now

it is suggested that a man should be fully permitted

to  frustrate  the  purposes of  the  referendum  by

intentionally  defacing or otherwise destroying  his

ballot  paper. The Opposition wants this. Maybe  the

Member   for   Anson  does  not   know   the   wider

implications.  Not unnaturally the conclusion  `that

we  or any rational person must come to is that this

is  one of the tactics to counter the referendum, to

cause  confusion by tricking or intimidating  people

into spoiling or defacing the ballot paper. This may

reach  sufficient proportions so that the objectives

of  the  referendum  can be,  in  the  public  mind,

frustrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of explanation if the Prime Minister will permit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Surely [and resumed his seat].



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If you will see, Sir, clause 31,

page 11, line 40, it makes it a criminal offence for

any    person   who   "intentionally   defaces    or

intentionally  destroys  any  ballot  paper  or  the

official mark on any ballot paper....'. And it carries a

liability of two years' imprisonment maximum  and  7

years, from the date of his conviction, being unable

to vote. If the Prime Minister would direct his mind

to  that - the  point was that the  person  should  be

free,  if  he  did not want to vote, to destroy  his

paper without making him liable to conviction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I am grateful to the Member

for  Anson  for  repeating my explanation.  That  is

exactly the point. Under the present legislation  no

man  is  entitled to deface or destroy even his  own

ballot  paper.  There  is a reason  for  it,  and  I

suggest to him particularly now, in view of the fact

that  the  Member for Changi has also stressed  this

point.  It is a pity that we wish to punish  anybody

for defacing his ballot paper; and if he now returns

a blank ballot, it will be deemed that he will leave

the  decision to this Assembly. The Member for Anson

may be still naive,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



Sir. I have a feeling that it is a long while  ago

since he was a vestal virgin in political matters. I

have  the  unhappy feeling that he knows full  well,

having  seen, having felt, and having heard  of  the

activities  of the Communists through  the  Barisan,

through the unions and through the manipulations  of

some  of his own members of the Workers' Party, with

one of whom I had the occasion to discuss -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> His Party has been captured. He

has admitted that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes. I had to describe the

activities of the one of his members in my series of

broadcasts  which  unfortunately had  to  bring  his

Party  in.  Let  us  not  be squeamish  about  these

things.  He himself admitted yesterday that although

his  Party may have been captured, he has  not  been

captured. Well, I say, God bless him. Perhaps he  is

not worth the capture. I do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that it is contrary to the

interests  of  this country to allow the  Communists

and their open front organisation an opportunity  to

manipulate, by lies, trickery and smears, people  to

destroy  or  leave  blank ballot papers.  One  could

achieve  that  result  by any number  of  lies.  For

instance,  there are a lot of ignorant  people  who,

for some reason or the other, may believe that since

they were not born here, for them to put a cross for

or  against  a proposition might mean  the  loss  of

their citizenship. They would really readily believe

such   a  proposition,  and  if  sufficiently  large

numbers   can  be  persuaded  to  believe   such   a

proposition, they might be dissuaded from  making  a

choice  and  leaving a blank ballot. This  provision

does not prevent anybody from making his choice, but

it  makes  it  unprofitable for  the  Communists  to

dissuade  people from exercising their choice.  That

is the purpose of the amendment which has arisen out

of  the  amendment proposed by the Member for Anson,

which he may or may not know may be very useful  for

the  Communists. So the provision we have made, that

unmarked  or blank ballot papers shall be deemed  to

accept  the decision .on the matter by the Assembly,

will prevent any such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



mischievous campaign, can look after the  less  than

one  per cent in the last general elections of those

groups who, the Member for Queenstown said, are  not

politically mature enough to understand  the  issues

in a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in January of wanting to

delay  the passage of this Bill and thereby avoiding

the  holding  of  a  referendum.  We  at  that  time

directed our attention to the Barisan Sosialis.  But

they,  of  course, from time to time, in order  that

they   will  not  be  spotlighted  in  their   stark

nakedness, their ugly features revealed, bring in  a

few aides to try and blend into a wider and a bigger

background. They brought in the Member for Anson who

foolishly  supported  the  statement  that  we  were

trying  to  abscond from a referendum.  So  did  the

Member  for  Hong Lim. Now, however, the Member  for

Hong Lim has asked that more time be given to him so

that he could find out if other democratic countries

like  Australia have referendum laws  which  provide

for   the  determination  of  the  issues   by   the

Government and by the Opposition also. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I was grateful for his suggestion. Now he wants

the Bill to go to Select Committee. In order that we

shall  not  be  accused  of  wishing  to  delay  its

passage,  we  have stated that it can go  to  Select

Committee  if  it is the wish of the Opposition.  In

other  words, the Government will abstain. Sir,  the

Member for Anson was so moved by this gesture of the

Government  that  he  exclaimed,  "Very  fair!  Very

fair!" Of course, we must press that the Bill should

be reported to this House by the end of April. There

are  various  reasons for it, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  A

Select Committee is a matter on which the Members of

the  Opposition can please themselves.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  denounced this yesterday. The  Member  for

Anson praised it yesterday. I am now told the Member

for  Anson  praised it the day before, but denounced

it  yesterday when he was approached by  Members  of

the U.P.P. and the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance. He went

over  to  the  Barisan  side and  opposed  a  Select

Committee. I am now told in my few minutes'  absence

out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



of this Chamber - I do not know whether the Member for

Anson  was  here - that there has been a  reversal  of

line.   The   Barisan - their   appendages   in   this

Assembly - have made the wrong decision, it seems;  or

perhaps  this was an impromptu one which  again  may

have to be reversed. But they also are not against a

Select  Committee and they will abstain  now.  Well,

Sir,  so  be it. The Opposition can have it any  way

they like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the complaint of lack of time to

consider  the amendments, may I point out  that  all

these  amendments are as a result of the  amendments

proposed by the Opposition? In nearly all cases, the

Government  could  have moved  these  amendments  in

Committee  without giving the Opposition any  notice

whatsoever.  That  is so. We gave them  notice  last

Monday.  If  the  Bill  were not  to  go  to  Select

Committee,  it would have been next week before  the

Committee  stage  is  arrived  at.  I  am  therefore

completely unmoved by all these charges made by  the

Member  for  Anson and by the Member for Queenstown

of  unfair  practice and of not giving  them  enough

time.   If   they  really  wish  to   consider   the

amendments - as  the  Member  for  Farrer   Park   has

said - they can vote for the motion by the Member  for

Hong Lim to refer the Bill to Select Committee.  But

as  I  say, whether in Select Committee or  in  this

Chamber or in any other public forum, we defend what

is  fair,  what is just and what is right. We  shall

not   be  deterred  from  doing  what  we  know   is

necessary.  What is really necessary is to  disabuse

the  minds of the people of Singapore - or any section

of the people of Singapore; in this particular case,

principally  the Chinese - that there is any  sell-out

to  any  Malays in the Federation. Merger will  take

place  whether we go through a referendum or without

a  referendum. The Seeretary-Genera1 of the  Barisan

Sosialis has admitted that to a meeting of his union

officials  recently. He knows it. The  game  is  up.

They  fought the wrong issue. In fact they acted  as

the  catalyst for merger. The issue is  not  whether

merger takes place or not, but whether after it  has

taken place you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



have  a  happy  society composed of three  principal

races. Let us be frank about it - two principal  races

and one minor race the Chinese and the Malays, about

equal in number; the Indians, about 15 per cent.  If

one community believes that another has deprived  it

of  its rights or that somebody has sold it out  and

carries a chip on its shoulder, that is the kind  of

bitterness and hatred upon which the Communists hope

to  feed and grow after Malaysia. It is our duty not

just  to  plan for merger - for that phase is over - but

to  ensure  that after merger only those who  sought

trouble and who now have got it coming to them  will

be left embittered, namely, the Communists and their

stooges  in  the  front organisations, it  must  be

brought  home to the majority of the Chinese - whether

they  are  Chinese-speaking,  non-Chinese  speaking,

born here or born in China - that merger is inevitable

and  is in their own interest of survival, and  that

nobody   sold  anybody  to  anyone  else-let   alone

Singapore  to the Federation. For if that  were  the

case,  as I said, the gift would have been  taken  a

long  time ago. It is because of certain other basic

considerations,   of   maintaining    the    overall

proportions   between   the   various   races    and

communities,  of the imbalance that Singapore  alone

in the Federation would introduce, that Malaysia has

been  timed to coincide with merger. That in  itself

is   an  admission  that  Singapore  wields  a  fair

proportionate  measure  of  influence  in  the   new

Federation.  That  point will  sink  home  when  the

people  make their choice. As I put it to the Member

for  Stamford,  is  she afraid to  put  the  Barisan

Sosialis proposition - complete merger like Penang and

Malacca - to a vote of the people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in view of the unfounded  charges

and  insinuations made by the Member for  Queenstown

and other Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen regarding the

intention of the Government in this Bill, I wish  to

reiterate  what  I  said when  I  moved  the  Second

Reading of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modifications which the Government have made

to the Bill with regard to the procedure for holding

a   referendum  were  made  because  no   individual

candidate or political Parties were involved  as  in

the case of elections, and also in order to simplify

the  procedure at polling stations and to save time.

These  modifications were made to suit the different

requirements of a referendum. However, in order that

there can be no doubt whatsoever about the propriety

of  the  conduct  of the referendum, the  Government

accept   several  amendments  of  the   Member   for

Queenstown  relating to the appointment  of  polling

agents  and  counting  agents by  political  Parties

represented in the Assembly, the affixing  of  seals

by polling agents or counting agents, the opening of

ballot  boxes  in their presence, and the  provision

for  the  recounting of votes. The  Government  also

accept   with  some  modifications  the   Opposition

amendments  on  the prohibition of  flags,  banners,

symbols,  advertisements, etc, and canvassing  in  a

referendum.  For the information of the  Member  for

Queenstown,  the  period  of  time  in  respect  of

certain   statutory  notifications  will   also   be

extended by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate once again that canvassing

will  be prohibited only on polling day, just as  in

the  case  of  any elections in the past.  Also  the

prohibition  on  the displaying of  flags,  banners,

symbols,  etc, is to be confined only to the  period

of  the  referendum.  The  provision  of  referendum

petitions  too has been spelt out in a comprehensive

form under the new Part V of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government therefore have met most of the

criticisms contained in the speech of the Member for

Queenstown. However, in spite of the fact  that  the

Government  had  conceded to the amendments  of  the

Opposition, the Member for Queenstown deemed fit  to

carry  on a long tirade fighting shadows of his  own

making. Nevertheless, the speeches of the Member for

Queenstown and his colleagues showed how absurd they

had  become after closely associating with Communist

front leaders in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of a referendum on

merger  was raised by the Party even before  the  13

Barisan Sosialis Members left the P.A.P. in the hope

of becoming Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.

It is equally absurd for the Member for Hong Lim to

suggest  that the proposal to hold a referendum  was

forced upon the Government through his pressure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon made a fantastic

suggestion that the purpose of the referendum is  to

give the Government another lease of life. If he  is

not  dishonest, he will remember that in  May  1961,

soon  after the Hong Lim by-election, the Government

were  prepared  to hold a referendum as  to  whether

they should continue in office. However, it was  the 13  Barisan  Sosialis Members  now  sitting  on  the

opposite  side  of  the  House  who  came  out  most

strongly  against this move. They were horrified  at

the  prospect  of  not  being in  office  either  as

Parliamentary  Secretaries or  Assemblymen.  If  the

P.A.P. leadership wanted to hang on  to  office  at

whatever  cost, we would not have put the future  of

the Government in the hands of the people then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the criticism that the Opposition

had  not been given adequate time to campaign during

the  referendum. This again is far from  the  truth.

Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of this Bill,

the  first  matter to be committed to the electorate

for a referendum will be the terms and conditions of

merger  of Singapore with the Federation.  Much  has

already been said about this merger during the  past

few  months  through  the  radio  forums,  meetings,

discussions  and  in  this  Assembly:  The   Barisan

Sosialis,  in fact, have held a considerable  number

of  mass  meetings  in the last few  months  on  the

merger  issue,  of  course,  not  with  a  view   to

clarifying the facts as contained in the White Paper

but  in  order to create fear and confusion  in  the

minds  of  the people. The fact that their so-called

mass  meetings are being attended by fewer and fewer

people is already an indication to them as to  which

way the wind of public opinion is blowing. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



one  cannot  expect  a political  Party  founded  on

double   talk  and  petty  ambitions  to   stir   up

enthusiasm among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim yesterday went to

considerable lengths to criticise the Government for

not  calling an All-Party Conference to discuss  the

Referendum Bill and to agree on the question  to  be

put   to  the  people.  Although  he  mentioned  the

Referendum Ordinance in Australia, he was unable  to

quote  any  provision  in the Australian  Referendum

Ordinance where there was provision for an All-Party

Conference  to  decide on the  question  to  be  put

before the people. From what the Member for Hong Lim

said regarding the All-Party Conference and the fact

that  the  Member  for  Anson sought  to  allow  the

Assembly  to decide on the question, I am  beginning

to wonder whether they understand the cabinet system

of  government. The Government is elected by, and is

responsible  to, the people. It is the  business  of

the Government to govern in the best interest of the

people.   Surely   these  two  gentlemen   are   not

suggesting that the Government should abdicate their

powers and responsibility? If an executive matter is

to  be referred to the Assembly for a decision, then

there  might as well not be a Cabinet. Perhaps  that

is what they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one can imagine what the

position would be like should this happen. The issue

for a referendum would be so confused that the whole

purpose  of  the referendum would be  defeated.  Mr

Speaker, the purpose of a referendum is to ascertain

the views of the people on a certain national issue,

which   the  Government  consider  to  be  of   such

magnitude  and  importance that direct  consultation

with  the people is necessary. Since the Member  for

Upper  Serangoon says he has full confidence in  the

political consciousness of the people and  in  their

ability to see clearly the issue before them, I fail

to  see  any reason why they should be afraid  of  a

referendum.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  his  Party  Chairman,  seems  to  think

otherwise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



According to him, the people are ignorant fools  and

have  such  a low political consciousness that  they

are  unable to distinguish between the good and  the

bad,  and  therefore a refrendum is most unsuitable.

If  then  this is the view of the Barisan  Sosialis,

that  the  people are politically immature and  have

such  a  low  political consciousness and  the  same

degree  of sanity as the Member for Anson, then  it

should -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. This

is misrepresentation of what I said in the Assembly.

He  said  that I called the people fools and  things

like that. That is entirely wrong.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Minister  has alleged that the Member for Queenstown

called  the people fools. But may I suggest  to  the

Minister  for Home Affairs that the expression  used

of  the  Member for Anson is completely improper?  I

ask him to withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> As you wish, Sir, I withdraw my

expression  in  respect  of the  Member  for  Anson.

Nevertheless, what the Member for Queenstown said at

the raido forum amounts to the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon

has   also  suggested  that  the  question  for  the

referendum  should  be whether the  White  Paper  on

merger  should  be accepted, and not  what  type  of

merger the people would like. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

beginning  to  wonder whether the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon has second thoughts about the implications

of  his Party's own merger proposal on the basis  of

Penang  and  Malacca, and that he now realises  that

his  Party's type of merger is not acceptable to the

people,  because it is a sell-out of more than  half

of the citizens' rights and privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Upper

Serangoon  made  an  unfair allegation  against  the

integrity  of  the civil servants  who  will  be  in

charge of the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes. I never accused the civil

servants yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

implication is clear enough. According to  him,  the

clause  on tendered votes will enable the Government

to indulge in irregular practices. How this could be

done  he did not explain, and I hope he will  do  so

when it comes to the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I only wish to say at this stage that the

whole  referendum  machinery is  run  by  the  civil

servants,  including the issue of ballot  papers  to

the  voters. The Ministers, the Parliamentary  Secre

taries,  and Government Assemblymen have no hand  in

running   the  polling  stations.  Apart  from   the

presiding  officer  who  is normally  a  responsible

civil  servant to see that a `ballot paper is issued

only  to  the person entitled to it, there are  also

the   polling   agents  appointed  by  the   various

political Parties themselves to see that the polling

is  conducted  in an honest and fair manner.  Is  he

then  suggesting that the civil servants,  numbering

more  than 10,000 in charge of the polling stations,

will  indulge in irregular practices, and that  they

are  even  so  bold  as to do  it  under  the  close

scrutiny  of  the  polling agents appointed  by  the

political  Parties? Elections have  been  held  many

times in the past, and I have yet to hear of such  a

fantastic  charge  being made  against  the  polling

staff.  If  I  may point out, the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon took part in at least four elections and I

failed   to   hear   from  him  any   complaint   of

irregularity committed under this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, not so long

ago  his  Party Chairman, the Member for Queenstown,

the  Member for Thomson, and many others in the Barisan  Sosialis, praised the integrity  of  the  civil

service to high heaven. But today we hear the Member

for    Upper   Serangoon   making   this   fantastic

presumption that the civil servants in charge of the

referendum machinery is politically corrupt.  Is  it

because  they  think  that  the  praise  they   have

showered on the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



servants  in the not too distant past has fallen  on

barren  soil  that they have now decided  to  change

their views?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, great play has been made of the

amendment regarding unmarked and uncertain votes. In

this respect, the Minister for Finance and the Prime

Minister have already given an adequate explanation.

Mr Speaker, Sir, in their campaign to oppose merger

and  Malaysia, the Communists and their stooges have

resorted  to  unprincipled  tactics  of  deceit  and

duplicity  even  to  the extent  of  stabbing  their

comrades   and  pilfering  properties  from   P.A.P.

branches. Ever since the issue of merger was raised,

the  communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have been earnestly going about  confusing

the  illiterate  people,  especially  in  the  rural

areas,  by spreading rumours that they should oppose

merger  because merger would mean the domination  of

the  Chinese  by the Malays; special privileges  and

licence  would be granted to the Malays; and Chinese

culture and education would be eliminated. Since the

Government  have  decided to  refer  this  important

national issue to the people, they have decided that

the   referendum  should  be  exploited   to   their

advantage.  Without the amendment  proposed  by  the

Government  regarding uncertain and unmarked  votes,

the  Communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  could go round and mislead the  electorate

to  cast blink votes or deface the ballot papers  by

giving  all  kinds  of false interpretation  to  the

White  Paper.  For example, a vote for  merger  will

entail the loss of citizenship or a taxi licence  or

the  opportunity to be educated in a Chinese school.

It  is  to  ensure that the right of the  voters  to

express their views is not prevented or confused  by

the   falsehoods   and   rumour-mongering   of   the

Communists and their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis

that  the amendment has been introduced so that  the

genuine  views of the people may be ascertained  and

that the referendum will not be turned into a farce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may note that in the last general

elections in 1959 the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



rejected  votes,  which  included  the  unmarked  or

uncertain  or defaced votes, etc., only amounted  to

6,650,  which  was about one per cent of  the  total

votes cast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, charges of parliamentary

dictatorship  were  levelled  against   the   P.A.P.

Government   by   the  Member  for   Queenstown   in

connection   with   this  Bill.  The   Members   for

Queenstown,  Nee  Soon, and Upper  Serangoon  seemed

unable  to  grasp the simple truth put  to  them  in

simple   language.   The   Government   could   have

implemented the merger plan after the Assembly  gave

its  approval to the White Paper, Cmd. 33  of  1961,

without  holding  a referendum. The  fact  that  the

Government are prepared to put the issue  of  merger

before  the people even after the Assembly gave  its

approval   proves  conclusively  that   the   P.A.P.

Government is far from being dictatorial. Indeed the

Government   consider  merger   a   national   issue

affecting the future of 1.7 million people,  and  it

is  therefore  a  matter important  enough  for  the

people  to  decide on the manner of  the  inevitable

reunification  of  the  two  territories.   If   the

Government wanted to be dictatorial, like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, not only would this Bill  not

be  before  this House today, but most probably  the

Member  for  Queenstown  and his  political  cronies

would  not  be  present in this  Assembly,  but,  as

suggested by the Minister for Finance, they would be

six feet underground.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

the motion*

standing in my name,



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same motion also stood in the name of A. P. Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial unrest  and  calls  on  the

Government  to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the  interests  of

the economic well-being of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Sir, I would like to say in

unequivocal terms that this motion introduced by  me

is  not a political move to embarrass the Government

or  to  condemn the two political Parties, that  is,

the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis, for fighting it

out  in the trade union arena as to who are the true

champions of the workers in Singapore. The fight  is

the  more  bitter  because it is a  fight  of  Party

comrades  who have irreconciliably fallen out.  Both

have  graduated from the same school of the  art  of

using  the  workers' movement to achieve  their  own

political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish my motion for the present to

get  involved  in the mischief created  by  the  two

political  Parties.  It is a  motion  in  plain  and

simple  language. The first part of my motion,  that

is,  "That  this House views with grave concern  the

mounting  of industrial unrest" does not require  me

to  say  much  to convince hon. Members.  Facts  and

figures  speak  for themselves. The  economic  well-being of the people is the first and sacred task  of

the elected representatives





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



of the people, the Government as well  as

the  Opposition, and such being the case, this House

cannot  but  view  with grave concern  the  mounting

industrial unrest. In the words of the Minister  for

Labour and Law, when he moved the Second Reading  of

the  Industrial  Relations Bill  on  10th  February,

1960, and I quote Hansard, Vol. 2, No. 3, col. 151:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Strikes and lockouts and other traditional forms

of  direct  action cause suffering and  hardship  to

those  involved, and economic loss to the  community

as  a  whole on a scale which a progressive society,

aiming   at  a  happier  life  and  higher  economic

standards  for  all,  cannot  tolerate  and   cannot

afford.'



<br><br>Whether there has been mounting industrial unrest or

not,   hon.  Members  can  evaluate  from  newspaper

reports   and  statistics  issued  by   the   Labour

Department.  Official figures released last  January

showed  that  last year, with 113 strikes  and  four

lock-outs involving 43,764 workmen, and resulting in

the loss of 426,127 man-days, was the worst year  of

industrial  unrest  in  the  life  of  the   present

Government. In 1960, there were 45 strikes.  In  the

last  five months of last year, there was an average

of  one strike every two days, against an average of

five  a  month  in the first seven months.  Of  last

year's  113  strikes, 78 occurred in the  last  five

months, August to December, giving an average of  15

strikes  a month. The number of disputes dealt  with

by  the  Industrial Section of the Labour Department

last year was 1,225.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst strike month was November with 20

strikes involving 32,304 workmen and costing 300,842

man-days lost. Moreover, Sir, many new strikes  have

already  taken  place this year  and  there  do  not

appear  to  be indications of an easing off  on  the

strike  front.  From these facts  and  figures,  hon

Members  cannot  ignore  the  fact  that  industrial

unrest  has  been  on the increase and,  as  elected

representatives  of the people, we cannot  but  view

this with grave concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while on the question of strikes, I want to

take  this opportunity to refer to the recent strike

of the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



Bank  Employees'  Union at the Oversea-Chinese  Bank

which  has  not been amicably settled. Hon.  Members

will  remember that during the debate on the  Second

Reading  of the Banking Bill which was taken through

all its stages last January, I had occasion to refer

to this Union as a P.A.P. union. This reference drew

forth a Press statement from the Acting Secretary of

the  Union  declaring that his  Union  did  not  owe

allegiance  to  any  political  Party,  nor  did  it

profess  any political ideology. The statement  went

on  to  express  the hope that I would  withdraw  my

allegation.  Well, well, I am glad, Sir,  that  this

Union  has  made  its  stand  clear  vis-a-vis   its

allegiance  to  any political Party. I  accept  this

statement and I would like to congratulate the Union

for  the wisdom of its stand. Its members should  be

proud  that  the Union will not allow itself  to  be

geared to the machine of any political Party. Having

paid  all  this  highly  deserving  praise  to   the

Singapore Bank Employees' Union, Sir, I do not think

I was wrong in describing it as a P.A.P. union in my

speech  referred to earlier. Inasmuch as  the  Prime

Minister  has  described unions which  have  Barisan

Sosialis  leaders associated with  them  as  Barisan

Sosialis  unions  and as Communist front  unions,  I

have  described the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union

as  a P.A.P. union because it has Mr Devan Nair and

also,  mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for  Culture closely associated  with  the

union.  If  the Prime Minister is right, then  I  am

right.  In  fact,  Sir, I am more  right  because  a

Parliamentary  Secretary, a  representative  of  the

P.A.P.  Government,  is connected  with  the  union.

Therefore,  I am more right than the Prime  Minister

when I described the Singapore Bank Employees' Union

as a P.A.P. union -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

You are a capitalist.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, having viewed with grave

concern  the mounting industrial unrest, this  House

cannot  leave  it  at that. The second  part  of  my

motion, therefore, comes in, and that is:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House...calls on the Government to take

all reasonable steps to ensure industrial peace with

justice  in the interests of the economic well-being

of the people of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance is a

reasonable step in this direction. When the Bill was

read a Second time in February 1960, I think it  was

the  Prime Minister who said that this was the first

attempt made by the Legislature to bring the rule of

law  into industrial relations where the rule of the

jungle had prevailed previously. The Bill as drafted

by the Austrian expert brought in specially for this

purpose  was  a good Bill, and the Opposition  quite

frankly  informed  the  House  that  they  were   in

complete  agreement with the principle  involved  in

the  Bill when it was read a Second time in February

1960.   Unfortunately,  Sir,  during  the  Committee

stage, there were rush amendments introduced by  the

Government  which  were  forced  through  with   the

Government's strength then of 43 Members in spite of

very  strong  objections  from  the  Opposition.  50

amendments  were  introduced by the Government,  and

some  of  these  mutilated the  Bill  and  took  the

essence   out  of  the  genuine  effort  to  promote

industrial  peace. However, the Minister did  assure

the  House  during his speech on the Second  Reading

that   the   Government  would  give  very   careful

consideration to the Annual Reports of the President

of  the Industrial Arbitration Court required  under

section  83 of the Ordinance and that the Government

would not hesitate to introduce amending legislation

if  the need to do so was shown. At long last,  Sir,

the  President  of the Industrial Arbitration  Court

has  submitted his first Annual Report and this  has

been  in  the  hands  of  hon.  Members  since  last

January. It is clear, Sir, from the Report  and,  in

fact,  it  has been clear to us for some time,  that

the Court has been working at a feverish pace and  I

would ask the Government not to hesitate to give the

additional staff asked for by the President  in  his

Report. Certain suggested amendments have also  been

brought up by the President of the Arbitration Court

with the Minister. I take it that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



these  suggested amendments are aimed  at  improving

the  operation of this legislation as  a  result  of

experience gained over the past 15 months.  I  would

ask   the  Minister  to  introduce,  without  delay,

amending legislation as recommended by the President

of  the  Arbitration  Court. The  present  unhealthy

situation in Singapore demands immediate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Table 4 of the Report discloses a sorry state

of  affairs and the Government cannot afford  to  be

complacent about this. Table 4 shows that there  are

8  cases pending before the Court. One case is being

heard,  while  the  other  seven  cases  are   still

awaiting hearing two of which were submitted to  the

Court  as far back as September 1961, that is,  they

have been in cold storage for many, many months  and

are  still  awaiting hearing. I can now  understand,

Sir, why it was that the Minister had been found  to

be   hesitant   in  directing  trade   disputes   to

arbitration.  It  would  be  manifestly  unfair   to

require the disputants, particularly workers'  trade

unions,  to  shelve settlement of their  claims  for

many,  many months awaiting the convenience  of  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court; for it  must  not  be

overlooked  that  once  a  trade  dispute  has  been

submitted   by  the  Minister  to  the   Court   for

arbitration, strike action must cease. The  Minister

for  Labour  and  Law in his speech  on  the  Second

Reading of the Industrial Relations Bill in February

1960,  said (Hansard, 10th February, 1960, Vol.  12,

col. 154):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As the system develops, it could be that we may

have  to  have  more  than one Court  to  deal  with

matters in the first instance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 4 clearly shows that one Court is grossly

inadequate. Moreover, Sir, let us look at section 29

of the Industrial Relations Ordinance which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of section 30 of this

Ordinance    the    Court   shall   carefully    and

expeditiously  hear,  inquire into  and  investigate

every  trade dispute of which it has cognizance  and

all matters affecting the trade dispute and the just

settlement  of  the dispute and shall determine  the

dispute by arbitration.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir, "the Court shall carefully and

expeditiously hear, inquire into and investigate ...".

The  fact that there have been cases pending hearing

for   months  and  months  is,  to  say  the  least,

defeating the object of this special legislation. It

is  now evidently clear that the Government must set

up  more than one Court to do justice. I would  like

to  receive  an  assurance from the Government  that

this will be done forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now refer to Part VII of the

Industrial Relations Bill. This deals with boards of

inquiry.  This  provision in the law  has  not  been

brought into play by the Minister. There must  be  a

purpose  for such provision, and it is my submission

that  the  Minister should have exercised his  power

under  this Part in regard to the recent  strike  at

the  Oversea-Chinese  Banking Corporation.  Ltd, in

this  particular strike, the union claimed that  the

employers  had done some act injurious to the  union

and  demanded an apology. The employers were adamant

and  refuted  the union's claims. As a  result,  the

workers were called out on strike, which lasted more

than a week before it was amicably settled. But  the

workers  would  not  have to  suffer  some  loss  to

achieve their ends and the public would not have  to

suffer  inconvenience  if  the  Minister  had   only

exercised  his  power  under  this  Ordinance.   The

Minister should have appointed a board of inquiry to

inquire  into who was right and who was  wrong,  and

public  opinion  would be brought  to  bear  on  the

culprits.  I would ask the Minister not to  hesitate

to  use this power when the occasion demands it  and

thus put a check on unnecessary industrial strife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out earlier, one Court of

Arbitration has been found to be ineffective to cope

with  the spate of trade disputes. More courts  have

to  be  established,  and once  this  is  done,  the

Minister  should have no hesitation to direct  trade

disputes   to   be  submitted  to   the   Court   of

arbitration. Once a strike takes place,  it  is  the

duty of the Labour Ministry officials, including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  and his Parliamentary  Secretary,  if

they  are  not overburdened with work,  to  step  in

straightaway  and  try to bring  about  an  amicable

settlement. But if these efforts proved futile after

a  reasonable  time,  the  Minister  should  without

hesitation   direct  that  the  trade   dispute   be

submitted  to  the  Court  for  arbitration  if  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance is  meant  to  be  a

serious  piece of legislation to promote  industrial

peace with justice, and the rule of law must be made

to  replace  the rule of the jungle  which,  in  the

words of the Minister for Labour and Law uttered  in

February  1960,  causes "suffering and  hardship  to

those  involved, and economic loss to the  community

as  a  whole on a scale which a progressive society,

aiming   at  a  happier  life  and  higher  economic

standards  for  all,  cannot  tolerate  and   cannot

afford".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conciliation is the biggest factor in promoting

industrial peace, and it is therefore vital that the

Labour  Department should have a full complement  of

trained conciliators. I do not know whether  or  not

there  is  a  strong and effective team  of  trained

conciliators in the Labour Department,  but  if  the

Minister  wants additional staff, we will  give  him

all support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago in this House, the Prime

Minister   waxed  eloquent.  He  said  in  vitriolic

language  that  it was the policy of the  Government

not to allow non-citizens to play an active part  in

the industrial relations field. If he meant what  he

said  and  said  what  he  meant, may  I  ask   the

Government  when  it proposes to introduce  amending

legislation  to  this  effect?  In  the   Industrial

Relations  Ordinance, non-citizens are not  entitled

to  be  appointed to serve on the panel of employers

or  of employees. Sir, in view of section 83 of  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance, a number  of  secret

ballots   have   been  undertaken  by   the   Labour

Department  to ascertain the workers'  choice  of  a

particular trade union to represent their interests.

I  cannot  understand, Sir, how, after  such  secret

balloting  had disclosed the choice of the  majority

of  workers  in a particular place of employment,  a

rival trade union which lost in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



secret   balloting  was  allowed,  to  continue   to

function,  in  one  particular  case,  it  was  even

allowed  to  call  and carry out  a  strike  of  the

minority  of workers. Does this not make a farce  of

the  procedure  of secret ballot undertaken  by  the

Labour Department? Why go through this rigmarole  as

it  will  only  bring  the  Labour  Department  into

disrepute   and   contempt?  If  a   secret   ballot

undertaken by the Labour Department does not  settle

the question, why should the Government waste public

funds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Industrial Relations Bill was read a

Second  and  a  Third  time in  February  1960,  the

Government   quite   rightly   claimed   that   this

legislation  would  bring  the  rule  of  law   into

industrial  relations where previously the  rule  of

the   jungle  had  prevailed.  The  Bill  which  was

assented  to  on  25th  February,  1960,  came  into

operation on 15th September, 1960 - a delay  of  seven

months - and  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court  was

officially  opened on 24th October, 1960.  All  this

happened  in 1960 and yet, Sir, in 1961, there  were

113  strikes more than in previous years.  Has  this

piece of legislation achieved the object - that is, to

bring  the  rule  of  law into industrial  relations

where   previously  the  rule  of  the  jungle   had

prevailed? To a lesser degree than in 1961,  it  has

failed.  Why  and  where  it  has  failed,  I   have

endeavoured  in my speech to quote a few  instances.

This  law, if it is meant to be a serious  piece  of

legislation   to  promote  industrial   peace   with

justice, must be made to work, and it can be made to

work,  and  I  call on the Government  to  take  all

necessary steps to make it work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Government is no less anxious

than we are to promote industrial peace with justice

so  that the industrialisation plans for the benefit

of  the  people of Singapore can be assured of  some

measure of success. The P.A.P. have leaders who  are

very  close to the trade unions. They are  therefore

in  a  position to know what reasonable steps  other

than  the  ones I have touched upon, the  Government

can take to ensure industrial peace with justice in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



the  interests  of the economic well-being  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, my motion rests.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I propose the Question, may I

enquire from the Member for Anson whether he intends

moving his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, may I suggest that the

mover of the motion, if he wishes to deal with  that

amendment, can do so now so that the device which we

have   adopted   on   other   occasions   could   be

adopted - that  is, the debate could  range  over  the

motion and the amendment, and then at the end of the

debate  the  Question  could be  put  first  on  the

amendment and then on the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I seek your indulgence, Sir,I shall

be  unavoidably away in Penang on Monday. I have but

a  few minutes to deal with my amendment and if  the

Member  for Cairnhill continues to speak, of course,

I will be even unable to deal with that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not my choice. It is the choice

of  the  Member for Cairnhill. Perhaps he  can  just

indicate whether he accepts that or not.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not know what has

prompted  the Member for Anson to move an  amendment

to  a very simple motion. I must listen to his views

before  I  can even decide whether I support  it  or

not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, the Member for Cairnhill

has the right to reply at the end of the debate.  At

that  stage,  he  can  indicate  his  views  on  the

amendment.  But the point is that I would  like  the

assent  of  Members to the device  that  the  debate

should  proceed not only on the motion but  also  on

the amendment, and that will save time. Is there any

objection to that?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I suggest that the amendment

be  disposed  of,  because, depending  on  what  the

Member  for Anson has to say, I may have  a  lot  to

speak against or for the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



If  I  support it, it will be all right, but  I  may

speak against it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Cairnhill does not

understand. He will have the opportunity at the  end

of  the debate to say whether he supports or rejects

the  amendment. This is a device to save time. Well,

there is a dissenting voice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

congratulate him. It must be a comfortable position.

He  has  so well hidden the antecedents of the  days

when he was a trade union agitator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a touch of hysteria a little

reminiscent of the Straits Tunes in this motion, and

that  is  why  I  have sought to bring  a  sense  of

balance to it by my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recognise that in a free competitive

society, the worker is naked and defenceless in  the

face  of  the  power of capital and  his  only  real

protection is the unity he gets from the trade union

movement; and by the very nature of the structure of

our  economy, a trade unionist and a capitalist must

carry  on  a  constant struggle which  is  perfectly

healthy,  as  healthy as hunger and the satisfaction

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law can help to some extent, but the law

cannot replace self-help in the industrial field any

more than it can replace self-help in the individual

field.  This  alarm  displayed by  the  motion - grave

concern;  mounting  industrial unrest - forgets  that

there are other countries, for instance, England,  a

land of democracy. I was just reading the other  day

a  book  and I noticed that in 1912, there  were  40

million man-days lost by strikes, and there were far

more  in  1921 and in 1926. If we take our minds  to

Australia   and  America  and  to  other  democratic

countries,  there  are far more man-days  lost  and,

when  they are compared to the population, there  is

far  from cause for alarm. I would say, with respect

to  you, Mr Speaker. Sir, but for the malice of our

newspapers,  we would be conscious of the  restraint

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



dignity  of our workers, Sir, let us not lose  sense

of  the value of a strike to the worker. I speak  as

one  who has suffered from unfortunate strikes  when

the  Member  for Cairnhill was himself the  Minister

for  Labour, but even in spite of some strikes which

were  politically motivated and completely malicious

and  not intended for the welfare of the worker,  in

that  one year in 1955, Sir, the standard of  living

of  the  worker  was  raised by  11  per  cent;  the

industrial workers' wages rose from 65 cents  to  74

cents in one year - an increase of 9 cents - and in  the

whole  of the six years since 1955, it has increased

by  6  cents. That year compared to last year was  a

year  of  turmoil,  and last  year  was  a  year  of

comparative peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill refers to the strike in

the  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation which seems

to  touch his heart rather closely. Sir, of all  the

strikes  I  have heard of, that would be hardly  the

one I would consider compelling the worker to go  to

arbitration. May I remind the hon. Member that  when

I  pleaded with him, as the Minister for Labour,  to

introduce  provisions  for  arbitration,  he   said,

"Marshall,  not now. The workers do not like  to  be

forced  into arbitration. It is much better to  have

voluntary    negotiations."   There    is    nothing

confidential about that. That was the advice of  one

Minister to his Chief Minister who was very  much  a

tyro   in  these  matters.  The  Minister  was   the

experienced  labour man and it was  advice  which  I

found  to be good - and, frankly, Sir,I believe still

is  good - that compulsion in the field of  industrial

relations is by and large unwise. Although I  cannot

but  agree that it is, I hope that greater advantage

will be taken of arbitration proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do move the amendment that stands in my name in

order to bring a sense of balance to this debate, to

recognise  that there is industrial unrest - but  this

is   natural  and  healthy - to  recognise  that  that

Government  should do something but that  it  cannot

take  the  entire  burden to  seek  to  repress  all

strikes; and because Mr Tan Chin Tuan does not like

an O.C.B.C. strike, therefore, the Government should

intervene, is really an unbalanced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



approach to an extremely important problem.

What  I  am  particularly disturbed  about  is  that

Government,  I understand, has issued  orders  which

have  encouraged a small section of the trade  union

movement  to  indulge  in excesses,  orders  to  the

police  not  to take action in respect  of  criminal

offences  without reference to a Labour  officer.  I

say  that  the  Government has acted  in  a  grossly

improper fashion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member wishes his

amendment  to go on, he must end his speech - this  is

near the moment of interruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines 1 and 2, to leave out "views with
