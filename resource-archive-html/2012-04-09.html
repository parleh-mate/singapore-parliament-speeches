Singapore is a signatory to the World Trade Organization's Agreement
on Government Procurement or GPA. Our obligations both under the
GPA and our Free Trade Agreements require that local and foreign
suppliers be given equal opportunity to participate in Government
tenders. The Government's procurement rules are aligned with Singapore's
international obligations. All Ministries, Organs of State and Statutory
Boards are required to adhere to them.</p>

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for the reply.
I would like to ask the Minister of State how would the Government procurement
guidelines provide a level playing field for all types of businesses,
whether foreign or local, and among the local companies, SMEs versus
Government-linked companies. And how does the Government assess
or allow tenders by smaller enterprises which may not have the strong
financial background but have the requisite track records and capabilities?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
the Government's procurement regime is an open one that places emphasis
on fairness, transparency and value-for-money. It is also important
to note that, wherever possible, Ministry of Finance encourages
the use of outcome-based specifications in Government tenders. This
allows bidders to put in their best proposals regardless of their
own size or track record. The other aspect that is important is
that bids are evaluated holistically based on their abilities to
meet the requirements and objectives of the tender. For example,
the total life-cycle cost is considered instead of just price alone.
Award of contracts is on the basis of the best value-for-money offer.
Specifically, to address Mr Baey's concern of whether the playing field
is level for companies that are smaller in size, I am pleased to
share with him that if we looked at the tenders that the Government
has awarded, about 20% of them go to businesses with net tangible
assets of less than $250,000. These would typically be small and
medium enterprises. If we were to consider the contracts where the
tender value is $100,000 or below, two in three of those contracts
typically go to the small and medium enterprises with net tangible
assets of $250,000 or lower. The evidence does suggest that our
procurement regime is supportive of a whole range of enterprises,
regardless of their size.</p>

                  <a name="id-168c9154-5c46-4602-b62e-14d8eb5ad27d__id-c79c2d6f-a2ea-4d60-b70f-f4ed87448a50"><!--a--></a>We also recognise that there
may be occasions where the tender value is quite large. Smaller
suppliers may need to enter into joint collaborations or consortia
in order to compete for those projects fairly. The way to deal with
that is to share pertinent information on public sector pipeline
projects in advance, so that the suppliers have better visibility
and to team up with potential partners. For example, IDA in their
annual briefing to the infocomm industry will let suppliers know
in advance of the kind of projects that they are looking to put
out for businesses to tender for.</p>

also pushes alerts on business opportunities to suppliers via the
GeBIZ system. There is one component called "Really Simple Syndication" (RSS). This
is specifically designed to allow even smaller enterprises to access
opportunities. When projects are published on RSS, email alerts
on SPRING's Enterprise One Portal, which links to SMEs' database,
are also made available. That is what we have been doing.</p>

Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether these
same guidelines apply to statutory boards and Government-owned companies
where Government owns a significant shareholding. I ask this because
not so long ago, I read in the newspapers that Changi Airport Group
in the design of the new Terminal 4, that local architect firms
were excluded, and that caused a ruckus within their industry. I
know there was a subsequent clarification but I wanted to hear the
Ministry's response to this and, specifically, whether these guidelines
also apply to statutory boards and Government-owned companies.</p>

I thank Mr Seah for his question. These guidelines apply to all
Ministries, statutory boards and Organs of State. As for companies,
they operate on commercial principles and it is up to them to decide
on what basis their procurement is best proceeded with. In the case
of the Changi Airport Group, I think they have made a very clear
statement that where Terminal 4 is concerned, all local as well as
foreign architects are welcome to participate. I think there is
no need for us to speculate further. They have made their intentions
very clear and in actual fact, in terms of implementation, all architects
have been invited to submit their proposals.</p>

I should just clarify. I did not say that there were any specific

Sir, under the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP), it takes about six
months to overhaul ”€ Ms Foo used the word "upgrade" ”€ an existing
lift; and about 16 months to build a new lift shaft with a new lift
in it. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7b594872-e026-4822-af7f-0cace7cef623">

in an existing shaft, it is a relatively simple job. The replacement
of lift cable, motor, lift car and control systems, etc, can be
done rather quietly
and speedily. Even including testing and commissioning, most of
the overhauling can be completed within six months.</p>

in their lift shafts, the work is more complicated. Firstly, HDB's
appointed contractors would need to work with other agencies to
detect and divert underground services such as telecoms, power supply,
water and sewage pipelines as necessary. This phase alone could
take up to four months. Secondly, the appointed contractors would
commence the construction work proper starting with micro-piling,
and then lift and lift shaft installation, lift testing and commissioning.
This phase will take about a year. </p>

a precinct, HDB will ensure that the residents will continue to
have access to their lifts. This is why HDB would construct the
new lifts first before proceeding to overhaul the existing lifts.
Taken together, for each block on the ground under LUP, the duration
of the upgrading programme could take about two years. </p>

to the residents, HDB has taken active steps to shorten the time
needed for onsite construction work. For example, HDB cut the time
needed for construction by two months when it introduced the use
of steel lift shafts in 2007. Steel lift shafts are pre-fabricated
and can be assembled on site more quickly than concrete lift shafts.
More recently, HDB achieved a further two-month reduction, from
six months to four months, in the service diversion phase of LUP
works, by streamlining the process involving multiple agencies.</p>

at ways to expedite LUP works without compromising quality and safety,
bearing in mind that the works are often carried out within a tight
site area and in close proximity to residents. In some situations,
HDB will also need to phase out the work, so that residents can
continue to enjoy the same level of lift service while LUP works
are ongoing, and to minimise noise and dust to residents.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I would
like to ask two supplementary questions relating to comments made
by my residents undergoing LUP at Pandan Gardens. Many of the residents
ask me how come it takes two years to upgrade a block when we can
build condominiums in the same time. The crux of the issue is about
how work is being phased. According to my own observations in the
estate, the work being done in upgrading the lifts in the precinct –
let us say the eight blocks involved – basically the work is done
in batches. They start digging in one block, they finish and they
go to the next block, and they go one round before they come back
to the first block to do the next step. If it is done like that,
it would take a long time, probably two years, end-to-end for the
whole project. My question to the Minister of State is whether HDB
can consider the work being compressed so that works can start on
one block, complete the works there before proceeding to the next block,
so that inconvenience to residents is minimised. I would also like
to ask a question on pre-fabrication. The Minister of State talked
about pre-fabrication being used for the lift steel shafts. What
other opportunities are there for HDB to explore so that a lot more work
can be completed offsite?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
I thank Ms Foo for her questions and her observations. Indeed, I
sympathise with some of these observations that Members have gathered
from the local execution of the LUP projects. I, myself, have some
LUP works ongoing in my constituency,
and I get very similar feedback from residents. Compared to a condominium
or new flats built on a greenfield site, the LUP work has to be constrained
by existing tight site and hours of construction and to minimise inconveniences
and noise pollution to the residents. The Member made the observation about
whether we could − instead of treating the whole precinct as one
site – carry out work block to block. HDB is studying this approach.
The reason why it is currently done this way has to do with the
contract that is given. Contractors would typically hire a team of
specialists doing certain functions, and they would go from one
block to another block sequentially. If not well managed locally,
these sequential activities can add up in terms of total duration.</p>

HDB is making use of prefab technology as far as possible. I am
hopeful that HDB will continue to make improvements by better onsite
house-keeping and project management to make sure that activities
are more tightly integrated on the ground, and where feasible to
complete work in one block before moving to another block.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, two supplementary questions. First, what is the
progress of LUP? How many more blocks are in balance, still awaiting LUP?
Secondly, the question is whether HDB is on track to meet the Government's
target to complete the LUP so that all eligible HDB blocks will
have lift access on every floor.</p>

short answer is "yes". HDB is on track to complete the LUP programme
for all the eligible blocks. In fact, 5,000 HDB blocks have been
selected for LUP and polling has been completed for about 95% for
these blocks. LUP has been completed for 65%. There is a time lag
between polling and completion. The rest is being completed.</p>

Sir, may I ask the Minister of State whether the Ministry can consider
reducing the overall testing and commissioning period without compromising
safety of the lifts. Normally, for LUP, the same batch of lifts
is actually provided by one company. So, it is possible to stagger
or do simultaneous testing and commissioning of the lifts to reduce
the overall period.</p>

Hng Kiang)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2005, the Government
decided to divest JTC's generic multi-storey, multiple-user factory
space, or what is commonly known as flatted factory space. As explained
in my speech during the Committee of Supply debate last month, there
was already a competitive market for flatted factory space in the
private sector. JTC's market share then was only 18%. </p>

lower rentals than others. This created an unlevel playing field
for other SMEs that were not JTC's tenants. Furthermore, JTC's lower rentals
were undercutting private sector developers. If JTC had continued
to remain in this segment of the market, it would crowd out the
smaller developers. The divestment was therefore necessary to, first,
level the playing field for all SMEs and, second, to promote the
vibrancy of this segment of the industrial market. </p>

factories has affected only a small proportion of SMEs because JTC's
market share, as I mentioned just now, was only 18%. To ameliorate
the impact of the divestment on the affected SMEs, JTC worked with
the buyers to impose rental caps, for a period of up to three years.
SMEs affected by the first phase of divestment in 2008 paid, on
average, 6% to 25% less than market rates when they renewed their
tenancies in the first three years after divestment. </p>

earlier three years. </p>

space affordable. First, JTC continues to develop innovative infrastructure
projects, some of which help reduce business costs for SMEs through
innovative designs or the up-front provision of capital-intensive
facilities that can be co-shared. Examples of such projects include
the Business Aviation Complex and the upcoming MedTech Hub and Surface
Finishing Complex. </p>

is a sufficient supply of industrial land to meet SMEs' demand for
industrial space. Through the Industrial Government Land Sales (IGLS) programme,
about 20 hectares of land was released every half year in 2010 and
2011. This is about 30% higher than in 2008 and 2009. In the first
half of 2012, an even larger amount of land – 24 hectares in total
– has been made available through the IGLS programme. For this IGLS
programme, we also released several small sites with shorter tenure,
to satisfy the demand of industrialists, including SMEs, who require
customised facilities and thus prefer to build factory space on
their own. With shorter tenure, the sites will also be more affordable.</p>

of space, we have also shortened the project completion period for
IGLS sites, from eight years to between five and seven years.</p>

that our industrial space remains affordable. Industrial rentals
have, in fact, moderated recently on the back of incoming supply
and weakening demand. Industrial rentals grew by only 0.4% between
3Q2011 and 4Q2011, compared to 5% for the same quarters of the previous
year. We expect rentals to continue to moderate as more supply comes
on-stream, and with the weaker economic climate. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, Singapore's monetary policy is centred on managing the exchange
rate of the Singapore dollar. This makes sense given the small and
open nature of our economy. Our exports and imports of goods and
services are nearly four times as large as our GDP. The exchange
rate therefore has a significant influence on domestic prices, and
plays an important role in determining economic activity. While
MAS does not have a formal inflation target, the MAS Act clearly
states that MAS' objective is to maintain price stability for sustained
economic growth over the medium term.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b5283d0b-7a84-4e0b-ad6d-6dbaa13b36c7">

and imported inflation. We keep close watch on consumer price developments
from both sources. First, imported inflation from abroad. The prices
of goods we import from other countries, for instance, food and
oil, can change significantly due to events beyond our control,
such as poor harvests, natural disasters, or geopolitical tensions.
Second, there are domestic sources of inflation stemming from changes
in the cost of factor inputs. For example, when the cost of hiring
a worker goes up, businesses may charge higher prices for goods
and services to maintain their profit margins. </p>

helps to cap both imported as well as domestic inflation. As the
majority of products we consume and use in production are imported
from overseas, a stronger exchange rate will reduce the Singapore
dollar cost of these imported goods for both consumers and producers.
Moreover, a stronger Singapore dollar will help to moderate domestic
inflation by dampening the external demand for our goods and services,
in turn lowering the demand for domestic resources, such as labour
and land. As a result, rentals and wages would rise more modestly,
reducing Singaporeans' demand for goods and services. This is similar
to how interest rates impact domestic prices in larger economies.</p>

Singaporeans have also been concerned about asset prices. The increase
in asset prices is due to strong demand and tight supply of completed
units. The low domestic interest rates, which follow global rates
because of our open financial system, have also partly supported
the demand. We have implemented fiscal and prudential measures to
cool the property market. Where supply constraints can be ameliorated
to relieve cost pressures in the housing, commercial and industrial
property segments, we have also done so directly.</p>

is partnering Singapore workers and companies to raise productivity.
Firms are in a challenging environment, where foreign worker levy
and other costs are impacting their bottom line in the short term.
Higher productivity allows firms to pay higher wages while remaining
profitable without relying on large price increases. There are already
several schemes for firms investing in machines that enhance productivity
and innovation as well as to encourage further training and up-skilling
of our workers. </p>

provides cash grants directly to help mitigate the impact of rising
costs on households. For example, the "Grow &amp; Share" package
and the U-Save rebates. Last year alone, resident households living
in HDB 3-room flats received Government transfers worth more than
$2,000 per person on average. This amounts to around 10% of household
income per household member. For resident households living in HDB
4-room flats, the transfer was around 7% of their average household income
per household member. Although these grants do not reduce inflation,
they help to offset the higher cost of living that our households
experienced.</p>

rate now catching up with the GDP growth numbers, at some point,
are we worried that the inflation rate will take to overtake our
growth numbers? I cite today's <em class="ph i">Business Times</em> report, headlined
"All eyes on Sing$ as price pressure rises. Stubborn inflation and
expectations of rising prices can feed into jobs and wages". This is
clearly a concern. The second is, yes, I agree a strong Sing dollar
helps with an open economy like ours to mitigate imported inflation.
However, I do wish to comment that a strong Sing dollar policy may
necessarily mean that our forward rates will also remain low. A
low forward rate may lead to a rise in money supply which could
also lead to asset inflation, which the Minister rightly pointed
out. Those two are potential concerns that I want to raise now.</p>

the Member for stating the complex challenge that MAS faces. It
is obviously true that the inflation rate has been more persistent.
We have been stuck with headline inflation at just below 5% for
quite a long time. And MAS' core inflation has also been stuck at
3% for a long time. This is something which MAS is very concerned
about. As Members know, the monetary policy statement will be issued
this Friday. So these are some of the factors that MAS will take
into consideration. The other point about the very liquid international
situation which partly causes the asset inflation that we face is
with us for some time to come. And this is also part of a very complex environment
that MAS has to deal with in managing its monetary policy.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, from 2007–2011, I understand that the operator
SBS Transit spent about $16 million on preventive maintenance for
the rail tracks, the tunnels and Overhead Catenary System (OCS)
of the North East Line (NEL). Please note that this amount is only
for these three areas and is therefore a fraction of the total maintenance
cost that is spent on the NEL. The operator also currently has an
in-house team of about 470 maintenance staff dedicated to the maintenance
of the line. </p>

of the tracks, tunnels and OCS, and carries out preventive maintenance
in accordance with approved maintenance plans. Some of the measures
that are taken include the monthly deployment of a specialised engineering vehicle
known as a Multi-Function Vehicle (MFV) to help detect track faults
for corrective maintenance. Six-monthly tunnel inspections are also
conducted to check for cracks and leaks. Detailed inspections on
the OCS are carried out every three months, as well as yearly, to
ensure that it is well-maintained. Necessary measures are taken
to deal with any defects that are detected during these checks. </p>

together with the operators. The LTA works with them on three areas.
One is to define the Operating Performance Standards and to ensure
that these standards are met. For example, the availability of the
fleet, adherence to schedules, frequency of breakdowns, severity
of breakdowns – those will come under the Operating Performing Standards.
The LTA also reviews the two-yearly maintenance plans as well as
audits the safety management system. These are key areas that LTA would
work with both operators on. </p>

the way I would look at it is that we would try and minimise as
much as possible the major disruptions and keep them in check. But
I think it is unavoidable that a system that is as heavily utilised

are about 2.7 million passenger trips. They are running thousands
of train trips for more than 18 hours a day and I dare say that
there is no way you can prevent disruptions from occurring. What
you try to do is that you minimise the major disruptions and if
they do take place, you then have an incident management plan in
place that will then try to ameliorate the effects on commuters. </p>

good question, Mr Speaker, and I thank Mr Cedric Foo for raising
that. As systems age, it is important that we do not hold to the
same maintenance regime that we have been using in the past when
the systems were newer. Hence, there is a need to holistically relook
what we do with regard to maintaining the older lines. I have asked
LTA in particular to pay attention to looking at, for example, together
with the operators, the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of particularly critical
components, as well as to put in place an On-Condition Monitoring
regime where you are able to detect, for example, whether there
are trains that are experiencing problems because of wheel flats
that are especially noisy because the wheels need to be re-profiled.
On-Condition Monitoring (OCM) will give you a better idea of how
to prioritise some of the maintenance efforts that you will need
on particular aspects, whether of the tracks or the trains. </p>

or minor disruption,

                  </span>: I think the
way we will look at the major disruption is one that is more than
30 minutes in duration. Of course, major disruptions may impact
thousands of commuters or fewer. So, for example, the NEL incident
that was raised by Mr Dhinakaran impacted about 90,000 people. The
service between Dhoby Ghaut and Harbourfront was shut down for about
10 hours because of a fault somewhere between Outram and Harbourfront.
Yesterday, there was a disruption along the East-West line that
affected about 500 people. This was slightly more than half an hour.
Yes, every disruption, I know, causes inconvenience to commuters
but I think it is also important to recognise that given the very
heavy utilisation of the public transport system network, there
will be disruptions. If you take it as a percentage of the trips
that I mentioned earlier, 2.7 million passenger trips on average
every day, then 500 passenger trips would be about 0.02%. So, yes,
I know the 500 people were impacted, their trips were disrupted.
But I think if you look at it as a whole, we have to recognise that
there are going to be some disruptions, there are going to be some
defects that we will encounter from time to time. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, the Malaysian media earlier reported that Malaysia is looking
at the option of charging tolls only on Singapore-registered cars
to recover the costs of constructing the new Eastern Dispersal Link
(EDL), with tolls to be imposed – not at the EDL itself, but at
the Causeway, regardless of whether the Singapore-registered cars
actually use the EDL or not. Other media reports have indicated
that the Malaysian government has opted to impose a levy on foreign
vehicles instead of a toll, so as to avoid having to charge Malaysian
vehicles, while arguing that Singapore has similarly imposed Vehicle
Entry Permit (VEP) fees on foreign cars. I appreciate that several
Members are concerned by such news for Singaporeans, especially
those who need to travel across the Causeway frequently for work
or other activities.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4e4e1483-55d0-48fb-a7c3-f4f46d6a84eb">

government. They are aware of the public reactions so far, and they
have informed us that no decision has yet been taken on the various
proposals to charge tolls or levies for the EDL. They are still
exploring their options.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-394643a4-fa6f-4d03-a9e8-b84336629e11">

that we peg our tolls to match those set by Malaysia. This should
apply to all vehicles using the Causeway or the Second Link, regardless
of whether they are Singapore-registered or foreign-registered.
Depending on the eventual details of Malaysia's proposal, we will
then see how best we should apply this matching principle. </p>

(VEP) scheme, fees are imposed on foreign cars and motorcycles entering
Singapore in order to equalise their ownership costs with the higher
levels paid by Singapore-registered cars and motorcycles. This policy
does not discriminate against foreign vehicles' usage of our roads,
which would, in itself, be unfair. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, we will be partnering the public bus operators – SBS Transit
and SMRT buses – to roll out the Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP).
This will significantly improve current bus service levels over
the coming years. With the addition of 550 buses that will be funded
by the Government under the BSEP, and another about 250 buses that
the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) themselves will add at their
cost, we expect to progressively increase the public bus fleet by
about 800 buses over the next five years. This will require the
two public bus operators to recruit a total of approximately 1,600
more bus drivers, because it takes an average of about two drivers
to operate a bus throughout the day.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-be9ef8d5-222a-4477-a219-87b6eafee536">

in the overall manpower requirement facing the public bus industry.
The public bus operators will also have to compete with other companies that
similarly have to target locals in the face of a reduction in the
intake of foreign labour. Nonetheless, how the public bus operators
intend to improve their wages and employment terms to attract and
retain sufficient bus drivers are ultimately matters for the PTOs
to decide as the Government will not micro-manage such matters.
However, this is clearly a top priority for both bus operators,
and I understand that they are currently in talks with the unions
on this matter. </p>

operators, there is also a limit to how much the Government can
and should intervene in the labour market for the wider private
bus industry. In particular, bus driver salaries for this sector
should remain market-driven, and private bus operators should make
their own commercial decisions on how to ensure that their businesses
remain viable in the face of a tightening labour market.</p>

experience working with the PSA. During the peak season, where they
need to move containers from, let us say, Tanjong Pagar to Pasir
Panjang, they talk to the operators like us, to use our ships to
ferry the containers. Would the Ministry consider, working with
the private bus operators with their existing fleet and their bus
drivers, to supplement the public transport during the morning and
evening peak hours, without having
to put more buses on the roads and having to fight for the limited
number of bus drivers?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, let me thank Mr Teo for that very interesting supplementary
question. Indeed, this is something that the LTA is exploring. Not something
that is so easy to implement because the private operators we know
are also trying to maximise the utilisation of their fleet as much
as possible. Whether for workers using private buses, or for the
general public commuting on the public buses, the peak hours are
roughly about the same. So, therefore, the demand for buses, regardless
of whether they are from the private industry or from the public
bus companies, generally will tend to peak around the same period.
Nonetheless, this is something that LTA is trying to explore together
with the private bus companies, to see if indeed there is some room
to do as the Member has suggested.</p>

I thank the Minister for his clarification. My question relates
to foreign bus drivers because I am quite certain the significant
number of this increase will include foreign bus drivers. Just last
week, we had a bus accident involving a foreign bus driver. I would
like to ask the Minister, in light of this, what are the measures

safety of other road users or pedestrians.</p>

Zaqy for that supplementary question. Indeed, we are all saddened
by that incident that happened in Sengkang last week. Regardless
of whether it is a local driver or a foreign driver, I think it
is something that we want very much to avoid as much as possible.
In terms of the composition of the nationality of the drivers in
the public bus sector, about 61% are locals, meaning Singaporeans
and PRs; about 26% are Malaysians; and about 12%-13% are from PRC.
Taken across the two companies, because they are given the ratio
of within 10% but across the entire workforce, they are within those
limits. MOM is very stringent on the quotas that they allow for
all the different sectors. We know that and, in fact, it is something
that is keenly felt not just by the bus sector but across the service
sector as well as the other sectors. The more important thing actually
is to make sure that regardless of nationality, every driver is
adequately trained, appropriately qualified, and especially if they
come from abroad, they are given the kind of orientation that will
help them familiarise themselves with the peculiarities of the system
here in Singapore,.</p>

train the drivers in terms of equipping them with the skills but
preparing them for life in Singapore, which may be very different
from what they are accustomed to in the past. And, hence, part of
the training programme is to make sure that we infuse in them the
responsibility that they carry when they drive a vehicle like a
bus, and to make sure that they pay stringent attention to road
conditions and that they operate their vehicles in as safe a manner
as possible.</p>

where we deploy most of the fleet, are when we use the drivers at
the heaviest, that is, the morning peak as well as the evening peak.
In between, some of the drivers will then get to rest in the interchanges
and use the facilities. I believe that the ratio of about two drivers
to one bus has been something that we have used over an extended
period of time. So, I do believe that it is something that is adequate.
It is just to make sure that we continue to emphasise safety, continue
to ensure that as much as possible, the drivers are properly trained,
properly equipped with the skill sets, as well as be very familiar
with the routes and the road conditions when they are driving.</p>

their education in the same school on the "O" level track, or in
another school or institution. The remaining students withdrew from
the IP primarily because they were relocated overseas. </p>

I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her answer. I have
three supplementary questions: (1) what is the Ministry's assessment
of the effectiveness of the IP programme in terms of achieving its
intended outcomes; (2)
moving forward, how does MOE ensure that the different IP programmes across
the different schools are of comparable standards?; and (3) will
MOE be conducting a major review of the IP programme to ensure that
the attrition rate will be even lower than what has been shared
with us?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Sim Ann</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I thank Mr
Zainal Sapari for his supplementary questions. First, he asked whether
the IPs have achieved their intended outcomes. Having the IP as
one pathway alongside the "O" level pathway widens choice for our
students and allows them to match teaching and learning to their
own individual styles, specifically students who enrol in the IP
track will undergo a style of teaching that is more suitable for
self-directed as well as independent learning, whereas for students
who need a more structured approach, the "O" level track would be
more appropriate. So, in terms of offering this choice to students
and parents, we believe that the programme has achieved that outcome.
There are also some positive outcomes that have been observed of
students who have completed their programme. For instance, they
have been observed to be more vocal, more expressive and independent
in learning, stronger service to the community because IP students
do serve more CIP hours, and also the ability to move between collaborative
as well as independent learning styles. All in all, we feel that
having this variety of learning pathways will enrich the holistic
development of our students.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3f734b18-288f-496a-9265-3884588a371f">

to know how the MOE will ensure that the different IPs will adhere
to standards. This is something which the MOE works constantly with
all our IP schools on, and there are also measures in place to help
students who find continuing in the IP a bit of a challenge. For
instance, there are support programmes to help the weaker students
cope with the demands of IP. The support given to these students
includes tailoring the instructional and assessment methods or providing additional
guidance to cater to these students. There is also regular communication
with parents of these students to help keep them abreast of their
children's progress and allow them to also provide additional socio-emotional
support, where necessary.</p>

asked whether there will be a major review of the IP. Sir, along
with all other educational programmes that our schools offer, we
will constantly review and monitor the progress and development
of all of these schemes and tracks.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I think the
IP is a matter of considerable interest amongst students and parents.
But we would like to highlight what is important here is that the
IP is one track that is offered alongside the "O" level track, and
both tracks, we feel, are equally valid. In fact, the majority of
our students are on the "O" level track. So, I think the "O" level
track retains great relevance for education. What is important is
for students as well as their parents to recognise which style of
learning suits the individual student best. Is it one that is more
self-directed or independent, or would it be one that is more structured?
And this is something which goes a long way towards determining
the success of the student in either programme.</p>

Sir, children who are deemed exceptionally gifted have to meet a
set of stringent criteria, which are based on international best
practice. These include a psychological report, achievement and aptitude
(typically manifested in terms of above-level test scores; in other
words, test scores which are well above those of children of the
same age), samples of the child's work, and teachers' recommendations.
In addition, to determine the social emotional readiness of the
child, data from interviews with the parents, and classroom observations
will be taken into consideration. </p>

typically observe that a child could exhibit exceptional giftedness.
The identification is confirmed after specialists have assessed
the child on a variety of criteria, as mentioned above. To support
the exceptionally gifted child, officers in MOE work with the school
and parents to draw up a learning plan for the child.</p>

                  </span>: I thank
the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. I have two supplementary
questions. One, there are some highly gifted students who are sometimes twice exceptional.
They are exceptionally gifted, but they may also present exceptional
behavioural issues that may lead them to be diagnosed as having
special needs. How does MOE handle cases such as these? For example,
whether the teachers are equipped to handle such students and if
the teachers will feel that they are disrupting the classes, be
it whether they are in mainstream or "gifted schools".</p>

tertiary institutions in partnering MOE to help those who are exceptionally
gifted, as some of these children may be so gifted that they can handle
university curriculum even at the upper primary level? Do our tertiary
institutions take in young students way before the university age,
or do such students have to go overseas for their education if they
cannot find anything that could be customised to their needs?</p>

                  </span>: I thank Mr Yee
Jenn Jong for his supplementary questions. First, he asked about
students who may both be exceptionally gifted and yet at the same
time exhibit some special needs. Sir, when we are talking about
exceptionally gifted students, we are really speaking about a very
small group. If these students also have special needs, the first
thing to determine is whether or not the special needs of this particular student
will allow him or her to undergo education in a mainstream setting.
If the special needs are such that the student cannot be adequately
cared for or looked after in a mainstream setting, then special
provisions will have to be made. So, it really depends on the nature
of the special needs that the student may have. </p>

are our tertiary institutions in accepting or taking in students
who are identified to be exceptionally gifted. I am glad to inform
Mr Yee that MOE headquarters does work quite closely with our tertiary
institutions and universities when it comes to progressing these
very few students who have been identified as being exceptionally
gifted, and the universities work with us in determining whether
or not the student is ready to enter the university, even though
at a younger age.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>

clarifications. Firstly, at what age is the youngest that our universities
would allow the exceptionally gifted students to be enrolled? Secondly,
of the 20 or so that have been identified in the last 10 years,
how many of them actually stayed in Singapore and how many of them
had to go overseas for their education?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, when we are
talking about exceptionally gifted students, we are really talking
about very small numbers, each of whom may have very unique circumstances.
So, I do not think that there is a hard number or an age below which
our universities would not consider. This would depend on many factors.
It goes beyond the intellectual ability of the student but also
in terms of his or her social-emotional readiness and their readiness
to be in a learning setting – a question of which learning setting
would suit the individual best. </p>

that Mr Yee has raised, whether there have been any exceptionally
gifted students who have had to go overseas. Sir, I have mentioned just
now that fewer than 20 students have been identified since 2000
as being exceptionally gifted and, out of these fewer than 20 students,
one is known to have gone overseas to pursue his university education.
The rest remains in Singapore. They are at various ages and they
are still going through our education system. They are still in
the schools and, as I have mentioned, the oldest one is already
enrolled in a local university.</p>

Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer.
We know that students mature at different rates and there are some
bright students who peak a little later after Primary 3. Will the
Ministry consider allowing such students to join the GEP in Primary
4 or Primary 5? In addition, GEP students are taught quite differently
from non-GEP students, and the GEP curriculum focuses more on higher
order thinking and problem-solving skills. But increasingly, we hear
parents and students lament that PSLE questions are getting trickier,
and seem to favour GEP students. My question is: will this disadvantage
non-GEP students who are taking the same PSLE examination as GEP
students?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, Dr Intan
has asked two supplementary questions. I will take the second one
first. She asked whether undergoing the GEP programme would give
an edge, an advantage to students at the PSLE. Sir, GEP students
do, in fact, do very well at PSLE on the whole. Why is that so?
The GEP draws from the top 1% to 2% of each Primary 3 cohort. These
would be students who, at that age, already exhibit rather strong
academic abilities. This would be then reflected in their PSLE performance. However,
Sir, the GEP itself is not a programme that is intended to prepare
children for exceptional performance at the PSLE. Its goals are
to develop intellectual depth, higher level thinking and also to
nurture productive creativity, amongst others, whereas the PSLE
itself is a national examination that is based on the Primary school
syllabus which all students undergo. So, I hope this addresses Dr
Intan's concerns that there may be any one group that is given an
advantage over others. This is not so. </p>

accepting them into the GEP at Primary 4 or 5, I thank Dr Intan

students against the need to ensure minimal disruption to their

HDB has a proactive programme to help families in rental arrears.

Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I have four supplementary
questions for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. Firstly, I would
like him to clarify what are the trigger points at which the notice
to quit will be issued to the tenant, that is, how many months of
arrears typically before the notice to quit is issued? Secondly,
if nothing is heard from the tenant, am I right that there are actually
no checks done at the premises itself to determine whether the resident
has any particular hardship before the notice to quit is sent? I
have come across cases where there is a job change, for example,
the tenant has lost his job but the notice to quit has still come
despite that and apparently no questions were asked of the tenant
prior to that. Thirdly, I have noticed also that when tenants request
for reduction of rental in the midst of the tenancy agreement, this
is usually turned down. So, is it the HDB's default position that
there will be no change in the rental amount in the middle of the
agreement, or are there any circumstances under which the rental
fee could be changed in the midst of the tenancy agreement? Last
of all, after the notice to quit is issued, of course, there is
a period of time for the tenant to attempt to remedy the situation.
But just prior to the eviction, I would like to ask whether there
is any attempt made to check whether there is really a hardship
case that has somehow slipped through the cracks or failed the attention
of the authorities.</p>

Sir, I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for the supplementary questions. First,
I would like to assure Ms Lim and Members of the House that HDB
is very sensitive to the needs of families in rental flats. On the
trigger point for notices to quit (NTQs), firstly, usually HDB will
send reminder letters to tenants who have not been paying their
rent, after the first month and the second month, reminder letters,
as in any other agencies. The NTQ is issued if the tenant has not
responded after the third month of arrears. What happens usually
is that in the reminder letters, we encourage the tenants to come
to the Branch Office to talk to the HDB officers for us to understand
their circumstances better. If they do not turn up, HDB officers
do visit the families to understand the situation better. Sometimes,
the Member is right, it is an issue of them losing their jobs, temporarily
being affected by inadequate finances within their households.</p>

HDB will work very closely with CDCs. They will refer the families
to CDCs for the Work Support Programme. In the Work Support Programme,
the families are then assessed as to how they can be assisted which
includes, at some points, rental vouchers that the CDCs may offer
to the families.</p>

of rental fees during the mid-point of their tenancy periods – often
times, we do not change the tenancy fees midway because the financial situation
of the families may vary across time. The tenancy agreement is for
two years. We review tenancy agreements for two years because we
want to encourage families to do better. And some families do actually
do better because a large proportion of our rental flat tenants
are first-timers who have the potential to own flats subsequently.
We do not want them to be entrenched in their rental flats. Within
that two-year period, if they do improve, we will try to get them
to move on to purchased flats. Sir, because of that, we do not change
the rental rates in the middle of the tenancy agreement. We try to
help them with the Work Support Programmes with the CDCs so that
they can try to get back to where they were. During the renewal
of the tenancy, we look at whether they are able to move on to purchased
flats or at some points where their income situation has improved,
it is fair to raise the rental a little bit to be fair to the other
rental tenants. More
importantly is that we will assess the case individually to understand
that if they do need help, help will always be available.</p>

although the notice to quit is issued at the point of the third
month, I can assure Ms Lim and Members of the House that many, many
months afterwards, HDB continues to work with the families. HDB
continues to help the families. We do not usually take any further
action until nine months or even several years after the family
is in arrears. Since 2003, only three cases have been evicted because
we tried very, very hard to make sure that the circumstances of
the families are well understood and the families are given the
necessary assistance.</p>

comes to rental arrears, it is more than just a housing issue. It
is really a social issue that sometimes families are trapped with.

Sir, I have one supplementary question regarding the NSAs who went
from funding to zero from 2011 to 2012. Was there any possibly more
direct warning to the employment of their staff? Because, I understand, for
some of them, the funding for their staff – and some of the staff
have been working with the NSAs for quite a long period of time
– were largely dependent on the funding from the Sports Council.
The funding amount was announced in the middle of March and took effect from
1 April. In fact, some of the staff was given less than three weeks' notice
and then they were basically out of a job. So, I think some explicit
notification for that would have helped even though the general
indication might be that they are not doing so well and they need
to buck up.</p>

has been in communications with the three NSAs throughout the entire

this to their respective staff nor have they prepared their staff

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Yee for the Question.
Our CPF helps to meet various needs, amongst which is to help provide
for our retirement needs as well as help us own the roof over our
heads. It is, therefore, important that the CPF savings used for
property are carefully spent. The Valuation Limit (VL) is a mechanism
that helps us to ensure this. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-427a798c-6ca2-4265-b345-bede1242b5ef">

used for property to the purchase price or value of the property
at the time of purchase, whichever is lower. The intent really is
to discourage the use of CPF savings to pay for property for which
the price exceeds fair value. It also encourages members to be prudent
in their property purchase and to take up a housing loan that is
within their means, since once the VL is reached, they can no longer
service their monthly instalments using CPF savings and have to
use cash instead. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-327c6ee5-8c86-48ef-b7f9-ff23c586789f">

more than the VL for his monthly mortgage repayment, he would first
need to set aside the Minimum Sum Cash Component in his CPF account. This
cash component is currently half of the Minimum Sum. This requirement
ensures that a member at least has some level of cash savings available
for retirement before we allow more CPF savings to be used for housing. </p>

the number of members who can no longer use CPF savings to pay for
monthly instalments after reaching the VL is actually very small.
At any one time, we have almost 700,000 CPF members who are using
their CPF savings to finance their housing instalments. Of these,
fewer than half a percent are unable to use further CPF savings
for monthly instalments as they have reached the VL limit. </p>

that some members will find it difficult from time to time to continue
servicing their housing loans after they reach the VL. Therefore,
on a case-by-case
basis, CPF Board has allowed members some flexibility where the
case merits, for example, where giving such flexibility will help
them tide over a period of temporary hardship, or where the member
is in the midst of right-sizing his property to avoid defaults. </p>

is no Valuation Limit on the amount of CPF savings the low-income
earner can use when he buys a new HDB flat and when he takes up
a HDB loan to pay for the property. So, while we try to facilitate
home ownership and it is important, the VL also plays an important
role to balance and to ensure prudence in the use of CPF savings,
and strikes a balance between housing and retirement needs. We remind
CPF members to buy a home within their means, and to factor in the
VL in their plans for financing their home. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, the Retirement and Re-employment Act, which came into effect
on 1 January of this year requires employers to re-employ their
older workers from age 62 to 65. To enable these employees to continue
to be covered by group medical insurance schemes, we understand
that most major insurers have extended the coverage of employees
up to the age of 65 and beyond. Re-employed employees who have been
working for the same company over the years and have been covered
by the company's medical insurance schemes typically do not need
to be re-assessed as "new cases" for the purpose of insurance coverage
in this regard. If an insurance company does not extend the coverage
of the scheme up to the age of 65 and also requires re-employed
employees to be re-assessed, the employer should work with the insurance company
to address this issue so that the medical needs of these employees
can continue to be met. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d84916ba-6434-44a3-9719-9bac7262ea8d">

various briefing and outreach sessions has shown that companies
have already raised the coverage of their group medical insurance
schemes for their
employees to the age of 65, or beyond. In such cases, re-employed
workers would continue to enjoy medical benefits under their company's
medical insurance schemes. By so doing, they would avoid the risk
of being denied coverage for existing medical conditions that were
previously covered.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, polyclinics do not have a quota on the number of patients to
be seen each day. The official polyclinic consultation hours extend
from 8.00 am to 1.00 pm and then after that, 2.00 pm to 4.30 pm
on weekdays, and from 8.00 am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays. Registration
for patients may sometimes close before official consultation hours
to allow time for registered patients to be seen by the doctors.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5aa82ede-f727-4dd3-ba37-bd7b56dcb90f">
                  <a name="id-c874d788-96be-4284-8deb-7eacf29307d8__id-5aa82ede-f727-4dd3-ba37-bd7b56dcb90f"><!--a--></a>Notwithstanding, polyclinics
often operate beyond official opening hours and doctors have been
working very hard and trying their best to see their patients as
soon as possible. When the consultation time for patients waiting
in line is expected to go well beyond the operating hours, nurses
at the polyclinics will assess the severity of the patients' conditions.
Those with urgent conditions will be seen or given the necessary triage.
Those with non-urgent conditions may be advised to return the next
day, but if registered patients wish to wait, the doctor will still
see them even after the opening hours. Patients with critical conditions
may be referred to the nearest A&amp;E departments after triage.</p>

measures to better manage waiting times. For example, our polyclinics
have implemented self-registration for appointment-based services, such
as health screenings, immunisations and visits for chronic conditions.
With self-registration, patients can proceed directly to service
points without having to spend additional time queuing at the registration
areas. Notices of current estimated waiting time and patient volume
are also posted at the respective polyclinics and the Internet Queue
Watch page on our polyclinic websites, which would enable patients
to better manage their time. </p>

patients may wish to seek care at the GP clinics, including after
polyclinic opening hours. Most of these GP clinics operate extended hours,
including evenings and weekends. Currently, 460 GP clinics provide
subsidised care under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)
where eligible patients can receive similar subsidy as that received
at polyclinics. </p>

                     </span>: Yes,
of course. Water has always been of paramount importance for Singapore.
With the limited land for both water catchment and storage, Singapore
has been acutely aware of the need to provide a safe and reliable
supply of water for its people since independence. In the early
days, we faced and overcame drought, floods and water pollution
as the city grew. These challenges have inspired us to innovate
and develop capabilities in water, turning our weakness into strength. </p>

and sustainable water supply through the Four National Taps, namely,
the local catchments, imported water, NEWater and desalination.
We have also reduced our domestic water consumption over the past
decade from 165 litres per person per day down to 153 litres per
person per day through a multi-pronged approach which includes pricing,
mandatory requirements, and voluntary measures.</p>

today and receive clean, safe drinking water at any time of the
day, any day of the year. We often take this for granted, but behind
each tap lies an integrated system comprising over 7,000 km of drains,
17 reservoirs, water catchment
area which constitutes two-thirds of Singapore's total land area,
seven water treatment plants, 5,400 km of water mains, 3,400 km
of sewers, four water reclamation plants, and four NEWater factories.
I cited a lot of numbers to give Members an idea of the amount of
investment that has gone on over the past five decades.</p>

of meeting the water needs of our population and economy will be
even more complex. We have to protect the quality of local catchment water
in an increasingly urbanised Singapore. We have to build the buffers
to accommodate greater climate uncertainties. We have to manage
the cost of water against scenarios of even higher energy prices
in the future. And by the expiry of the remaining water agreement
in 2061, we have to be ready to be self-sufficient in water if no
new agreement is struck before that date. </p>

Marina, Punggol and Serangoon reservoirs, we now have 17 reservoirs.
In other words, two-thirds of Singapore has now become a water catchment
area. We intend to continue expanding the water catchment area to
cover more of the island. To enable this, we must keep our land,
waterways and reservoirs clean. Any pollution of the sources, the
pathways or the receptacles of water in any of our water catchment
area will make the water more difficult and costly to treat. As
such, a pre-emptive approach to controlling pollution is necessary.</p>

which specify the amount of silt discharges permitted, these can
only be enforced after the silt discharge has already taken place. The
proposed amendments to the Sewerage and Drainage Act take a pre-emptive approach
to controlling silt discharge. Adequate silt control measures must
be installed at worksites before any work takes place, and an order
may be issued to stop the work if the control measures are inadequate.
For effective deterrence, the penalties for offences related to
silt discharge will be raised to be commensurate with the cost of installing
adequate silt control measures.</p>

in place an extensive and effective used water management system
by expanding the national sewage system and by rehabilitating older
sections of our public sewers. There remain some sewage treatment
plants (STPs) in a few remote areas, some of which were built and
maintained by private owners. These STPs are small biological treatment
plants which treat used water before discharging it into the watercourses.
These areas will eventually be served by sewers, in tandem with
future land development plans. </p>

for public sewers, the used water system is funded through the Sanitary

on the amount of water supplied, regardless of location and the

Act will more properly reflect these charges as a tax contribution
to our national used water system, which is an essential part of
securing our national water supply. In this regard, past impositions
of the Waterborne Fee are also validated as impositions of a tax.
Speeches made in this House at the time when the Waterborne Fee
was introduced show the Government's intention had always been that
the Waterborne Fee was to be in the nature of a tax and this is
now being put beyond any doubt. </p>

                     </span>:
Sir, I wish to seek three clarifications on the Bill. In the Minister's
earlier Second Reading speech, he elaborated on how our water supply system
is going to become increasingly more sophisticated. And I am concerned
about clause 5 of the Bill regarding the water tariff. This introduces
some new provisions concerning the pricing of water which arouse
suspicions that water prices are going to rise. </p>

states that when the PUB is pricing water, it may take into consideration
"all costs incurred in enabling it to supply the water, including but not limited to collection
and purchase of water, storage, treatment of water and maintenance
and security of the water supply system." In the current Public
Utilities Act, the factors taken into account in pricing water are
not spelt out. However, I recall that in the recent Committee of
Supply debates for the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources,
the Minister has responded to the Member for Aljunied Mr Low Thia Khiang's
cut on Water Tariff by mentioning some of the items now in section
20(1A) as going into water pricing. </p>

is particularly worrying as it is stated to be "subject to section
14" of the Act, which in turn provides that the PUB must ensure
that its total revenues are sufficient to meet its total outgoings
as well as a reasonable proportion of the cost of developing the
Board's services. </p>

this amendment is meant to signal any change in the way water is
priced? More specifically, is the PUB intending to apportion more
of the cost-sharing to consumers? What assurances do Singaporeans
have that water will still be priced affordably in the future?</p>

maintenance of water service installation. Under section 45(2) of
the Act, a person responsible to maintain a water service installation
which has a master meter and cisterns is to engage a professional
engineer to inspect and maintain the system once in 60 months (or
five years). This is to ensure that such systems on residential,
commercial and industrial properties are fit and safe for use, and
free from contamination and leakage. </p>

of once in five years will now be removed, giving the PUB discretion
as to when to require the inspections. Though the explanatory note
says that this removal is to give flexibility to the PUB on the
frequency of inspections, what is the intention behind the amendment?
Will there be installations where inspections will now be carried
out less frequently, and would there be an increased risk to public health?</p>

other statutory boards and other persons to be engaged in implementing
duties under the Act. Under clause 4 of the Bill, the PUB will be
able to appoint and authorise officers and employees of "any other
statutory board" to be authorised officers, giving them duties and
powers under the Act. It can also appoint "any other person" to
perform duties or tasks under the Act. Under clause 21, new sections
55A and 55B give authorised officers or persons vast powers of investigation, including
compelling witnesses to attend, taking statements, and entry into
premises to search and seize evidence. </p>

entry into premises, conducting searches and doing investigation
work are confrontational by nature and have a lot of grey areas

note that the Ministry takes the matter of water quality seriously. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>
                  </span>: I
thank the two Members for their queries on this issue. Let me first
reassure the House and members of the public that there will be
no change to the structure or to the rates of the pricing of our
water charges. The insertion of the new subsection 4 to section
20 of the Public Utilities Act simply clarifies that the Government's
intention has always been that the Water-borne Fee was to be in
the nature of a tax and that this has now been put beyond any doubt.
This is not a new charge. I am not making any announcements for
new rates or new charges. So that is not on the cards at this point
in time.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e49b392e-2f94-42da-ab56-d0d9948c64d6">
                  <a name="id-14433e09-2ff7-4404-bb59-90c1d7d1b056__id-e49b392e-2f94-42da-ab56-d0d9948c64d6"><!--a--></a>Having said that, I also need
to remind the House that used water that flows from our sinks, toilets
and bathrooms cannot simply be discharged into the sea for environmental and
public health reasons. The used water has to be collected properly
through public sewers which are not leaking and then treated at
PUB plants before they can be safely discharged. The current revenue
collected does not fully recover the costs of treating used water
and the operating costs of the public sewerage network, and I have
not yet even included the capital costs incurred.</p>

water system: this was a query that I think Mr Low made to me during
COS debate. In order to provide a safe, secure and resilient supply of
water for Singapore, right now, it costs PUB about $1.3 billion
a year. In the same year, that is, for the year ending March 2011,
PUB collected $674 million from water tariffs and $327 million from
its used water fee. This includes both the Water-borne Fee and the Sanitary
Appliance Fee. Even if you include the amount collected under the
Water Conservation Tax, which does not accrue to PUB but goes into
the Consolidated Fund, the total amount that has been collected
is still less than the total amount necessary to maintain, operate
and upgrade our water system in Singapore. If you extrapolate for
the long term, every additional drop that we are going to have to
get either from expanding our water catchment area and having to
make sure that that water is clean or from recycling water through NEWater or from
desalination, every additional drop is going to be more difficult
and costly. </p>

because of the technological availability of membranes in reverse
osmosis is that, in the long term, a key determinant of the price or
the cost of water is the cost of energy. So, no Minister for the
Environment and Water Resources in Singapore can ever give you a
warranty that water prices will not change in the future. It is
dependent on so many factors which are beyond our control and are, in
a sense, because of our uniquely water-constrained circumstances.</p>

out in the public domain so that we understand that this is a complex
and difficult issue. But I also want to assure the House that we
are very mindful that by running a most efficient-possible water
system, we can maintain water at an affordable rate for all our
people. For even those low-income families, through U-Save, we ensure
that everyone has access to water that they need. Let me reassure
Ms Sylvia Lim and, indeed, members of the public, that we are not
changing water rates this year.</p>

raised was about removing the prescribed frequency for inspecting
water storage tanks by professional engineers. First, I would say
that being overly prescriptive in legislation in general is not
a good idea, and it is better to let this be a professional decision
to be made by professionals as to the optimal frequency of these
inspections. But having said that, let me also clarify that the
proposed amendment is to remove the fixed frequency for inspecting
water tanks by professional engineers. Water storage tanks will
continue to be inspected by licensed plumbers on an annual basis,
and licensed plumbers will inspect every water storage tank and
the associated pipes to check for proper maintenance, cleanliness
and to prevent any leaks. So I want to assure you that we are not
slackening our vigilance and the need for meticulous maintenance
of our water tanks and the pipes therefrom.</p>

meant to give sufficient flexibility with the possible objective
of reducing the cost burden on owners for inspecting water storage
tanks. Let me give you an example. The cost for inspecting and certification
by a professional engineer is estimated to be between $300 and $500
per HDB block. For an average Town Council with 500 blocks − I presume
yours would be in that range − the average cost savings could amount
to somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000 per year. So I am trying
to find an optimal balance to save you money at the same time without compromising
the safety and integrity of our water system. So, allow the legislation
to provide flexibility and the professionals to make appropriate
decisions.</p>

your point about the amendments to section 10 of the Public Utilities
Act which will allow PUB to authorise other parties, other persons,
to perform any function or duty under the Public Utilities Act,
subject to such conditions and limitations as the Board may specify
in writing. For a start, PUB is considering engaging agents for
catchment surveillance and for the enforcement of minor offences,
such as littering or causing nuisance at reservoir parks and water
ways. As we open up more reservoirs and waterways for recreational
activities, these authorised agents will complement PUB's own team
of officers and help maintain our reservoirs and waterways in a
clean and safe condition for the public's use.</p>

way this evolves, PUB and, ultimately, the Minister, remain responsible
for the conduct, recruitment, training and the impact that these officers have on the
maintenance and integrity of our public water system and, indeed, their
impact on members of the public. I give that assurance to you and
to others.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I have a few clarifications. First, I would like to clarify with
the Minister that my concern about the water tariff was not about
the water-borne tax but about the main tariff itself which has been
elaborated upon in the new proposed section 20(1A), and my question
was on whether the enumeration of those various factors that can
be taken into account is a signal we can expect some change in the
water pricing formula. </p>

                  </span>: I
do not want to jump to next year's Budget Debate. The purpose of
enumerating these factors is just for greater clarity and transparency.
We are not enumerating this as a prelude to increasing water charges.
But I also want to transparently and openly tell you that, based
on the current trajectory, the cost of producing safe water will
be under great pressure in the future and it is not possible at this
point in time to give you an assurance that it will never be raised
in the future. At the appropriate time, if we need to do so, we
will do so, and we will explain it fully. But for this year, we
are not making any changes.</p>

agencies. For a start, within our own Ministry, NEA officers would
also have an interest in littering and in the maintenance of cleanliness and,
certainly, with respect to our reservoirs, there is an obvious group
of people we will reach out to. But I am considering other people.
We may have to outsource some of this routine work which could be
outsourced to other people. But the point that I am trying to make
is that it is our duty to make sure whoever we recruit to do this
is properly trained and is held accountable and performs to the
level that you would expect of any other public servant.</p>

                     </span>: Mr
Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second
time." The Energy Conservation Bill, or EC in short, in order to
save energy on our part, seeks to introduce mandatory energy management
practices for large energy users in the industry and transport sectors,
and to consolidate legislation on energy efficiency under one Act.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf5d5b53-f5d1-452c-b121-607b62b02195">

of high resource prices and increased economic and environmental
risk. The exploitation of low-priced natural resources has underpinned much
of our global economic growth in the 20th century. However, there
is now soaring global demand for resources due to rapid economic
development in emerging markets. Furthermore, the cost and difficulty
of finding and extracting new sources have also been increasing
progressively.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1e6f08e9-5dc6-46b6-985e-ff9fb9bf0f06">

study on resource productivity, the past 10 years have wiped out,
in real terms, all price declines that occurred in the previous
century. Old input-driven business models that benefitted from low
resource prices will confront a test of survival. Consequently,
private and public sector institutions need to make resource productivity
a higher priority and prepare for a resource-constrained future.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-510e34cc-bc19-4f53-91a2-1c2a4c11f62e">

greater resource scarcity, companies, consumers and countries that
break with old patterns and take the lead on resource efficiency
will strengthen their competitive and economic position. This is
certainly true for energy. </p>

energy needs to fuel our economy. The more we grow, the more we
need to think of conserving energy and using it efficiently. Otherwise,
we will pursue an ultimately unsustainable growth path. Today, countries
face a stark choice – to compete aggressively for finite resources
– this is not a viable option for a small city state with no natural
resources like ours – or to advance towards a more energy-efficient economy
and more sustainable pathways to prosperity. </p>

and secure, we must learn how to get more power, more mobility,
more lighting, heating and cooling from less energy. We must minimise
wastage. We need to focus the minds of corporations and citizens
on building and achieving breakthroughs in energy efficiency through
more rigorous energy management practices. And this has to be a
national effort.</p>

on improving energy efficiency have been focused on raising awareness,
on building capabilities and incentivising the adoption of energy- efficient
practices. Much more can be done. Findings from industry consultations
and benchmarking studies carried out by MEWR and NEA show that energy
management varies substantially among companies in Singapore, with
some managing their consumption better than others.</p>

practices under the Energy Conservation Act will focus management
attention of large energy consuming businesses on proper energy management.
It will complement existing incentive schemes and capability building programmes,
such as the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies and the Singapore Certified
Energy Manager Training Grant. The resulting best practices, technologies
and processes will subsequently cascade down the economic chain
to smaller enterprises. And similar energy management practices
are already mandated in countries, such as Japan, South Korea and
China.</p>

key features of this Bill. First, the respective Ministers in charge
of the industry and transport sectors will be empowered to gazette
the corporations or class of corporations that have to comply with
the energy management practices set out in the Act. We intend, as
a start, to require all large energy users in the industry and transport
sectors that consume more than 15 gigawatt-hours of energy equivalent
each year, or 54 terajoules of energy, to first appoint an energy
manager; second, to monitor and report energy use and greenhouse
gas emissions; and third, to submit energy efficiency improvement
plans. Large energy users in the industry and transport sectors
were consulted by MEWR, MOT, NEA and EDB on the energy management
practices to be mandated. In December 2011, a draft of this Bill
was released for consultation and subsequently revised to incorporate
the feedback received. MEWR and MOT, together with our statutory
boards will continue to engage stakeholders on the implementation
details of this Bill. </p>

Labelling Scheme (MELS) and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards
(MEPS) for household appliances, as well as the Fuel Economy Labelling
Scheme (FELS) for passenger cars and light goods vehicles under
the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA) are consolidated
under this Energy Conservation Bill. Energy-efficiency related measures
for the building sector will continue to be administered under the
Building Control Act for now. However, the energy efficiency-related
legislation under the Building Control Act will subsequently be incorporated
into the Energy Conservation Act. Consolidating all legislation
on energy efficiency in the industry, transport and household sectors
under this Bill over time will enable a more coordinated approach
to mandating energy efficiency. </p>

Act will be jointly administered by MEWR and MOT. The Minister for
the Environment and Water Resources will oversee the measures for the industry and household
sectors, while the Minister for Transport will oversee the transport

individuals count, too. Collectively, the everyday choices that
we make at home, in the office, our mode of transport – each of
these decisions add up. We can make decisions on energy through
the products we buy, how we make them, how we use them, as well
as what we do in our own spare time. By moving and acting together,
we can all make a difference.</p>

in a recent newspaper report by <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> on 6 March 2012, Singapore
was highlighted by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as "a top carbon
culprit in Asia-Pacific". The business and industrial sectors were
identified as major contributors to our high carbon footprint. In
fact, the building sector is responsible for 15% of the country's
carbon footprint. </p>

and Modelling Centre handbook of Energy &amp; Economic statistics
in Japan (2010), Singapore has the fifth highest CO<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> emission

11.92 ton-carbon/person in 2007. Sir, although such emission measurements
disadvantage countries with small populations, such as Singapore,
it is a fact that Singapore is contributing to increasing amounts
of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

as a timely wake-up call for Singapore to reduce our carbon footprint.
We should not be defensive but should instead be progressive and
take concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To do
that, we need a robust structure to manage the demand and supply
of energy in Singapore.</p>

Framework. Sir, the proposed Energy Conservation Bill will help
Singapore develop a framework to legislate, implement and enforce
energy conservation policies and measures more effectively. At this
point, I wish to share the success of Japan's Energy Conservation
laws and policies. Over the last 40 years, Japan has implemented
a comprehensive set of energy conservation measures, such as formulation
of energy conservation laws, financial support for energy conservation
equipment and systems, development of energy conservation technologies,
and extensive public education on energy conservation. These measures have
diversified Japan's energy sources, reduced energy demand in many
sectors, and built an energy-conserving culture among its people. </p>

sector. Sir, Singapore can also learn from Japan to reduce energy
consumption in the industrial sector, residential sector, business
sector and transportation sector and implement various energy saving
measures. The proposed Bill has provided an energy conservation
framework for the industrial, domestic and transportation sectors.
However, it fails to address the business sector, especially with
regard to energy conservation policies and measures, for the operation of
buildings. </p>

consumption and are responsible for a significant amount of our
greenhouse gas emissions. In Singapore, many buildings in the business sector,
such as offices, commercial buildings, hotels and hospitals, consume
a lot of energy. Although the Building and Construction Authority
(BCA) is encouraging the Green Mark scheme for the construction
of new buildings and retrofitted buildings, BCA does not monitor
the energy consumption of buildings.</p>

electrical and mechanical appliances, IT and security systems, and
lighting systems in many buildings that waste energy, contributing
to more greenhouse gas emissions. Sir, I am glad that the Minister
has mentioned that the Building and Control Act, part of it, that
is, the energy conservation portion, will be incorporated into the proposed Energy Conservation
Bill. May I ask the Minister when will this be done? </p>

sector. Sir, I support Division 1 of Part III of the Bill which
prescribes for the labelling of certain goods which consume electricity
or fuel, and the prescription of minimum energy efficiency standard
for such goods. This information will help consumers purchase more
energy-efficient appliances. However, having energy-efficient appliances
does not directly translate to low energy consumption. Thus, we
need to inculcate green habits among Singaporeans in order to further
reduce energy consumption. </p>

educating the public on energy conservation for many years. However,
it seems that many building users, especially in offices and commercial buildings,
have not fully embraced energy-saving habits. This could be partly
due to a lack of ownership. We need to constantly identify and highlight
high energy consumption appliances and devices to Singaporeans and
various building users. At the same time, we must set up monitoring
mechanisms to help them track their energy saving efforts. This
will encourage better ownership among Singaporeans and various building
users. </p>

among Singaporeans and building users may pose significant barriers
to the effective implementation of the energy labelling scheme.
I wish to ask the Minister if the Ministry has any plans to further
encourage our people to reduce the purchase of energy or fuel consuming
appliances, and also reduce consumption of energy through energy
saving habits. </p>

on energy conservation among Singaporeans, more educational activities
and publicity events should be organised. In Japan, the government
has established "Energy conservation day" on the 1st of every month, "Energy

on 1 August and December. We should organise more regular activities to
reach out to our community, and develop a green culture among Singaporeans.</p>

manager. Clause 30 of the Bill requires a registered corporation
to appoint an Energy Manager who will assist the firm to comply
with energy management practices. This practice is similar to Japan's
energy conservation law. However, I am concerned that the Energy
Manager in Singapore may not be as effective as the Energy Manager
in Japan due to cultural differences. </p>

in Singapore has limited mandate to implement the energy efficiency
improvement plan. This may be so when introducing new energy management
practices in different departments in a firm, or installing new
energy-efficient devices or appliances. The energy efficiency improvement
plan may also face resistance or not receive top priority when introduced
to different departments. These problems are commonly encountered
in the implementation of ISO 9000 Quality Assurance System in companies.</p>

Manager (QSM) faces difficulties in getting their colleagues and
sometimes their bosses to comply with quality procedures. To overcome such
problems, I suggest that we should instead appoint External Energy
Auditors to help firms implement energy efficiency management practices.
The use of External Energy Auditors will facilitate the sharing
of best practices, thus benefiting more firms in energy conservation,
while in-house Energy Managers may have limited expertise and experience and may
find it difficult to provide innovative solutions for continual energy
conservation. Sir, in Japan, the Energy Conservation Centre Japan
provides FOC (free of charge) energy audit services for firms. This
service has benefited thousands of companies over the years.</p>

launched the New National Energy Strategy and Basic Energy Plan

I propose that Singapore should also formulate a National Energy
Strategy Master Plan to provide a roadmap to guide Ministries, Government
agencies, industries, businesses and our people to conserve energy.</p>

Sir, it is time for Singapore to have this Bill. It is also time
for us to formalise and legislate certain practices and requirements.
It also shows we are fulfilling our global responsibilities with
some of the new measures that are going to be undertaken. This Bill
is also necessary in our move towards achieving our pledge to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 16% by the year 2020. </p>

One, on the requirements for corporations to perform energy reporting,
record-keeping and submission of energy improvement plans, will there
be some form of training provided to the relevant personnel to be
on par with these submissions? Will there be specific training available
for them for the so-called "energy manager"? If so, which funds
can the companies utilitise for this, and can the post-secondary
education funds be used by these employees who are going to be trained?
Certainly, this will also likely be a new job scope for a lot of
companies and, no doubt, it will be a move towards job creation. </p>

now that we are starting to legislate, will we be having more relevant
courses available at our institutions of higher learning or even
at WDA? Currently, there is a course conducted by the National Environment
Agency, that is, the Singapore Certified Energy Manager Programme.
Is this course sufficient for the required training, or do we need
to supplement and enhance the available course?</p>

towards the larger energy users in industries, consuming more than
15 gigawatt hours of energy per year. This is equivalent to energy
consumed by some 3,000 4-room flats. This is a good starting point.
However, studies done at the Danish Institute of Energy Authority
has shown that companies can substantially reduce their energy consumption
and cost by implementing such programmes. And, on average, typically
they can reduce their energy consumption between 10% and 15 %. So, I
hope we can study some of these models.</p>

other companies, like our SMEs? We have many SMEs contributing significantly
to our economy and if we add their total energy consumption, it
might come up to something quite substantial. SMEs may have unique
energy demands and
requirements and face different issues from bigger companies. This
move will certainly help companies to be more energy efficient and
energy conscious. After all, energy conservation and reducing climate
change is everyone's and every company's responsibility, I feel.
Countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, do have energy
policies for their SMEs; perhaps we can study from these models. </p>

are we stepping up education of the public as well as the industries?
Will we be able to send relevant staff and personnel to study and
share best practices from other countries like Japan, Denmark and
South Korea where there are indeed good practices on energy-efficient
usage? For the sales personnel in Singapore, we will also need to
perform training for them as they will be the ones who can promote
sales of various energy-saving household appliances and equipment.</p>

something many of us cannot do without. It is one of the major contributors
to our energy consumption. This is dependent a lot on the temperature
set and, interestingly, the temperature set has effects on productivity. Studies
have found that for work requiring focus and high concentration,
temperatures should be set between 22 and 23 degrees Celsius. For
jobs involving innovation and creativity, it has been recommended
that a temperature of about 24 to 25 degrees, a little bit higher,
is sufficient. Now, the temperature set in offices also depends
on the climate origin of the people and the workers there. It has
been shown that tropically acclimatised persons prefer lower temperature,
whereas those workers who come from temperate or other cooler climates
prefer a warmer temperature. Thus, companies must know how to choose
smart air-conditioning systems and set the appropriate temperatures.
Some recommendations and guidelines from the Ministry will also
be useful in this area.</p>

countries that is actively promoting Green Buildings. There is a
"Zero Energy Building" in Singapore, in case Members did not know,
run by the BCA. Now, to build a Green Building, there must be a
green concept plan, a construction stage with active and passive
phases, green promoting tenants who will then realise the economic
incentives it can bring. How are we doing in reaching the target
set that 80% of our buildings must be green-marked by the year 2030?</p>

set a target to improve our energy intensity by some 35% by the
year 2030, from the 2005 levels. This has also been documented in

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
the Energy Conservation Bill aims to bring about a 35% improvement
in our energy intensity by 2030 and to improve the energy performance
of our companies in the industrial and transport sectors. Sir, I
welcome this Bill.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-397548f5-2509-4d42-a098-bcea24d72d01">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-397548f5-2509-4d42-a098-bcea24d72d01"><!--a--></a>As a developed nation, we
should be more energy efficient, both for the purpose of allowing
our companies to become globally competitive as well as to signal
our commitment to
good use of scarce global resources. This Bill sets out the minimum energy
management standards. These include the appointment of energy managers, reporting
of energy use, and submission of energy efficiency improvement plans
for large users of energy. I noted that the Government recognises
that these are "minimum" standards, which imply that it is aware
that more needs to be done and companies can be encouraged to do
more. I would like to point out some implementation matters for consideration,
as well as to offer suggestions on what more can be done.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c5d1cc70-2144-4ba0-9f0b-521122c98a4f">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-c5d1cc70-2144-4ba0-9f0b-521122c98a4f"><!--a--></a>First is in the area of energy
management practices. We are generally supportive of making energy
management plans mandatory for heavy energy users. There are, however,
potential issues concerning governance that we anticipate with the
proposed energy management practices. This Bill gives extensive
flexibility to the Director-General and to the Minister to subsequently
introduce by-laws, regulations and standards via Gazette. The Minister
is empowered to gazette by-laws, but no guidance has been given
so far. It is left to the subsequent discretion of the Director-General. Therefore,
I would like to ask the Minister to give more indications of the
by-laws, regulations and standards the Ministry intends to gazette,
so that Parliament can debate this. What guidelines does the Ministry
intend to use? Can the Minister share the timeframe guidance on
when the by-laws may be gazetted? I believe these are necessary to
prevent inconsistency in the implementation and enforcement of the
proposed Bill.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 46</p>

                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-650c4e5a-d261-485e-acfd-da4968767593"><!--a--></a>Drawing a parallel from the
practices in the building industry, there are the Building Control
Act (BCA) and the Building Control Regulations (BCR). The BCA and
the BCR have been in use for more than 20 years in Singapore and
are very detailed. Does the Minister anticipate that the by-laws,
regulations and standards of this Bill will take a form like that
of BCA and BCR? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c358496a-a89d-43d4-ab97-e40b0a0f3c17">

managers that large companies must now employ, and auditors to monitor
for compliance. We noted that there have been recent programmes
which are supported by E2Singapore and EDB to train auditors and
energy managers. How many have been trained and how sufficient are
these programmes to ensure that there will be sufficient qualified
officers to fulfil our needs to implement this Bill? Are there guidelines
on the qualifications and experience of such energy managers? </p>

an area I believe will be increasingly important for both Singapore
and for the world, which is renewable energy. I think a gap in this
Bill is that it does not seek to promote renewable energy explicitly.
A comprehensive energy conservation effort must include renewable
energy as a component. South Korea is aiming for an 11% share of
renewables in total energy consumption by 2030. Another heavy energy
consuming country, Belgium, is aiming for 12% share of renewables
for electricity suppliers in 2012. Japan, the energy intensity of
which is comparable to the EU, is aiming for 10% by 2020. Denmark,
already a leading energy-efficient country in the world, is aiming
for 13% by 2020. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e5d06eb8-14b5-4b3e-b1e2-9d3846773e8a">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-e5d06eb8-14b5-4b3e-b1e2-9d3846773e8a"><!--a--></a>According to statistics from
Singapore's Energy Market Authority, in 2010, 79% of electricity
in Singapore is produced from natural gas; 19% is from petroleum
products, that is, fuel oil and diesel, but only under 3% is from
renewables. This gap is made more pronounced by the fact that our
National Climate Strategy commits Singapore "to do our part in the
international effort to address climate change". We have promised
to play our part by
"improving the energy efficiency of our major energy sectors, namely,
power generation, industries, transport, buildings and households"
and "to the global research effort on climate change and energy
technologies", particularly in solar energy and green buildings.
The Strategy states, "The objective of our research efforts ...
is to improve the current state of technology, and to bring down
production costs to a level that would make large-scale adoption
commercially viable". The Government is conscious of the need to
signal to the international community our national commitment to
the international climate change effort. The fact sheet in this
Bill concludes, "Establishing energy efficient standards across
sectors under an Energy Conservation Act will also send a strong
signal to external parties that Singapore is serious in undertaking
mitigation actions to meet its international obligations". </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 47</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-032d1486-bec1-4f04-bba6-19811567a750">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-032d1486-bec1-4f04-bba6-19811567a750"><!--a--></a>Therefore, I would like to
know the progress of our development in using more renewable energy.
What are our current plans to significantly increase the use of renewables?
I would like the Government to be more proactive to signal to the international
community of our commitment to international efforts to address
climate change by setting a target of renewables in total energy
consumption to be achieved by a specific year. Using the four benchmark
countries' target as reference, how far can we push for a target
of, say, 10% of renewables in total energy consumption by 2030?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-497c4755-a3fa-4c9c-8bf5-82877ac85b05">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-497c4755-a3fa-4c9c-8bf5-82877ac85b05"><!--a--></a>Lastly, I would like to cover
another area which I feel can be promoted more aggressively to drive
energy conservation practices, which is, having an integrated system
of financial incentives and disincentives. A comprehensive energy
conservation policy, especially for a liberalised energy market
such as in Singapore, should include such a financial system to
support volunteer agreements with corporations on energy efficiency
targets. In terms of financial systems, the developed world can
be divided into three zones: EU and UK, AAC (America, Australia,
Canada) and Asia, namely, Japan, Korea and Singapore. AAC offers
both financial assistance to promote energy management and tax incentives
to encourage achievement of energy efficiency targets. EU and UK
use carbon emission market "cap and trade" to promote energy efficiency, but
individual countries use a variety of other instruments, including
financial assistance, tax incentives and green taxation. Asian countries,
including Singapore, use only financial assistance.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cd855492-890b-46cb-b11e-cb28e225f205">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-cd855492-890b-46cb-b11e-cb28e225f205"><!--a--></a>We can look more aggressively
at using tax and cash incentives to encourage the achievement of
energy efficiency targets set for different industrial sectors in consultation
with stakeholders. Currently, the energy efficiency initiatives
of E2Singapore are mainly support schemes for implementing programmes.
Only the Green Mark Scheme gives out cash incentives for hitting
targets. I am interested to know how effective Green Mark has been,
and if the effectiveness of all schemes has been indexed and tracked.
I am also interested to know the utilisation rate of existing schemes listed
in E2Singapore and if the Minister thinks this has been effective
in promoting energy efficiency.</p>

schemes as "incentives" is also a misnomer as they do not really
measure actual achievement of targets. Besides current support schemes,
I hope the Ministry can look at providing real incentives for hitting
energy efficiency targets. My colleague, the hon Member Gerald Giam,
will elaborate further on suggested taxation and incentive schemes
that can be considered.</p>

Bill in its intent to bring about a more energy-efficient Singapore.
I hope the implementation issues and other suggestions that I have
raised can be considered
by the Minister to more aggressively set the pace for Singapore
to be a global leader in energy conservation and energy technology.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, as an industrialised economy
which consumes its fair share of energy, Singapore must play its
part to reduce its carbon footprint and combat climate change. One
way of doing this is to be more efficient in the use of our limited
energy resources. Doing so is not only environmentally friendly,
but it is also economically beneficial to our companies.</p>

Conservation Bill (EC) is a welcome development to signal our nation's

Bill are to give the practice of energy management greater focus
within companies that are large energy consumers, and to build industry
capability in energy management. This is expected to help reduce
Singapore's energy intensity by 35% by 2030, from 2005 levels. Improving
the energy performance of companies will make them more competitive
in the global economy. The Bill is also expected to complement existing
schemes and capability-building programmes which provide support
for companies that invest in improving their energy efficiency.</p>

how the Government arrived at its 35% target for reduction in energy

electricity bills and, hence, improve their profitability, it should
be in their business interest to improve energy efficiency. We need

made in this House in 2008 by Ms Sylvia Lim, to introduce tiered
electricity tariffs, such that those who consume more electricity
pay more for additional units at a higher rate. Ms Lim's suggestion
is even more relevant today, given the push for energy conservation.
Introducing tiered tariffs could result in large energy consumers paying a higher bill,
and smaller consumers paying less, while remaining revenue-neutral
overall. The price mechanism will impact large energy consumers
the most. It will, therefore, force them to innovate and improve
their energy efficiency, in ways that an energy management framework
alone cannot.</p>

the introduction of the energy management framework in the EC. And
I propose that this can be implemented by, firstly, tax incentives
for companies which meet their energy efficiency improvement targets;
secondly, disincentives for high usage of electricity, like a higher
tariff for large users; thirdly, an Energy Efficiency Certification
scheme that extends to all companies, not just the biggest energy
consumers; fourthly, energy labelling of business equipment; and,
lastly, aligning energy labelling with companies' energy management
systems.</p>

are in place, I believe Singapore can aim for a more aggressive
reduction in our energy intensity over the next 20 years. More importantly, these
measures will contribute towards creating a stronger culture of
energy efficiency in Singapore and encourage large and small companies

                     <strong class="ph b">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, the Energy Conservation Bill is a good move that will enable
the Government to monitor energy consumption and improve energy efficiency
in our large-scale industrial and transport sectors. It also shows
that Singapore is taking its international responsibilities in tackling
climate change concerns seriously, in line with other developed
countries. </p>

the Minister. The first concerns the reporting requirements for
the companies under this Bill. I understood then that this issue
was raised during a consultation exercise on the Bill in December
2011. I find it surprising that the detailed reporting requirements
are still not finalised, and that the consultative exercise on these will
only be completed by the end of June 2012. Would the Minister be
able to share more details of the reporting requirements at this
moment? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-accdadad-086d-4172-8324-edeee8000155">

Efficiency (EE) improvement plan targets that the companies are
required to submit. Since this Bill does not require companies to
meet their EE improvement targets, but are strongly encouraged to
develop robust cost-effective plans with the intention of implementing
them, the provision seems to be a weak instrument. I understand
that this Bill is modelled on similar ones in places like the European
Union and Japan, and I suspect that they are more stringent on companies meeting
their EE improvement targets. This Bill does not cover SMEs, but
rather MNCs, which can afford to invest more effort and resources
to meeting their EE improvement targets. My question, therefore,
to the Minister is, does the Government plan to establish mandatory
EE targets in the future? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4fb932de-fe8a-4899-a907-f64b70b38b88">

covers companies which consume more than 15 gigawatt hours (GWh)
of energy per year. This would generally affect only MNCs. Does
the Government plan to lower the qualification threshold and, hence,
include SMEs in this Bill
in future, in line with some other countries? Such a move is certainly
a laudable one in improving energy efficiency in Singapore, and
should be supported. However, it may put the resources and efforts
of some SMEs at a strain, for it to meet the reporting requirements,
without any substantial cost savings from improvements in their
energy performance. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the objectives of this Energy Conservation
Bill. It is vital that we maximise our resources in a rigorous and
systematic way. Targeting a 35% improvement in energy intensity
from 2005 to 2030 is a significant goal. This is comparable with
the European Commission Energy Efficiency Plan, which targets a
20% saving in Energy Consumption from 2007 to 2020. However, the
latest projections indicate the Euro zone will only achieve 9% savings by
2020, largely due to the lack of awareness amongst citizens and
the energy issue not being high on the national agenda. Hence, it
is important to bring more focus into our new Bill by improving
its scope and defining measurable quantitative objectives for energy
conservation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce75e91e-4a4f-4586-9fc0-24438b3af402">

our current Bill, I refer to Part III of the Act, which is "Energy Conservation
Measures for Domestic and Industry Sectors" (sections 27 to 29).
Large energy users are to: report energy consumption, energy production
and greenhouse gas emissions; keep relevant records; and prepare
and submit an energy improvement plan.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ee97563-bc13-4e08-8c53-a40982317d61">

and more in line with free market principles to implement an energy
tax or a carbon tax on large users. Carbon and energy taxes are
currently in legislation in Denmark, France, the Netherlands and
Switzerland. China is also planning to introduce carbon tax by 2015.
I note with particular interest the Denmark model in which the carbon
tax can be offset by a tax refund for implementing energy efficient initiatives.
It would be good to explore possibilities of implementing a similar
carbon tax structure in Singapore progressively, with the current
Bill serving as a starting point for such future initiatives. Ultimately,
businesses should face the true social and environmental cost of
their energy usage via a price mechanism. </p>

the Bill is the impact on the transport operators. Part IV of the
Act is on "Energy Conservation Measures For Transport Sector". Through
section 47, it obligates the transport operators to report energy
consumption, energy production and greenhouse gas emissions. Through
section 49, it requires the preparation and submission of an energy
improvement plan. Through section 62, it empowers the Transport
Minister to specify minimum fuel economy standards for motor vehicles.
This would lead to increased overhaul and fleet maintenance costs,
and increased compliance costs of energy reporting and record-keeping. </p>

the incremental costs of compliance must be offset against the gains
in energy efficiency rather than passing to the consumers. Further,
it should be mandated that the surplus savings from energy efficiency
above the compliance costs must be passed on to the commuters through
fare reductions, in order to achieve holistic gains from energy
efficiency.</p>

has been using fossil fuels for producing much of its electricity.
A large portion of electricity consumption is by export-oriented
business, with domestic
consumption being rather small. The three oil refineries, for instance, consume
20% of the total power consumed in Singapore. Together with major pharmaceutical
and wafer fabrication facilities, they make a significant impact
on our total consumption. Our focus in the current Bill is on these
large users of energy only. </p>

are either by controlling wastage of energy or by radical technological
improvements. The quantum of savings by controlling wastage alone
may not be significant enough to achieve our ambitious target of
35%. Further, the technological improvements within a specified
timeline are also beyond our control. Therefore, it will be prudent
to include in the scope the secondary users of energy as well.</p>

emphasise measures that will shape the habits of Singaporeans. This
will be more relevant towards building a culture and society which respects
the scarcity and dearness of energy and attempts to make more judicious
and conscious use. Singapore, being a small country, and based on
effective and efficient centralised planned amenities, has a far
higher chance of succeeding in efforts relating to secondary consumption
of energy. We must make legislative efforts to bring energy saving
habits amongst Singaporeans so that, over time, the national culture
and habits change. </p>

are: (a) mandatory tapping of solar energy in every building in
Singapore, residential and commercial alike; (b) mandatory use of
light sensors in all public lighting to ensure maximum and progressive
use of daylight. Today, with the timer-based system, we see lights
on in the evenings well before sunlight fades away; (c) commercial
and residential buildings must be designed to have higher ceilings,
windows and ventilators to allow better natural flow of air and
more daylight; (d) include compulsory education to minimise and
reduce the need for air-conditioned environment with emphasis on
health besides energy savings; (e) introduce markings on all cooling
equipment on ideal healthy temperature at 25 degrees centigrade,
thereby curbing the tendency to over-cool ambient temperature. Lastly, encourage
use of new technology and materials for treatment of exterior walls
of buildings for better insulation and reduced demand for air conditioning. </p>

Energy Conservation Bill, I wish to briefly highlight a positive
spin off from this effort which could be a long-term opportunity
for Singapore and Singaporeans. Green economy is the future. Energy
efficiency, compliance methods, science and enforcement technologies
are areas where specific skills will be needed. In the process of
introducing the Bill, we should explore developing training courses
in our institutes and polytechnics which will help people qualify
in this area. It will also generate job opportunities for Singaporeans
as it has done in other countries, like the United Kingdom.</p>

presently empowers the enforcing authority and establishes the rules
and regulations for large energy users to follow and conserve energy.
In order to make the Bill more effective, it must define measurable
quantitative objectives for the energy conservation besides increasing
the scope to include secondary users of energy. In conclusion, I
support the objectives of this Bill, and I look forward to an energy-efficient

impact on the environment of certain industries or activities; or
(b) advising the Minister or other public bodies concerning energy
or environmental policies. In clause 65(2), the Director–General
may require relevant parties to furnish the required information.
There is no mention of whether the public, stakeholders and other
interested citizens shall have access to this information.</p>

will change, with regard to this Bill, I recommend that the Government
set up a publicly available data repository regarding energy and greenhouse

clause 65 that I mentioned above.</p>

First, public scrutiny will offer an additional incentive for companies
to reduce their environment impact. When the public is environmentally aware
of ethical and environmental practices and more critical of unethical
corporate activities, there is much companies can gain when they
are motivated to be more socially responsible. And, second, it is
very clear that Singaporeans are also more critical of the Government
and are demanding greater consultancy and accountability in public policy-making
and policy enforcement. From the time that this Bill was first mooted, much
has changed in public perception of the Government. Demands for
public engagement
are getting louder and cannot be ignored. A public data repository
will go a long way to ensure more openness and transparency.</p>

President's Address aforementioned, the Ministry of the Environment
and Water Resources also had this to say, "We will explore how we
can develop a more robust framework on environment reporting by
business and make environment information more open to the public.
We will consult more closely with the public on our policies, by
developing more channels of communication." I trust that what I
have said is simply a reminder of this commitment.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Nee
Soon)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the mandating of energy management
practices proposed by the Bill is a timely move in the right direction
for Singapore in its quest to minimise energy wastage, improve productivity
and play its part in contributing towards the realisation of our
goals of reducing CHG emissions by 16% by 2020.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-308f36fd-f2ff-4267-882a-88175f24ff79">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-308f36fd-f2ff-4267-882a-88175f24ff79"><!--a--></a>Sir, the electricity that
powers our businesses and our homes, the fuel that powers our cars
and machineries contribute towards carbon emissions and pollution.
As the world population grows to seven billion and inching towards
10 billion in the near future, we need to review our strategies
and policies towards how we use energy and regulate a framework
which will phase out technologies and practices that will be harmful
to the environment and promote the development of sustainable technology that
is environmentally friendly and which is efficient and clean.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa7a9146-5113-4e3b-9824-7382adb5670f">

itself alongside other developed nations in the world, it is imperative
that it puts in place systems, structures and programmes for its companies
to invest in efficient energy management and benchmarking practices.
We would also have to be creative in ensuring that our energy usage
habits and processes are sustainable in meeting the demands of the
21st Century economy. I believe that this Bill will play its part
in laying the necessary framework to cultivate such a culture and changing
mindset shift needed for our companies, especially the SMEs in their
quest to realise efficient, environmentally friendly energy management
production capabilities and operational practices. Although Singapore
is small compared to the rest of the world, I am convinced that
we can still make the difference. </p>

the Bill, I would like to clarify a few issues with the Minister.
Sir, while most companies would welcome the change and agree that
this is a move in the right direction, there will also be those
that have yet to cultivate such processes within their operational
systems. These companies may find this mindset and operational changes
challenging especially if the expectations of the new regulations
of the Bill would require a restructuring and transformation in
their operation and practices. I would like to urge the Government
to allow for a transition period for these entities so that they
could focus more attention on examining issues relating to their energy
consumption and production as well as greenhouse gas emissions generated
by their operations. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6cd65952-7483-4700-baa2-362bec64bcf3">

I would like to call the Government to adopt a humane perspective
in allowing companies to coherently infuse into such a framework
by providing the relevant assistance and support. They could be
in the form of guidance and advice on management practices as well
as providing grants for the expected costs some of these companies may incur in its
journey towards realising an efficient energy management culture. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df335330-0536-4682-97bc-6257ada46d55">

some of these transition issues because the Bill would empower the
Director-General to conduct surveys, audit and inspect companies
to ensure compliance and impose punitive measures if they do not.
Companies that sell products and services or operate in a way that
flout the regulations may be adversely affected by this Bill. For
those without the knowledge would have to hire staff to ensure compliance
within the company and incur additional manpower costs. New operational procedures
would also have to be devised. Additional operating hours would
have to be put in place to manage the requirements of an efficient
management culture. </p>

help to establish a body to help companies to make the transition,
help them pool resources together for sharing of expertise and knowledge
in this area and to generate cost savings through economies of scale
as they build their energy conservation improvement plans.</p>

ask the Minister on how the Bill will affect businesses, particularly
our SMEs. How will the additional costs, such as the registration
fees and fees for renewal of registration, the need to provide free
of charge to the Director-General samples of the registrable goods
for the purpose of testing and analysis as well as the need to prepare
reports, such as the Energy Improvement Plans, affect the cost of operations
of the businesses? How will the Ministry assist those companies
affected by the Bill to comply with these requirements?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-87820743-b75f-4e73-aab8-92f01389e158">

to know how the Ministry will evaluate the impact of this Bill on
the cost structure to businesses and whether it may result in the
cost being passed on to end users and our consumers? I would also
like to know what will happen to those companies that have great
difficulties in meeting the requirements of the Bill.</p>

manpower needs and training. Sir, the Bill requires the employment
of an Energy Manager and possibly few other executives to support
the requirements of the Bill. In addition, with the Bill, I would
expect the growth of consultancy services related to the energy
production and efficiency. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2146135a-3860-4fd6-b6d9-6f93e279338f">

like to ask the Minister if there are adequate manpower provisions
to meet the needs in implementing an effective platform for such
a Bill. How does the Ministry intend to beef up the expertise and
manpower in this area and how will our local polytechnics and universities
support this sector of the industry? I hope that this will open
up more employment opportunities for Singaporeans. </p>

businesses will also need to adjust to a new paradigm where social
costs of pollution and energy inefficiencies are weighed in by consumers
and Government alike. They have to transform and reinvent themselves
to build products and services that use energy efficiently and are
friendly to the environment. This is a journey that all types of
businesses must take to remain relevant in a world facing energy
shortages due to the growing demand from the ever increasing population
and economic activities. I would like to urge the Ministry to continuously engage
and encourage companies to reinvent themselves to operate under
the new operational environment. </p>

for inclusivity in ensuring that this Bill, in its essence and spirit,
is infused in the economic structure of Singapore. Regulations alone will
not suffice but has to be complemented, supported and guided by
the Government and its people to ensure that all stakeholders within
our society are able to manage this transition effectively. Mr Speaker,
Sir, on this note, I support the Bill. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>
                  </span>: Mr
Speaker, Sir, let me thank all the eight speakers who have spoken.
I must admit to being surprised that so many of you have spoken. However,
I am gratified that every single speaker has supported this Bill,
bipartisan support, as well as the Nominated Members of Parliament.
So, this is a good sign. Let me start by reiterating our principles
behind what we are trying to do. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 56</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f87b9ade-b8c4-4dae-b9c5-61bee8677472">

first step. It is not in its final form yet. Another review would
be due in 2015. This is a first step that is designed to facilitate
and enhance our nascent capabilities in this area. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d0085f0c-d84f-4ae1-a8a0-12daf6a66c08">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-d0085f0c-d84f-4ae1-a8a0-12daf6a66c08"><!--a--></a>Second, we believe that we
have to work closely with all stakeholders, and I do not just mean
across the House at the political level, but, indeed, with all industry stakeholders
as well.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e23cefb9-1b63-4dde-9bdd-41324bfc30e9">

do not want to unnecessarily inflate costs because ultimately if
we do things prematurely for ideological reasons, pursue technologies which
are not yet mature, we will inflate costs and costs will have to
be borne by consumers. </p>

whilst we do not want to unnecessarily inflate costs, we do want
to ensure that we have right pricing in our economy. In particular,
this means that we do not subsidise the price of electricity in
Singapore. From time to time, there are political kerfuffles every
time the energy tariffs have been revised when oil prices change.
But the more important point is you do not distort the economy and
resource allocation by mispricing precious resources and in this
particular case, is the price of energy.</p>

agree with Members of this House that we want to provide Singaporeans
with an opportunity to make an informed choice, and that is where
things like energy labelling and other schemes which Members have
suggested in their earlier speeches are relevant.</p>

we should not prematurely rush into technology which is not yet
mature, we should nevertheless pre-position ourselves to be a useful
test bed for promising technologies which may have applications
later on when they become more mature or when they enjoy economies
of scale. </p>

the principles, the guiding philosophy behind what we are trying
to do in our energy conservation. </p>

have raised in particular. First, I want to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin
for referring to the recent news article which cited the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) having ranked Singapore as the top carbon emitter per
capita in the Asia-Pacific. The methodology that the WWF used in
its report differs significantly from the methodology that is officially
adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). It is important for us to remember that it is the UNFCCC which
is the international authority on climate change issues.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-91de8d7d-2b55-4791-b822-22f36599497f">
                  <a name="id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-91de8d7d-2b55-4791-b822-22f36599497f"><!--a--></a>The key difference between
the methodology adopted by these two organisations lies in the treatment
of goods imported and consumed in a particular country. The WWF methodology
attributes the carbon emission from such goods to the importing
country. By contrast, the UNFCCC attributes the emissions to the
country in which the goods are produced. The UNFCCC treatment is
internationally recognised because it is not practical to hold the

to measure carbon emissions is also not appropriate as this naturally
disadvantages a small, densely populated city state like Singapore.
A better and more direct measurement of Singapore's performance
or carbon footprint would be the carbon dioxide emission per dollar
of GDP. Based on this indicator, Singapore is ranked amongst the
lowest carbon dioxide emitters per dollar GDP internationally. We
ranked 123 out of 137 countries. This is one lead table when you want
to be lowly ranked. This ranking is done by the International Energy
Agency.</p>

our efforts to encourage greater use of renewable energy in Singapore.
Unfortunately, let me share some of our constraints in this area. We
do not have large rivers in Singapore. So hydroelectricity is not
a viable option. We do not have volcanoes. So geo-thermal energy
is not an option as it is in other tectonically active countries.
Solar and wind farms require large tracts of lands which we do not
have. A recent report authored by Stewart Brand estimated that you
need land about the size of the entire island of Singapore in order
to generate one gigawatt of wind energy. To put this in context,
it means even if the entire Singapore was converted into a wind
farm, you would produce only about 10% of the installed capacity
that we have. It is not possible. Even if we were to cover every
roof top and every surface with photovoltaic panels using current
technology, we estimated it could provide maybe about 12% to 14%
of electricity needs.</p>

and the fact that we do not have typhoons and hurricanes, which
is a good thing, also mean that the same characteristics that have
made Singapore a safe harbour also make wind, tidal and these other
renewable sources not viable in our context.</p>

explain all these so that you understand that it would be wrong
to prematurely and simplistically set a target for renewable energy
in Singapore. We are an alternative energy disadvantaged country.
Some people say we are not even a country, we are a city state.
So, you need to understand this basic strategic fundamental constraint
because otherwise if you just simplistically copy what other larger countries in
very different circumstances do, you will end up imposing an impossible
burden on Singaporeans, Singapore enterprises and businesses. That
would be counter-productive.</p>

Yee have also asked about our progress in achieving a sustainable
Singapore blueprint targets for energy intensity and green mark
buildings. Here, I have some good news. Under the "Sustainable Singapore
Blueprint" which was published in 2009, Singapore was supposed to
pursue a less energy intensive growth trajectory. Our target was
to improve our energy intensity by 35% compared from 2005 levels,
and to achieve this by 2030. I am pleased to inform the House that
our energy intensity has already improved by some 16% since 2005
levels. This we achieved in 2010.</p>

the 35% improvement in energy intensity is a stretch target. It
is a stretch target. Paradoxically, the fact that we had done well
in the past makes further improvements more difficult. Let me give
Members an example of that. We already have a very energy efficient
fuel mix as far as the generation of electricity is concerned. More
than 80% comes from natural gas. We also have limited access to alternative
energy sources, as I have explained earlier. Nevertheless, we have committed
to achieving this stretch target and a working group under the Inter-Ministerial
Committee on Climate Change has been established to study in a practical and
reasonable way how we can achieve this target. But I want to caution
that this would not be an easy target to achieve.</p>

we would need to implement cost-effective energy efficiency measures,
but there are market barriers. For instance, lack of information,
lack of capability and these deficiencies exist in many companies;
in fact, in most companies currently. The Energy Conservation Bill
addresses some of these barriers by establishing a legislative framework
that would require companies to build up this capability in energy
management and to cultivate a practice of systematic monitoring measurement
of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

Blueprint (SSB) also sets a target of 80% of our buildings achieving
the Green Mark status by 2030. Efforts towards achieving this has
been guided by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and
it has set out specific initiatives under six key strategic thrusts:
first, by taking a lead in the public sector, that means we have
to lead by example; second, to spur the private sector to follow
in our footsteps; third, to further the development of green building
technology; fourth, building industry capabilities through training;
fifth, to profile Singapore and to raise awareness of its capabilities;
and, sixth, to impose minimum standards. Through BCA's Green Mark rating
scheme, buildings are assessed as environmentally sustainable if
they meet the stipulated criteria on energy and water efficiency,
indoor environmental quality and environmental protection.</p>

not currently monitor the energy consumption of each and every single
building. This gap will be addressed when MND amends the Building Control
Act later this year to introduce some new energy efficiency measures
for the building sector.
So, for example, utilities suppliers and buildings, excluding industrial buildings
and dwelling units, will be required to submit annual electricity
consumption data and basic building information such as gross floor
area. As mentioned in my speech earlier, the energy efficiency related
specifications under the BCA Act will be incorporated into the Energy
Conservation Act subsequently. We will do this in step so the next
review will be in 2015. If we do so, it will be after 2015. But
do not mistake this as tardiness or as unwillingness to move forward
in parallel. </p>

speech when he suggested the introduction of carbon pricing as a
means to incentivise companies to reduce emissions and to enhance energy
efficiency. In very few places do you get a corporate leader asking
for higher taxes. I agree that there is a need to price externalities,
and carbon emission is one obvious case of an externality that currently
is not priced. But we also need to encourage our industries to take
a long-term view and a sustainable growth path. So this is, and
I am sure Mr Dhinakaran will agree with me, a very complex area.
It needs careful study, given our needs circumstances and our competitive
position. In terms of natural endowments, as I have explained earlier,
we would always be alternative energy disadvantaged compared to
almost any other country in the world. </p>

this House bearing in mind our total trade is three times our GDP.
That means our companies, every day, every year, are engaged in
a global fight for survival. The progress of negotiations on a global

in this decision-making process because we do not want to prematurely
disadvantage the viability of our companies. I would also give the assurance
that we will consult carefully and widely all stakeholders for their

the assistance that will be rendered to companies and manpower training
to meet the requirements. In 2010, the Government actively engaged
industry players to seek feedback on energy management practices
and the Energy Conservation Bill was subsequently published for
public consultation in December 2011. We refined the Bill in response
to public feedback, and the NEA and the statutory boards under the
MOT are currently conducting another round of consultations with
stakeholders in affected sectors on the detailed reporting requirements
of the Act. I hope Mrs Lina Chiam would be more patient. This is
again a very odd situation where the Opposition is asking the Government
not to take time to consult all stakeholders. Be a bit more patient

training on the use of an online system for them to submit information
that is required by the Act. We will try to make this as simple
as income tax submissions, which I think are due in a few days. The
online system is also currently under development and it will be

The Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) Programme was launched

Singapore in order to equip facility and building managers, engineers, technicians
and others who intend to pursue a career as energy professionals.
They need to have the technical skills and the competencies in order
to manage these services within their organisations. And we will
continue to refine the SCEM syllabus to ensure its robustness and
its relevance over time.</p>

lack sufficient expertise and energy management at this point in
time. Dr Teo suggested that companies appoint external energy auditors
to help them implement energy efficiency management practices. This
is a good idea and it can complement our efforts. We have started
by requiring large energy users to appoint and train their own in-house
energy managers. This is to ensure that energy management capabilities
and practices are internalised to cultivate a culture of continuously
seeking energy efficiency improvement within that company itself.
It is better that this be "organic" and in-house to the company,
and then you supplement that by seeking expertise outside the company. </p>

build up the necessary manpower to support the requirements of the
ECA. I am glad to inform him that aside from supporting training through
the SCEM, NEA and partner agencies will provide advice and exercise
oversight of the progress made in energy management by the companies.
Concurrently, we hope to facilitate the entry of more reputable
international energy service companies which can provide the external
energy services. Over time, we hope that there will be a good number

for his suggestion to pool together resources by sharing expertise
and knowledge in area of energy efficiencies in order to achieve
economies of scale. The Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP)
Programme which was introduced in April 2010 is an industry-focused
voluntary programme to support companies in their energy efficiency
efforts and to share best practices. This is a key platform. It
will help companies build up the necessary capabilities and prepare
them for the onset of the ECA. A total of 107 companies have joined
the EENP as partners as of March 2012. Companies can also tap the
Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies scheme to meet their energy
efficiency improvement plans. This scheme aims to incentivise owners
and operators of industrial facilities to invest in energy-efficient
equipment and technologies. So far, NEA has approved about 31 projects
worth $66 million by 28 companies. Each project is estimated to
generate about $168 million in energy cost savings over the lifespan
of the equipment purchased.</p>

Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASe) encourages companies
in the manufacturing and building sectors to carry out detailed
studies on their energy consumption – these are known as energy appraisals
– and to identify potential areas for improvement. According to

energy appraisals makes economic senses – each dollar spent on energy
appraisal typically generates $5-$10 in annual savings.</p>

the Singapore International Water Week and the World City Summit
in July this year. We have the President's Award for the environment

of an Energy Efficiency Certification Scheme and enhancement of
the Mandatory Labelling Scheme for industrial equipment – I believe

to engage in sustainability reporting, specifically by making the
details of the company's environmental, economic and social impact
publicly available. As this is a new Act, we want to give industries
time to adjust and we will progressively move towards additional measures
and a more transparent regime when we review the Act. For now, our
focus will be ensuring that the information submitted will be robust
and will be accurate and provide us with a better understanding
of the current landscape. This will allow us to stand a better chance
of designing better and more targeted measures to improve energy
efficiency in Singapore. I think we need to beware of being overly
intrusive and forcing companies to reveal commercially sensitive
data which they will naturally be reluctant to. So, with this approach,
build on trust, in order to build a relationship and to improve
their performance without being unnecessarily intrusive or anti-competitive will,
I believe, be a more useful and relevant approach at this point
in time.</p>

with the Minister that solar energy is the main option available
to Singapore. The others that we have tried include bio-gas and
waste which is quite minimal given the limitations. I understand
the Government has been significantly funding solar research with
EDB also funding solar and alternative energy research. The question
I would like to ask is: if not 10% for KPIs, what other KPIs can
we set for all these investments that we are currently putting into
solar energy and other alternative energy?</p>

is right. We have been promoting research and development as well
as early prototyping of systems including solar technology in Singapore.
For instance, there is an HDB precinct, I believe, in Punggol, where
we are evaluating the system, the performance of the system and
the economic implications of such a system. But the point right
now is that, even as of today, the electron that you get from a
photovoltaic cell is more expensive than an electron you get from
the grid. So Members have to be very careful that whilst we want
to do the right thing, we want to be more green, you got to be careful
not, in your zeal, to impose costs onto consumers. And that is why
we are taking a technology agnostic approach. And we are taking
a very careful approach in the rollout of all these new technologies
and green renewable sources of energy. We do not want to add on
costs to people.</p>

our people and I am somewhat surprised that you have been so enthusiastic

other times when Ms Sylvia Lim gives me "heat" on prices of utilities,

or large consumer, you are paying market price for it. I would rather
make it worth their while to invest in capability and technology to
conserve energy, and therefore to make business sense rather than
to impose taxes in the name of ideology or in an effort to look
green, but actually impose a burden on our stakeholders and our
industrial sector. So, this is one of those situations where I understand where you
are coming from. I appreciate your support for this Bill. I am just asking

that far different in our intention to ensure that Singapore becomes

                  </span>:
Sir, I would like to clarify my points just now about the taxes
or the new taxes that the Minister is suggesting I suggested. I
suggested two tax rebates actually for companies which achieve their
energy efficiency targets as well as those who have attained their
energy efficiency certification that they will be assessed under.
So, even though the tiered tariffs might result in some high energy
users paying a bit more for their energy, this could be returned
to the companies through the tax rebates. And, in fact, the tiered
tariffs that will be imposed on the higher energy users could serve
as a further incentive for them to reduce their overall bill which
would benefit them overall economically.</p>

am being a bit more constrained because I am acutely aware that
he is supporting the Bill. But actually there is a fundamental difference
in approach here and I cannot help wondering whether you have calibrated
your position with the Workers' Party, in particular as a whole.
So, let us go back to basics. </p>

is not a subsidised price. There is a market. The market sets the
price. Everybody pays for it. For the big consumers, they are in
a position to bargain to take advantage of the contracts which are
available. But the point is these are all market prices. We are
not subsidising them. </p>

add another levy on top of the market price, it is a real burden on
our industry sector. And if you say let us only target the big consumers,
then you can start playing games by having a big company decide
it has got multiple subsidiary units and qualifying for the lower
rate. All these are regulatory games which I believe are counter-productive.
The key point is to have right pricing for energy. It makes sense
for everybody to save energy to reduce their consumption and to
invest in more energy efficient equipment. But right now there are
some barriers to that – lack of knowledge, or the fact that sometimes
the split incentives between owners and users of a facility, or a
building, or because the payback period is too long. Businesses,
for instance, might be prepared
to invest in technology that can pay back in three years, they may
not be prepared to invest in technology that takes six years to
pay back. </p>

rather than play games with tax or additional levies, is to focus
on building up capability, building up access to information. And
in the case of technology that takes too long a period to pay back,
for instance, the GREET scheme in which we co-fund equipment that
will lead to greater energy efficiency for the company. Our co-funding
in effect reduces the payback period to a level in which the company
is willing to go for. By making these measures carefully and slowly,
we are enhancing capability, building up knowledge and, more important,
I am enhancing the competitiveness of our companies in Singapore.
I think this is a better and safer way of promoting energy efficiency
and conservation. Not by saddling our companies with additional
levies and taxes as what you have proposed. So, I do not want to
be overly robust to engage in an overly politicised debate with
you. But I just want to hasten to add that you got to be very careful
about the unintended consequences of your proposal.</p>

system. In many other countries, just in our own neighbourhood,
they are unable to stop subsidies for fuel oil, for cooking oil,
for energy. The logical thing is to actually remove subsidies and
then target assistance to low-income families who need access to
these essentials in life. But if you do not have a government and
a civil service that is capable of planning things rationally and
of directing assistance in a targeted way without worry of corruption,
you cannot get out of this subsidy trap. </p>

Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>
                     </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,
I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." The Government
began developing Singapore as a hub for international arbitration
in the mid-2000s. We have come a long way. The Singapore International
Arbitration Centre's ("SIAC") total caseload stood at 188 last year.
I have asked for a distribution of an Annex which sets out how our
arbitration sector has developed and some data on the caseload [<em class="ph i">A
handout (Pg 102-106) was distributed to Members</em>]. It will be
treated as part of my speech.</p>

reckonings, our position as the leading centre for arbitration in
Asia is now cemented. An <em class="ph i">Asian Legal Business</em> article in
December 2011 called Singapore's rise in the world of arbitration
as "meteoric". Singapore has become the leading Asian seat for international
arbitrations.</p>

One, broadening the definition of what an arbitration agreement
is; two, providing recourse against negative jurisdictional rulings by
an arbitral tribunal; three, clarifying the tribunal's power to
award interest; and, four, recognising emergency arbitrators and
interim orders.</p>

what is an arbitration agreement. Clause 2(b) deletes the existing
definition of an arbitration agreement in section 2. Clause 3 inserts
a new section 2A, containing a broader definition of an arbitration
agreement. The new section 2A incorporates Option I of Article 7
of the 2006 Amendments to the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration.</p>

an arbitration agreement which is concluded orally, or by conduct,
or through any other means, if its content is recorded in any form,
it will be recognised as an arbitration agreement within the context
of the International Arbitration Act. In our consultation last year,
a majority of arbitrators and practitioners were of the view that
the broadened definition should be adopted.</p>

jurisdictional rulings by an arbitral tribunal. Clause 4 repeals
and re-enacts section 10 to provide recourse against negative jurisdictional
rulings by an arbitral tribunal. Such a ruling is one where the
tribunal holds that it does not have the jurisdiction to hear a
dispute. The Act currently follows the Model Law in not providing
any recourse against such negative jurisdictional rulings. The absence
of recourse against such rulings may defeat the parties' intention
to arbitrate.</p>

have called for reform in this area. In particular, the Singapore
Academy of Law's Law Reform Committee had recommended that the review
of negative jurisdictional rulings be allowed. That was in its January
2011 Report on the Right to Judicial Review of Negative Jurisdictional
Rulings.</p>

stage of the arbitral proceedings can now be appealed to the High
Court, and appealed further to the Court of Appeal, if the High
Court grants leave
to appeal. The Bill will also allow the tribunal and the court to
award costs against any party for the arbitral and/or court proceedings,
when it rules that the tribunal has no jurisdiction.</p>

20 to clarify the power of arbitral tribunals to award interest.
Subject to the arbitral agreement, the tribunal will be able to
award simple or compound interest, on sums claimed or costs awarded
in the arbitration, from such a date, at such rate and with such
rest as it sees fit. In other words, full discretion will be given
to the arbitral tribunal to award interest.</p>

the definition of an arbitral tribunal in section 2(1) to include
emergency arbitrators. Emergency arbitrators provide urgent interim
relief to parties before the arbitral tribunal is constituted. They
are a fairly recent innovation in international arbitration. The
SIAC was one of the first in the world to introduce them. Other
arbitral institutions have now followed suit.</p>

will be clear legislative support for emergency arbitrators. They
will be able to exercise the full range of powers available to the
tribunal under the Act. Their awards will be enforceable in our
courts in the same way as awards by any other tribunal.</p>

the definition of foreign arbitration awards in section 27(1). The
amended definition will encompass interim measures made by an arbitral tribunal,
such as orders for the preservation of property. Such interim measures
will now be enforceable in our courts.</p>

miscellaneous, consequential and other minor amendments. </p>

mention that the Bill comes before this House at a significant moment.
In June this year, Singapore will host the 21st Congress of the
International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA). That is
a significant global arbitral meeting. It is the first time since
2004 that the ICCA is meeting in Asia. It emphasises Singapore's growing
status as a hub for international arbitration. The passage of this
Bill will signal to the international arbitration community our
continued commitment to providing the fullest legislative support
for international arbitration. Sir, I beg to move.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a member of the Singapore
Institute of Arbitrators. Sir, I rise in support of the Bill that will
help to further enhance Singapore's status as an international arbitration
hub. The Bill demonstrates our commitment to developing Singapore
as an arbitration hub through constantly improving the legislative
framework for the conduct of international arbitration in Singapore.
It is a very competitive arena, and to secure our position as the leading
hub in Asia, we have to work constantly to make improvements to
the overall environment. I am confident that the amendments will
encourage more international businesses to adopt arbitration as
an expedient alternative dispute resolution platform with Singapore
as a preferred site.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-55597947-61cf-4be2-83f4-6a5c1727560e">
                  <a name="id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-55597947-61cf-4be2-83f4-6a5c1727560e"><!--a--></a>I would now like to enunciate further on
the amendments and how I see them. For a start, the relaxation of
the writing requirement acknowledges commercial realities and practicalities,
as it may not always be feasible to make an arbitration agreement
in writing. This is a step forward.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-75fa479f-1113-4348-9c0f-34a1ac6fd453">
                  <a name="id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-75fa479f-1113-4348-9c0f-34a1ac6fd453"><!--a--></a>The critical importance in
the enhancement of the arbitration framework to strengthen Singapore's
status as a commercial hub in Southeast Asia cannot be understated.
For Singapore to continue to grow and prosper as a nation and maintain our
attractiveness to foreign investors, not only do we need the best
infrastructure and people, our legal framework must also keep up
with the times. The new provision for an appointment of an emergency
arbitrator is a fine example of this strategic development.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 67</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-350afbe9-63f3-451f-b573-21a08a3cc8e1">

environment, emergency arbitration provides for the swift resolution
of arbitration cases where timeliness is tied to the product nature.
The amendments to the law will provide the legal recognition and
alignment to what has already been practised by the international
arbitral institutions, including Singapore International Arbitration
Centre (SIAC). In recognition of the emergency arbitrator, I am glad
that the Bill has decided to take a pioneering approach. In fact,
we are doubly a pioneer in this area – the SIAC was one of the first
arbitral institutions to introduce the emergency arbitrator, and
we are now the first jurisdiction in the world to provide explicit
legislative support for such a scheme. The legislative recognition
of the emergency arbitrator is complemented by the recognition of
interim conservatory orders made by foreign arbitral tribunals.
These proposed legislative amendments would further widen the range
of options available to parties who require interim relief in aid
of arbitrations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9a880c80-3507-4f9b-854f-e754bccca0f2">

Arbitration Act was amended, the court was granted the power under
section 12A to make certain interim conservatory orders in support
of arbitrations. With the passage of the Bill, a party involved
in an arbitration conducted in Singapore who requires such relief
now has the additional option of applying to an emergency arbitrator
who would be able to exercise the full range of powers available to
arbitral tribunals, and the proposed amendment to section 2 would
ensure that such orders would be enforceable by the Singapore courts.
I believe that this amendment gives greater flexibility to parties
and enhances the attractiveness of Singapore as a forum for arbitration.</p>

negative jurisdictional rulings by arbitral tribunals, it is an important
step in giving our Singapore courts a greater power in making judgements that
are "non-interventionist" and to enable the arbitration process
to achieve its intended outcomes – which is a swift and speedy resolution
of disputes. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-50dbd99e-e74c-4f7a-b9e4-e954b65d6ad3">

this may be in conflict with the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law in relation to international arbitrations,
a "non-interventionist" approach should not be equated with a totally
inactive one. Taking a step back to understand the relevance of
the review mechanism, we currently have a good number of fully administered
arbitrations of which many are foreign entities. As the Minister
has mentioned earlier, in 2010, we have a total of 265 cases; in
2011, 235 cases, all from more than 40 countries. In many of the arbitral
agreements, Singapore is cited in the clauses as a venue for the
enforcement of awards. If there is a lack of clarity and understanding
from our judicial system on the execution of international commercial
arbitration, this would not bode well for us as an arbitration hub. I am
glad to note that the amendments will therefore help to close the loop
on this.</p>

the powers of the tribunal to provide post-award interest, this
is an indication of the further empowerment that our local laws
are allowing tribunals like SIAC to expand its rights to exercise
the judgement. Therefore, not only have we achieved economy and
efficiency in the arbitration process, we are also now able to tag
a time value to its effectiveness as a compensation mechanism. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, before I begin, I wish to declare that I am a practice
trainee in an International Arbitration department of a local firm.
Sir, the changes proposed to the International Arbitration Act by
this Bill are likely to buttress Singapore's position as an international
arbitration hub. Specifically, the amendment of the International
Arbitration Act to accommodate aspects of the 2006 amendments to the
Model Law, which has moved away from the requirement that an arbitration agreement
must be in writing – as proposed in the First Schedule of the Bill
– is one helpful indicator to the market that Singapore intends
to keep its arbitration regime in line with the arbitral norms around
the world. The careful and calibrated inclusion of certain aspects
of the 2006 Model Law amendments to our international arbitration regime
bodes well in Singapore's drive to maintain its premier Asian arbitration
hub status.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ed453eac-a78a-43fc-821f-684d214b7e7d">
                  <a name="id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-ed453eac-a78a-43fc-821f-684d214b7e7d"><!--a--></a>A second amendment, the judicial
review of negative jurisdictional rulings, has provoked a little
more uncertainty among some segments of the arbitration community, especially
since it opens the curial prospect of reversing an arbitral tribunal's
ruling that it has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute. In this regard,
Singapore is moving ahead even though there is no international
consensus with regard to erroneous negative jurisdictional rulings
by an arbitral tribunal. However, allowing the judicial review of negative
jurisdictional rulings is persuasive for a variety of reasons, many
of which were laid out in paragraph 12 of the Report of the "Law
Reform Committee on the Right to Judicial Review of Negative Jurisdictional
Rulings" published, as the Minister stated, in January 2011.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d3b560b8-7dfa-4a40-b109-a5ee53114042">
                  <a name="id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-d3b560b8-7dfa-4a40-b109-a5ee53114042"><!--a--></a>In this regard, the Law Ministry's
willingness to move ahead of the Model Law when the situation deems
it appropriate also speaks well for the continued and organic development
of the international arbitration space in Singapore, and it should
also continue to attract the confidence of the international legal
community. I also note the Ministry's willingness to adopt provisions
from other jurisdictions, specifically the tribunal's powers to
award interest, with section 20 of the Bill based on section 79
of the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance 2010 which came into force
last year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-21ab31ef-accd-4217-a47f-52af0ec46634">

consultation brief for this Bill that the Ministry is assessing
and requesting for additional inputs on the waiver of a right to
set aside an award and even third-party funding. This commitment
to constant review and revision of our arbitral laws is likely to
have a positive effect on the development of international arbitration
in Singapore in the years to come. And these amendments are timely
as we are already seeing other seats of arbitration in the region
slowly but surely stepping up their efforts to attract international
parties and clients to their shores. Mr Speaker, with that, I support
the amendments proposed.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill and let me declare my interest
as a lawyer and an arbitration practitioner. We have succeeded beyond
most expectations to become a global arbitration player, the paper
just distributed by the Minister makes this clear. For a small and
young country like ours, this is a remarkable achievement. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ed790d76-493e-4129-96e4-af9be4b82991">

itself as the method of choice of most large and multinational companies
to resolve disputes. And they will naturally choose to arbitrate in
a jurisdiction which has the political and legal infrastructure
to facilitate a fair, timely and cost effective resolution of proceedings.
This is where Singapore has succeeded in providing a real value proposition to the
world. Prof Michael Pryles, Chairman of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (SIAC), noted that Singapore is seen as a neutral
venue for the holding of international commercial arbitration which
is in a geographically convenient location and is supported by a
physical, legal and political infrastructure that is sophisticated,
skilled and of high integrity.</p>

and other countries are eager to establish themselves as centres
for arbitration themselves. In order to stay ahead, we need to provide
a proper legislative framework to support and facilitate arbitration
and our laws must reflect the best practices in the industry. The
proposed amendments align Singapore law with the needs of the industry
and are therefore a welcome improvement.</p>

I hope the Minister could clarify. The amendments propose that an
arbitration agreement will be considered to be in writing if its
content is recorded in any form, whether or not the arbitration
agreement or contract has been concluded orally, by conduct or by
other means. This is line with the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a2c76a1f-6fd5-459a-99c0-bd6f3948ce46">

the requirements for the agreement to be "recorded in any form"?
Would it suffice for one party to the oral agreement to record the
arbitration agreement without confirmation from the other party?
What happens if the parties both record terms which are inconsistent? </p>

as to the existence or content of the arbitration agreement, parties
could be forced to resolve this preliminary issue before they can even
engage on the substance of the claim? This would result in uncertainty
and higher costs. Further, some parties may try to delay court proceedings
by contriving allegations that the parties had agreed to arbitrate.
If the party appeals an unfavourable decision, the delay could take
months. How does the Ministry propose to ensure that these disputes
are resolved quickly?</p>

by the editors of Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration,
is that an arbitration agreement that is regarded as valid by an
arbitral tribunal or court in one country may not be so regarded
by the courts of the country where the award falls to be enforced.
By way of example, the Norwegian Court of Appeal refused recognition
of an award rendered in London because an exchange of emails did not,
in its view, satisfy the writing requirement under Article II(2)
of the New York Convention. Although such an electronic exchange
was sufficient to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement
as a matter of the law of the place of arbitration, the court held
that the validity of the arbitration agreement was to be separately assessed
by the law of the enforcement court. </p>

be helpful if some clarity can be given on the phrase "recorded
in any form", as any uncertainty may diminish our attractiveness
as an arbitration centre. With that, I support the Bill.</p>

are assuming there are thorny questions. In law, there could be
a range of circumstances taking place over many years and we cannot
be dealing with those sorts of hypotheses. We may have been the
first, in terms of the SIAC, setting up this process, but we are
not the only ones. I am not sure if the Member is aware that the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the Stockholm Chamber
of Commerce as well as the Dutch Arbitration Institute have similar
procedures for the appointment of emergency arbitrators. We have
had emergency arbitrators appointed since we started the process.
We have not come across any particular difficulties. So, I take
it that the Member does not have any specific points in mind and
would clarify at some point in time in future.</p>

clarifications on the new section 2A which relaxes the requirement
for an arbitration agreement to be in writing.</p>

mean when it provides that an arbitration agreement is in writing,
if its content is recorded in any form? The general intention is
that an arbitration agreement can be entered into in any form, including
orally, if there is some record of the content of the agreement
which can subsequently be referred to. Section 2A(5) goes on to
provide that electronic communications satisfy that requirement
of record if they can be accessed for subsequent reference. The
definition of "electronic communication" in section 2A(10) encompasses
emails.</p>

one party suffice? The answer is "yes". This is the answer we give.
At the end of the day, the courts have to decide. Our legislative
intention is that, yes, a record by one party would suffice. Section
2A does not require that the record of the arbitration agreement
to be confirmed by all parties. Of course, there could be disputes
as to the authenticity of the record if the record is made only
by one party or if inconsistent records by different parties are
produced. Those disputes would have to be resolved by the courts
or by the tribunal in the same manner that disputes on authenticity of written
arbitration agreements are resolved, or, for that matter, any other dispute,
on facts, are resolved. </p>

is whether the possibility of such disputes arising should preclude
us from recognising unilateral records. The answer must balance
the competing needs of certainty as opposed to flexibility, and
that is, of course, a challenge that both legislation and the courts
deal with in commercial law. In this case, the loosening of the
writing requirement has been recommended by UNCITRAL. When we held
consultations on the Bill, the feedback was also in support of relaxing
the writing requirement.</p>

issue of enforceability. This issue arises whenever awards are made
in one country and enforced in another country. In international arbitration,
enforceability is governed by the New York Convention. Under that Convention,
each country has some, albeit limited, discretion in deciding whether
or not to recognise and enforce an award. Some countries take a
stricter approach than others; Mr Kumar gave an example. Two points
are, however, of note. UNCITRAL's commentary to Article 7 emphasises
that its approach is intended to preserve the enforceability of awards
under the New York Convention. A second important point is that
many mainstream countries have adopted similarly pragmatic approaches
to the writing requirement. Jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Australia
have like us, adopted Option I of Article 7 in the 2006 Amendments
to the Model Law. UK similarly recognises arbitration agreements
which are evidenced in writing. France does not even require arbitration
agreements to be in writing. Thus, while it is not feasible to renegotiate
the New York Convention to make this enforcement issue absolutely
clear, we are moving in a direction that is recognised in other
jurisdictions.</p>

recognition of foreign interim arbitral awards. I would take the
opportunity to expand a little more fully on this amendment. Members
who follow developments in the arbitration world will know we consulted
on the 2006 Model Law's interim measures − Articles 17A to 17J.
Industry opinion was on balance against the adoption of those Articles.
At the same time, it was also recognised that some interim measures
ordered by foreign arbitral tribunals ought to be enforceable. This
Bill reflects an approach that takes these two considerations into
account. Tweaking the definition of award in Part III of the Act
achieves three things. It allows the same range of measures that
the court may order under section 12A in aid of foreign arbitration. Two,
it is enforced with the leave of court as with other local interim
arbitral orders, but with the added protection of the grounds for
refusing enforcement set out by the New York Convention.</p>

Singh's points, I think he is generally in support of the Bill.
One small qualification. I think he said that he welcomes the fact
that we have moved away from the requirement that arbitration agreement
should be in writing. We are not moving away completely. We are
loosening it. There is still a requirement that it be in writing,
but any written record, as defined in the Act, would be accepted.</p>

                     </span>: Sir, I beg
to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." This Bill enacts
the Foreign Limitation Periods Act. It adopts the recommendations
of the Singapore Academy of Law's Law Reform Committee's 2011 Report
on Limitation Periods in Private International Law. The Report was
prepared by Prof Yeo Tiong Min, Senior Counsel and Dean of the SMU
Law School. Practitioners, arbitrators and academics contributed
during our public consultation on this Bill. We thank all who have contributed.</p>

underlying the Bill. It deals with the application of limitation
periods. In common law jurisdictions, limitation periods prevent
actions from being brought after a specified period. That is the
case under our Limitation Act.</p>

law characterises time bars as procedural in nature. Therefore,
according to the principle that a forum applies its own procedure,
the forum would apply its own time bars, even if a foreign country's
law is applicable to the issue at hand. So you could have a Singapore
court applying Singapore time bars to an issue which is substantively
governed by French law. The effect of the time bar, when it is applied,
is to terminate the action in the forum. </p>

Supreme Court in <em class="ph i">Tolofson v Jenson</em> [1994], the time bar is
"determinative of the rights of both parties". It is not part of
the rules which "make the machinery of the court run smoothly."
It is therefore incongruous to say, on the one hand, that an issue
is governed by a foreign law and, on the other hand, to apply the
forum's time bar to that issue.</p>

have introduced legislation to reform the common law position. The
basic position is, if an issue is governed by a foreign law, that
foreign law's limitation period will apply; and the forum's limitation
period will not apply. Such an issue has not yet arisen in our courts.

of a more closely connected country to displace either or both laws

or interruption of a limitation period on the ground of a party's
absence from a jurisdiction to be disregarded. This would prevent
forum shopping by plaintiffs, to deprive defendants of the benefit
of limitation periods. This is similarly subject to a public policy
exception in clause 4(4).</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I support the Bill. The amendments mirror reforms that took
place in the United Kingdom in 1985 and help clarify the law. The determination
of whether foreign limitation is procedural or substantive leads
to much uncertainty. The Bill provides for foreign limitation periods
to apply as a general rule, without the need to determine whether
it is substantive or procedural. This move by the British in 1985
simplified their law and we will reap the same benefits.</p>

may extinguish a claim (as a matter of substance) or bar a remedy
(as a matter of procedure). As noted in the seminal text, The Conflicts
of Laws by Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins, the complexity of the law
forced individuals to navigate legal minefields. </p>

of the foreign country is procedural, an action will fail if it is
brought after the period of limitation of Singapore has expired
even though that of the foreign country has not. But it will not
fail if the period of limitation of Singapore has not yet expired
although that of the foreign country has expired. This has been
criticised for encouraging
forum shopping – where litigants choose forums which have little connection
to the dispute, but which afford more generous limitation periods.
It also creates uncertainty for defendants – as they may labour
under the impression that potential actions against them have become
time barred, only for it to be brought in a different jurisdiction. </p>

statute of limitation of the foreign country is substantive, the Singapore
limitation period will apply if it is shorter than that of the foreign
country because the case will be considered stale by the Singapore
courts. But once the period of limitation of the foreign court has
expired, no action can be maintained even though the Singapore limitation
period has not expired. In short, there is more certainty and less legal
manoeuvring. </p>

regarding the exceptions to the general rule. The general rule will
not apply where its application would conflict with public policy
and the period of limitation of Singapore would apply. This would
occur where the application would cause undue hardship to a person
who is or might be made a party to the proceedings. </p>

is problematic for two reasons. First, if we are choosing to apply
foreign limitation periods as a general rule, then we should embrace it
completely. If the party to the dispute finds himself falling outside
of the limitation period if his case was heard in the foreign country,
why should he be given additional time simply because he chooses
to sue in Singapore? The Limitation Act in Singapore does not recognise
hardship as a reason to extend the limitation period and I wonder why
we are borrowing a British concept of "hardship" that was in fact
not supported by the majority of their Law Commission when it considered
the issue in the 1980s. </p>

it would be preferable that "hardship" should only be relevant if
the foreign law on limitation recognises it as a ground to extend
the limitation period. In short, if the exception does not apply
in the foreign country, it should not matter in Singapore either.
Allowing such exceptions only encourages satellite litigation, because
all litigants who miss deadlines under foreign law will no doubt
argue that their case is one of "hardship". It creates uncertainty
and raises costs. </p>

be removing one area of uncertainty only to replace it with another.
Limitation periods by definition create hardship as meritorious
claims may be time barred in order to fulfil the idea of limitation
itself, that is, the protection of defendants from stale claims
and the encouragement of plaintiffs to proceed with expedition,
the preservation of evidence and finality of closure of a specific
period under potential liability incidents. </p>

in what scenarios where hardship would be considered such that the
exception would apply to oust the foreign law on limitation? Laws,
in particular, procedural laws, should be made simpler and clearer,
so that individuals will know their rights and will be better able
to enforce them. I support this Bill.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I thank
Mr Kumar and Mrs Chiam for supporting the Bill. Mr Kumar has some
concerns about the exceptions to the general rule which are based
on public policy and
undue hardship. It is a general principle of private international
law, or the conflict of laws, that a forum will not apply a rule
of foreign law which is contrary to the forum's public policy. That
is a function of the forum's court's duty to uphold its own public
policy. At the same time, of course, Mr Kumar will know, the courts
do not take a parochial approach in defining public policy. For
example, the Court of Appeal has recognised the case of <em class="ph i">Liao
Eng Kiat v Burswood </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Nominees</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 690 − Mr Kumar
may want to look up who the counsel were − and this was a case decided
before we had IRs in Singapore − that public policy operates with
less vigour in the conflict of laws than in domestic law. Relevant
policy must be "so important as to form part of the core of essential
principles of justice and morality shared by all nations", quoting
from the court, before it can be applied in the conflict of laws.</p>

point in noting that the majority of the UK Law Commission which
considered the same issue in the 1980s did not recommend a statutory
exception for public policy. But that was not because public policy
was not a legitimate reason for disapplying foreign limitation law
but because the majority was of the view that the existing public
policy defence at common law would suffice. That is the reason.
Also, the UK statute ultimately provided for an exception based
on public policy and undue hardship. </p>

Committee considered the same issue in some detail and similarly
concluded in favour of an undue hardship exception. Prof Yeo pointed
out in the Law Reform Committee's Report that there is now a substantial
body of case law in the UK on what would constitute undue hardship.
And our courts can refer to this body of UK case law and apply the
exception, of course, taking into account and applying it in the
context of Singapore and Singapore's public policy.</p>

general principles. One, the exceptions would not apply simply because
the foreign limitation period is different from Singapore. Otherwise,
we would encourage forum shopping. Two, it should also be emphasised
that the exception is framed in terms of "undue hardship".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0c0a47d9-052a-4666-8551-aea7ae3f4413">

limitation periods necessarily cause some hardship to plaintiffs
in that they impose a cut-off time for bringing in an action. But
that hardship alone cannot be sufficient to trigger the exception.
The plaintiff must go on to show that he would suffer greater hardship
in a particular circumstance than would normally be the case. One
example could be that the plaintiff was prevented from suing by
war or civil unrest.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-adb61db5-bade-4fce-b0e4-d2354cf647c9">

the policy reasons underlying the foreign limitation period. If
the hardship complained of was already considered in formulating
the foreign limitation period that would militate against applying
the exception. In practice, exceptional circumstances would be required
before the exception has been applied.</p>

to whether it would be preferable for hardship to apply only if
the foreign law on limitation recognises it as a ground to extend
the limitation period. But that could lead to a situation where
there is in effect no hardship exception because a foreign law exception
to the foreign limitation period is already applicable as part of
the general rule. Our view is that it is better for the court to
have some discretion in cases considered exceptional where the foreign
limitation period does not provide for an exception. I think we can rely on our
courts to apply these public policy and undue hardship exceptions
judiciously. Sir, I beg to move.</p>

Act was set up in 1992 to provide for the issuance of Government

Government Securities are non-tradable bonds issued specifically
to meet the investment needs of the Central Provident Fund. As the
proceeds from the issuance of securities are not spent, they are
invested. </p>

the outstanding amount of securities is $295 billion, and this amount
is estimated to reach $490 billion in five years' time. There is, therefore,
a need to raise the limit now.</p>

                  </span>:
A clarification, Sir. When Parliament approved the last increase
in the borrowing limit two-and-a-half-years ago, it was estimated
that the increase of $70 billion would be sufficient to last a period
of five years, taking into account the expected increase in CPF
funds as a result of changes in policies such as CPF LIFE and the
increase in Minimum Sum, as well as the expected growth in the market
for Singapore Government Securities over a period of five years.
So I would like to ask the Minister of State what new and additional
considerations now necessitate this substantial increase of $170
billion to the borrowing limit − how did the Ministry arrive at
this number of an additional $170 billion?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
thank Mr Chen for his question. Mr Chen will recall that in 2009,
it was a period of great uncertainty and we were in the depths of
a recession. As it turned out, at the end of 2009, actually Singapore
did remarkably well. We registered a growth of nearly 2%. The rebound
in 2010 was even faster and stronger than anyone had hoped for.
Our Resilience Package had not only served its purpose, it exceeded
all expectations. So the rebound was very strong. So in 2009, when
we made those projections, it was with a certain set of economic
conditions in mind, it was with a certain expected growth in CPF
balances which soaks up quite a large part of the issuance of these
Government Securities. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8131c2f0-e67e-4a38-9737-7ce3146e362c">
                  <a name="motion__id-8131c2f0-e67e-4a38-9737-7ce3146e362c"><!--a--></a>In summary, what has happened
in that time was that the increase in the Special Singapore Government
Securities was faster than expected as the economy recovered very
rapidly and exceeding expectations. As a result, the issuance limit
that we sought in 2009 is going to be reached much earlier than
we expected. So this is why we have come to Parliament again to
ask for the issuance limit to be raised.</p>

Investment-grade gold is essentially a financial asset that is actively
traded in international exchanges, just like other financial instruments
such as stocks and bonds that do not attract GST. Exempting investment-grade
gold from GST brings our GST treatment of investment-grade gold
in line with the practices of developed economies like Australia,
UK and Switzerland. This will facilitate the development of gold
trading, which can draw on Singapore's strengths as an international
financial centre and trading hub, to meet strong demand for investment-grade
gold in Asia.</p>

depend on who the buyer and seller are. What matters is that the

be readily accepted for settlement by international exchanges. </p>

                  </span>: Pawnbroking
loans are essentially secured loans. The pawner needs to furnish
items of personal property as collateral for a loan. The amount
of loan the pawner can take is limited by the value of his collateral.
He does not have to come up with cash to service the loan. If the
pawner fails to repay the loan, he forfeits the collateral.</p>

unlike unsecured loans given by moneylenders, where there is much
higher potential for individuals to borrow beyond their means to
repay. Given this nature of pawnbroking loans, pawnbroking advertisements
are of less concern. </p>

concerns and will look into introducing measures to regulate the

stipulating that such advertisements must not be misleading, and

to see whether there is a need for even stronger regulatory action,
such as restricting pawnbrokers' advertising channels. The Member
may also wish to note that the Ministry is in the midst of reviewing
the Pawnbrokers Act, with a view to strengthening protection for
pawners and enhancing corporate governance for pawnbrokers.</p>

                  </span>: Dr Teo Ho
Pin has asked for the number of summonses issued in the past three
years for infringements of the three-quarter tank rule. Singapore Customs
has clarified that there are none as the Customs Act was only recently amended
to allow the issuing of ticket summonses. Singapore Customs will
start issuing ticket summonses for the offence only from June 2012.
However, Singapore Customs reported that about 3,000 persons per
year were offered compositions to settle the case out-of-court.
The composition amounts range from $100 for first-time offenders,
to $500 for third-time offenders. </p>

my Ministry takes to ensure competitive pricing of petrol. The Government
maintains competitiveness in the petrol market by making sure that
there are no anti-competitive practices that keep prices artificially
high. The Competition Commission of Singapore, or CCS, conducted
an inquiry into the retail petrol market in Singapore in 2010. Based
on the facts and data gathered, CCS did not find any evidence that
the petrol players had engaged in anti-competitive collusive behaviour. </p>

                  </span>: Most primary

basis of 30 students per class at Primary 1 and 2 and 40 students
per class at the other primary and secondary levels. </p>

may be intuitively appealing, empirical evidence on the benefits
of a smaller class size remains inconclusive. Studies have shown
that teacher quality is the most important factor in achieving better
student outcomes. Hence, MOE's focus is on raising the quality of
teachers, even as we increase our recruitment of teachers. </p>

quality, our approach has been to progressively deploy more teachers
to the schools while giving schools the flexibility to decide on
how best to deploy their teachers to meet the needs of their students.
This may involve reducing class size for certain subjects or student
profiles. For example, in Design &amp; Technology and Home Economics,
where students may be required to operate machinery or equipment,
the class size is usually 20. Learning support programmes for Primary
1-2 students with difficulties in basic literacy and numeracy skills
are conducted in small groups of eight to 10 students. Some schools
also deploy two teachers in a class of 40 students – one teacher
brings the class through the curriculum, while the other teacher
assists specific students who may have difficulty understanding
the materials being covered. </p>

not mandate targets for class size, we plan to improve the pupil
teacher ratio from 18 and 15 at the Primary and Secondary levels
to 16 and 13 by 2015 when the Education Service grows to 33,000
Education Officers. This will ensure that our schools are well-resourced

students. </p>

The implementation of the Retirement and Re-employment Act has been
relatively smooth. Since the re-employment policy was first announced
five years ago, the tripartite partners have been working closely
together to prepare companies and workers for its implementation.
In 2011, about 79% of private establishments had in fact already
implemented measures to allow their local employees to work past
the age of 62 even before the Act took effect. Employers in general
are re-employment ready.</p>

services to employers, unions and employees to help them resolve
any re-employment issues amicably. If the issue cannot be resolved through
conciliation, workers may appeal to the Minister for Manpower, or
lodge a claim with the Commissioner for Labour to seek remedy.</p>

has received 14 re-employment dispute cases, mostly over eligibility
for re-employment. Several have been successfully settled, while
the remaining cases are still undergoing discussion and conciliation. </p>

should refer to the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of
Older Employees which provides advice on engaging employees and
in making re-employment offers. The Government has also reconstituted
a tripartite workgroup comprising representatives from the unions,
employer groups and the Government to monitor the progress of implementation
of the re-employment law and the Tripartite Guidelines, and to address
issues that may arise. </p>

important in helping us look after our older workers and to increase
employment opportunities for them. The employment rate of older
residents aged 55-64 has increased from 59% in 2010 to 61.2% in
2011. We must help our people, regardless of age, acquire the right
skills, and we must promote the adoption of age-friendly practices
so that older Singaporeans can continue to work if they choose to,
and to earn a regular income as long as they are healthy. </p>

                  </span>: Our Motor
Vehicle (Third Party Risks &amp; Compensation) Act (MV Act) requires
all vehicles used on Singapore roads to be insured against third
party bodily injury and death. This is to ensure that victims who
are injured or killed in motor accidents are not denied compensation.
There are similar provisions in the Malaysian Road Traffic Act.</p>

of traffic between Singapore and Malaysia, since 1975, Malaysian
insurers had entered into a Special Agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau
of Singapore. This Agreement requires them to settle claims for
their insureds who get into accidents in Singapore, in accordance
with Singapore legislation. Singapore-based insurers have a similar
agreement with West Malaysia's Motor Insurers' Bureau. Should accidents
involving deaths or injuries occur in either country, these agreements
facilitate third party claimants from both jurisdictions to file
their claims with the insurers on the other side directly.</p>

average number of foreign vehicles entering Singapore is about 400,000
annually, the majority being Malaysian-registered vehicles. At the

to be driven into Singapore. In this same three-year period, about
2800 accidents a year involving foreign vehicles had been reported.</p>

to augment our land capacity through reclamation, by building higher

                  </span>: Homework,
when used appropriately, can reinforce students' learning, contribute
to their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards learning.
Generally, parents and students appreciate the importance and value
of homework. However, the appropriate amount of homework has to
be carefully calibrated. Children have varying learning interest
and pace of learning, and may take different amount of time to complete
the same piece of work. Nevertheless, students and teachers have
found homework to be a useful feedback mechanism to check whether
students have mastered concepts and skills, and are able to apply
them to different contexts. </p>

a good opportunity for students to consolidate their learning and
work on areas which they are weaker in. It would be unwise to completely disallow
homework during vacation. Some amount of revision and consolidation
of learning during the school holidays can help students to be better
prepared for the next stage of learning when the new school term
starts. In setting holiday homework, however, schools need to ensure
that the homework load given is not excessive. There should be sufficient
time for students to take a break from formal learning to pursue other
interests, and take part in social-recreational activities with
friends and bonding activities with their families during the holiday.</p>

no "50-storey height limit for HDB flats". However, like all other
developments, HDB blocks are subject to height control, based on
planning rules, flight paths and other technical requirements. In
new towns, HDB already builds to the maximum allowable height. However,
in the Central Area where the height limits are less restrictive,
HDB may not build to the maximum allowable height. This is because very
high-rise buildings will require high-speed lifts and an additional
fire safety refuge floor. These additional requirements will be
expensive to provide and maintain. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: The proposal
to ban the sale of cigarettes to Singaporean residents born from
the year 2000 was first suggested in October 2010. There are significant
practical difficulties and risks in implementing and enforcing such
a measure and it may not result in the desired reduction in smoking
rates. For example, a person affected by the ban can circumvent
it by getting a friend or relative unaffected by the ban to purchase
tobacco products for them or buying the tobacco products while overseas, thereby
rendering the intended control measure ineffective. It would be
difficult to enforce against adults who provide tobacco to other
adults who happen to be members of the targeted cohort. It would
also appear unreasonable for one cohort to be prohibited from smoking
while their slightly older peers are allowed to smoke. When these
cohorts grow into adults, enforcing the ban would be even more challenging
as age differences between cohorts would become less apparent physically.
Studies have also shown that adults, be it parents, relatives or
role models, who smoke will greatly influence the initiation of
youth smoking. Unless smoking prevalence in both adults and youth
are reduced to very low rates, it will be difficult to stem out
smoking in the Year 2000 cohort totally. </p>

smoking rates in the world at 14.3% in 2010, compared to Australia's
16.6%, New Zealand's 20% and Thailand's 23.7%, but we remain concerned
about tobacco use and the health consequences. The public can be
assured that my Ministry will continue to be proactive in our efforts
on tobacco control, in collaboration with partner agencies such
as MEWR, NEA and Singapore Customs. In the recent Committee of Supply
Debate, my Ministry announced new tobacco control measures on cigarette
packaging to be implemented on 1 March 2013. NEA also announced
its extension of smoking ban to more public spaces. </p>

youths to advocate a healthy tobacco-free lifestyle. In 2011, we

Last year, the MOF and NEA conducted a survey on public sector cleaning
contracts. Responses from contractors were sought on a voluntary,
in-confidence basis via the respective Government agencies. Based
on the returns, contractors pay full-time cleaners a gross monthly
wage of between $700 to $1,200, with those performing supervisory
duties earning above this range. The wages received by general cleaners
engaged to clean Government offices are comparable to the industry
average of about $800.<a href="#fntarg_1" name="fnsrc_1">

of "national treatment" – where foreigners are given the same treatment
as one's own nationals – is one of the fundamental principles of
the multilateral trading system. It is also enshrined in Singapore's
FTAs and Investment Guarantee Agreements (IGAs), thus providing
Singaporean investors equivalent rights and privileges in a host
country as that accorded to those foreigners in Singapore. This
concept of competitive equality is helpful in facilitating and promoting investment
flows between countries. Naturally, countries do not grant "national treatment"

As announced at MICA's COS 2012, a total of up to $210m will be
spent on the Community Engagement Masterplan for arts and culture over
FY12-FY16. This Masterplan seeks to broaden opportunities for exposure
to arts and culture,
make arts and culture more accessible to the community and deepen engagement
of our arts and culture practitioners and enthusiasts. </p>

the Government will work closely with both artists and the community
to create a wide range of quality programmes and content that resonate
with and reach out to all Singaporeans. These initiatives can be
broadly divided into three priority areas: (i) promoting learning
and appreciation; (ii) seeding new interest groups, community networks
and ground-up initiatives; and (iii) providing more community touchpoints
for arts and culture. To ensure their relevance to Singaporeans, various
initiatives under this Masterplan would be continually reviewed,
and funding will be adjusted according to the needs and responses
of the ground. </p>

channel approximately 30% of the $210 million committed towards
increasing interest and appreciation for arts and culture. Under
this area, MICA and its partners would be putting in place initiatives,

to build up a larger pool of audiences and participants for arts

radio stations to further expose the Noise music talents on radio.
These opportunities complement "live" showcase platforms like Esplanade's
'Baybeats', an annual three-day alternative music festival aimed

as a launch pad for local indie talents, and plays an important
role in the development of these bands through the mentoring provided
leading up to their showcase. </p>

                  </span>: Residents
in Pasir Ris Town currently have four options to connect to the
Tampines Expressway (TPE) – at Loyang Avenue, Pasir Ris Drive 8,
Elias Road and Pasir Ris Drive 12. The Land Transport Authority
(LTA) has been monitoring the traffic flow in the Pasir Ris area
during peak hours and is aware that there is heavy traffic along
Pasir Ris Drive 1.</p>

conditions as well as expected traffic from new residential developments,
a series of road improvement works will be carried out to help improve the
traffic conditions. For example, due to upcoming nearby residential
developments, Pasir Ris Street 51 will be widened to dual-two lanes,
and the junctions of Pasir Ris Street 51 and Pasir Ris Drive 1 as
well as Pasir Ris Drive 8 and Pasir Ris Drive 1 will be improved. LTA
is also currently studying how to better improve the connectivity
between Pasir Ris Town and the TPE.</p>

leave was introduced in 2004 to provide time for parents to bond
with their adopted child. It is not a mandatory provision. Employers
who voluntarily grant adoption leave to their employees can claim
reimbursement of four weeks' salary from the Government. Employers

under the Child Development and Co-savings Act, on the other hand,
is part of overall efforts to incentivise more births. It provides
for 16 weeks of maternity leave for citizen births to married couples.
The 16-week maternity leave allows a mother to bond with the child,
as well as physically recuperate from childbirth before returning
to work. The Government reimburses the employer for eight to 16
weeks of the leave, depending on the birth order of the child. </p>

and maternity leave are different, it is not necessary to extend
adoption leave to 16 weeks. Nevertheless, the Government will continue
to encourage employers to support adoption leave applications by
their employees, as part of
family friendly practices. Adoptive parents can also tap on the
six days of statutory paid childcare leave (for parents with a Singaporean
child below seven years), as well as six days of statutory unpaid
infant care leave (for parents with a Singaporean child under the
age of two). </p>

                  </span>: Today, childcare services are provided
by more than 900 centres, operated by private operators and Voluntary
Welfare Organisations (VWOs). This variety allows centres to offer
a range of programmes to cater to the diverse needs of families.</p>

to meet MCYS' licensing standards in order to operate. Teachers'
academic qualifications and professional training standards are
also regulated. To raise the quality of programmes, MOE has introduced
the Singapore Pre-school Accreditation Framework (SPARK) for kindergarten
level programmes and MCYS launched the Early Years Development Framework
last year to guide programmes for younger children aged 0-3. </p>

services remain affordable, we support parents through the universal
childcare subsidy and the Baby Bonus scheme. A total of $209 million
was disbursed in universal childcare subsidies in FY 2011. Lower
income families can receive additional help through the ComCare
childcare and kindergarten assistance schemes. </p>
