<div align="center"><b>WEST ASIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Minister for Foreign Affairs' Visit)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs, in connection with his recent

tour of West



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



Asia,  to inform the House (a) how the governments

of  the countries he visited regard Singapore; (b)

how Singapore has benefited from the tour; and (c)

what  scope is there for improvement in  relations

with those countries of West Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



with  regard to the first part of the question,  I

would  refer  the  hon. Member to  the  two  joint

communiques  and  statements  issued  during   the

course  of  our  tour. If he would read  them,  he

would  discover  that  they refer  to  discussions

being conducted in a "friendly atmosphere and in a

spirit of mutual understanding" and that there now

existed  favourable conditions, according  to  the

communique   "for   the  promotion   of   mutually

beneficial  relations based  on  understanding  in

many  spheres,  particularly in the  economic  and

commercial  fields". Though  our  visit  to  these

countries  took  place at a time  when  they  were

preoccupied  with  the winding  up  of  the  Arab-Israeli conflict and receiving an unending  stream

of  more  distinguished  visitors,  the  Singapore

delegation  was  warmly received, entertained  and

afforded  generous time for discussions with  very

busy Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second part of the question,

the   personal  contacts  with  Arab  leaders  and

officials  enabled  the  Singapore  delegation  to

clear  doubts and misunderstandings in  regard  to

Singapore's  stand  on  issues  which  the   Arabs

consider  crucial. It is my view - which is  borne

out  by  the  two joint communiques  -  that  such

misunderstandings  as may have  existed  have  now

been cleared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visit also enabled us to learn directly from

Arab  leaders  of  their  political  and  economic

aspirations  and  in  what  way  these  could   be

assisted through co-operation with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussions brought to surface the large

areas  of  ignorance the Singapore and West  Asian

countries   had  as  regards  potentialities   for

economic  cooperation. I should,  however,  stress

that much of Arab aspirations in the economic  and

technology  fields would be met by the  major  and

wealthier  industrial countries.  However,  during

the  course of our discussions the leaders of West

Asia   thought  there  were  residual  areas   for

mutually  beneficial cooperation between Singapore

and the oil-rich countries of West Asia. Like many

developing countries, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



wary  of becoming too dependent economically on  a

few  industrial nations. The leaders of West  Asia

were  unaware, until it was pointed out  to  them,

that  Singapore had some expertise in such  things

as port development, public housing, banking, ship-repairing,     shipbuilding     and     industrial

development,  which  would  be  more  relevant  to

developing countries because Singapore itself  was

a developing country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third part of the question,

the  scope for improvement of relations with  West

Asian  countries will depend largely on  ourselves

and  our entrepreneurs. We cannot expect the  West

Asian  countries to court Singapore  because  they

have more suitors than they can cope with and with

far  more to offer. It is, therefore, up to us  to

take the initiative and convince the countries  of

West Asia that mutually beneficial relations could

be developed with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection I am happy to note that our

Chambers  of Commerce, industrialists and  bankers

are organising a trade mission to visit West Asian

countries to study and explore prospects. However,

this  should  be  supplemented  by  exchanges   of

cultural missions and promotion of tourism between

Singapore  and  West Asian countries  which  quite

regrettably our citizens are inclined to bypass on

their way to Europe.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, would the

Minister  consider  the  setting  up  of  a   more

permanent  office in that part of West Asia,  such

as an embassy, so that continuity of what has been

established  can be maintained, and  it  can  also

help  them  utilise and invest the expected  US$50

million which they get from their oil trade?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, my Ministry has always

considered such matters. But I have no doubt that,

as  our  relations with the West  Asian  countries

grow and develop, the establishment of missions at

different  levels  would  be  given  more  serious

consideration during the coming years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, in view of the

Minister's  reply  that Singapore  and  the  Arab

countries  are friendly, what are the chances  of

Singapore getting cheaper oil?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the chances of Singapore

getting cheaper oil are as good as the chances of

other countries getting cheaper oil.

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to improve service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   if  the  Government   (a)   will

consider the withdrawal of the licence granted to

the  Singapore Bus Service (Private) Limited,  in

the  public  interest; (b)  will  take  over  the

rights and interests of the Singapore Bus Service

(Private)  Limited;  (c)  will  take   steps   to

establish a statutory corporation to operate  the

bus  services and, if necessary, the other public

transportation  systems, in which the  Government

should  hold  a reasonable proportion  of  shares

directly  or  indirectly; (d) will  carry  out  a

proper  valuation of the assets of the  Singapore

Bus Service (Private) Limited and allocate to the

owners   an  appropriate  number  of  shares   in

relation  to  the valued assets at  the  material

time of share allocation and such shares shall be

disposed to the Government if required; (e)  will

invite  the  participation  of  other  interested

parties  and groups as co-operative members;  (f)

will  take  all  possible measures  to  make  the

operation  viable and efficient; (g) will  ensure

that  the  statutory  corporation  works  in  the

public  interest; and (h) will take all measures,

including  the provision of funds, to develop  an

efficient mass rapid transit system in  the  next

one to two decades to supplement the bus system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I begin my answer,

may  I  first preface my remarks by seeking  your

indulgence and that of hon. Members of the  House

if I provide an answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



that is rather long, in view of the fact that the

Question for Oral Answer tabled by the Member for

Kallang  is rather long, probably the longest  on

record,  covering one-third of the first page  of

the Order Paper. And in order to do justice to  a

subject of public interest, the answer would also

have to be reasonably long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first assure the hon.

Member  for  Kallang that if it is in the  public

interest to do so, I would have no hesitation  in

withdrawing the licence of Singapore Bus  Service

Ltd  (SBS). But I do not believe it would  be  in

the  public interest to do so now. Other measures

would serve the public interest better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS began operations about four months ago. It

took  over the assets and services of the  former

three  bus  companies  -  Amalgamated  Bus   Co.,

Associated Bus Services and United Bus  Co.  With

the assets also came many problems. For instance,

it  inherited  a  bus fleet, on paper,  of  2,000

buses of which over 400 were broken down and laid-up.  This  fleet also comprised no less  than  17

different makes. Many of the buses had also  been

repaired,  in the past, using non-standard  parts

or  parts cannibalised, or "transplanted" as  the

Member worded it, from other buses. In the  past,

there was much duplication of routes and services

because  of  the  depot locations  of  the  three

former  bus  companies and to allow each  of  the

three  companies a fair share of  the  profitable

and unprofitable routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the starting up of operations by SBS and to

ensure the efficient management and operation  of

the   sole   public  bus  service,  a  tripartite

committee  was formed. This is the  Bus  Services

Reorganisation  Committee  (BSRC)  made   up   of

officials from the Ministry of Communications and

Registry  of  Vehicles, the Managing Director  of

SBS  and  the  General Secretary of  SILO,  which

represents  the  bus  workers.  The  BSRC   meets

weekly,  monitoring  the operations  of  SBS  and

setting  the  targets for the bus  management  to

attain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal immediate tasks of BSRC are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To get the 400 buses now not in service

repaired  and  put back on the road,  as  soon  as

possible.  SBS  has  contracted  this  work  to  a

private  firm  of motor repairers to be  completed

originally by April at an estimated cost  of  $1.2

million,    excluding   replacement    of    major

components,  of  which SBS has on  order  227  new

engines, gear boxes and rear axles costing another

$2 million. Owing to the number of different makes

operated, a comprehensive range of spare parts for

all the laid-up buses is not available. Only 45 of

the  400  laid-up buses were repaired  up  to  4th

March.  Now  it  does not appear likely  that  the

balance  of  the 400 buses will be repaired  until

much   later  than  April.  The  situation  should

improve  when  the major components on  order  are

delivered.  To  speed  up  the  work,   SBS   will

undertake some of the repair work itself with  the

new  personnel it would be employing and temporary

repair  facilities that are now being provided  at

the  existing depots. In addition, SBS has invited

other private motor repairers to contract for some

of the repair work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To improve the standard of maintenance of the

buses.  This  involves setting up a Central  Depot

and  Workshop on a 17-acre site at Braddell  Road,

which  has  been  leased  from  the  Housing   and

Development Board for 15 years. This Central Depot

and   Workshop  is  to  be  properly  staffed  and

equipped. Building plans are now being put  up  by

SBS'  architects, assisted by workshop consultants

from   major   motor  assemblers,  repairers   and

suppliers. Under-operation of buses, through  poor

standards  of  maintenance,  has  been  a  serious

defect.  The  following financial  penalties  were

imposed  on  the  three former bus companies  over

1972  and  1973, before the formation of SBS,  for

under-operation of services: -



<pre>

          ABC         $ 46,000

          ABS         $ 73,800

          UBC         $ 126,350

                      ---------

                      $ 246,150

                      =========

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



Although  SBS has provided a performance  bond  of

$500,000,   it  is  not  intended  to  exact   any

financial  penalty  for under-operation  of  buses

until  after sufficient time has elapsed  for  all

the  400 laid-up buses to be repaired and put back

on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To require SBS to undertake a faster

replacement  programme of old  buses.  This  would

involve  the  purchase of a minimum of  1,000  new

buses  over  the next three years,  400  of  which

would  be replacements for old buses over 12 years

old,  and 600 would be as additions to the  fleet.

This   would   cost  an  estimated  $65   million,

including interest charges. Between November  last

year  and end of February this year, SBS purchased

and  put  into operation a total of 152 new  buses

costing $8.4 million, which increased the carrying

capacity of its fleet by 11,100 passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures required of SBS to improve the

public  bus  service involve investment  of  large

sums  of  money.  SBS started  operations  on  1st

November last year, with a paid-up capital of  $11

million  and  net assets (i.e, net book  value  of

buses  less  hire  purchase  obligations)  of  $30

million. The net asset value was determined  by  a

professional firm of management consultants,  SGV-Goh   Pte  Ltd,  in  September  last  year  in   a

preliminary  valuation  for  purposes  of  initial

allotment  of shares in SBS to its three component

companies - ABC, ABS and UBC. The consultants were

commissioned by the three bus companies  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair standard of service would require assets

of  some  $90  million. No one would  invest  such

capital if there is a certainty of losses  and  no

returns. Had the old bus fares, in existence since

April  1971, not been revised from 10th  February,

SBS  would have headed for substantial losses.  It

would  have  ended up like the Singapore  Traction

Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several conditions have to be satisfied by SBS

in  consequence  of  the bus fare  revision  being

allowed: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To provide better terms and conditions of

service for its 9,000 workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



by  implementing, in full, recommendations made by

the  National  Wages Council (NWC), from  time  to

time.  Also, the provision of adequate rest rooms,

canteens  and  toilet facilities at all  main  bus

terminals  for its workers, which are  practically

non-existent at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As SBS is operating an essential public,

service,  its  profits,  if  any,  should  not  be

unrestricted  and at the expense of  lowering  the

standard of service. Accordingly, its annual  pre-tax  profits  for the first three years  would  be

limited  to  a maximum of 8 per cent  of  its  net

assets  (i.e, net book value of buses  less  hire

purchase   obligations)  as  certified  by   their

auditors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Should annual pre-tax profits exceed the

limit of 8 per cent, the surplus would be ploughed

back  for the purchase of yet more new buses, i.e.

SBS would have to embark on an even faster rate of

replacement than that mentioned earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bus Services Licensing Authority Act was

amended  effective as from September last year  to

provide  for  an  Inspector  to  be  appointed  to

inspect  the  affairs of SBS,  if  necessary.  The

report of the Inspector could be published  if  it

is  in  the public interest to do so. I would  not

hesitate to use these powers if the management  of

SBS  is  found  to be abusing their positions  and

sacrificing the public interest. So far, the  need

has  not  arisen.  I  am  monitoring  developments

closely in conjunction with the BSRC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the intention to

withdraw the licence of SBS, establish a statutory

corporation, and take over its functions. I am not

sure  what  the  hon. Member  refers  to  when  he

mentions "other public transportation systems". If

he is referring to school buses, taxis, etc, may I

say  that there are 1,860 registered school buses,

350  of  which are under the NTUC Comfort  Scheme.

There  are  5,004 taxis, 1,225' of which  are  in.

NTUC  Comfort.  And up to 9th March,  a  total  of

1,135  Adult  Worker Contract (AWC)  permits  were

issued to 959 school buses and 176 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



goods and other vehicles to provide transport  for

workers.  Public Transport licences issued  up  to

9th March to vehicles participating in Scheme B of

the Supplementary Public Transport Service, number

290,  of  which 267 were for school buses and  the

remainder for goods and other vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for the Government to carry out

a valuation of SBS assets. A preliminary valuation

has  been  carried out by the firm of professional

management  consultants for initial allocation  of

shares,  as  stated  earlier.  A  full  and  final

valuation  will  be completed by  this  firm.  Any

reputable  firm  of consultants  that  produces  a

false valuation can be prosecuted, besides loss of

operating privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that accounts for part (d) of

the hon. Member's Question. Parts (e), (f) and (g)

would  require no answer, since I have replied  to

part   (c)   in  the  negative.  The  Government's

intention  is  to get SBS to institutionalise  and

strengthen  its management, and not to  set  up  a

corporation to take over the public bus operations

or   to  invite  others  to  participate  in  this

corporation.  There is no magic in nationalisation

of  the bus services. What must be done to improve

bus  services is to enable a reasonable return  on

its  net assets, professional management not based

on  family or clan relationships, proper servicing

and   maintenance  of  buses,   fair   wages   and

facilities  for  bus workers in  return  for  safe

driving and courteous service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part (h) of the hon. Member's Question about

development  of  an efficient mass  rapid  transit

system  has been answered by me in this  House  on

4th March in response to a similar question by the

hon.   Member  for  Kim  Keat.  The  position   is

unchanged.  I may add that action to  improve  the

public   bus  service  cannot  be  successful   in

isolation At the same time, we have to resolve the

increasing   traffic  congestion  on  our   roads.

Greater  priority has to be given to the needs  of

public   transport,   to   pedestrians   and    to

preservation  and enhancement of our  environment.

The problem we face is one faced by all big



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



cities   with  high-rise  buildings.   Since   the

redevelopment  of  the Central  Business  District

(CBD),  the number of people going to work in  the

CBD  has  increased more than five times, but  the

roads  have expanded less than two times to  cater

for the cars, taxis and buses that take people  to

work  at  peak hours. A recent count by  the  Road

Transport  Working Group showed that about  30,000

cars  go  into the CBD between 7.30 am, and  9.30

a.m. - just two hours - and of these, one half are

motorists commuting to work carrying an average of

1.3 passengers per car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Road Transport Action Committee (RTAC)

comprising  the  Permanent  Secretaries   of   the

Ministries      of      National      Development,

Communications,  Home Affairs and Finance  (Budget

and  Development Divisions) was set up in November

last year. This Committee is charged with the two-fold task of: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) according high priority to the public bus

service; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) adopting various traffic management measures

to reduce the present congestion on our streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following traffic management schemes have

been introduced: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As from January this year, Government and

statutory  boards  have started staggered  working

hours  for their staff, for a trial period of  six

months.  So  far,  the response from  the  private

sector to appeals by the Finance Ministry to  also

adopt    staggered   working   hours   has    been

disappointing.  The private sector should  respond

more   effectively  to  help  spread  peak  period

traffic and so ease congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The insurance industry has creditably

responded to the call from Government to save fuel

during  the  present world oil crises. Car  owners

participating  in car pools would not  have  their

insurance  policies invalidated under the  present

terms  of  these  motor  insurance  policies.  Car

pooling  will save fuel. More important,  it  will

also ease traffic congestion. In this respect,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Principal  of  the  Methodist

Girls'   School   in  Sophia   Road   is   to   be

congratulated. It was reported in the press



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



recently that from 1,000 cars previously  used  to

carry pupils to and from her school daily, she has

successfully, through the enthusiastic support  of

parents, reduced this number to 300 by promoting a

car  pooling scheme. If one school can reduce  the

number of cars by 700, or more than two-thirds, 10

schools could reduce the number of private cars on

the  roads by 7,000 daily through similar schemes.

So  if  employers, trade unions and others in  the

private sector followed the example of MGS,  there

would be an immediate easing of traffic congestion

during peak periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A widespread system of reserved bus lanes

which began with Robinson Road and parts of Market

and  Cecil  Streets on 6th February.  Those  along

Stamford  and Bras Basah Roads came into operation

from  22nd February, and the next would  be  along

Orchard  Road,  Penang  Road,  Somerset  Road  and

Orchard Boulevard as from tomorrow, 15th March. By

the  end of June, more than 20 busy streets in the

Central Business District would have reserved  bus

lanes  to  accord public buses the  priority  they

deserve   in  order  to  move  expeditiously   and

unhindered by other traffic in limited road space.

We are also providing more and wider pavements for

pedestrians  and  kerbside  bus  stands  for   bus

commuters, wherever possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Increasing restraints on private cars. As

reserved  bus  lanes  come  into  operation,  many

existing  kerbside parking lots will be abolished.

In  particular,  restrictions  would  have  to  be

imposed  on  private  cars  entering  the  Central

Business  District  during  peak  hours.  I   have

mentioned in my reply to the hon. Member  for  Kim

Keat  on 4th March that a plan is now being worked

out  for fringe parking of private cars going into

the  CBD  and commuting in special buses into  the

CBD.   The  plan  will  be  published  for  public

discussion    and   all   practical    suggestions

incorporated before implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me assure the hon. Member that

measures are in hand to ensure an adequate  public

bus service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



supplemented  by other forms of public  transport.

Further measures are being studied to improve  the

peak  hour  congestion in the CBD.  A  World  Bank

mission,  which  was  in  Singapore  recently   in

connection  with the Mass Transit  Study  project,

indicated considerable interest in the work of the

Road  Transport Action Committee and Bus  Services

Reorganisation  Committee and  gave  assurance  of

favourable  consideration  by  the  Bank  to  loan

financing  of  projects undertaken  by  these  two

Committees.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first  I  would  like to  clarify  that  the

reference to "other public transportation systems"

in  my  Question includes only MRT,  and  excludes

goods vehicles, taxis and school buses. I have got

several supplementary questions, and I hope I will

be  given  a good deal of time to do them justice,

just  as  much  time  as  the  hon.  Minister  for

Communications.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> How many supplementary questions

does the Member have?



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> I have about 10 supplementary

questions. There are still other courses left open

for the Government to take: first, to maintain the

interest of private monopoly and, second, to  take

over control of the operation of the bus services.

Will  the Minister for Communications now  confirm

if  any  assurance or guarantee had been given  to

the  Singapore Bus Service Limited that  it  would

not be taken over under any circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer is a simple no.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Will the Minister say whether

the  Government  will  consider  taking  over  the

rights  and interests of the Singapore Bus Service

Limited  when the services become worse,  or  when

the  services  become better?  Is  the  Government

stalling for time? And, if so, will a target  date

be fixed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it seems that the hon.

Member  has  other questions too. Maybe  I  should

hear them before I give him the answers.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> I will then proceed with all

my questions. Is profitability of an undertaking a

crucial  point  in  determining  the  Government's

attitude? Or is public interest of no concern?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister answers my next set of

questions, may I refer him to the statement of the

Minister  for  Finance  on  4th  March,  1974,  in

Parliament, and I quote [col. 76]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There have been suggestions that the Government

nationalise  the bus companies and  subsidise  the

commuter.'



<br>I  have  only proposed the nationalisation of  the

Singapore  Bus  Service Limited. I  quote  further

from the same speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But what happens when the Government

nationalises  a  company which  has  not  yet  got

institutionalised management, and corruption on  a

scale  rampant  in  the former Singapore  Traction

Company  inevitably  results?  Let  us  first  get

management  and services improved through  tighter

supervision from the Ministry of Communications.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes my set of questions. Can it be implied

that  it  is  not  against the philosophy  of  the

Government  to  nationalise the  SBS?  Can  it  be

implied also that there is a nagging fear that the

present SBS management is corrupt, and will it  be

more  corrupt if the Government were to take over,

lock, stock and barrel? Will it bring ruination to

the  bus  service?  If the Port  workers  were  to

behave   in   this  way,  it  would  be   treason.

Therefore, will the Government take such behaviour

on the part of the management of SBS as treason?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much productivity and leisure hours of the bus

travelling public is wasted. Will the Minister for

Communications stop nursing and molly-coddling the

SBS? Does he think it imperative that the views of

the   bus  travelling  public  be  sought  if   an

efficient and cheap bus service is to be  operated

by the State?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is, if the Government is not

willing  to take over the rights and interests  of

the  SBS,  may  I know whether the  Government  is

willing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



to establish a corporation, wholly or partly owned

by the Government, to compete with the SBS?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the logical explanation for the

Government's decision to spend millions of dollars

on  the  cable car system, which is  not  a  daily

necessity, or on the construction of golf  courses

which are beyond the means of the ordinary working

people,  when  it is not prepared  to  finance  an

essential  service like the bus service,  although

it  is  able  to do so? This is beyond reason.  We

have a lot of reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister believe that the bus service

will  be ruined to a point where it would be wiser

for  the Government to leave the management of the

bus company to the owners?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister want us to believe that the

Government has no financial resources?  Where  are

our reserves? Since the Government was prepared to

go  to  the  extent of lending its  assistance  in

getting  local as well as international banks  and

finance  companies, and also the Development  Bank

of  Singapore, to bolster the SBS,  why  does  the

Government  not consider doing so for a  statutory

corporation?  Does the Minister for Communications

consider  that the SBS, without even  a  Board  of

Directors   and   ruled  by  personal   and   clan

relationship, has far greater expertise  than  the

Government can command?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one last question on the MRT. If MRT is

feasible,  will it be in the hands  of  a  private

monopoly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All these supplementary questions

asked  by  the Member for Kallang are incorporated

in Oral Questions 3 and 4.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> I agree I have given notice of

Questions  3 and 4. And I have other supplementary

questions on those two Questions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> But, they have not been answered

yet.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> I think the Minister for

Communications  has referred  to  them.  If  I  am

permitted, I will now ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



supplementary questions on these Questions which I

have already given notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member is anticipating his Questions 3 and  4.  He

seems  to  be very impatient to get on with  them.

With  your permission, Sir, we may as well get  on

with Questions 3 and 4, and the Member can ask his

supplementary questions ad infinitum.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> All right. My next supplementary

question. We are always reminded that the SBS  was

formed  only  on  1st  November,  1973.  The   bus

services had been bad before SBS was formed.  They

are  now  worse. If something is  to  be  done  to

improve  it, it will at the best fall into  a  bad

state again. How long will it take to improve  the

services to the satisfaction of the public,  I  do

not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Why should the operating

losses  of  its predecessor-companies  be  of  any

material importance to the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next supplementary question is this. If the

running of public transport service is rather  bad

business  and  therefore in  order  to  make  good

profit the travelling public can only expect  poor

service,  as is the case with the SBS  where  both

service and the supposed losses are bad, will  the

Minister for Communications be able to say whether

the  operating losses are true and correct? Before

the Minister answers the question, it may interest

him  to  refer to the Government's White Paper  on

the  Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service

of  Singapore,  (Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970)  paragraph

3.7, wherein it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The management of some bus companies have noted

with  delight  [the  next few  words  are  not  so

important]  that after replacing their  old  buses

(some  as  old as over. 20 years) with  new  buses

their profits went up appreciably.



<br>What is the name of the game, when we are now told

that they are operating at a loss?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is, why is the Minister so

concerned with the existence of a private monopoly

by  nursing  the SBS? Why is he most  prepared  to

allow the present state of affairs to continue and

to  tilt  the  balance so that the register  shows

profits? Why prop up an inefficient organisation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if

I  have  to answer Questions 3 and 4 at  the  same

time, as it should then cover all the points  that

the   Member  has  raised,  whether  they  be   on

Questions 2, 3, or 4.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Questions stood on the Order Paper -

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase of bus fares)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b>: To ask the Minister

for  Communications (a) on what legitimate grounds

the  Singapore Bus Service (Private)  Limited  has

been  allowed to hike bus fares when it has failed

to  serve  the public interest; and (b) if  it  is

fair  and reasonable to impose upon the public  to

financially make up for its operating losses,  and

to   enhance   profits  and  raise   the   capital

requirements of a private monopoly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC BUS SERVICES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Operation by Government)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b>: To ask the Minister

for  Communications  to  state  the  capacity  and

capability of the Government to operate the public

bus  services on its own or indirectly  through  a

statutory   corporation  with  suitable  partners,

taking  into  consideration that our international

airlines,  international  shipping  lines,   port,

telecommunication and other services and  concerns

are expertly managed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the legal

authority for raising fares is in the Road Traffic

Act  (Chapter  22).  The Road Traffic  (Taxis  and

Buses  -Maximum Rates of Hire) (Amendment)  Order,

1974,  published on 9th February in the Government

Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 7 of

1974   issued  under  that  Act,  authorises   the

revision effective from 10th February.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons why the revision was necessary were

given at length in my Ministry's Statements of 3rd

and 20th February. Replies by the Secretary of the

Bus    Services   Reorganisation   Committee    to

editorials, reports and letters in the Press  also

detailed  the  reasons. I am sure Members  of  the

House would not wish to have them repeated here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the fare revision should have been

allowed  when  the  bus  service  does  not   meet

commuter demands really begs the question. If  the

old  bus  fares, which had been in  existence  for

almost  three years from April 1971, had continued

unchanged,  and  there had  been  no  interim  $25

monthly  allowance per worker, and no increase  in

diesel fuels and other lubricants, spare parts and

tyres, Singapore Bus Service Ltd. (SBS) would have

had  an  expected profit in the year ending  March

this  year  of  $133,000 but losses  in  the  year

ending  March 1975 and 1976 of $29.7  million  and

$42.3     million    respectively.    In     these

circumstances, it would be difficult to expect the

public  bus service to improve. No one will  throw

good money after bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projections of profit and loss, just quoted,

came from professional management consultants, SGV-Goh  (Pte)  Ltd,  who  were commissioned  by  SBS.

However,  these projections were made in  November

last year and did not take into account additional

cost  factors  arising later. These  cost  factors

are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the increasing fuel oil price which rose

last  December  and has gone up again  this  month

following  doubling  of the  crude  oil  price  in

January - SBS's fuel bill will be up this month by

105 per cent as compared to pre-November 1973;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the increasing wage bill which went up in

February  following implementation of  an  interim

wage  supplement of $25 per worker per  month  and

will rise still further in July when the NWC makes

its   next  recommendation  -  SBS's  wage   bill,

including CPF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



contributions and related items, went up  by  18  per

cent as compared to pre-November 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New projections which take account of these

additional cost factors and an, annual  growth  in

passenger trips of 4 per cent, as against 5.5  per

cent  by SGV-Goh (Pte) Ltd indicate a loss to  SBS

over the 15 months from April 1973 to June 1974 of

$17.5   million,  if  the  three-year   old   fare

structure remained unchanged,.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the old fares were uneconomic is

corroborated   by   the  poor  response   to   the

Supplementary Public Transport Service (SPTS).  Up

to  6th February, in the three weeks during  which

operators were invited to submit applications, few

applications by bus owners and lorry  owners  were

received. On 6th February an announcement was made

that  the  fares chargeable under the SPTS,  which

were  based  on  the public bus  fares  structure,

would be revised in line with the revision of  the

public  bus fares. Even after this increase,  only

189   buses  and  134  lorries  have  joined  this

supplementary transport scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair and reasonable that the public should

pay  to financially sustain the bus company or pay

for its capital infrastructure? The answer is that

SBS  started operations with a paid-up capital  of

$11  million  and net assets of $30 million  (i.e.

net  book  value  of buses less  outstanding  hire

purchase   payments).  To  get  the  bus  services

improved  to fair standards to meet the  increased

passenger  load would require net assets  of  some

$90  million. No bus operator can be  expected  to

sink  in this capital if they cannot see any  hope

of even covering costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidies to help meet operating costs would not

result in the improvement of bus services. Capital

investments of $65 million would have to be  made.

Adult bus commuters are already subsidising school

children  who travel on concessional 10-cent  flat

rate   to   any  destination.  Indirect  subsidies

through  exemption of diesel fuel  tax  and  other

taxes,  as has been suggested, would not have  any

significant effect. Tax on diesel fuel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



accounts  for  only 0.8 per cent  of  SBS's  total

operating costs. Other taxes and licence fees make

up  10.7 per cent. Together, they only account for

11.5  per cent of the total operating costs. These

go towards general revenue to pay for making roads

and  maintaining them, bus bays and shelters,  bus

termini,  etc.  Wear and tear by  buses  are  very

heavy  on  surfaces  of  roads  and  termini.  For

example,  after  the  Singapore  Traction  Company

(STC) packed up in December 1971, the former three

bus  companies, now known as SBS, were allowed  to

temporarily  garage the SBS buses at the  National

Stadium  car park during the night. When  the  bus

companies  stopped  garaging  their  buses   there

months later, it cost them $123,000 to make up and

restore  the surface of the car park worn  out  by

the buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that completes my answer to Question 3. I

now proceed to answer Question 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have stated that there will

be  no advantage in the Government taking over the

public bus services now operated by Singapore  Bus

Service Ltd (SBS) which has been in operation  for

only four months. SBS has shown itself willing  to

meet  the  targets and take such  measures  as  my

Ministry   and  the  Bus  Services  Reorganisation

Committee  (BSRC) have asked. It should  be  given

time  to  settle down, tighten management, improve

maintenance and increase bus services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question as posed by the hon.

Member,  may  I point out that Singapore  Airlines

(SIA)  is not a new airline but has developed  its

management and organisation over one quarter of  a

century.   The  Government  has  been   associated

directly with its management in the course of this

development for many years. Our port has a history

of  more  than  one century; in fact,  150  years.

Telecommunications in. Singapore  goes  back  into

the last century. The Government has been involved

in  the  management of these for many  years,  and

built  up  on  inherited  organisations  like  the

Oriental Telephone and Electric Company, Cable and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



Wireless Ltd, etc. In the case of shipping,  there

is  local talent with the knowledge and experience

to  operate a national shipping line. Shipping  is

as  old  as  the history of Singapore.  There  are

numerous  shipping  companies in  Singapore  where

experience  in  operating  a  major  international

shipping line can be obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the position with the public bus

services  is  different.  We  now  have  only  one

company,  namely  SBS, operating  the  public  bus

services  with  a fleet of 2,000  buses.  All  the

local  talent with experience in operating  public

bus  services  is in SBS. Prior to November  1973,

there  were  three  bus companies.  None  of  them

operated  more than 1,000 buses. Less  than  three

years   before  that,  there  were  11  companies,

including  the  former Singapore Traction  Company

(STC). Then, none of them was operating more  than

170  buses, except for the STC which was operating

about 500 buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government were to take over the public bus

operations,  it  would have  to  use  the  present

management of SBS. To do this effectively would be

a  problem with the existing manpower resources of

the  Government.  No government  officer  has  had

experience of operating a bus company. The nearest

to  such  a task is the officer in charge  of  the

Singapore  Armed Forces, Transport  Division,  and

that  took a great deal of effort to build up from

scratch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the

responsibility  to  ensure  that  SBS,  the   sole

operator  of public bus services, must be properly

managed   and  must  provide  adequate   essential

service. But it cannot be expected to do this when

it  is  operating at a loss. Even before SBS began

operations  on  1st November, 1973, I  established

the  Bus Services Reorganisation Committee (BSRC).

The  BSRC, under my personal supervision, receives

daily returns from SBS on the bus operations - how

many  buses were operating for the day,  how  many

buses  broke  down, how many are in the  workshop,

how much fare was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



collected,  etc. In addition, monthly  reports  on

the  bus  operations, as well as monthly financial

statements, are submitted by SBS. As from November

last  year,  SBS  is  also  required  to  send  in

certified  quarterly financial reports. All  these

returns  and  reports  are analysed  and  studied.

Officers  of the Registry of Vehicles cross  check

by  making personal visits to the depots from time

to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of all this is not only to monitor

the  progress of SBS and set the targets  for  its

management to attain, but also to ensure that  the

revenue it collects is properly spent. There is  a

limit  to  the return on its net assets in  buses,

which  shareholders in SBS may  earn.  Supervision

and  scrutiny are necessary to ensure that revenue

and  expenditure are properly accounted  for,  and

that   there   is  no  wasteful  expenditure,   no

corruption,  no dishonesty. The Government  cannot

allow  the management of the bus company any  fare

revisions   that   would  go  into   wasteful   or

unjustified    expenditure   through   inefficient

management or corrupt practices. The management of

SBS  would  be  improved and made organisationally

efficient.  The BSRC and I intend to see  that  it

will stay so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, this supervision is giving a team of

Government officers experience in detecting  flaws

in  the  running of a public bus operation of  the

scale  of  SBS. This body of supervisory men  will

develop  the expertise to help ensure that  public

transport will be run efficiently, not at a  loss,

nor allowed to exploit the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next three years, the job is for the SBS

to  get  at  least 1,000 new buses on  the  roads,

repair  the  400  buses that are now  immobilised,

keep   all  under  regular  maintenance,   improve

driving  standards  for safety of  passengers  and

others   on   the   roads,   more   courtesy   and

consideration  by  conductors.  The  best  way  to

achieve  this is through the BSRC. Nationalisation

will  create  more  problems  than  we  have   the

capacity at present to solve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my supplementary question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



is  connected with Question No. 2, and I  did  not

have  the  opportunity to raise it then. Does  the

Minister  know  that there is  some  talk  to  the

effect  that the only thing wrong with the  public

transport system in Singapore is that one  exists?

I  disagree, and in disagreeing I would humbly ask

the  Minister whether he has plans to improve  the

public   transport  system  by  introducing   some

commuter-discipline. At the present moment, at bus

stops  it is the law of the jungle, and not  first

come first served.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I fully agree with the

Member  that  there should be general  improvement

all round - buses, bus commuters and the public.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, must we carry

the SBS as a passenger?

the  motion* standing in my name as it appears  on

the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter

270),  approves the reclamation by Government of  that portion of the foreshore and  seabed

off  Pulau  Serangoon containing an  area  of approximately  122  acres as  shown  coloured

pink  and  edged in black on the plan  marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 9/73"

which   is  deposited  in  the  Land  Office, Singapore.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Honourable Members will recall that at its

sitting  on  30th November, 1973, this  House  was

informed  of the proposal of the Port of Singapore

Authority  to  carry  out development  of  seaward

recreational  facilities covering,  for  a  start,

Pulau  Hantu (Besar and Kechil), Pulau Subar  Laut

and   Subar  Darat  (Sisters  Islands)  and  Coney

Island. As the development involves reclamation of

land,  approval under the Foreshores Act was  then

given  "by this House for the reclamation of about

32.3  acres  of  the foreshores at these  islands.

Work on this reclamation will commence soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority now proposes to

reclaim  about 122 acres of the foreshores  around

Coney  Island as shown coloured pink and edged  in

`black   on  the  plan  marked  as  "LAND   OFFICE

RECLAMATION  PLAN NO. 9/73", a copy  of  which  is

displayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the

information  of  hon. Members. The reclamation  is

estimated to cost $20 million and the fill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



required  will  be  obtained  from  dredging   the

nearby,   navigation  channels  and  from   excess

materials   left   over  from  other   reclamation

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority is also considering the

reclamation of about 24 acres of the foreshore  at

Punggol  as shown coloured orange on the plan  and

the construction of a bridge (shown coloured green

on  the  plan)  to link the enlarged Coney  Island

with  the  mainland.  These  proposals  are  being

studied  in the context of a comprehensive  scheme

for the development of the Punggol area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land   will  be  proclaimed  as  State  land   and

alienated  to  the Port of Singapore Authority  on

terms  and conditions to be agreed with  the  Land

Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the  reclamation by Government of that portion  of

the  foreshore  and  seabed  off  Pulau  Serangoon

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Education what was, for the year 1973, the average

cost  per  student  borne  by  the  Government  in

relation  to  its  subventions for  the  following

educational  institutions (i)  the  University  of

Singapore; (ii) the Nanyang University; (iii)  the

Singapore Polytechnic; (iv) the Ngee Ann Technical

College;  (v) the Industrial Training  Board;  and

(vi) the Institute of Education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The average cost per student

borne by the Government in 1973 in relation to the

subvention for each of the following educational

institutions is as follows: -



 <pre>



                              Average cost per student

  Institution/Board                  for 1973



  University of Singapore.     ...  $3,928



  Nanyang University           ...  $2,222

  Industrial Training Board    ...  $1,760



  Institute of Education       ...  $2,570(1972/1973)



</pre>





<br>However, Government subsidy varies from course  to

course.   For   example,  in  the  University   of

Singapore, it ranges from around $2,000 per  annum

for   Accountancy   and  Business   Administration

students to $10,000 for medical students. The  low

figure  for the Ngee Ann Technical College is  due

to  the fact that the College receives substantial

contribution  from Ngee Ann Kongsi, and  therefore

less  subsidy  is extended to it by Government  as

compared with the other educational institutions.
