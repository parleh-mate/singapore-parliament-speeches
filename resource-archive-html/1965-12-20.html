Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the present, the Ministry of Health does not

plan to build a medium-sized market in Tanjong Rhu

Housing  Estate as there is no available land  for

such  a purpose. Arrangements were made previously

with  the Housing and Development Board to provide

the  present covered pitches for hawkers at a cost

of  $30,550 in 1963. It is too early yet to decide

whether these covered pitches should be demolished

and  replaced  by a small but not  a  medium-sized

market, if any is to be built.

<div align="center"><b>(Fifth Day)</b></div>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [14th December, 1965],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed

to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore,

express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

for the speech which he delivered on behalf of the

Government at the opening of the present Session

of this Assembly.".'. - [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  enforced  emergence   of

Singapore as an independent and sovereign State is

an event that has far-reaching consequences on the

lives  of  the  people of our country.  The  chain

reaction started by this dramatic event has begun,

and  has  become  apparent in  the  allocation  of

expenditure  in  the first Budget  of  independent

Singapore.   Foreign  affairs  and   defence   are

responsibilities  which we can  no  longer  avoid.

These  must be paid out of revenue. In the present

state  of affairs, it must mean that other  fields

of  responsibilities cannot claim as large a share

of  the  budget as had been the case in the  past.

Thus,  the  amount devoted to education next  year

has dropped from about one-third of the budget  to

24  per cent. However, it must be noted that there

has  been a drop only in proportional terms of the

whole  budget.  The  actual amount  allocated  for

education  in absolute terms has increased,  being

$129  million  or an increase of $16 million  more

than this year. In other words, education is still

amply provided for, and will continue to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



progress.  This  is because the  Government  fully

realizes  that investment in education is  crucial

to  economic  and social progress,  and  that  "no

single factor is more likely to bring about a more

fair and just society than equal opportunities for

education for all."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I outline the Government's education

programmes   for  the  future,  let   me   briefly

summarize  our past achievements. By  the  end  of

this  year, the present Government will have spent

nearly  $654 million on education since  1959.  In

return  for  this big outlay of public  funds,  we

have  built up an education system that has become

the envy of many less fortunate countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved universal free primary education

without  making  it compulsory. There  are  enough

school places to admit every child aged six  plus,

not  only  now  but for many more years  to  come.

Every  child of school-going age is assured  of  a

place  in a school using the medium of instruction

of  his  parent's  choice. Once  admitted,  he  is

assured  of  ten  years of primary  and  secondary

education, finishing at the minimum age of 16 with

at    least   a   Secondary   Vocational    School

Certificate.  Of  those  who  obtain  the   School

Certificate, no less than 25 per cent are admitted

to  Pre-University  classes  to  prepare  for  the

Higher   School  Certificate  and  entry  to   the

universities and the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school enrolment has shown spectacular

increases.  In the primary schools, the  enrolment

in  Government  and Government-aided  schools  has

increased from 261,000 in 1959 to 360,000 in 1965,

or  an  increase  of about 38 per cent.  Secondary

enrolment   has   increased  in   an   even   more

spectacular  manner, having risen from  44,000  in

1959  to 113,000 in 1965, that is, an increase  of

157  per  cent.  We should note with  satisfaction

that our total primary and secondary enrolment  of

473,000 represents about 25 per cent of our entire

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expansion in enrolment has been made

possible   by   heavy  capital  outlays   on   the

construction  of schools. In this year  alone,  15

new schools and four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



major  extensions  to existing schools  have  been

completed. All in all, the Government has built 72

new  schools  of all types, with 1,700  classrooms - excluding special rooms like the teachers' common

room,  the school hail, etc. - affording more  than

125,000   places.   These   schools   have    been

constructed at an average rate of one  school  per

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that no child in Singapore

shall  remain  illiterate on account of  financial

difficulties,  free  primary  education  has  been

introduced for children born in Singapore or whose

parents are Singapore citizens. In addition, there

is  provision  for  15 per cent of  the  secondary

enrolment  to  be free. About 17,000  pupils  have

been  granted free secondary education under  this

provision    on   account   of   their   financial

background.  Malays  who  are  Singapore  citizens

enjoyed  special  assistance in  education.  Malay

children have been guaranteed free education  from

primary  schools to the University.  All  in  all,

about  35,000  Malay  pupils  are  enjoying   free

education at all levels. Annually, large  sums  of

money  have  been  allocated for scholarships  and

bursaries. In this year, the Government has  spent

$1.6  million  on scholarships and bursaries,  and

this  amount  has enabled 40,266 poor students  to

study  in the secondary schools, universities  and

the  Polytechnic. In addition, the Government  has

also spent $259,000 in the provision of free

text-books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past five years, the Government has

fulfilled  its objectives with regard  to  primary

education.  From  now  onwards,  the  emphasis  on

education will be:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the improvement of the quality of education

at all levels;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the expansion of educational facilities in

the secondary and tertiary levels;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) diversification of educational

development which is essential for the development

of an industrial society; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the further development of education for

national unity and tolerance in a multi-racial,

multi-lingual and multi-cultural society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future building programmes will reflect the

shift  in the emphasis on priorities in education.

Less primary schools will be built. It is expected

that  by the end of 1966, six primary schools  and

three major extensions to existing primary schools

will  be  completed. In addition, four dilapidated

and  sub-standard-sized Malay schools - the  Telok

Kurau  East  School, the Telok Kurau  Malay  Boys'

School,  the  Siglap Malay School  and  the  Pulau

Bukom  Kechil Malay School - will be reconstructed

and  completed into standard-sized modern  primary

schools.  Work will also begin on two new  primary

schools  under the 1966 school building programmes

in Toa Payoh and MacPherson South Housing Estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of secondary schools will

receive special attention next year. In the course

of  next  year, 13 new secondary schools and  nine

major  extensions  to  existing  schools  will  be

completed, thereby providing an additional  36,000

places  for secondary students. Furthermore,  work

on  eight  new  secondary schools under  the  1966

building programme will commence early next  year.

The  building programme next year will ensure that

every child who is now in primary school and  with

the  eligible qualification will be assured  of  a

place in secondary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Second Development Plan, the

Government  will also build a number of  secondary

schools  to be known as Junior Colleges  specially

for   Pre-University  students.  This  will   make

possible  the  optimum use of teaching  staff  and

laboratory  facilities and relieve  the  secondary

schools  of the pressure for accommodation  up  to

the  Secondary IV level. Construction  of  one  of

these  Junior  Colleges will commence  early  next

year.   The   Junior  Colleges  will  admit

Pre-University students from all the language streams,

thereby bringing integration one stage nearer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to diversify our education system to

meet   the   demand   of   industrialisation   was

recognised as early as 1960. Today there are  nine

secondary  technical schools  and  nine  secondary

vocational  schools which can  provide  a  maximum

enrolment of 18,000 students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



in   each  type.  However,  in  1965,  only  4,600

students  were in secondary technical schools  and

8,600 in secondary vocational schools. In 1966  it

is   expected  that  the  number  of  students  in

secondary  technical schools will increase  by  63

per  cent  to 7,500 and the number of students  in

secondary vocational schools will increase  by  34

per   cent  to  11,500.  The  1965  enrolment   in

secondary  technical  and  vocational  schools  as

compared  with  the total secondary  enrolment  of

113,000 is only 11 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome the traditional prejudice against

technical  and vocational education in  favour  of

academic   education,  a  new  feature  has   been

introduced in our educational system, namely,  the

incorporation  of  workshop  facilities  into  the

secondary structure and consequent ending  of  the

separation of schools into academic, technical and

vocational  units.  In  fact,  all  new  secondary

schools in future will have workshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of Singapore as an independent

and   sovereign  State,  the  necessity   to   use

education as an instrument to weld national  unity

and  to  build  a nation out of its  heterogeneous

population has become urgent and unavoidable.  The

study of the National Language will be intensified

at  all  levels  without, however,  affecting  the

medium  of instruction in schools. For some  years

it  has  been compulsory for students  in  primary

schools  to  learn a second language. It  has  now

been  decided that the study of a second  language

will  be  made compulsory in the Secondary school,

beginning  with Secondary I in 1966 and continuing

on  to  Secondary  IV in 1969, when  every  school

candidate  for the School Certificate  Examination

will  be  required to offer a second language.  In

this  manner, all school leavers will at least  be

proficient  in two languages. This policy,  aiming

at breaking down the language barrier in Singapore

and  enabling students of one language  stream  to

appreciate the cultural and linguistic backgrounds

of  those  in  another language  stream,  will  be

extended   to  all  our  institutions  of   higher

learning.  In  order that the additional  teaching

load



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



should  not fall on the shoulders of our  existing

corps  of  teachers, extra provision  of  language

teachers will be made. In the meantime, in-service

courses  for  existing language teachers  will  be

intensified  so  as to raise their efficiency  and

effectiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the expansion in education could not have

been made possible without co-ordinated efforts in

increasing the number and quality of teachers.  In

1960,  full-time teacher-training was replaced  by

part-time in-service training in order to meet the

unprecedented  demand in primary  education.  With

Primary  I enrolment levelling-off at the rate  of

about  60,000 per annum for the last  three  years

and  a  declining  birth  rate,  the  problem   of

increasing supply is now overcome and emphasis  is

now  shifted  to  improving  the  quality  of  the

training  of  teachers. A positive  step  will  be

taken towards qualitative improvement by a gradual

reversion   to   full-time  training.   A   second

Teachers' Training College will be built under the

Second  Development  Plan to  take  in  fee-paying

students   on   a   full-time  basis.   With   the

establishment  of  this new College,  it  will  be

possible  for  the  existing  College  to  make  a

gradual  reduction in the annual intake  of

part-time  trainees  and  to start  full-time  training

courses of its own. Eventually, both Colleges will

have only full-time students for regular training,

and  more  attention can be devoted to  in-service

courses  for  qualified teachers. The  anticipated

improvement  in the quality of training  will,  in

the years to come, be reflected in the quality  of

teaching throughout our schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum and the intensity of training

will,  by and large, be similar to the present

3-year  in-service training course but crammed  into

two  years  of full-time training. On  graduation,

they  will  become qualified teachers drawing  the

same   salary  as  the  3-year  in-service  course

teachers.  The anxiety expressed by the  Singapore

Teachers' Union of a multiplicity of salary scales

and  more  favoured treatment for these  full-time

students will not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the regular school system, vocational

training  will  be  greatly  expanded.  Additional

training  facilities  at the Singapore  Vocational

Institute, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



the  cost of $1.65 million, are in the process  of

construction.  When completed  by  the  middle  of

1966,  the  enrolment capacity will increase  from

the  present 1,200 to 2,500. In addition, two  new

vocational  institutes will  be  built  under  the

Second Development Plan, one providing courses  in

the   manual  and  applied  arts,  the  other   in

engineering  and  building.  When  completed,  the

three institutes together will be able to take  in

about  6,500  students, including a proportion  of

those   with   the  Secondary  Vocational   School

Certificate,   for  training  to  become   skilled

craftsmen  to  meet the demand  of  our  expanding

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a higher level of technical training, the

Polytechnic  has  finalised arrangements  for  its

graduates in Engineering, Building and Accountancy

to   he  awarded  degrees  by  the  University  of

Singapore.   The  long-term  plans  of   expansion

envisaged moving the Polytechnic to a new site  to

develop  into  two  separate  units  -  a  College

providing training at Technician Diploma level and

an   Institute  of  Advanced  Technology  awarding

Degrees  of  its  own. With the  establishment  of

these  institutions, it is expected that Singapore

will   become   a   centre   for   technical   and

technological education in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, more attention will be

paid  to  integrating our higher  institutions  of

learning into the national community so that  they

will   the   better  serve  society.  Universities

represent the apex of the educational system in  a

country.  They  have an essential and  influential

role in society, and the quality and character  of

the  universities  are  bound  to  have  important

impacts  on  the social, economic,  and  political

life  of  a  country. The role  and  character  of

universities have varied from place to  place  and

from time to time. Universities are simultaneously

conservative   and  progressive

institutions - conservative  in the sense that they preserve  the

best  in the culture of a society, and progressive

in  the  sense that they introduce new ideas,  new

discoveries, and new inventions, usually  for  the

betterment of society. As institutions  of  higher

learning, universities throughout the world  share

certain  common  functions, but they  differ  also

because they have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



cater for the different needs of the societies for

which  they  purport to serve. It is obvious  that

universities in homogeneous societies with a

well-developed  sense  of national  identity  have  one

important   difference  in  role  to   play   from

universities in newly independent countries  faced

with  the  problems of building national  identity

out  of a heterogeneous population. Problems, too,

differ   from  one  newly  emergent  heterogeneous

country  to  another. Thus, most  of  the  African

countries  are  beset by the problem  of  building

national identities out of diverse tribes, divided

by a multiplicity of local dialects, loyalties and

customs. In Singapore, where we are thrown by  the

circumstances  of  history and  geography  on  the

crossroads   of   trade  and  cultures,   we   are

confronted by the immeasurably greater problem  of

fostering  a  national identity out  of  competing

cultures - cultures  which  have  an  inherent

vitality   of  their  own.  The  hard   facts   of

geography,  history, and demography in  South-East

Asia  have forced upon us the realisation that  we

cannot build our distinctive national identity  on

the  basis  of  one  race, one religion,  and  one

language.  Our  brief experience in  Malaysia  has

driven the lesson home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of history that our universities

were  founded in different circumstances,  without

careful thought as to the burning problems imposed

upon   us   by  the  complex  character   of   our

population.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  let  me  at  this

juncture  quote  certain extracts  from  the  much

publicised  Nanyang University  Curriculum  Review

Committee, a document more popularly known as  the

Wang Gung-Wu Report, and named after its Chairman,

Professor   Wang   Gung-Wu,   a   local   scholar,

internationally  known  for  his  scholarship  and

linguistic  proficiency in English,  Chinese,  and

Malay. Parts of this report run as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...there is an urgent need for people with a

deep,  rational  and sympathetic understanding  of

the   multi-racial  basis  of  the  country.   The

University should produce graduates able to  guide

the  course  of  the  country's  development,  and

trained  to  administer the  public  services  and

manage  the  growth of commerce and industry,  and

specially equipped to meet the nation's  need  for

rapid modernisation . . . It should be the aim  of

the University to produce graduates who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



are  at  least bi-lingual, if not tri-lingual,  in

the  languages relevant to the development of  the

country.  The University cannot depend on  outside

teaching  staff for an indefinite period of  time.

There must he every opportunity for the employment

of young but highly qualified local graduates with

a  deep  understanding of the  conditions  in  the

region.  In this way, the University will play  an

increasingly valuable role in the service  of  our

society.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the extracts I have just cited

were  written in the context of Malaysia and  with

reference  to  Nanyang University. But  the  views

expressed   are   also  valid   for   multi-racial

Singapore and for the University of Singapore.  In

other  words,  both  Nanyang  University  and  the

University of Singapore must reflect the character

of the society which they serve. But the character

and  the dimensions of the problems differ.  These

arise  from  the fact that in one university,  the

question  of university reforms has been  wilfully

turned  by anti-national elements into a political

issue  on  the preservation of Chinese  education,

while in the other the problem is one of adjusting

the  university  to the realities  of  society  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Nanyang University, the University of

Singapore  is not faced with major re-organisation

to  bring  it  up  to the requirements  of  modern

university  education.  Internationally,   it   is

recognised  as  an institution of higher  learning

with  a  reputation  for scholarship  because  its

standard  of scholarship and teaching can  measure

up  to  international standards. Its international

reputation   is  likely  to  increase   with   the

implementation of its development programme.  This

expansion  programme includes two  new  faculties,

namely,  a Faculty of Technology and a Faculty  of

Social Sciences. It also includes an Institute  of

Medical  Specialties, a Science  Tower,  which  is

about  to be completed, an animal farm to  provide

facilities  for teaching and research,  extensions

to the Medical Faculty and new library facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the University of Singapore, there

is  no problem of raising standards. However,  the

University  shares one common defect with  Nanyang

University. This concerns the sensitivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



of  the  universities to the  character  of  their

environment, and the political and social  changes

occurring therein. To begin with the University of

Singapore, this institution has been somewhat slow

in  its  responses. Nevertheless, it has begun  to

take  a  more  realistic view of  things.  It  has

admitted for some years already students from  the

Chinese-medium stream and from Nanyang University.

The  indications are that its response  to  social

changes and needs will he quickened, for there  is

a growing national consciousness in the university

as  more  and more local staff are recruited  into

the  university. In fact, about a  year  ago,  the

local  staff, with a few notable exceptions,  have

organised themselves into an association dedicated

to making the University of Singapore into a truly

national  institution, reflecting  the  needs  and

character  of  our  society,  without  sacrificing

international  standards. They  demanded  a  local

Vice-Chancellor to head the University, and  their

demand  was  met. In the University of  Singapore,

steps  have already been taken to revive the Malay

Studies  Department, and to strengthen the Chinese

Studies  Department in order to take  in  students

from  the  Chinese  stream.  The  Chinese  Studies

Department has already existed for about a decade,

but  it  has failed to measure up to expectations.

Obviously,  a  radical  re-organisation   of   the

Department is necessary. But more has still to  he

done  to  ensure that facilities for the study  of

languages  will he made available to all  students

in  the University. In a multi-racial society, the

intelligentsia has not only to be multi-lingual in

order  to  play an effective role in all walks  of

life,  but  bi-lingual  and tri-lingual  graduates

have  better chances in the competition  for  jobs

and promotions. Even in the field of researches in

the  arts  and social sciences, the bi-lingual  or

trilingual academic men have advantages over their

mono-lingual rivals both in the scope and depth of

their  work.  It is pertinent to observe  that  an

increasing  number  of Western  Universities  have

introduced the study of Asian languages  and  have

required  that  their  post-graduate  students  on

Asian  studies  should have proficiency  in  these

languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set out to build Singapore

into  a  model  multi-racial,  multi-lingual,  and

multi-cultural  society in this region  of

South-East  Asia.  The contribution that the  University

can make towards helping the Government to achieve

this  end  is immense. This is a challenging  task

which  I think the University can fulfil,  with  a

qualitative change in its orientation as more  and

more  local staff with a national outlook come  to

control the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of reforms in Nanyang University is

one  of  great  magnitude,  because  anti-national

elements   have   turned  the   efforts   of

re-organisation  into a political  issue  on  Chinese

culture.  Before  I  proceed,  let  me  repeat  in

Parliament  what  the Government and  the  Nanyang

University  authorities have categorically  stated

so  many  times  in  the past and  also  recently,

namely, that Chinese shall continue to be the main

language  medium  of instruction  even  after

re-organisation. The objective of re-organisation  is

to  turn Nanyang University into an institution of

higher learning consonant with the needs of modern

university  education in a heterogeneous  society.

This  is  a necessary step in order to fulfil  the

Government's educational policy of equal treatment

for  four  languages - Malay, Chinese, Tamil,  and

English.  Let me repeat the main features  of  the

Government's  policy on languages.  Malay  is  the

national  language.  The  official  languages  are

Malay,  Chinese, Tamil, and English. In education,

there  is  no discrimination against any of  these

languages. All four language streams of  education

have been accorded equal treatment. The Government

has  not  only  been giving full  grant-in-aid  to

aided Chinese schools, but has also actively built

schools  for  the Chinese language streams.  There

were  only nine Government Chinese medium  schools

before  June  1959.  Today,  there  are  60   such

schools, 28 of which are secondary schools and  32

are  primary  schools. This has  made  possible  a

major  increase  in  the enrolment  in  Government

Chinese medium schools. In 1959, the year in which

the P.A.P. became the Government of Singapore, the

enrolment  in Government Chinese schools  amounted

to only 6,500. Today, the enrolment is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



about  35,000,  or an increase of nearly  540  per

cent  in  enrolment  within six  years.  All  this

increase  and  future increases mean that  Nanyang

University  has to be re-organised so  that  those

who  have  the  necessary qualifications  will  be

given  a proper university education that is their

due.   Re-organisation  means   better   qualified

teachers for the Chinese-medium schools, with  the

result that the quality of Chinese education  will

be  improved. It also means that Nanyang graduates

will  have the necessary qualifications to compete

for   other  jobs.  The  best  of  them  will   be

acceptable   to   do   post-graduate    work    in

universities  abroad, with improved prospects  for

even  better  and  more lucrative jobs,  including

employment in Nanyang University itself, when they

return with post-graduate degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, Sir, the re-organisation of Nanyang

University will benefit Chinese education  at  all

levels  as  well as open up new opportunities  for

Nanyang   graduates.  Each  and  every  individual

graduate will gain by these changes; society  will

also  gain by them. For there is a great  deal  of

talent  in the Chinese stream which has never  had

the   opportunity  for  development  because   the

education  system has not been adequately  staffed

and,  at  university level, properly organised  to

give it full opportunity for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real question which the nation has to face is

whether Nanyang University is to be allowed to  be

re-organised  quietly  and  peacefully   so   that

Chinese education will improve in quality  at  all

levels   within  the  context  of  a  multi-racial

nation, and Nanyang graduates will be in an  equal

position  to compete for jobs and play a  positive

role in the life of a multi-cultural society. This

is  the real issue which all those who profess  to

love Chinese education must face. The issue is not

the   preservation  or  destruction   of   Chinese

education. Unfortunately, the Barisan Sosialis and

other  pro-Communist organisations  have  confused

the  real  issue and presented the re-organisation

as  an attempt to kill Chinese education and  turn

Nanyang  University  into an  English  University.

Before  I  explain how the anti-national Communist

elements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



stirred up a campaign against re-organisation, let

me  briefly explain what they hoped to gain by it.

Since  1961,  the fortunes of the Communist  Party

and  its  front  organisations, like  the  Barisan

Sosialis, have gone from bad to worse. By fighting

against  merger and Malaysia, by getting  involved

with  the Brunei revolt and the P.K.I., they  have

exposed  themselves before the  public.  There  is

hardly any major issue left in Singapore for  them

to  exploit  except communalism.  And  it  is  not

impossible   to  stir  up  Chinese   feelings   on

questions  of Chinese education, with  unavoidable

increase in communal feelings between the  Chinese

and other cultural groups. The re-organisation  of

Nanyang  presents  for  the Communists  and  their

supporters an Opportunity to stir up trouble.  But

the re-organisation of Nanyang University presents

to  them more than just an opportunity to stir  up

communal  feelings; it is also a threat  to  their

sources  of  supply of new recruits. With  Nanyang

University   re-organised,   and   its   graduates

equipped for better jobs and a meaningful role  in

our  society, their sources of supply will dry up.

Furthermore,  it  will no longer be  possible  for

them  to  make  use  of  Chinese  education  as  a

political issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons then, the re-organisation of

Nanyang University has falsely been presented as a

move  to kill Chinese education. Unfortunately,  a

number of errors in the Chinese translation of the

Report  had been mischievously exploited  to  lend

credence   to   their  distortion   that   Nanyang

University  was  to be converted into  an  English

University.  Under the pretext of the preservation

of  Chinese  education, a group  of  pro-Communist

students  carried out a boycott  of  classes.  The

boycott  is a familiar technique employed  by  the

Communists  when  they  stir  up  trouble  in  the

Chinese  educational stream. It involves violence,

intimidation, and even arson, in the present case,

the   agitators  resorted  to  physical   violence

against   the  Acting  Vice-Chancellor  and   some

members of the academic and non-academic staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They intimidated and forcibly prevented students

from  attending classes. They committed  vandalism

by  tampering with the locks of lecture rooms, and

defacing  all the University buildings except  the

library.  They even tried to burn down a dormitory

block.  It  is  estimated that it  will  cost  the

Singapore  taxpayer some $100,000 to renovate  and

repair   the   damages  done  to  the   University

buildings.  It  will be noted that these  criminal

and  destructive acts had been perpetrated against

Nanyang  University - itself a  symbol  of  Chinese

education and culture - by people who professed to

preserve  Chinese  education and  language.  Their

actions  only served to prove their hypocrisy.  In

their   campaign  of  vandalism  and  boycott   of

classes,  the  agitators  were  openly  aided  and

abetted   by   the   usual   pro-Communist   front

organisations, the Barisan Sosialis, the Old Boys'

Associations, and some trade unions. Unfortunately

for  them, the public was not convinced  that  the

Government   was   anti-Chinese   education    and

language.  Without  public  support,  the  boycott

collapsed ignominously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University authorities have taken

disciplinary  action against 85 students  involved

in  the agitations. Nearly half of them came  from

the   Federation.  It  would  appear   that   many

Federation  students find the relative  liberalism

and  freedom in Singapore a convenient  place  for

them  to manifest their suppressed grievances  and

frustrations  over the years in  their  home  town

where  the  cry  was and still is "One  race,  one

language, and one religion."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out that with separation

these  students  are now in the  territory  of  an

independent  country, which has not  only  allowed

them  to  pursue their studies here but  has  also

subsidised their studies at Nanyang University  at

public   expense,  an  educational  responsibility

which   their   own  Government  has  consistently

refused  to  shoulder. We are  quite  prepared  to

continue  allowing them to come  here  for  higher

education,  and  even subsidise their  studies  at

Nanyang  University, for, despite  separation,  we

are  still one people. But the Government  expects

them to observe the laws of the country and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



discipline  of the University while  they  are  in

Singapore.  It  would be a pity if the  Government

had  to  send them back to the Federation half-way

through   their  studies  -  a  step   which   the

Government would be reluctant to take.  They  have

chosen  the  wrong battleground to fight  for  the

preservation  of Chinese language, education,  and

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since re-organisation began in Nan-yang last

July,  the  Government has donated  a  sum  of  $1

million  for  a new Library Building. Construction

work  on  the  Library  has  begun,  and  will  be

completed  by about July 1966. Another $1  million

has   also  been  granted  for  the  purchase   of

scientific equipment and library books. To  enable

the  University to lower the fees for students who

are  Singapore citizens, Government subsidised the

University  to the extent of $81,000 in  1964  and

$137,000 in 1965. In addition, it is expected that

the  Government  will  have  advanced,  since

re-organisation,  a  total of $1.86  million  to  the

University by the end of this year to make up  the

deficit  in recurrent expenditure. As further

re-organisation takes place, Government will increase

its  financial  assistance to the  University  for

both    recurrent    expenditure    and    capital

development, so that the University may develop on

a  sound financial footing into an institution  of

high   academic  standing,  free  from  subversive

influences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of adult education, the Lembaga

Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, now in its sixth year of

existence, continues to provide a valuable service

not   only  towards  eradicating  illiteracy   and

raising   standards  of  education  among  adults,

including the provision of facilities for learning

a  second  or  third  language for  those  already

proficient in one, the running of academic classes

up  to and including pre-university education, and

conducting   vocational  classes,  but   also   in

widening  the outlook of the citizens of Singapore

by providing extra-mural courses to enable them to

make  more fruitful use of their leisure time.  In

1960,  the  total student population  was  20,000.

This year it has increased to 50,000. To cope with

the expansion of activities in this field, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



new  Adult Education Centre will be built  by  the

Government under the Second Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have set out some of the

problems connected with education we have to face,

and   certain  targets  to  be  achieved  in   the

immediate future. However, the efforts to  achieve

these targets would be hampered should there be an

influx  of  children  of  school-going  age   from

outside  Singapore.  As  the  Prime  Minister  has

explained  to this House a few days ago,  when  he

moved  a  Motion of Thanks to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara for his Speech, `In the short-term, we have

had  to  introduce certain new measures  in  order

that  we  can  take stock of what our  liabilities

are,  our immediate liability to give jobs to  our

own... citizens, provide schools for their children,

hospitals  and social community services,  housing

and  so  on.' To this end, we have taken steps  to

tighten  rules governing admission to schools  and

to  revise school fees for non-Singapore  citizens

by  requiring them to pay for the actual  cost  of

education. It is a well-known fact that  education

is   taking   up  a  substantial  and   increasing

proportion of the annual budget of Singapore.  The

number  of  children  born outside  Singapore  and

whose  parents are not Singapore citizens admitted

to  schools in Singapore has been on the  increase

each  year  from  874 in 1960 to  2,026  in  1965.

Already  in 1965, the Government had to  subsidise

nearly $1.4 million on these children who are  not

Singapore  citizens. Obviously, it is  unfair  for

the people of Singapore to pay for the failure  of

another Government to provide for the education of

its citizens to the extent of ultimately affecting

our ability to cater for the educational needs  of

our   own   citizens.  Nevertheless,  the  special

relationship  between the people of Singapore  and

those   of   Malaysia   has   been   taken    into

consideration  by the fact that children  of

non-Singapore citizens who are in Singapore  with  the

concurrence of the Singapore Government or who are

permanent residents of Singapore on or before 31st

December,  1961,  will  not  be  affected  by  the

increase in school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



fees.  This concession, in practice, will  benefit

many Malaysian citizens now in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his address to this House a few days ago, the

Member for Bras Basah has referred to anomalies in

the  salary  structure of the teaching service.  I

must  point  out that the multiplicity  of  salary

scales  and  the complexities of problems  arising

therefrom  are not the makings of this Government.

The  Member for Bras Basah is aware of the complex

nature of the problem and, because any revision in

the salary structure for teachers will have direct

repercussions   on   the   other   services,   the

Government  had  decided  to  appoint  a  Salaries

Commission to review the salary structure  of  the

Government  services as a whole jointly  with  the

then  Federal Government. Since then we have  been

notified  that we are no longer a Member  of  this

Joint  Salaries  Commission, and,  therefore,  the

Government  has  now  decided  to  appoint  a  new

Salaries Commission of our own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as anxious as the Member for Bras Basah to

settle   the  long-standing  issues  as  soon   as

possible  because, as the Member has pointed  out,

dissatisfied teachers cannot give of  their  best.

However, it is heartening to note that the problem

is   one   of  rationalisation  of  the   existing

multiplicity  of  salary scales  in  the  teaching

service  and  not a question of under-remuneration

for service performed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised certain problems

regarding Tamil education at secondary level. I am

aware   of  the  problems  that  she  has   posed,

especially  in  respect of shortage  of  qualified

secondary  school  teachers as well  as  qualified

teacher-educators   in  the   Teachers'   Training

College.   I  shall  certainly  look  into   these

problems,  including the desirability  of  sending

students to India for higher studies with  a  view

to  subsequent  service in our secondary  schools,

and  the feasibility of recruiting qualified Tamil

secondary school teachers from India on short-term

contracts.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, I wish to associate myself with my

colleagues in expressing my thanks to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara for his speech on 8th December. In

his speech in this Assembly, His Excellency said

that Singapore is undergoing a new history because

Singapore is now an independent and sovereign

State. Now that Singapore has obtained its

independence, we can show to the world that the

people of Singapore can live in peace and

prosperity in a multi-racial, multi-lingual,

multi-religious and multi-cultural society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while we are making every effort to

build  up  our  newly  independent  and  sovereign

country,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  chosen  to

boycott  this  Assembly on the  pretext  that  the

present  Government  is not democratic.  But,  Mr

Speaker,  you know that the Barisan Sosialis  have

no  more  life  in the independent  and  sovereign

State  of  Singapore. The reason why  the  Barisan

Sosialis have boycotted this Assembly is that they

are  now  in a precarious position. We have  proof

that  the  leaders  of  the Barisan  Sosialis  are

quarrelling among themselves on ideologies. As you

know,   the  Rightist  Secretary-General  of   the

Barisan Sosialis is receiving medical attention at

Woodbridge Hospital. A number of their leaders are

in  an uncertain position. If the Barisan Sosialis

are still in Singapore, they will definitely be in

this  Chamber  to  argue in the  interest  of  the

people. They were elected to this Assembly by  the

people,  but they were unable to give their  views

in  the  interest of the people. You  may  perhaps

remember, Mr Speaker, the time when the  Chairman

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis gave a speech  in  this

Assembly  which lasted seven hours. He thought  he

was a champion fighting for the rights of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



the  people.  But now not even one Member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  is  seen here.  One  point  can

clarify  this.  If  I  am  not  mistaken,  in  the

Assembly on Friday, there was a Question for  Oral

Answer  put  up  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  This

concerns  the  workers in a Bee-boon  company  who

lost   their  jobs  where  the  Barisan   Sosialis

themselves were the leaders of the workers there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not only the people who have

lost  faith in the Barisan Sosialis. Many  workers

at one time had faith that the Barisan Sosialis is

a Party that can lead the people, but they finally

realised  that  they had been led  up  the  garden

path.  Many  workers have lost employment  because

they  have been led astray. Many of the firms  had

to  dismiss their workers and close down. This  is

all  because of the Barisan Sosialis who  led  the

pro-Communist unions. Many workers' unions,  which

were formerly with the Barisan Sosialis, have  now

withdrawn   their  membership  and   have   joined

national  unions  which are  affiliated  with  the

N.T.U.C.  This  is  a  clear indication  that  the

influence of the Barisan Sosialis in the  Assembly

today is dwindling. It is not because Singapore is

no  longer enjoying democracy but because  of  the

realisation  by  the  people  in  regard  to   the

leadership of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to stress in this House what

I  have  said just now. Singapore is undergoing  a

new  phase in its history. The manner in which she

was  forced to receive its independence  fills  us

with  a  feeling of sadness. If we were to compare

Singapore with other countries which have achieved

their independence, we will see that they received

their independence with joy. Even the independence

achieved  by  the Ian Smith's faction in  Rhodesia

was a source of joy to the people of that faction.

On  the  other  hand, we received our independence

with  sadness because of the doings of the  people

on the other side of the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read in the papers, particularly the

Utusan  Melayu, that the Malays in  Singapore  are

downtrodden. The Utusan Melayu very often gives  a

wrong picture of the true situation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



the Malays in Singapore. On the other hand, if  we

deeply  study the true position, it  can  be  said

that  a  great number of people in Singapore  have

connections with people in Malaysia who  are  well

aware of the conditions of the people here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to those who allege that there is no

democracy  in Singapore and that the  Malays  here

are  oppressed,  I  would like  to  say  that  the

Government  of  Singapore is very much  practising

democracy  and  is giving freedom  to  all  races,

languages  and  religions. The Head  of  State  of

Singapore  is  a  Malay. The Chief  Justice  is  a

Chinese.  And  the  Speaker of this  House  is  an

Indian. Here, we can see for ourselves that only a

tolerant  multi-racial  and multi-lingual  society

can  bring about this state of affairs. It is this

sort of society that we must have in order to live

happily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the efforts of the Malaysian

Government  appear  to  be  directed  against  the

harmonious  living  together of  the  people.  For

instance,  in the Utusan Melayu of Saturday,  11th

December, Tun Razak in a speech likened the speech

of  His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to

that  of  playing an old film. But  the  new  film

which  will be screened in 1969 was not stated  in

that  paper. Mr Speaker, Sir, when old films  are

re-screened in the same theatre, it means that the

film  is  popular and liked by many. That  is  the

reason  why  it is re-screened. Therefore,  it  is

proof  that  that old film was a  film  which  was

popular.  The shorts of the new film were screened

in  Ayer  Hitam  in Penang, and  Rahang  in  Negri

Sembilan,  to  attract the people of  Malaysia  in

1969. This is a new picture, Mr Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, in 1962 the

Malaysian Government stopped the import of poultry

and  pigs into Singapore. That was one way to stop

the  prosperity of Singapore. But,  on  the  other

hand,  because we wish to live, we have to find  a

way to bring about a better standard of living for

the  people of Singapore. We in turn have to  stop

the import of their vegetables into Singapore. But

this    was   later   discontinued.   All    these

restrictions were not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



for the benefit of the people of Singapore. If the

people  on  the  other side of the  Causeway  were

shouting  about the oppression of  the  people  of

Singapore,  particularly the  Malays,  then  these

restrictions  which  they  had  imposed  and  were

against  that ideal would further create  distress

and  difficulties  for  the Malays  in  Singapore,

because 90 per cent of the Malays in Singapore are

wage  earners. If these restrictions were imposed,

then  it is the Malays in Singapore who would feel

the pinch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we wish to resume barter trade with

Indonesia  in  order  to  bring  about  a   better

standard  of living in Singapore, particularly  to

that community of wage earners. But the Government

of  Malaysia objected to that wish on  the  ground

that  it would be against their defence interests.

However,  that  was part of our  effort  to  bring

about  a better standard of living for our people,

including  the Malays. If the Malaysian Government

still  continues with that attitude, it will  mean

that  they  are  not  only not  giving  their

co-operation   to   the  people  of  Singapore,   but

indirectly oppressing the Malays of whom  a  great

majority  are poor. If they truly wish  to  be  of

assistance  to the Malays here, then  they  should

not  continue to object, because by so  doing  the

fat  people  will grow fatter and the thin  people

will  grow  thinner,  as  what  has  happened   in

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, the true

picture has been misrepresented by the leaders  in

Malaysia  who, through the ultras in  their  midst

and through the Utusan Melayu, say that the Malays

in  Singapore  are oppressed and are not  enjoying

life. Why I say that the Utusan Melayu is behaving

that  way  is  this. There was an article  by  its

correspondent   on   the  16th   December,   1965,

regarding  the  speech of the Member  for  Geylang

Serai, when he referred to Tun Razak's comments on

the  speech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  As

reported in the Hansard of the 14th December,  the

Member for Geylang Serai continued with his speech

and  mentioned what had happened in Rahang.  Here,

we  can  see  that what actually was said  in  the

House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



was  misreported in the paper. Thus we can see how

the  true  position of the Malays in Singapore  is

misrepresented  in  the Malay  paper,  the  Utusan

Melayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our effort to build an independent

sovereign  nation  and  a harmonious  relationship

between  the  peoples of various races,  religions

and  cultures  is being countered  by  efforts  to

destroy it. We have clarified our efforts to unite

the people of various races, and the acceptance of

Malay  as  the  national language  has  been  well

received by all sections of the people.



But  recently  when  the Government  launched  its

National Language Month campaign, Ahmad Haji  Taff

of  U.M.N.O. is reported in the newspaper  Berita

Mingguan  to  have stated that U.M.N.O.  Singapore

supported   the   National  Language   Month   and

supported the Government's campaign. But, in fact,

not  a  single programme was supported by U.M.N.O.

It  is  difficult  to see how they  supported  the

campaign. This is something insincere as Malay has

been accepted by all sectors of the people as  the

national language.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can the Member give the date of that

paper?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Berita Harian

of Sunday, 14th December.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to go into the

details  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  Address,

as my colleagues on the Government Benches have so

ably  brought  them up during the course  of  this

debate.  I  would rather try to present a  general

picture  of  the new situation in which  Singapore

has found itself since we separated from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are standard textbooks which military

strategists,  Ministers of  Defence  and  aspiring

political   leaders  read  in  order  to   improve

themselves and widen their knowledge in the course

of  their having to administer the affairs of  the

country.  One, of course, is the Western  standard

textbook by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



Clausewitz on The Art of War. But there is a  much

more  interesting text-book which relates  to  the

history  of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history.

The  Three Kingdoms are the Wei Kingdom,  the  Chu

Kingdom  and  the Wu Kingdom. It is a  history  of

three  territories seeking to survive, each trying

to  preserve  its  integrity and sovereignty,  how

much    political   guile   and    strategy    and

resourcefulness were shown by their generals;  but

in  the  end,  unfortunately, all  three  kingdoms

disappeared.  They  were  taken  over  by  another

power.  Although I do not believe  in  the  dictum

that history repeats itself, because there are now

institutions  and  devices which  prevent  history

from  recurring  so often, I will  only  add  that

looking  around us there are comparable situations

in  South-East  Asia which are like  that  of  the

Three Kingdoms in ancient Chinese history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not my intention to spell

out  what the Three Kingdoms are in modern

South-East  Asian  history. I will  only  say,  for  our

edification  and education, that we  in  Singapore

should  try  to read a little more  of  The  Three

Kingdoms and make sure that we are not one of  the

victims  of absorption and conquest as  the  Three

Kingdoms   were.  That  is  why  we   thought   it

extraordinarily important that Singapore should be

a member of the United Nations Organisation. There

was  no  such world body in the days of the  Three

Kingdoms.  So when one territory was  attacked  by

another  territory, there was no  recourse  to  an

appeal or recourse to succour by a world body. But

it  is  fortunate  for many small countries  today

that  there is such a body as the Security Council

of  the United Nations where a considerable amount

of dirty linen can be washed in front of the world

You   have   perhaps,   to  some   extent,   quite

satisfactory measures which can he applied by  the

world  body  in  the solution of disputes  between

smaller  powers.  It is our good fortune  that  we

have   been  admitted  into  the  United   Nations

organisation, because you never can tell when  one

of  these  days  we  may appear as  a  complainant

before   the  United  Nations  Security   Council,

However, I hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



does not happen, because I believe that, like  the

able  leaders  and generals of one  of  the  Three

Kingdoms, people in Singapore will also  have  the

resourcefulness to ensure their own survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very interesting story about a famous

general  in  one  of the Three  Kingdoms.  He  was

called  Chu Ker Liang. General Chu Ker  Liang  was

short of arrows and short of ammunition. They were

using  arrows in those days. He had only bows  but

very few arrows to shoot with. So what he did  was

he  had  dummies made of straw, put them on  board

some  barges and sailed the barges down the river.

The   enemy  thought  Chu  Ker  Liang's  army  was

attacking them. So they fired thousands of  arrows

into these straw dummies. Chu Ker Liang was happy.

He  pulled out those arrows, was richer because of

the  ammunition he found and used the same  arrows

to shoot back at the enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Minister of Defence

should  acquire his ammunition like Chu Ker Liang,

but  we  feel safe and secure because our Minister

of  Defence is versed in the history of the  Three

Kingdoms.  Only  I  disagree  with  him   on   his

proposals  to  recruit  only  volunteers  in   the

People's Defence Force. He admits that our regular

army  is a very small army - two battalions, 1,600

soldiers. In fact, when I went with my colleagues,

the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs and  the  State

Minister   for  Education,  to  all  the   African

countries and explained to them that we  just  had

only 1,600 soldiers, they chuckled, "How could you

be  an independent country - no Army, no Navy and

no Air Force?" They asked us what we were going to

do.



I said, "My Minister of Defence has a bright idea.

He is going to recruit a militia." My disagreement

with  the Minister, of course, is that he is  just

going to recruit the militia on a voluntary basis.

But  in  other  countries  which  are  seeking  to

survive  too - I could mention a few, but  perhaps

in  deference  to  my colleague the  Minister  for

Foreign Affairs, I would rather not do so, because

it  may make his work more difficult - I would say

that   compulsory  national  service,   compulsory

militia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



service,  probably  would he more  effective,  not

from  the point of view perhaps of trying to teach

recruits the art of handling sterling guns,  tommy

guns,  bazookas or howitzers (I do not think  that

would  be  the  primary purpose of a militia)  but

from  another point of view, and that is  this;  a

far  more  important function of  such  a  militia

would   he   to   instill  a  sense  of   national

consciousness into the recruits. It is  absolutely

necessary, because Singapore is an open  port,  an

open  city, to which people from all walks of life

and  from  all  races and cultures  migrate,  that

these people must he assimilated and absorbed into

a  nation. That is the weakness which we  find  in

our  efforts  to build a nation,  and  I  think  a

compulsory militia would he an extremely effective

instrument indeed on which to build our  Singapore

nation.  We  started the task in  1959  since  the

People's  Action Party assumed power.  We  believe

the  schools are the real battleground for

nation-building. But I do not think that is adequate and,

in  any  case, the results will not be seen  until

after 10 to 15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, it is more urgent that able-bodied men

and  women too should possess a spirit of national

consciousness  and  should he able  to  comprehend

meaningfully  the  efforts of  the  Government  in

trying  to  build up Singapore as a viable  nation

and how we propose to do it. Nevertheless, it is a

start  in  having even volunteers in the  People's

Defence  Force. I have no doubt my  colleague  the

Minister  of  Defence  will  not  only  teach  the

volunteers or the militia the art of self-defence,

but  also teach them, more important than anything

else, the art of how to be a citizen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that Singapore by just becoming

independent   can   remain   isolated   from   our

neighbour,  much less from the rest of the  world.

In  fact,  we  must keep on remembering  that  the

Causeway, which is like an umbilical cord, ties us

to  Malaya. It has been that way for a  very  long

time.  Singapore is still a big city in South-East

Asia.  Therefore, we can always expect a drift  of

population  from  the rural  areas  of  Malaya  to

Singapore. This problem of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



urbanisation, of course, increases our problem  of

controlling  population  growth.  If  we  were  to

believe  in  the  estimates  that  annually  about

10,000  people migrate to Singapore  from  Malaya,

then  over  the course of years, in  the  last  10

years,  we  would have gained 100,000 people.  All

this  is going to defeat the plans of the Minister

for  Health  with his I.U.D. campaign.  There  are

about  50,000 to 60,000 babies born in  Singapore,

but  if all the time you are going to have such  a

substantial   number  of  persons   migrating   to

Singapore,  then,  of  course,  the  Minister  for

Health's plans to limit the population increase by

using  this unique contraceptive device are  going

to  get  nowhere.  Therefore,  we  are  keeping  a

watchful eye on migration into Singapore. We  hope

at   least   to  protect  Singapore  citizens   by

instituting  measures, e.g, issuing work  permits,

so that Singapore citizens will not he flooded out

in the process of looking for employment. This, of

course, ties up with economic planning. Population

control  is  just as important as our  ability  to

plan  for the future. It is necessary that we must

not find ourselves in a situation where we keep on

running on a tread mill which moves backwards, and

in the end, we find that no progress has ever been

made at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make only one comment on

students, and students in Singapore in particular.

I believe that students all over the world have an

important role to play, not just because they  are

part  of  the educational process, hut  that  they

will  in  time come to man the Civil Service,  man

industries,  and  a  few will  become  the  ruling

elite.  In  fact,  my colleague the  Minister  for

Foreign Affairs and I had the great advantage  and

opportunity to address students in London when  we

were  there  last  October. I spoke  to  Singapore

students  and I found that they were a  very  keen

and  enthusiastic  crowd. On my questioning  them,

they  told me that they would he very happy indeed

to  be  allowed to continue to be associated  with

students  from  Malaysia, to  he  allowed  to  use

Malaysia  Hall  (it was Malaya  Hall  in  the  old

days), and also to continue to use the services of

the  Students Unit in London. Some of our students

were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



living in Malaysia Hall, some were living in  Hans

Crescent  - a hostel - where students  from  all

Commonwealth  countries stay when  they  study  in

London.  I  wholeheartedly agree  with  them  that

although  Singapore  is now politically  separated

from Malaysia, at least we should not inflict upon

the  students,  upon the younger  generation,  the

failures of the older generation. Therefore, it is

most  regrettable indeed for me, Mr  Speaker,  to

read  in  the Press this morning that advice  will

soon  be given to the authorities who run Malaysia

Hall  to  evict Singapore students  too.  We  have

suffered  eviction  from  Malaysia.  Now,  it   is

regrettable indeed, and a big disappointment, that

this   also  would  be  the  fate  of  Singapore's

students who live in Malaysia Hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that in the Straits Times of this

morning?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. Malaya Hall,

as  it  was  called  when I  was  a  student,  had

memories  for me and my colleagues - the  Minister

of   Defence,   the  Prime  Minister   and   other

Ministers. And it was in Malaya Hall that we first

organised  our student political body called  "The

Malayan  Forum".  It was in the  Forum  in  Malaya

Hall,  that  we  first  met those  who  today  are

Ministers  in  the  Malaysian  Government  or  are

political  leaders in Malaysia. Therefore,  it  is

most  unfortunate that a decision is  being  taken

which  reverses completely the process of bringing

minds together. Perhaps I would say the beginnings

of  political thinking of independence for Malaya,

and  of  reunification of Singapore  with  Malaya,

also  originated within the Malayan Forum,  within

Malaya Hall, in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to our advantage, indeed - for the future

generation  at  least, if not for us  -  that  the

students  of  today, students from  Singapore  and

students from Malaysia, should have a common venue

where they can meet and exchange views, study like

students, and act and behave like students.  After

all, most of their activities at Malaysia Hall are

not  political. They are more social, and it  will

be  very unfortunate indeed if a Singapore student

has a girl friend from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  and  she cannot take him  to  a  dance  in

Malaysia Hall, because he would be thrown  out  by

the jaga there who looks after Malaysia Hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are problems which really ought to

have  been  taken into consideration by those  who

have arrived at this decision. I think it would be

a  better  example to the rest of the Commonwealth

if  at  least we make an effort to allow  students

from  neighbouring  Commonwealth  territories   to

study  and  live together. Who in the Commonwealth

would believe that we are so anxious and concerned

over  the  future  of the Commonwealth,  over  the

integrity  and  unity  of  the  Commonwealth  when

problems  which are much closer to  us  cannot  be

solved? Hans Crescent Hostel for students from all

Commonwealth  countries has made  no  decision  to

throw  out  students from any particular  country.

Therefore,  it  is  very regrettable  indeed  that

Malaysia  Hall  will  now be  empty  of  Singapore

students.  It  is more particularly annoying,  Mr

Speaker,  because  the  Singapore  Government   is

paying  one-third of the cost of running  Malaysia

Hall.  And  we  are  also contributing  a  quarter

million  dollars annually to the Students Unit  in

London.  Be  that as it may, it is a  decision  in

which we have no say. We are the junior partner of

Malaysia Hall, and it is a lesson to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Deputy Prime Minister, that was

not a decision of the Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is a decision made at a

meeting  of  Ministers who  were  present  at  the

Alliance  Council, and I have no doubt  that  this

could be duly transmitted to the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps if it is dealt with at that

level!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What I was saying, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is that the lesson, of  course,  is

that  in future, in joint organisations, we should

ensure  that we are not a junior partner where  we

hold only one-third of the shares. Because holding

one-third of the shares would mean that we can  be

unceremoniously thrown out when the other  partner

so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



pleases. And there are many other organisations at

the  moment  in which we are also a  partner  with

Malaysia.  But  I  do  sincerely  hope  that   the

political  separation of Singapore  from  Malaysia

will   not   bring  everything  to   its   logical

conclusion,   and   so   make   irreversible   the

separation which publicly, and to all intents  and

purposes, leaders of both sides of the Causeway so

much regret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just comment

on  the  absence of the Opposition. It is  a  pity

indeed  that they are not here. I suppose many  of

our  Back-benchers  miss the diatribes  which  the

Opposition could have hurled at us. But  certainly

their  absence has not in the least  hindered  the

proceedings of this House. The Government Benchers

have fulfilled their full quota of time during the

debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Address. As

you  are aware, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a rule  in

Standing Orders that each speaker is permitted  so

much  time. I am fully convinced we have dutifully

shouldered our share of responsibility.  If  there

is  any  unfulfilled  quota  of  time,  then  that

responsibility must be borne by the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I hope is that the Opposition will learn that

second  thoughts are best and that they  will,  at

some future date, clearly enunciate their stand on

the constitutional struggle for power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I want to say now. Mr Speaker, is that

in the three months since Singapore left Malaysia,

we  have  been having an exciting and a busy  time

trying to normalise public life. I would only  add

that  Singapore will never be allowed,  either  by

our  neighbours or by the rest of  the  world,  to

remain  a backwater for the rest of our lives.  It

just cannot be. I personally for one, Sir, do  not

mind  very  much if Singapore were  to  be  but  a

`sleepy   hollow',  like  Malacca.  In   fact,   I

sometimes wonder why it is that my colleague,  the

Minister  of  Defence, had ever  left  the  sleepy

hollow   of  Malacca!  It  is  a  sort  of  little

paradise, where you are free from all the  world's - [Interruption]. Yes, I

have just found the answer. He is not Mr Tan Siew

Sin!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to say that we occupy an

important  and a central position in  the  hub  of

political events in this area of the world, it  is

our  hope that many of us will imbibe the morality

of  the  history  of the Three Kingdoms,  that  we

strive to ensure that we do not suffer their fate.

That  is  our  purpose. I will only add  that  the

people  of  Singapore - two million of them - plus

10.000  yearly  from Malaya, together  will,  with

energy  and  industry, understand the  meaning  of

survival of Singapore. I think with this spirit we

can  build a national consciousness which will  in

the   end  ensure  that  Singapore  maintains  its

integrity and independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question for Oral Answer stood on

the Order Paper of 20th December, 1965:-



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Pedestrian crossing at 7th mile Tampines Road</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->"<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b> `To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government intends to establish a pedestrian crossing at 7th mile Tampines Road, near the market and when."

Prime Minister supplied the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. "The area on both sides of 7th milestone

Tampines Road is swamp land and there is no market

there. There is, however, a small village in Jalan

Bersekutu   (off   7  m.s.)  but   there   is   no

justification   for  establishing   a   pedestrian

crossing at this point."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question for Oral Answer stood on

the Order Paper of 20th December, 1965 :-



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Peng Chee High School</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Government Assistance)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->"<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b> To ask the Minister for

Education whether the Government intends to give

any assistance to Peng Ghee High School for

development, and if he will give details."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2), the

Minister for Education supplied the following

answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. "The answer depends on whether the School

Management  can  fulfil the requirements  as  laid

down  in  the  Government Grant-in-Aid Regulations

1957,  with  which  all schools  are  expected  to

comply. For example, the school must, among  other

things,  hold a legal title to the land  and  have

the amount of its own contribution in hand. If the

School  is  in  a  position  to  comply  with  the

Regulations.  I see no reason why its  application

for   capital   grant  for  building   cannot   be

considered together with others.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Pin Ghee High School is more

a  Primary  than a Secondary school.  In  1957  it

began with one Secondary I class; by 1964, it  had

only  6  Secondary classes. The academic  standard

achieved  has been appalling: in 1964, out  of  36

candidates who sat for the Government Secondary IV

Examination, only 6 passed, of whom 5 passed  with

Grade  III  and 1 with Grade I certificate.  Since

1957, when this school began its first Secondary I

class,  it  has  been encouraged  to  improve  its

school  buildings  and equipment.  The  Government

approved  in  1962  capital  grants  amounting  to

$5,241   for   the  school  to  purchase   science

equipment  and  furniture in  order  to  help  the

school  develop  gradually its  secondary  classes

into a proper secondary school. But unfortunately,

the  Management Committee of the school  not  only

had  not  been able to make any improvements,  but

also   allowed   the  school  administration   and

discipline  to  deteriorate.  For  instance,   the

school, under its former Management, was known  to

have  sold textbooks at list price, thus making  a

profit  of  some $9,000 a year from students,  and

yet  it  owed several bookshops a total of $18,000

in  September 1964. No serious attempts  had  ever

been  made to improve the school buildings,  which

still  consist  of  7 blocks of wooden  structures

with asbestos and attap roofing. Repeated requests

by  the  health authorities to improve its  health

requirements  had  not been fully  complied  with.

Only one wooden plank room is available for an

all-purpose laboratory; Chemistry, Physics and Biology

experiments are all conducted in it. The secondary

department   of   the  school  is  notorious   for

indiscipline. In November 1964, a pupil was caught

intimidating other pupils to subscribe to  Barisan

Sosialis   Party   Fund.  More  recently,   school

monitors, two of whom were known to have  attended

meetings organised by the Barisan Sosialis for its

cadres, defied the authority of the principal  and

engaged in producing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



distributing illegal handbills giving a  distorted

picture   of  Government  policy  towards  Chinese

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the School Management Committee can work

selflessly and genuinely for the future well-being

of  the  school, I do not see how all the  present

indiscipline,   poor  management   and   political

manipulation by the Barisan Sosialis are going  to

help develop this school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has already begun on the construction of a

secondary school at 10 m.s. Changi Road at a  cost

of  $1.1  million plus an additional $250,000  for

furniture  and  equipment.  This  school  will  be

completed  next year in time for the enrolment  of

students  in  1967.  It will  cater  for  students

living  in the Kampong Chai Chi, Changi, Tampines,

Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong areas who now have  to

travel long distances to attend school. Before the

completion  of this school, if parents  living  in

the  village  nearby  Pin  Ghee  School  find   it

inconvenient  to  send their  children  to  attend

secondary   schools  elsewhere  next   year,   the

Government  is  quite prepared to  open  secondary

classes at Changkat Primary School situated at  10

m.s. Changi Road to eater for this need until  the

new secondary school is ready."

Malaysian Mirror; (b) the amount of money spent on

each  issue; and (c) the Head and subhead  of  the 1965 Estimates   which   provides    for    the

expenditure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2), the

Minister  for Culture and Social Affairs supplied

the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. "The Malaysian Mirror, published from March

this  year,  stemmed from the  need  to  keep  the

public   informed  of  current  affairs  for   the

development  of an enlightened public  opinion  in

the interest of democratic Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



With  our  independent status,  it  has  now  been

decided  to  abandon  the  Malaysian  Mirror   and

instead bring out a weekly publication called  The

Mirror, with a similar objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The publication of the then Malaysian Mirror

and now The Mirror is undertaken by the staff of

the Publicity Division of the Ministry of Culture. The four Editors in the Publicity Division, whose

duties include the publication of booklets and

other material, also contribute in the production

of The Mirror which is issued in four languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Approximately 62,000 copies of The Mirror

in  the  four languages are being printed  each

week at a cost of approximately $4,245.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Head and Subhead of the 1965 Estimates

which provide for the expenditure of printing cost

the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. "The Nanyang University Co-operative Store was

dissolved  by Order made under section 38  (1)  of
