<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FOR 1968</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates of Singapore

for  the year 1968 contained in Paper Cmd. 27  of

1967.  For  the  convenience of hon.  Members,  I

intend   taking  the  total  for  each  head   of

expenditure as it appears in the last  column  of

the  Summary of Estimated Expenditure on pages  5

and  6 of the Paper. The heads of expenditure  in

respect of which amendments stand on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



the  Order Paper Supplement will be taken  first.

But  before  doing  so,  I  would  like  to  draw

Members' attention to the guillotine times.  Hon.

Members  will  have noticed from  the  guillotine

times  that we are today on a schedule that gives

hon.  Members less time than we had on  the  Main

Estimates.  While on the Main Estimates  we  have

been able to apportion times in multiples of five

minutes,   it   has   been  necessary   for   the

Development Estimates to restrict time for debate

on  certain heads of expenditure to as low as two

or three minutes. In order to assist hon. Members

to  make  the best use of the available  time,  I

would  like to repeat something I said last year.

What  we will be considering in the Committee  of

Supply  today  are  Development  Estimates,   and

accordingly  it will not be in order for  Members

to address remarks on policy or on the day-to-day

running  of the various departments and statutory

bodies against whom items of proposed expenditure

appear. Debate is confined to the proposed  items

of  development expenditure, and I hope  it  will

not be necessary for me to remind hon. Members of

Standing Order 46 (1) which requires a Member  to

confine  his  observations to the  subject  under

discussion  and  precludes  the  introduction  of

irrelevant matter. If it is the intention of  any

Member  not to move an amendment standing in  his

name, advance information to the Clerk will  also

help  in  making  the best use of  the  available

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, while I appreciate many Members have put

in  a great deal of effort in preparation for the

debate,  they  must  be prepared  to  modify  and

shorten their speeches having regard to the  time

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now turn to the first Head - Postal

Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 02 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the

names of Madam Chan Choy Siong and Mr Teong Eng Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 02 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 10 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the

name of Mr Teong Eng Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 10 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (001) of subhead 10l.+



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I am not moving my amendment No. (1),

Sir, but I would like to speak on amendment No. (2)*.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l0l*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking my other amendment also, Sir, i.e.,

amendment No. (4)++, together. I wish to raise  one

or two points under this Head and that is about  a

community  centre in Macpherson Housing Estate.  A

site has been

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



recommended  to erect a community centre  in  this

vicinity. I wish to emphasise that at least 50,000

people  are  living  of this estate.  I  hope  the

Minister,  instead  of saying that  there  are  no

funds  available, will do his best  to  put  up  a

community  centre  in  Macpherson  Housing  Estate

which will serve the people of this area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, if my memory

serves me right, it was announced that a community

centre  would be built in an area where there  are

more  than  200  or 300 people. The  residents  of

Kampong Eunos in my constituency number more  than

1,000. We have made an application for a community

centre and there is a site which has been acquired

by Government, yet a community centre has not been

built.  Can Government please provide one for  the

residents there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to ask

the Minister of Defence whether he is aware that a

site  at the corner of Old Airport Road and  Jalan

Satu  in  Old Kallang Airport Estate was earmarked

for  a  community centre in 1965.  When  will  the

People's  Association  carry  out  the  plan?   At

present,  my  constituency has a community  centre

which was converted from the previous Katong Boys'

Club.  It  is  located in a remote corner  of  the

constituency  and is serving people  predominantly

from  the  Geylang  area. My constituents  in  the

housing  estate at Old Airport Road are unable  to

make full use of this community centre because  it

is  not conveniently located. This being the case,

Sir,  I  am very anxious to hear from the Minister

whether  he  will  approve  the  building   of   a

community centre at Old Airport Road on  the  site

already earmarked in order to serve the people  at

Old         Kallang        Airport         Estate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir

since amendments Nos. (3)*, (5)+ and (6)++ stand in

my name, I would like, with your permission, to the

talk on People's Association and thereby not move

those amendments.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment No. (5) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++ Amendment No. (6) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 402.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed, Mr Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. There is a

provision of $60,000 for works and buildings for

which $15,500 is asked to be revoted. There is

another revote for furniture and equipment. I

would like to point out the lack of facilities in

my two standard community centres - one is the

Punggol Community Centre and the other at Punggol

Point. Regarding the Punggol Community Centre, I

notice that there is a piece of vacant land near

the centre to which facilities can be extended.

Similarly, at Pungol Point the centre has been

trying to obtain the necessary permission for the

adjoining land to be utilised as an added

facility. Sir, I hope the Minister concerned will

look into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the rural community centres.

Again the two items are revotes. I wish to talk on

the poor siting of some of the rural community

centres in my constituency. They are Kampong

Sungei Tengah Community centre, Jalan Serangoon

Kechil Community Centre and another is located at

7½ m.s. Upper Serangoon Road. In my opinion, these

centres are badly sited. No doubt the centres are

there, but very few people go there to make use of

the facilities. For example, in Jalan Serangoon

Kechil the centre is sited in a rubber estate,

much to the inconvenience of the people in the

kampong which is about a quarter of a mile away

and where the population is about a couple of

thousand people. I do hope the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



Minister will take steps to move such centres to

suitable sites so that they can be of benefit to

the community.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Move them yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since the Minister for

Finance has asked us to move the centres

ourselves, may I add that Punggol Constituency is

a rural constituency and, for that matter, the

rural people may be classified as poor people? I

think it is the duty of the Minister for Finance

to allow funds to be allocated for the building of

community centres for the benefit of the

community.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are not poor.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Anson Community Centre is too small for the

area. I hope the Minister will consider expanding

the centre a little so as to make it more suitable

for the area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Punggol has

forgotten that when we consider sites for

community centres, Members of Parliament of the

constituencies are consulted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, I will give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you very much. For the

information of the Hon.

Minister of Defence, the construction of the

centres was carried out in 1961 and

I was elected to this House in September 1963.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I did not say that the

Member  for  Punggol  was consulted.  I  said  the

Member of Parliament of the constituency, if there

was a Member, or else the sites were decided after

the Prime Minister had visited these areas and had

come  to  an  agreement with  the  elders  of  the

villages.  Therefore, having sited  these  centres

and  having spent the money which was provided  by

the  Ministry  of  Finance, it  would  be  wasting

public  money to shift them. As my colleague,  the

Minister for Finance has said, if they feel that a

certain  centre is badly sited, they can  move  it

themselves.  There are lots of things  which  they

can do themselves. For instance, the residents  of

Changi  themselves built a community  centre,  and

Changi is a rural area.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up another point brought up

by  the  Member for Punggol and that is the vacant

land  adjoining  the community centre  at  Punggol

Point   which  can  be  used  to  provide   better

facilities for the community centre. I  would  say

the fault lies with him and his committee, because

the  People's Association have obtained permission

from the owner of the land for its use, subject to

the  management committee of the community  centre

building  a  chain-link  fence.  They  have   done

nothing  so  far and, therefore, they cannot  make

use of the facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has

also said that his community centre is badly sited

because it is about a quarter of a mile away  from

the   nearest  concentration  of  population.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, you know that land in Singapore  is

rather  limited, and if everyone wants to  have  a

community  centre right in front of his  doorstep,

it  is  something that is impossible. If a man  is

really  imbued  with  civic consciousness  and  is

willing to serve the public and, at the same time,

wants to enjoy some of the facilities provided  by

a  community centre, a distance of a quarter of  a

mile to the community centre is nothing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that his community

centre  is too small for his constituency.  I  for

one  would  like  to see large  areas  being  made

available    for    community    centres.     But,

unfortunately, as the hon. Member knows, there  is

a   limitation  of  land  in  Anson  and  in  most

constituencies  in Singapore, and  land  is  quite

costly.   It  is  a  question  of  putting   every

available piece of land to the best economic use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with Mountbatten, Mr Speaker, Sir.

The  present community centre there is sited about

a  quarter of a mile away from the place which the

Member for Mountbatten thinks is a suitable  site.

I  have  my  doubts, because if we were  to  spend

money on building another community centre in  the

place  indicated by him, in a year or two he would

come  round  and say the same thing,  that  it  is

badly sited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all in all, I think these community centres

are sited in the best available spots and they can

serve  the  community there quite  well.  For  the

information  of the Member for Kampong  Kembangan,

what  the Prime Minister said was not, "Where  you

have  200  or  300 people in an area, a  community

centre will be built." I would rather think it  is

nearer  the truth if his statement was 300 or  400

families  living in an area. I would like  to  say

that, inasmuch as we would like to have dozens  of

community  centres in a constituency, there  is  a

limitation of land and funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MacPherson Estate, I have every sympathy

with the Member concerned and I will look into the

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

of   Defence  has  said  that  the  Punggol  Point

Community Centre is responsible for putting  up  a

chain-link fence. Sir, we all know that it is very

costly  to put up a chain-link fence. In  view  of

the  small  monthly subsidies given  to  community

centres,  I  think the management committees  will

have  to  manage within the limited scope  of  the

subsidies                                 granted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point refers to the Staff Club House

for the People's Association. While acknowledging

the good work done by the staff of the People's

Association to the community, I would like to ask

the Minister (1) where is the Staff Club House to

be located? (2) who will be allowed to use it, not

forgetting that a good number of the staff are

sprinkled all over the community centres in the

island? (3) why is it necessary to build it? and

last but not least, can we afford it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> The Minister has said that land

is scarce for the building of community centres.

But, actually speaking, there is some land. I

think the original estimate was for $80,000.

During the time when no money was available, a

very small building was built in Anson. I do not

think the Minister is objecting to the extension

of the building. I think it will cost about $3,000

or $4,000 to establish a vigilante post there. We

have not enough space. Therefore, he must consider

taking action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

considering now. If the Member for Anson can

assure me that, by spending $4,000 he can extend

the area of the community centre in Anson to a

size suitable for use, I will allow that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> But I will be surprised if he

can acquire 4,000 square feet of land in Anson for

$4,000!



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Only the building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was told by

the Member for Anson and other Members that it is

not so much the building that they go for but the

playing-fields. There is no point in having a

large building where there are limited playing-fields.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> I am asking for an extension

of, say, 15 feet by 30 feet, because the other

place for playgrounds and other purposes can be

used. I only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



want to extend the building. I am not talking

about using the whole land -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Matters of this

nature can be better discussed by inviting the

Minister to the Anson Community Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right!



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> I quite agree with you, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I agree with you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, because these are details on which we should

not waste the time of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Punggol,

there is a very good reason why we call the

committees "management committees". They have to

manage everything well within their means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Staff Club House for? The

People's Association has a staff of about 1,200

who are responsible for the running of, I think,

183 or 184 community centres. As the Member for

Punggol has pointed out, the staff are:

spread all over the island and they have few

opportunities of meeting one another socially or

of discussing their work. All members of the staff

are citizens of Singapore and I am sure the Member

for Punggol will not deny a section of our

citizens facilities for social intercourse and

sporting netivities. That is one of the reasons

why we decided that there should be a Staff Club

House for the, staff of the People's Association.

Another reason is to give them the facilities to

meet and talk about their problems. I think the

Member for Punggol is aware that we just held a

staff seminar of the People's Association:

to discuss ways and means ot improving their work

in the community centres so that there can be an

interchange of views between the members of the

staff of the People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also asked me whether

we can afford a Staff Club House. Surely, if we

cannot afford it, the Minister for Finance will

not have allowed it to be in the vote! The answer

is 'Yes'. This is going to be a substantive Staff

Club House situated next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



to the headquarters of the People's Association

and the rugger field in Mountbatten Road. The

first priority for its use will be confined to

members of the staff of the People's Association.

But we do not like to have any government

facilities lying idle and I have already proposed

to them that they can also entertain applications

at times - I think it will be quite often - from

any organisations, bodies or groups of people who

want to use it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7)*. Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated fot Head 11 be reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item involves a vote of $235,000 for the

purpose of putting up new community centres in

the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister three questions: firstly, how is the

vote to be allocated? where will the community

centres be built? and will there be any community

centre for Sembawang? Secondly, has the staff

conference of the People's Association achieved

its proposed objectives? Thirdly, the staff

should be trained in staff relations and their

work duties so that they will be able to do their

work better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the

management committees of the various community

centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for 1-lead

11 be reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim, three questions were addressed to you.

The first was on the location of the new

community centres. That is within the rules of

debate. The other two questions arise out of the

staff conference and the Member's comments on

staff training. They are completely irrelevant in

this debate. I will therefore be grateful if you

will not answer them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

is very interested to know whether or not he is

going to get an additional community centre in

his constituency, I am unable to enlighten him.

The programme md the plan are with the People's

Association and can always be made available to

him. But if he does not want to avail himself of

this opportunity, but wants me to write to him, I

will do so. As for the other questions, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I will abide by your ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, I am not very satisfied with the

answer. I ask for a division.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a

matter of detail. The vote is allocated for the

building of community centres all over Singapore.

I regret very much that at this moment I am

unable to tell him whether $1,000 or $5,000 is to

be allocated for Sembawang, or whether nothing is

to be allocated for Sembawang. But if he really

wants to, he can put in a written Question, and I

will give the full details of how these votes are

allocated. But, in general, the principle is that

this vote is to be allocated for building

community centres all over Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim. I think the Member's

desire not to withdraw his amendment is more the

result of what I have said rather than what you

have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $235,000 for Head 11 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, the provision for this Head is only

$10 and so I cannot ask for a token reduction of

$100.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of order, Sir. Even

before he moves his amendment, the Member has

started to debate on it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I take it that you are

withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

No. I want to say something. Mr Speaker, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 12

be reduced by $10 instead of $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister three

questions. Firstly, why should there be only a

token vote of $10? Secondly, since there is no

plan, why should it be included in the Development

Estimates? Thirdly, has any plan been drawn up? If

so, why cannot he ask for a supplementary vote

next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

third question first. It is because I probably

might ask for a supplementary estimate next year,

and that is why there is a token vote of $10. The

token vote of $10 indicates that we either have a

plan to carry on with the project in mind - in

this instance, it is the purchase of a launch for

the supervision of barter trade and also for

enforcing immigration regulations at the Jurong

wharf - or that the plans are not completely

finalised so that we have not made up our minds as

to what sort of launches we need to have, or how

many launches there are, and the cost. That is why

the token vote is put in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

debate on the Supplementary Estimates which took

place a week or so ago here, Members accused the

Ministries concerned of not being exact in their

estimates of the votes. Here is another reason

why, not having been able to work out all the

details of the plan in time, or not being able to

decide whether the plan can feasibly be carried

out next year or not, we put in a token vote of

$10.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the belief of the Member for

Sembawang, when he says that there is no plan at

all for this project, I can assure him that every

time we put in a vote, there is a plan on the

project.

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10 for Head 12 ordered to stand part

of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 20 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be

allocated for Head 20 be reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we can congratulate

ourselves on being one of the first countries, if

not the first country, in this region to have

educational TV. But I see that only a small sum of

$11,000 is being provided for its development next

year, as compared with a sum of $691,500 for the

previous year. I wonder whether all the

development has been done this year, so that next

year there need only be a small sum. Furthermore,

I understand that the programme is not quite up to

standard and I fear that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, I am afraid that

discussion on the standard of the programme will

be out of order under this Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir. What I fear is that a small sum of only

$11,000 may not be sufficient for the development

of this educational television programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, our educational TV service was

launched, as you know, on the 30th of January.

1967, after nine months of planning and

preparation. The service is designed to improve

the quality of teaching and to supplement ordinary

classroom work. The programmes for the first year

were directed to Secondary I and II students and,

as the Member for Choa Chu Kang has pointed out,

were very well received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But towards the end of the year, it was felt

that the time was ripe for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



expansion of the educational television service to

cover other classes in stages from Primary III to

pre-University level for 1968. So plans for

expansion were drawn up and submitted to the

Economic Planning Unit for consideration. The

Economic Planning Unit thought that the service

should consolidate itself before launching out

into new fields and advised deferment of the

expansion proposals. That is why the small sum was

provided for expenditure next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite financial restrictions,

staffing shortages and the comparatively brief

experience in this field, ETV has made remarkable

headway. This was confirmed by the winning of a

special prize in a contest in Japan, which was

open to television establishments all over the

world, including the B.B.C. For the information of

the Member for Choa Chu Kang, since then the

Economic Planning Unit has been having second

thoughts on the matter, and I understand that a

review of the proposals for limited expansion is

being undertaken now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am glad to hear that the

E.P.U, has reconsidered its decision and that

possibly a further sum may be voted on. I am quite

satisfied and indeed very glad to hear what the

Minister has said, and I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (001) of subhead

301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that the University has

essentially all the basic requirements to teach

the various academic subjects leading to the

degrees conferred by her. These, to my mind, are

not enough to grace the dignity of this queen of

higher education. What she really needs to crown

her glory is a University Hall that will have

enough space to cater for the annual convocations,

act as an examination hall, and be utilised as an

indoor stadium for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



badminton and other indoor sporting activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, a crying shame that this

institution, with an associated history of

providing higher education for some 60 years, has

yet to be provided with the necessary funds to

build such a hail, whereas junior institutions

such as secondary schools and vocational

institutes can boast of such facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister for Education, who is an old

boy of the University, reconsider with some

sympathy the urgent need for this so-called Great

Hall of the University?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

building of a Great Hall for the University of

Singapore has been receiving attention even before

the former Oei Tiong Ham Hall was converted into

offices to cater for the expansion of the

University. The present thinking is to establish a

Sports and Recreation Centre in which a multi

purpose hall, as suggested by the Member, for

convocations, examinations, lectures, debates,

conferences, seminars, theatrical productions,

film shows, and recreation, will be prominently

featured. The complex will be built on the land

near the existing playing-field and the whole

area, in fact, is now being filled up in

anticipation of this development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of our limited financial

resources and the need to give priority to other

more urgent development projects, the development

of this centre has not received urgent attention.

The cost of implementing this project will

therefore have to come mainly from donations, and

I hope the public, especially the alumni of the

University, who have benefited directly from their

old University, will respond generously to the

call for financial assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

that some form of appeal will be launched sometime

in the near future, so that the various alumni of

our University will make sure that our University

will be an institution of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



greatness in the form of a Great Hall. With that,

Sir, I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be

reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead

302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this item I notice that an Institute

of South-east Asian Studies is being proposed. Can

the Minister for Education inform this House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What the proposed Institute of South-east Asian Studies is?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Why cannot it be organised and run by the

History, Political Science, Sociology and

other similar Departments of the Singapore

and Nanyang Universities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What are the proposals for staffing the

institute? Will recruitment of the staff

from overseas take place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Has Government explored the possibilities

of foreign aid in the way of money and

talent for the proposed Institute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, can the Minister for

Education also explain to this House what progress

has been made towards the building of the Adult

Education Centre? As I see it, Sir, it is no use

coming to Parliament to ask for big sums of money

to be voted when the establishment of such an

institute cannot be realised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

institute of South-east Asian Studies is to be set

up for the purpose of carrying out systematic

research and studies on the economic, political,

social and cultural problems of the countries in

South-east Asia. It is intended to bring together

high quality intellects trained in a variety of

disciplines and get them to addiess their minds to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



certain problems as a full-time occupation for a

long period with the hope that the expertise they

develop will help Singapore to understand South-east Asia in detail and in depth. And this is

better done by a separate institute devoted to

this purpose than by other departments in the

Universities, either of Singapore or Nanyang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institute will have a director and several

other subordinate full-time staff, and some of the

university academic staff will also be drawn into

the various projects of studies to be organised by

this institute. It is for that purpose that the

institute will be sited at the University of

Singapore. The staff of this institute will be

open both to local as well as expatriate scholars.

I am sure that when the institute is set up,

foreign aid will be sought from the appropriate

foundations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister has not answered my last point on the

Adult Education Centre. Can he please oblige?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The plan for the Adult

Education Centre has been shelved - not exactly

shelved - but for the time being it is still under

consideration by the relevant authority and it is

not certain when it will receive urgent

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I well remember that when I was debating on this particular topic some

time ago, the Minister of State for Education

was painting a very good picture of what the Adult Education Centre would be and today ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, thought you

were going to be very short. But if you are going

to expand on the Adult Education Centre, I am

afraid I must rule you out of order on this

amendment. However, you may be able to bring your

remarks under the next amendment which is an

amendment to the whole head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allocation for this head totalling

$4,863,310 is mainly for the following. $400,000

for the University of Singapore, $921,400 for

Nanyang University, and $2,149,600 for the

Ministry of Education Administrative Building.

This shows that the Ministry of Education is

paying great importance to higher education. But I

would like to ask two questions. I remember the

Minister for Education once declared that the

Ministry would be considering the setting up of an

aeronautical faculty in the University of

Singapore. What is the progress of this plan so

far? Secondly, can the Minister say when the

Ministry of Education Administrative Building will

be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, the proposal to

set up a technological university has not been

finalised and the creation of an aeronautical

faculty will, as I said last year, have to await

the establishment of a technological university.

As for the building of a new headquarters for the

Ministry of Education, about 20 per cent of the

work has been completed so far, and it is expected

that the building will be ready for occupation by

the end of 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, before I ask

Mr Teong if he wishes to withdraw the amendment.

I believe Mr Ng would like to say something on

the Adult Education Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question

was debated on the 30th of December, 1965. The

Hansard Volume is No. 24, issue No. 14, col. 788

when I moved the Development Estimates then. I

quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to urge that the plan to build an

Adult Education Centre be speeded up,...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



I went on to say something about the Adult

Education Board for which a bouquet was in turn

handed back to me by the Minister of State for

Education. Today, I am indeed greatly disturbed to

hear that such a plan for adult education purposes

has to be shelved because of its low priority. I

shall be very grateful if the Minister will

elaborate on why this plan has to be dropped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am as disappointed as the Member for

Punggol that this proposed plan for an Adult

Education Centre has to be pigeonholed. But as he

is well aware, there are many urgent calls on the

financial resources of the State, and it is the

view of the relevant authority that this project

is not as urgent as many others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the explanation by

the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take it that this head deals with the

building programme of both primary and secondary

schools. But I notice that under primary schools

the three items have to be revoted. I shall be

grateful if the Minister can explain these

revotes. What are the schools? Are they for

existing schools or are the schools in the process

of being replaced, and what are the new schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down we have the secondary schools. I

would like to inquire as to the number of new

schools that will be built and where these schools

will be located. Also, is the number of schools,

both primary and secondary, sufficient to meet the

ever increasing school population demand, not

forgetting that more and more students are going

into the pre-university classes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, under this vote it seems that

there is a reduction compared with what was voted

for last year. I do not know whether this is due

to the fact that we have enough schools.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have a reduction in the vote for

next year. Whether there are sufficient schools or

not, I feel that it is because we have two

sessions in our schools. If we are going to revert

back to the system of a full-day school, it seems

there are not enough schools for the future. I

would like to know the reason for the reduction of

this vote. I remember the Minister said a few days

ago that four vocational schools would be built in

the future. Where are these schools to be built?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that

the vote for the reconstruction of Raffles

Institution is only $10 for works and buildings. I

understand part of the school is now falling to

pieces. Surely something must be done in case of

any possible accidents to the pupils there.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to pose two

questions to the Minister on construction of

secondary schools. Since the beginning of this

year, the Ministry has noted that secondary school

halls can be used for sporting activities, such as

volleyball and badminton. However, the halls in

certain secondary schools have glass windows.

Therefore, the principals stop their staff and

students from playing volleyball there. I want to

know whether the Minister has plans to change

these glass windows into some other type of

windows for the school halls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the revote for new

primary schools under subhead 101 is for the

construction of three new primary schools. These

are situated at Mattar Road, Toa Payoh and Delta.

Circus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revote of $362,000 is meant to carry out

major extensions to the Yio Chu Kang, Canberra and

Sembawang Hill Estate primary schools. Another sum

of $294,000 is revoted for construction of primary

schools to replace Rangoon Road and Pulau Bukom

primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary school enrolment will reach its peak

in 1968 and will register a gradual decline from

1969. There is enough accommodation to cater for

the requirements of primary education in the next

decade and no new primary schools need to be built

except to replace old schools or to serve

residents in new housing development areas.

Therefore, the reduction in development

expenditure for the construction of primary

schools necessarily follows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the secondary school building

programme is concerned, eight new secondary

schools will be functioning in January 1968. These

new schools together with the existing ones will

provide sufficient secondary places for the next

two or three years. This will give us time to do

some hard thinking on our future policy on

education and to find answers to questions such as

-are we doing enough to overcome the traditional

employment opportunities for those with technical

or vocational training? is there a case for

increasing the duration, scope and content of

vocational education? Or should more places be

provided at pre-university level at the expense of

secondary level? To what extent can we afford to

improve the quality in education by reducing class

sizes and increasing the teacher/pupil ratio or

reverting to a full-day school? The solutions to

problems such as these will affect the number and

type of secondary schools to be built in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants to know where the

four proposed vocational institutes will be built.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong, I have ruled both Members

and Ministers out of order under similar

circumstances on another Head. Perhaps your answer

can be given under Head 22.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes. The question of

rebuilding Raffles Institution is receiving

attention at the moment, and I think the problem

is now one of selecting the best site for this

school. I hope a decision can be arrived at early

next year and construction can be proceeded with

as expeditiously as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has raised the

question of providing some other more durable

material for windows instead of glass for

secondary school halls. This problem, I think,

will be looked into early next year and I hope

some solution can be found.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am no old boy of

Raffles Institution but I attended the last Annual

Dinner as a guest. At the function the President

made a speech. He was the guest of honour. He

informed the annual gathering that a site for

Raffles Institution had been found and I think i!

was somewhere around Grange Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, I do not know in what

connection you have referred to the President's

name or how you intend to use it. But may I draw

your attention to Standing Order 46,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



paragraph (7) , which precludes the use of the name

of the President for the purposes of influencing

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I do not intend to use the

President's name to influence the course of the

debate. But I just wish to quote what the

President said. He announced that a site had been

found for the rebuilding of Raffles Institution. I

was just wondering whether the Minister could

enlighten this House on whether the present site

has been rejected and a new site found.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am still concerned

about the possible injury to pupils of Raffles

Institution. Can the Minister tell us whether the

damaged parts of Raffles Institution have been

repaired before the school reopens next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I think that that part

of Raffles Institution which was condemned by the

P.W.D, is beyond repair and there is no intention

to waste any more public funds on it. But the main

portion of Raffles Institution is still usable,

although the cost of maintenance is very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when the President made his speech

at the dinner given by the Old Boys' Association

of Raffles Institution, there was a site

available. But since then I think there have been

competing claims for the same piece of land and a

decision will have to be made as to who should

receive priority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

Minister's explanation regarding primary and

secondary schools. I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,937,120 for Head 21 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 22 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 22 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed gratifying to note that there will

be piovision for more vocational institutes to be

built, and also the need to pay for land

acquisition in respect of sites for vocational

institutes. Therefore, I would ask the Minister

for Education whether there will be other

vocational institutes, apart from those mentioned

in the various subheads, to be built and, if so,

their locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising the important part played by

vocational training, will the Minister consider

increasing the period of vocational training which

it now provides? In this light, I would suggest

that a four-year vocational training period be

implemented, i.e., to provide the necessary know-how in respect of skilled labour, or technical

know-how which is urgently required in our

industrialisation scheme and in the various trades

too. I notice that the vocational institutes

provide a two-year course of training for primary

school-leavers, especially those who do not make

the grade for academic or technical secondary

training. I think a two-year course is barely

sufficient to enable a 14-year old child to be

able to pick up the necessary skill or know-how. I

think if the four-year scheme were to be

implemented, it would not only tremendously

benefit the students looking fo: jobs in the

labour market, but also the public.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member for Punggol is referring to vocational

schools and not to the Vocational Institute,

because he said that a two-year course is provided

for primary school-leavers. There is a distinction

between a vocational school and the Vocational

Institute. We have enough vocational schools in

Singapore. In fact, in 1967, nearly 9,000 primary

school-leavers will be posted to vocational

schools. The two-year course in the vocational

school is intended to provide general vocational

training and not specialised training in any one

trade or craft. However, the Ministry is now

considering the extension of this two-year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



course to three years based on a U.N.E.S.C.O.

report, so that more intensive training in a

particular skill or craft can be given during the

third year. However, this will mean an additional

burden on the Education Estimates and cannot be

implemented until more funds are available for

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those students who have done well in

vocational schools, they are given preference for

admission to the Singapore Vocational Institute

where facilities are available for the training of

skilled craftsmen. As the Member is aware,

provision for four more such vocational institutes

have been entered in next year's Development

Estimates. It is our view that if these four

vocational institutes can be completed by 1969.

the shortage of training facilities will be

resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, has your inquiry been

answered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw

he attention of the Member for Sembawang to page

21 of the Development Estimates where the location

of these four proposed vocational institutes are

given: there is one at Jurong, one .it Qucenstown.

one in the Macpherson Road area, and one on the

Kallang industrial site.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I quite appreciate what

the Minister for Education has just explained, but

there is a relationship that I am trying to point

out. You have the vocational institute, but you

also have the vocational school to give the

primary school-leavers - the failures, so to say - more training. But he says that there is a

lack of funds to carry out such a project. I

remember well the phrase "Spring source of the

Nation" and also the words "Education is the best

form of investment a country can have." These are

our policy statements. But as to the lack of more

funds, I hope the Minister for Education will try

to persuade his colleague, the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



Finance, to give the necessary funds to carry out

such a project, so that our young children will

benefit. You do not have to throw out our

projects just because of a lack of funds!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

sentiments of the Member for Punggol. But we are

given only a certain sum of money and we have to

decide how it is to be spent - whether there should

be more facilities at the primary level, the

secondary level, the pre-university level or the

vocational institute level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is to set up four more vocational

institutes and they will draw students mainly from

those who have gone through a two-year course at

the vocational schools. It is a debatable point

whether the students who have gone through the two-year course at the vocational schools will be able

to follow the instructions given at the vocational

institute, or whether we should extend this two-year course by another year. I think it must be

determined, to a large extent, by the financial

resources available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not wish to press my

point further. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that leave be given to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> No.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,204,520 for Head 22 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 31 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 901.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that there is a vote of

$76,500 provided in 1968 for the building of

markets. What I want to know is where they will be

built and whether a market will be built in

Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate to resite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



the unlicensed hawkers now congregating in the

car park at Kampong Arang Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subject of markets in Tanjong Rhu

Housing Estate was, in fact, raised by me in a

Question for Oral Answer in this House on 5th

December, 1966. In reply, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Health said - I will

quote from Hansard, Vol.

25, No. 7, column 439:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am very happy indeed to inform the Member for

Mountbatten that the problem of resiting the

unlicensed hawkers now operating in the car park

near Kampong Arang Road has been fully considered

by the Housing and Development Board and that a

twostorey hawker centre will be built as soon as

possible to accommodate them at Lots

202-4,    Mukim 25, off Mountbatten Road, as the

operating site for the hawkers. By then, all the

hawkers will be sited in this area.'



<br><br>Sir, since then, a full calendar year has elapsed,

and the plan has not been carried out. Although

the site has been cleared, I shall be grateful if

the Minister will enlighten me on whether such a

market or hawkers' centre will be built in the

near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> May I, Mr Speaker, Sir,

reply to the point raised by the Member for

Mountbatten as regards the number of markets that

will be built for the sum of $76,500 which is down

for next year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really in respect of balances to be paid

for three markets that have been in the course of

construction during this year. The balance to

complete Tuas Market is $12,400, and for Jurong I

Market is $28,600. The other sum of $35,500 which

has been entered for the 1968 vote has actually

been settled and this is in respect of Bukit Ho

Swee Market, Phase IV. That accounts for the sum

of $76,500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that in my reply to the Member for

River Valley, when he

brought up the subject of the vote for markets in

last year's Development Estimates, I indicated

that there had been a change in Government policy

to erect markets and that it was the Housing and

Development Board which would then undertake the

building of markets in areas where there were new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



buildings or where urban renewal was taking place.

Therefore, there is no provision for the building

of any new markets for 1968 out of Government

funds and the building of new markets, if any,

hereafter, will be shown in the Housing and

Development Board plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has drawn attention

to the fact that my Parliamentary Secretary has

indicated to him that a hawker centre would be

built off Mountbatten Road. I am afraid I am not

in a position to indicate the building plans of

the Housing and Development Board, because it

comes under a different Ministry. I do not think

it is necessary to ask my colleague, the Minister

for National Develop, ment, to stand up to answer.

I have tried to get an answer, and this has been

obtained by telephone from our Ministry to the

Housing and Development Board. There is a proposal

for future development which I take it is for next

year. I am in no position to say whether it is for

1968 or 1969 for a hawker centre around

Mountbatten Road to look after 168 stalls. I

presume that this is the hawker centre mentioned

by my Parliamentary Secretary - was it a year ago?

I hope it is not that long - and I will undertake to get more information for

the Member for Mount-batten after today's sitting.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

greatly disappointed with the answer given by the

Hon. Minister. The point is this: here, on the one

hand, we are trying to clear slums and move the

people into new Housing Board flats; yet, on the

other hand, when they get into the flats, they

have no way of earning a livelihood but to resort

to hawking. The problem is this: we are now

creating a modern slum. So unless the problem is

resolved expeditiously, I think this undesirable

state of affairs will continue to exist. We are

trying our best to build a modern metropolitan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



city, and yet we have failed in this hawker

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry that the Member

for Mountbatten is so depressed over the answer I

have given him. I think he has to be a little more

realistic about trying to resolve the hawker

problem. This is a problem of long standing. It

involves the livelihood of 40,000 to 50,000

hawkers, which in turn affects the lives of

perhaps 200,000 to 300,000 people. So i will take

some time before the problem of the hawkers can be

resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that it is the aim of the Housing and

Development Board to ensure that their housing

estates, which cost very large sums of public

money, do not change the situation of the present

slums to concrete slums. That is why they have

asked for powers from the Ministry of Health to

control the hawker problem within the estates, and

this has been conceded. There has been an

amendment to the Local Government Integration

Ordinance to give them powers to deal with

hawkers, and in this respect the powers were

transferred to the Housing and Development Board

on the 1st of December this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is only reasonable and fair to allow

some time for the Housing and Development Board to

organise itself to tackle this problem, but in the

meantime their officers are being trained by the

Hawkers Department of the Ministry of Health. We

have already made a move to resolve the hawker

problem, and we ourselves think that it will take

quite some time before we can tackle the whole of

Singapore. So to be fair to the Housing Board,

they should also be given adequate time to control

this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, I take it you are

withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,215,810 for Head 31 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 32 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 32

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this head, I find that a sum of

$117,020 has been provided for the year 1968. But

there is no provision for a mobile dental clinic.

To my mind, this mobile dental clinic is very

important as it can better serve the rural people.

So I wonder whether the Minister has taken into

consideration a plan to provide such mobile dental

services. If there is no provision now, perhaps he

can put it forward in supplementary development

estimates in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would like to assure the

Member for Changi that there are three mobile

dental clinics in existence. They are meant for

the treatment of young children and school

children for whom free dental services are being

provided. But I am sure the Member for Changi is

probably thinking in terms of a mobile dental

clinic for adults.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes, that is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> If that is his wish, I am

afraid it will take a very long time before it can

be fulfilled. As things stand, with the funds made

available to the Ministry of Health, all that we

can do at the moment is to concentrate really on

what are known as priority groups, which include

school children, pregnant women, and those nursing

mothers in need of dental care, and lastly adults.

As for adults, the only place for them to get

Governmental dental care at very low cost is at

the Dental Clinic of the Outram Road General

Hospital, which is also used as part of the Dental

Teaching Hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be very dangerous for me to

accept the Member for Changi's suggestion that

perhaps I make an application for a supplementary

vote for a mobile dental clinic. Maybe I can give

him a little indication as to how he can get what

he wants, not through Government offices, but

perhaps by an appeal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



to members of the public. I do feel that there is

a lot of room for the tapping of donations from

members of the public. For example, very recently

the Rotary Club donated a mobile blood bank,

costing probably $40,000, which is being fully

used at the moment. And there is a philanthropist

who wants to donate another mobile blood bank,

but, unfortunately, we do not have the staff to

man this mobile blood bank if it is made available

to us. We are trying to interest this

philanthropist into doing something else. So it

will not be too much to suggest to the Member for

Changi that if he can really make a very good

appeal, then this mobile dental clinic will be

forthcoming to meet his needs. Perhaps if he could

ginger up some charitable organisation or philanthropist - not this particular one but other

philanthropists - they would be at hand to meet

his needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I assure the Minister

that I will try my very best. In view of his

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 40 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I here point out

again that we cannot debate the day-to-day running

of the statutory boards which are receiving funds

under this Head?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of

clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. Since we had no

opportunity whatsoever to debate the policy and

day-to-day running of these statutory boards

during the consideration of the Ordinary

Estimates, perhaps you can relax the rule and

allow us this opportunity to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The position is this. There are

rules governing debates on matters pertaining to

statutory boards. But Members have ample

opportunity in the way of Questions and Adjourn

ment Debates for these matters to be debated. If I

were to allow free rein on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>

for other matters which should rightly be debated.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr. S. V. Lingam and Mr. Ng Yeow Chong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I am not mistaken, the Public Utilities

Board has received a loan from the World Bank

after it has made out a convincing case to the

World Bank for a loan. And besides getting this

loan from the World Bank, the P.U.B. has also

received a loan of $20 million from the

Government. In spite of all this, the P.U.B. has

increased its water rates. Can the Minister advice

the P.U.B. to reduce their water rates?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lingam?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence to

mention a little complaint, since the Deputy Prime

Minister is here, and I will be very glad if he

can help me out. This is an ordinary complaint by

the man in the street.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the loan of $20 million to the

Public Utilities Board is, as I understand it, to

finance public utility projects so that the people

of Singapore can enjoy the services of water, gas

and electricity. The services provided by the

P.U.B. are of a very high standard as compared

with those of any other city in South-east Asia.

In our highly urbanised society, practically every

household is provided with water, electricity or

gas, and even waterborne sewage.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, this is hardly a

complaint!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I will come now to my

complaint. Even our rural dwellers are provided

with these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



essential services. So you will agree that the

task undertaken by the P.U.B. in improving these

essential services to cope up with urban

redevelopment is indeed a gigantic one. However,

there is a little complaint I wish to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the billing of service charges to

the consumers. The consumers, particularly flat

dwellers in Housing Board estates, are very

dissatisfied with the manner in which their con

solidated accounts are rendered. In some

instances, they are overcharged for the services

supplied. I have a few complaints of this nature.

When complaints are taken up with the appropriate

department, they are rectified and the consumers

are credited with the overcharge. In other

instances, the consumers are usually debited with

excessive amounts, many times their normal

charges. When queries are made, they are often

told that they were undercharged in the previous

bills, and the surcharge covers a period of 10 to

12 months. When I examined all their old bills, I

discovered that estimated charges were entered in

all these old bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not understand why meter

readings are not taken every month, so that the

consumers are fairly charged for the actual

consumption.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it due to a shortage of meter readers and, if

so, why has action not been taken to recruit more

people to do the job of meter reading? Sir, this

is now being drawn to the attention of the

authorities concerned. I earnestly hope the

Minister will urge the Public Utilities Board to

improve the situation so that this undesirable

state of affairs will be eradicated. Surely this

is not the kind of efficiency that the people of

Singapore can expect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the question raised

by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I would like

to inform him that the P.U.B. has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



permitted itself to spend $140.32 million for

1968. This sum of money will be spent as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$57.1 million for the Jurong Power Station;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$54.8 million for a system to distribute electricity;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3.9 million for the Gas Department;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$9.6 million to enlarge the Seletar Reservoir and, at the same time, to increase the filter at Woodleigh; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6.7 million to create a distribution system for the increase of water supply from Woodleigh.



<br><br>Of this capital expenditure, the P.U.B can only

finance $45.66 million from its own funds. It has

obtained a loan of $50.59 million from the World

Bank to finance its power and water capital works

and, at the same time, on deferred payment credit

it has obtained a loan of $24.07 million. This

total sum does not come up to the required capital

of $104.32 million and, therefore, the P.U.B, has

to apply to the Government for a sum of $20

million in order to fulfil the capital works for

next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the increase in the water charges, I can

only remind Members of the House that the price of

water charged to consumers had remained static

since 1954, and for the last 13 years there has

been no increase at all in the price of water

although the cost of production has gone up. For

example, in 1962 the cost of producing a thousand

gallons of water was 72.94 cents and in 1966 it

was 72.14 cents. In 1967 this year it is estimated

to increase to 78.42 cents, and for next year the

cost is going to rise to as much as 87.4 cents per

thousand gallons. This, of course, means that

somebody has got to bear the losses and up to

date, until the P.U.B. raised this water tariff,

the cost has been borne by the Public Utilities

Board. The result, of course, is that the P.U.B.

has found itself in very difficult circumstances,

and in order for it to obtain a loan from the

World Bank, it has to increase its tariff charges

on water especially, in order to guarantee that

the sum returned will be able to meet the interest

on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



capital borrowed as well as to return the

principal sum. I think that will satisfy the query

of the Member for Kampong Kembangan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaints raised by the Member for

Mountbatten, I can only say that there are 660,000

meters involving 230,000 bills which are dealt

with by the P.U.B. each month. On the average, it

has been found that 12,000 meters cannot be read

per month. That is, 1.8 per cent of the total

number of meters have not been accessible to the

P.U.B. meter readers for one reason or another.

Some of these reasons are that the houses were

locked and the meter readers could not have access

to the meters, or the meters were faulty or the

dials were blurred and the meter readers could not

read and, therefore, had to await changes in the

meters. Or there may be obstructions where the

meters are placed. Somebody may have placed a

table, a box or a pile of firewood next to the

meter and the result, of course, is that it is

impossible for the meter reader to have access to

the meter at all. These are some of the reasons

why 1.8 per cent of meters are not read per month

and, therefore, some estimates of charges will

have to be inserted into the monthly consolidated

account. These are based on the average

consumption per month. The complaints which the

Member for Mountbatten has mentioned just now

amount to only about 100 a month. There are

230,000 accounts and 100 complaints a month from

these bills, amounting to 0.04 per cent. I think,

all in all, the complaints are not excessive and I

believe the accounting system is working well. So

probably the Member for Mountbatten has come

across specific individual cases and these have

been brought to his attention. But it is not a

general complaint among P.U.B. consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I do not think there is any

inefficiency or overcharging by P.U.B.

accountants. In any case, when meters are finally

checked, any overpayments are credited to the

consumers' account, and if there have been under

payments then, of course, the consumers have to

pay the balance.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the Member for Mountbatten, I also

wish to crave your indulgence to say a few words

on the Housing Board. The main point I wish to

raise under this head is about the one-room

flats. In a block, the passage-way between the

units opposite to each other is very narrow.

Added to this difficulty, the doors of the unit

opposite to each other are in the same line.

Because of this, when the dwellers of the

opposite units keep their doors open, one can see

what is happening in the other house. This

reduces the privacy of these flat dwellers. Can

the Minister remedy this defect by changing the

design of future blocks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the home ownership

plan. I understand that some of the present

tenants have been given the option of buying the

flats in which they live now. Since the Board is

asking them to buy the flats all of a sudden,

they may not be in a position to raise enough

money for a down-payment, though they would be

happy to buy the flat. So I request the Minister

to waive the down-payment and extend the period

of loan in such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that there are many housing

estates without community centres, and it seems

that there will be none in certain cases. Will

the Minister consider providing the residents of

such estates with a community hall or a similar

facility so that they can get together?

Incidentally, I wish to point out that there are

very few amenities for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



the children living in those estates. I have come

across a lot of open spaces in the Housing and

Development Board estates, such as Queenstown,

Kallang, Tanjong Rhu, and Macpherson. Some of

these open spaces can be turned into better use

for the children as well as adults.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only

want to touch on the allocation of the flats, if

I may. There are applications for Housing Board

flats where the applicants have applied for

Housing Estate A but have been offered flats in

Housing Estate B, while there are other

applicants who have applied for Housing Estate B

and have been given Housing Estate A. This seems

to be an administrative fault, and I only want an

explanation from the Minister why there is such

an administrative difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, may I first say that our

efforts at housing the population do not appear

to be appreciated by Members of this House? But

they have been appreciated all over the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Barker, you were not

here when I asked Backbenchers not to spend

their time praising the Government but to make

use of the time as Opposition time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> My point is this, Sir,In Singapore

we have housed one-quarter of our population. My

predecessor, the former Minister for National

Development, was awarded the Magsaysay Award for

his efforts at housing and community work. But

all we hear in this House is "I want flat A. You

have given me flat B. The passages are too

narrow. You can see through your neighbour's

door." Members of this House cannot distinguish

the wood from the trees. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



are in a happy position today where we have housed

one-quarter of our population in Housing Board

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Well done!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not expecting praise. This is

more the work of my predecessor and of the Housing

Board itself. But all we hear are grumbles about

one room and two rooms. "When you sell a house,

give it free," they say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to deal with the specific complaints of the

Member for Aljunied. He says the staircases are

too narrow and the doors are on the opposite side

of each other. But one-room flats are one-room

flats. They are not very big. Neither is the room

big nor the staircase or the corridors in between.

But if the doors are opposite to each other, I

will ask my housing experts to look into the

complaint and try to satisfy the Member for

Aljunied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the down-payments, it is our policy to

accept 20 per cent of the purchase price. But we

must have some sort of deposit, and in many cases

the 20 per cent deposit has been reduced to 10 per

cent. In fact, there is no problem about the flats

at Tiong Bahru. All have been bought. Those who

have refused to buy for reasons of their own have

been transferred to other accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again the Member for Aljunied grumbles

about the lack of facilities in Housing Board

Estates. He says there are no community centres

and no community halls. They are not completely

absent. There is a community hall at Queenstown

and we are building two community halls at Toa

Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How about Macpherson Estate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Macpherson Estate is already up and

the constituents of Aljunied should consider

themselves lucky to have a roof over their heads.

You cannot expect the Government to give you

everything.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All you have to do is to go round South-east

Asia and you can see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



there are millions of people without homes. We are

in a happy position. We supply you with houses,

electricity, water and comfortable accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The people are paying for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> You are paying part. The Government is subsidising the other part.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> But the money belongs to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The money does belong to the people.

Hence the subsidy. But elsewhere you do not have

these houses. I challenge you to name one country

in South-east Asia which can come anywhere near us

in respect of housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Obviously Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for open spaces for children, wherever there

are open spaces available, if only the M.P. for

the area approaches the Housing Board and makes a

suggestion to convert an open space into a field

or playground, I can assure you that the Housing

Board will give it every consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah grumbles about

tenant A asking for flat B and getting another

flat and someone asking for flat A and instead

getting flat B. There are many reasons why this

can happen. One possible explanation is that the

applicant for estate A may have been far behind in

the waiting list and hence was given another flat

which was lower down as far as priority is con

cerned. But if the Member for Telok Blangah knows

of two tenants, one living in, say, flat A and the

other living in flat B and both are unhappy about

it and wish to do an exchange, this will be

granted readily, provided, of course, the rents

are the same. This has been done. There are

thousands of flats being allocated. Sometimes

these things happen. If you live in a flat in

Tiong Bahru and you do not like it, and you have a

friend who likes Tiong Bahru and is prepared to

give up his flat for yours, we say good luck to

you both. But tenants of Housing Board estates are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



very fussy, as I pointed out yesterday. They not

only want a particular estate, but they want a

particular room on a particular floor in a

particular block. And we cannot accommodate

everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister said that he was not expecting

praise. He was not. He demanded it. While we are

in the happy position of accommodating a quarter

of our population in Housing Board flats, for

which I think the Government deserve lavish

praise, I wonder whether the Minister will look

into the proposition of building better flats now

that our society is getting more affluent, instead

of just building one-room units.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are there any other Members who

wish to speak on this head before I call the

Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I do not come to this House for

praise. What I am trying to point out to Members

is that they do not realise the position. They

grumble about one-room flats and narrow passages

and doors through which tenants can look at each

other. Their constituents are lucky that they have

rooms over their heads. That is the point and for

which I take no credit. I have only recently

joined the Ministry. My predecessors take all the

credit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the specific point raised by the

Member for Choa Chu Kang, he says build better

flats. We are doing so. We have built four-room

flats in Henderson Road. We thought of putting

them up for sale, but then we changed our minds

and agreed to let these flats out. At the moment,

unfortunately, only about half of these flats have

been let out. But we hope in a month or two all

will be taken up. There are, roughly, a little

less than 400 flats at Henderson Road. One reason

might be that the rent is too high. It is $120 for

a month with conservancy charges of about $6.50.

And should these flats not be taken up, we will

either have to reduce the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



rent to suit everyone's pocket or, in the final

analysis, sell the flats to those who want to buy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am withdrawing, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 40 be

reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this head, the total estimated expenditure

is $119,007,000 which will be mainly used to

provide loans to the Housing Board of $50 million,

to the Public Utilities Board of $20 million, and

to the Jurong Industrial Estate of $20 million. I

would like to put forward two suggestions under

this topic. Firstly, I would like to point out to

the Minister that the policy of house ownership

for the people has been well received, but this

policy has been confined only to certain areas. I

would like to ask him whether he will consider

selling all the Housing Board flats to the tenants

because this will be welcomed by the people.

Secondly, last year I suggested to the House that

the Housing Board should employ lift attendants

for the flats. The Minister seems not to have

listened to what I said. I believe that the

expenses for such lift attendants will be

willingly borne by the tenants. There are three

advantages to this. Firstly, more job

opportunities will be created. Secondly, the lifts

will be kept clean. Thirdly, the tenants' safety

can be well taken care of.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, we have two and a half

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Shortly, in answer to the Member for

Sembawang, our policy is to sell as many flats as

possible. We want to encourage home ownership in

Singapore. But not everybody can afford to buy a

flat. So I would suggest that the Member for

Sembawang gets his facts right before he asks me

to sell all Housing Board flats in Singapore.

Rented houses are subsidised and houses which are

purchased are not. And besides it is because of

lack of finance that many a tenant cannot buy his

flat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of lifts, he alleges that I

was not listening to him last year. I can assure

him that I did. I did listen Land surveys have

been carried out asking tenants whether they want

lift attendants. Surveys were conducted in Queens-town and MacPherson estates. But the xesponse to

these surveys showed a very negligible percentage

of tenants who are in favour of an additional

charge in rder to pay for these lift attendants.

The last survey was carried out in MacPherson

estate, resulting in 3.6 per cent who agreed in

principle to pay the :additional charge of $2.50

per month, 19.5 per cent were not in favour, and

76 per cent did not bother to reply. So this is

the reason why I suggest to the Member that he

gets his facts right.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I take it you are

withdrawing the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 52 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the vote for $646,900 for the

establishment of a branch library at Queenstown.

My only complaint is that there is no provision

for establishing branch libraries in other

satellite towns, e.g., at Toa Payoh which is

being built now and will soon be populated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b>Briefly, Sir, I am glad to note that the Member for Choa Chu Kang has expressed his

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, we are extremely short of time.

for more branch libraries to be built in other

areas such as Toa Payoh and Jurong, as suggested

by the hon. Member, is well taken care of by the

Ministry of Culture. In fact, we recognise the

need for more permanent branch libraries to be

built in densely populated areas such as satellite

towns. But I hope the Member will appreciate that

merely by building a branch library is not all the

problem. It will involve the acquisition of books

and the training of library officers. However, we

still intend to build more branch libraries in

densely populated areas when the need arises.

for the public and in particular for the tourists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been much talk by

the Government about attracting tourists to

Singapore. The Museum is one of the main tourist

attractions. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



am not so sure whether the Minister has been to

the Museum recently. If not, I suggest he pays it

a visit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I suggest that a notice be placed at

the gate of the Museum, "Not for Tourists", in

order to save the tourists dollars.

only a few words to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, the Chair will take

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I will only take one

minute, Sir,I have another point to raise. The

captions in the National Museum should be in four

languages in line with our multi-lingual policy so

that people - especially the students - in all the

four streams can gain historical knowledge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, it is acknowledged that

there is a need to reorganise and modernise the

National Museum. In fact, this was pointed out as

early as 1957 by Dr Van der Hoogh who was then a

temporary museum adviser to U.N.E.S.C.O. when he led a

mission to Singapore. In his report, he pointed

out that while the Museum was rich in its

collections and centrally located, it was none the

less outmoded and gave an old-fashioned

impression. He suggested ways in which the Museum

could be modernised to fulfil the functions

required and expected of a modern museum. We have

studied the matter in conjunction with the recom

mendations made in the same direction by the

Science and Industry Museum Committee in its

report to the Minister for Education in 1961.

Plans are in hand to reorganise and modernise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



National Museum, and I assure Members of the

House that their opinions have already been

considered in our planning. I shall not go into

details on how the money is to be spent in view of

the shortage of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally touch on the suggestion by the

Member for Delta that the, exhibits should be

written in four languages? This is the ideal thing

to do, in view of the fact that there are four

official languages in Singapore, but there are one

or two snags which the Member will appreciate.

Difficulty is experienced in expressing some

technical terms, particularly in Malay - perhaps

this can be achieved in time - and even in

Chinese. As Members know, the exhibits in the

National Museum are of scientific, archaelogical

and historical value and' sometimes it is very

difficult to assign a proper translation to them

into the, other languages except in English. Even

some of the objects are in Latin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate for this Head is $825,000 for the

year 1968. A sum of $200,000 is provided for Works

and Buildings for the Junior Approved School and a

sum  of $500,000 is provided for the Home for  the

Aged, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government should build homes

for  handicapped children. At the moment,  I  know

that   such   homes  arc  provided  by  charitable

organisations and not by Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know when the Home for the Aged will be

ready?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker. Sir, on the question of the Home for

the  Aged,  I think we have enough of such  homes.

There are three at the moment: one is Bushey  Park

Home,  one is Woodstock Home, and there is a third

one at Woodlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to homes for handicapped children,

we have at the moment nine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>

there is no need for the Government to build  more

of  such  homes. But we will certainly assist  the

voluntary organisations in whatever way we can.

Aged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister or his

Parliamentary Secretary to inform the House of the

number  of  children's playgrounds that have  been

built  this year and the number that will be built

next  year. Why is there a necessity for a  revote

of $40,400? I have a suggestion to make. Is it not

possible  to include some playgrounds in community

centres if there is enough space?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for   Punggol   has  asked  for  the   number   of

playgrounds.  I  do not have the  information  now

because  we have so many playgrounds in Singapore.

But if he needs it, I will go back to the Ministry

and send him a list of the playgrounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the revote raised by the hon.

Member,  we  are  using it for one  playground  in

Geylang Serai and one playground in Jalan Padang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary has answered only one point of the three

points I have raised. I want to know the number of

playgrounds  built this year and the  number  that

will  be  built next year. But if he  can  provide

supplementary information at a later stage, I will

be  grateful  to  him.  He  has  not  answered  my

question  as  to  whether it will be  possible  to

include  a  children's playground in  a  community

centre if there is enough space.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the   playgrounds  near  community  centres   will

definitely  be  under the charge of  the  People's

Association. This matter does not come within  the

portfolio of the Ministry of Social Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member</b>: You are passing the buck!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I am not

passing  the  buck. In case there  is  'land,  the

Member  for  Punggol can certainly  write  to  the

People's  Association  which  will  consider   his

request.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  is very confused over my suggestion.  I

was  saying  that suppose a community  centre  has

some  vacant space, would his department  consider

putting up a playground there? The problem that  I

can  foresee is probably the question of ownership

of  that  ground. Then the Parliamentary Secretary

might say, "Look, if the Social Affairs Department

puts  a playground there and also looks after  it,

then  it  is  the  property of the Social  Affairs

Department."  But I say: for the  benefit  of  the

community, fqrget these little technicalities, and

grant these facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  there is any ,confusion. If there is  empty

ground  near the community centre, definitely  the

People's Association can look into it.

If  he  has  any  empty space, and  he  wants  the

Ministry to look into it, he can write in  and  we

will consider it.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of  Mr Tang See Chim

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item is for a water fountain to be

installed in a lake. I would like to know where

this fountain is to be located. Firstly, I would

have thought that there are no lakes in Singapore,

but we do have ponds and reservoirs. Secondly, why

is it necessary to build such a costly fountain?

Would it serve as a tourist attraction? And would

not the amount of $138,000 be better utilised for

the benefit of the community?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I fully support the sentiments of my colleague,

the Member for Punggol, when he said that it is a

waste of money building a fountain in the lake in

the Botanic Gardens, and that this money could be

better spent elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of aesthetic taste to

be considered. I think the Botanic Gardens in its

natural surroundings is a very beautiful place and

its beauty will not be enhanced one little bit

with the building of a fountain in the lake. It

will only disturb the fish and frighten the swans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I wonder whether a very good

fountain can be built for $138,000. I remember,

during last year's debate on the building of a

floating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



fountain at the MacRitchie Reservoir, the Minister

for Law and National Development quoted the

cryptic remark of the Finance Minister. I quote,

Sir, this is in Hansard Vol. 25, No. 6, col.

385:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Better to have two or three lavish fountains

than to have a large number of scraggy ones."'.



<br><br>I wonder whether this fountain to be built will be

a scraggy one. And even if it were to be a lavish

one, I do not suppose we can compete with cities

that are renowned for their

fountains, for example, the Tivoli Fountains of

Rome

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know there are fountains in

the Western hemisphere which are so lavish that

they can throw patterns for one full hour in jets

of water without repeating any of those patterns.

If this is one of the schemes, to attract

tourists, I think it is a very mis- conceived

scheme. I think the money can be better used

elsewhere. For example, $138,000 will bring water

to Yew Tee Village in Choa Chu Kang, for which

over hundreds of families will be very grateful.

But with the fountain, we please no one, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is rather regrettable that this fountain

is not to be put up in Punggol or in Choa Chu

Kang. I must also clear this point that it is not

the Member for Tanglin (the Minister for National

Development) who suggested building a fountain in

his area. In fact, it was the Prime Minister who

suggested in 1966 that a gyrating water fountain

be installed in the Garden lake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The Prime

Minister was wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> The Director

of Public Works was consulted on this matter and

he recommended the installation of a floating

fountain with underwater coloured floodlights at a

cost of $38,000. However, this proposal was

considered not suitable because (a) the fountain

proposed was not of a gyrating type, and (b) it

was not possible to site such a fountain in the

heavily silted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



water of the lake. The present scheme submitted by

the Senior Electrical Engineer consists of a

composite set of three fountains at a total cost

of $138,000. This increased cost is due to the

following factors: (1) the fountains recommended

are of a gyrating type as originally suggested by

the Prime Minister. (2) A filtration plant will

need to be installed so that the fountain can

filter the silted water of the lake; and (3) this

fountain will be provided with floodlights, as

steps are being taken to have the Garden open to

the public at night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is time, I would like

to give breakdown figures of the estimated cost

of the project. For a set of three fountains

which cost about $25,000 each, and totalling

$75,000, 36 floodlights at $500 each, and

totalling about $18,000, pumping equipment for a

storage well for water supply to the fountain set

costing about $5,000, plant room storage well,

fountain piping, etc., cost about $2,000 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I raise a point of clarification? I

wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary can

answer our question of priorities rather than

giving us a list of all the details. If he wishes

to give us the details, we will take them in a

memorandum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

connected with the question that the Member for

Choa Chu Kang is asking. In fact, he talked about

how beautiful the fountain heads of other

countries are and all that sort of thing. In fact,

we are determined to build Singapore as a Garden

City. We have to have some beauty in our own

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the idea of the Member for Choa Chu Kang

to supply more water, in fact, it is now the rainy

season and there is a lot of water. Does he want

more water in his area or does he want more pipes

in his area? We have to beautify our country

definitely.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the answer to the

question that Mr Ng asks is that the lake is in

the Botanic Gardens?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Can I say a few words?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am dealing now with one point.

When I finish, I will call you, Madam Chan. Mr

Chan Chee Seng. I suppose the answer to Mr Ng's

question is that the lake is in the Botanic Gardens?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Having heard from the Parliamentary

Secretary, it would seem that after the water

fountains have been built, the Botanic Gardens

will be open during the night. My understanding is

that the Botanic Gardens will shut by 7.00 p.m.

Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to

help romantic couples go in and enjoy themselves!

This would damage the dignity of the Gardens. I

feel it should be a place for students to go and

study. If it is to be open even during the night

after the fountains have been built, then there is

no way to prevent courting couples from going in.

It may not then be of use to other persons. For

instance, students who wish to go to the Botanic

Gardens to study or do some research or even to

enjoy the scenery, may be offended by the romantic

sights they see around them. The Parliamentary

Secretary should consider the point whether the

Botanic Gardens should be open during the night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, you are not going to

suggest floodlighting the place at night, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Not at all. I have something

else in mind. In every country there is a national

park and they feel proud of it. If you travel to

other countries the national park is one of the

many spots you will visit. Can the Parliamentary

Secretary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



the Minister for Social Affairs enlighten this

House on whether there is a plan to build a

national park or to enlarge the Botanic Gardens

into a national park?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta has said

just now that the fountains to be built in the

Botanic Gardens may draw a lot of courting couples

into the Gardens. In actual fact, Singapore is a

young country. I think it would be a good thing.

Every young couple should go through this stage!

If they cannot go to the Botanic Gardens, they can

go elsewhere and make friends. Since we have seen

so many couples along the beaches, we must not

think that when young couples go to the Botanic

Gardens they will act indecently. I think members

of the public should have the right to go in. It

is now under consideration only. We have not come

to the final stage yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the time when the Botanic Gardens

will remain open, this has yet to be decided. It

may depend on whether or not there are incidents

such as robbery, and so on which may happen in the

Botanic Gardens. The security of the people there

should be taken into consideration. They should

have a sense of security when they visit the

Botanic Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about a national park, the suggestion by

the Member for Mountbatten is a good one. I think

the Ministry can consider this point. But there

are other considerations to bear in mind. It is

not so simple to have a national park. According

to my understanding, a national park may involve a

lot of artificial structures such as we can see in

the national parks in other countries. Even zoos

are included in the national park. Some types of

plants are also sold in the national parks. The

question to be considered is whether artificial

things put into the park will spoil the natural

scenery or beauty.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Development Estimates

this item is shown as "Improvement to Beaches". I

suppose this is principally concerned with the

cleaning of beaches. I am glad to see in'

yesterday's papers that the Tourist Promotion

Board is taking a hand in cleaning up our beaches

which could be very beautiful but for the uncivic

consciousness of some of our beach users. The

beaches in Singapore have been littered with

rubbish like beer cans and other things. I am also

very glad to see that my colleague, the Member for

Changi, also took a very active part in the

campaign which was also helped by some very

prominent businessmen in our Republic. I hope this

will set an example which other people can follow.

Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make an appeal to

our people to have more regard for other users of

beaches and also to help keep our beaches clean?

Apart from the tourist promotion point of view, it

can also be very beneficial' to ourselves. In this

regard, Sir, may I ask the Minister to look into

the question of providing more bins properly

labelled? For example, call a spade a spade; call

a rubbish bin a rubbish bin and not a litter bin,

because there can be a misunderstanding by

tourists who are not English-educated. These

tourists could put letters and postcards into

those bins.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I believe the Member for

Choa Chu Kang is referring to the beach-cleaning

campaign last Sunday when about 100 or more civic-minded citizens of Singapore went to the beaches

to carry out the campaign. Among them was a V.I.P.

from this House, none other than the Member for

Changi. The newspapers of all languages had given

this campaign a lot of publicity. A tribute must

be paid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



to all those who participated in the beach-cleaning campaign. Sir, I understand this is not

the first time but rather the third time that a

campaign of this sort was carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that when this House

discussed the Development Estimates for 1967 on

20th December last year in Committee of Supply, I

requested the Government to build beach resorts

and recreational amenities near the seaside not

only for the citizens of Singapore but also to

attract tourists. This aspect of work has now been

transferred to the Tourist Promotion Board this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Social Affairs said in this House -

I quote from Hansard, col. 1015, No. 13 of Volume 25, dated 20-12-66:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, the need for better recreational facilities

on our beaches is becoming urgent, and it is

proposed to make a start at the Changi Beach which

has proved extremely popular with the local

population.'



<br><br>And he went on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If this pilot project [the pilot project means

improvement to the beaches at Changi proves a

success, plans will be made for further similar

projects both at Changi Beach and other beaches on

the Island.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a full year has elapsed and no

beach resorts have been built as planned. Now that

the improvement to beaches and their maintenance

are placed in the charge of the Tourist Promotion

Board, I expect the work wilt be speeded up.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, we have one minute more

for this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I am coming to the end now.

It is, therefore, my fervent hope that the

Minister will urge the Tourist Promotion Board to

make full use of the vote of $100,000 provided for

this purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, 30 seconds left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I think it is a little unfair if I

have only 30 seconds to answer questions about why

I do not develop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



beaches and all that. I think if Members of the

House want answers from me, they should give me a

little more time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, Sir, this item - improvement to beaches

- was previously under the Parks and Recreation

Division. In July this year Government decided

that the Tourist Promotion Board be charged with

this responsibility. The Board has drawn up

schemes for the maintenance and improvement of

beaches and for their development. The cleaning

and maintenance by the Board will take effect from

1st of January next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards development, several major as well as

minor schemes to offer both simple and

sophisticated seaside facilities have been

prepared. They include land concessions, tenders

for which have been drawn up and are ready for

publication, and construction projects which will

require capital investment, in some cases

amounting to millions of dollars. These schemes,

which are at present being studied, will, it is

hoped, be finalised and announced shortly.

Government has accepted responsibility for

assisting with the infrastructure necessary to

make these schemes possible. I assure the Member

for Mountbatten and Members of this House that

1968 will see cleaner and more attractive beaches

in Singapore provided, of course, ---

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the former fire site at Kampong Eunos was

acquired by Government way back in 1962. To date,

the fire site has not been developed. I wish to

know the area of the site acquired by Government,

and also can the Government lease the site to the

residents there for the purpose of building

community projects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1963 Government

acquired about 44,650 square feet of land in

Kampong Eunos affected by fire. The acquisition

was undertaken in anticipation of future

development of the area. The site, however, is too

small to be developed independently. The Member

for Kampong Kembangan wishes to use the site for a

community centre or a centre for his Citizens'

Consultative Committee. The People's Association

appear to have completed their development

programme for community centres, which may account

for the fact that no applications have been

received by the Land Office for the use of this

site as a community centre. I can assure the

Member that the land will be released to the

People's Association if it is prepared to

undertake the construction, maintenance and manage

ment of a community centre there. But taking into

consideration the fact that there is another

community centre in Jalan Pengaga which is about a

quarter of a mile away from the fire site, it is

not unlikely that the People's Association may

feel that another community centre in such close

proximity may not be justified. But that is a

matter for the People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing land for Citizens' Consultative

Committees is an entirely different matter. There

are about 51 such corninittees on the island, and

giving one means meeting demands from others. I

think we should have a policy decision from

Government before Government land or State land is

made available to Citizens' Consultative

Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 62 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish the Minister can explain why the

$300,000 has to be revoted for when there was none

last year or this year, and the number of car

parks that will be built and their locations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision of

$300,000 for 1968 is earmarked for the proposed

underground car park at St. Andrew's Cathedral

grounds. The total cost for the project will be in

the region of $1 million. The section of North

Bridge Road from Stamford Road to Elgin Bridge is

one of the busiest in Singapore, forming the main

thoroughfare of the central business district, and

it carries about 35,000 vehicles daily and 2,740

vehicles per hour at peak hours. Over 75,000

vehicles a'ppear daily at the intersections at the

same time because of obstructions caused by cars

parked in front of the shops flanking both sides

of the road. This section is the scene of almost

continuous traffic jams and delays blocking up

entirely the road and intersections. From the

financial point of view, this project is also very

advantageous. The estimated cost of the project is

SI million and there will be about 250 parking

lots and the net income is expected to be about

$300,000 per year. It will, in addition, as I have

mentioned, give enormous advantages from the

traffic point of view.

subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this vote there is a sum of $240,000

provided for land acquisition and ex gratia

payments in connection with the East Coast

foreshore reclamation scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I seek information from the Hon. Minister

for Law and National Development as to whether

T.O.L. holders will be compensated for making

improvements to the foreshore such as a jetty, a

pier or a swimming pool? The T.O.L. holders are

not only deprived of access to the sea but they

have also to face the loss of their foreshore

improvements which they built at some cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in the case of improvements to

the foreshore made by T.O.L. holders, due

compensation will be made if they are affected by

clearance. But under land acquisition, no ex

gratia payment is made if that is what the Member

for Mountbatten is thinking of. Compensation,

yes. As the Member is well aware, compensation is

paid under the Land Acquisition Act, and if the

compensation is considered madequate, there is

provision in the Act for appeals to the Appeals

Board which has only recently begun sittings and

has heard, I think, about six appeals up to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with resettlement, it has been the

practice to award compensation to settlers and

squatters who have no legal title to the land,

provided they are in occupation when such land is

required or cleared for development purposes.

Compensation is calculated on the basis of

improvements found on the land according to a

fixed scale which has been in force for some

time. And the reason for paying compensation is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



to minimise the hardships caused by the

dislocation of settlers and squatters.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarification from the Hon.

Minister on the policy of rehousing displaced

trades such as workshops, tinsmiths and charcoal

shops. As the present position stands, these obnoxious trades are not offered alternative

accommodation in the Housing and Development

Board's housing estates. For instance, 17

workshops affected by the "Golden Mile" Scheme

were not offered Board's accommodation. The

charcoal shops from the urban renewal areas were

also told to change their trade because it was not

possible to relocate them to Housing Board shop-houses in view of the nature of their trade.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resettlement officers maintain that it is

very difficult for this type of trade to survive

in Housing and Development Board housing estates

because the Board's flats are supplied with

essential utilities. Here, Sir, I have a

representation from the Singapore Charcoal

Dealers' Association which is in my constituency.

The charcoal dealers have been in this trade for

more than 20 years, dating as far back as pre-war

days. About 20.000 persons are directly or

indirectly dependent on the trade for their

livelihood. It is easy for our Government

officials to suggest to them that they should

change their trade,, but they do not realise the

difficulties that will confront these charcoal

dealers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Charcoal Dealers' Association

contend that charcoal dealers should be allowed to

carry on with their business in the Board's shop-houses until such time as they are able to adapt

themselves to other trades, otherwise if they

cannot find suitable alternative accommodation,

they will have to close down their business. Of

course, this is a very obnoxious trade and so are

the workshops and machine-shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will be kind enough to

urge the Housing and Development Board to look for

a solution to this problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to touch on the expenditure for

resettlement. I hope the sum allotted will be

used properly so that adequate cornpensation can

be paid in resettlement cases. Sometimes the land

in question belongs to the Housing Board and not

to private owners or the Land Office. The question

arises whether compensation will be paid to

families affected by resettlement. With regard to

the vote for resettlement, what areas does the

Minister have in mind? Will it be used for areas

like North Bridge Road or South Bridge Road in the

urban areas or for other areas? These two areas

are marked as Urban North and Urban South. Can the

Minister enlighten me on whether the compensation

is in respect of private investment or public

housing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has touched on the

question of small merchants and businessmen.

Yesterday, the Minister said that he would not

like to make recommendations to the Minister for

Finance regarding compensation to these small

traders. I feel that the resettled small traders

should be well looked after so that they will not

be unemployed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I will deal first with the Member for

Mountbatten who agrees that the charcoal trade is

an obnoxious trade. He has asked my Ministry to

find accommodation for such trades in Housing and

Development Board shop-, houses. If this is done,

it will lead to protests by residents of Housing

Board' flats. The only solution appears to me to

be that these traders should find their' own

accommodation. But I am not aware that the Housing

Board has ad-vised them to change their trades. I

do not think they have done so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> There was an instance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If there was an instance,

I think the Member should give me the

particulars by way of a letter or quote

a letter from the Housing Board so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



I can look into it. I do not think it is the

Board's duty to ask people to change, their trades

or occupations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> There was a

particular instance in which a resettled person

was advised to change his trade. It is all stated

in the letter. The resettle'ment officer went to

the extent of say.ing that the change of trade was

well received, particularly by the charcoal

dealers themselves. I wonder how he could have

formed such an opinion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I suggest that the Member should

send me a copy of the letter so that proper

investigations can be carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Delta, I did not

say yesterday that we do not help shop-keepers at

all. What I said yesterday was that the Government

is :subsidising housing and that it cannot

subsidise businesses. But we do give preferential

treatment to shop-keepers under clearance. In

fact, they are given priority for Board shops at

concessional rents without going through the

normal tender system. The concessional rents

take the form of a scheme known as the rising

rental system, that is to say, paying less for

the first year and gradually rising year by year

for three years until the rents reach the market

rents.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would

like to clarify one point. The Minister has said

that these resettled merchants and traders have

been given concessional rents without going

ahrough the normal system of tendering. I think

this is a mistake, because they have to go

through this procedure to obtain shop

accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If you want a shop, you have to

apply for it. But preferential treatment is given

to shop-keepers under  clearance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also wanted to know whether

the vote of $5 million for 1968 is for Urban South

or Urban North. I think it would be better if I

told her the exact clearance areas for which this

vote is intended. The areas are (1) Upper Changi

area and Kallang Basin Reclamation; (2) Jurong

industrial development; (3) Tiong Bahru,

Queenstown extension and Telok Blangah housing

projects; and (4) minor sites required by the

P.W.D. for its projects such as schools, roads,

sewerage and other essential services. Perhaps it

would satisfy the Member if I gave her some

figures of the amounts of compensation paid to

families affected by clearances from 1961. In

1961, 294 families were paid

$273,000 as compensation. In 1962, 817 families

were paid $883,000. In

1963, 1,181 families were paid

$1,700,000. In 1964, 3,643 families were paid

$3,200,000. In 1965, about 6,500 families were

paid $5½ million. In 1966, about 6,000 families

were paid $5,100,000. I am only hoping, Sir, that

the provision for this year will be adequate and

that I will not have to come back to this House to

ask for a supplementary vote.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am in full agreement that the

Central Abattoir in Jurong is needed for the

slaughtering of animals for the meat canning

factory there, I shall be grateful if the Minister

for Law and National Development will look into

the inconvenience caused to butchers in the rural

areas who have to go all the way to Jurong to have

their animals slaughtered, especially pigs. This

will result in extra expenditure which will have

to be borne by the consumer.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subhead 105, Rural Abattoirs, a provision

of a token vote of $10 is made. I would urge the

Minister to make full use of this token vote to

press for the building of rural abattoirs. Sir, in

rural areas or constituencies like Upper

Serangoon, Changi, Tampines, or, for that matter,

Punggol - Paya Lebar to be included, Sir - the

butchers face much difficulty. This is the point

we must understand, and where a token vote is

provided for, we should make full use of it. Much

representation has been made by the butchers,

especially those in Punggol and Upper Serangoon.

but I am sad to say that they seem to have fallen

on deaf ears. With this token

vote for rural abattoirs, I hope the Minister will

press that there is a need ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I do

not think there is a quorum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member</b>: There are only 12 Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir,I hope that next

time when I speak, my friend the Member for Choa

Chu Kang will not care to interrupt. This cuts jif

a lot of time. While Members are complaining that

they have no time and Ministers too have no time

to reply, one Member here stands up and says,. "No

quorum." Thank you very much, Sir, for saying

that there is a quorum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to my point - rural abattoirs. I am

making a special appeal in this House for the

consideration of the Minister to construct rural

abattoirs in certain rural areas where they can be

located for the convenience of the' butchers. In

the markets, probably the butchers could sell a

few pigs a day.. But if you have to travel all the

way to the Central Abattoir in Jurong, which

actually is meant for meat canning - do you get the

services you want? I do not know, but this is an

important point that I want to press home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, shortly, the

Central Abattoir at Jurong was built not only for

the slaughter of livestock for local needs but

also for export. However, the facilities that the

abattoir provides may not be made use of by

residents in rural areas remote from Jurong. Their

needs are fully appreciated, and accordingly it is

proposed to build three rural abattoirs of smaller

units in the rural areas. These would provide

convenient slaughtering facili -ties for the

people in the rural areas, enable the

implementation of veterinary public health

measures to be carried out effectively in the

supply of wholesale meat, and reduce illegal

slaughter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote of $10 is only nominal. The reason is

this: these three projects can only be implemented

after the new Jurong abattoir has been in full

operation, so that a full assessment of the needs

of subsidiary rural abattoirs can be made, after

which we can decide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



whether or not to have these rural

abattoirs and where to build them. We have not

chosen the sites yet and I am afraid the Member

for Punggol will have to wait.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, there is no doubt that the

$10 token vote is there, but as I have pointed out

just now, I appeal to the Minister to convince his

colleague the Minister for Finance to provide the

necessary funds for the building of abattoirs in

the rural areas. Until the Jurong Abattoir has been

completed, the residents living in areas remote

from Jurong in the meantime will be suffering and

how can we relieve them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if they have been

suffering, they must have been suffering for many a

year! Were there rural abattoirs which we have demolished? Surely not. All I ask the Member is to be

patient. We are aware of these problems. We do not

expect Jurong to satisfy the needs of the whole

island. The only reason, as I have said, for the

$10 vote is that we do not have immediate plans to

build these abattoirs, but we certainly have not

forgotten the need for such abattoirs.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, I take it you are

withdrawing your amendment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 63 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 203.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from the rural constituency of Choa Chu

Kang. Sir, and these centres and schemes are hardly

felt there. Perhaps the Minister can let the House

know what are the centres and schemes going to do

and also to give it the widest publicity so that

the rural people who are engaged in agriculture

will have the benefit of any schemes that are being

established.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, first, the $10 vote for

Agriculture Extension Centres.

There are 10 Agriculture and Veterinary Centres at

present in various parts of the rural areas in

Singapore where there are large concentrations of

farming communities. Workers from the Primary

Production Department operate from these centres.

However, there is quite a large number of smaller

concentrations of farming communities quite remote

from existing centres where farmers cannot

regularly obtain the services of the Primary

Production Department.

The department, therefore, proposes to set up

smaller extension centres, each comprising a house-cum-office where an extension centre worker will be

permanently based in these remote farming

communities, so that the farmers there will also

benefit from the services provided by the Primary

Production Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item - Intensive Farm Improvement

Schemes. In order to find ways and means of

increasing the agricultural productivity of

existing farms in Singapore and to improve the

fertility of swamp land reclaimed for agricultural

use, the Primary Production Department proposes to

establish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



facilities for research in soil and fertilisers,

plant breeding and selection of seeds,

insecticides and control of plant diseases. The

establishment of this proposed soil and fertiliser

laboratory is complementary to the schemes for re

claiming swamp land for agricultural use and

improving and intensifying the production of

vegetable crops from existing farms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang may be interested

to know that a U.N, team was invited to Singapore

in 1965 to make a feasibility study of reclamation

of tidal swamps for agricultural use. The mission

recommended, inter alia, soil surveys and physical

and chemical analysis of soil samples taken from

swamp land as well as experiments in cover crops,

vegetable crop selection and rotation, soil

improvement and fertilisation. Farming in

Singapore is extremely intensive in that a wide

variety of crops, mainly vegetables, are grown in

small plots of land about an acre per farm. Due to

perennial planting and in the absence of seasons,

soil fertility, crop varieties, and pests and

disease control play an important part in

sustaining the economic returns from the land. The

proposed laboratory, therefore, has an important

role to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item, Sir - Factory Farming Pilot

Scheme. In view of the limited land area in

Singapore, farming must of necessity be of an

intensive nature so that farmers can carry out

their activities in the minimum area of land to

achieve maximum production. This is as the Member

for Choa Chu Kang has advised. He thinks that it

is particularly desirable, and so do we. In live

stock production, animals or poultry can be reared

in livestock houses and cages, so that the minimum

area of land is required. It is the intention of

the department to carry out a series of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



experiments on livestock husbandry with particular

emphasis on intensive housing for livestock. We

hope such methods will achieve some measure of

success and that they will be introduced by the

farmer subsequently for general application.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, it is very much

regretted that only a token sum of $10 is provided

for 1968 for agricultural development of Pulau

Ubin and Pulau Tekong.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development himself

has visited Pulau Tekong and he knows exactly the

poverty of the island. I remember sometime ago a

research committee was formed to do a special

research of the island and it recommended to the

Government to utilise the land around our islands

for agricultural purposes. Can the Minister

enlighten this House on the result of the research

committee's work and whether its recommendations

can be implemented immediately so that the people

in the islands will be better off?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again in subhead 205, I wonder whether the

Minister has overlooked the importance of the

"Research Services and Marketing Organisation for

Export of Orchids and Horticultural products."

There is only a provision of $10 for 1968. I think

this organisation is quite important for the

export of orchid blooms to Europe and the United

States. I have here with me the Asia Magazine

dated 22nd October, 1967. At page 6, column 4,

line 23, I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In l960 Singapore growers exported a relatively

insignificant US$37,600 worth of cut orchid blooms

to florists in Europe and the United States. By

1965 this figure had been tripled. Last year, that

is 1966 the exports soared to US$250,000; and,

with demand rapidly snowballing, few doubt that

Singapore's orchid industry will pass the million-dollar mark before long.'



<br><br>In 1966 we earned US$250,000, that is to say, the

amount that was declared. But I think it is well

over US$250,000. From this little effort by

backyard orchid growers and four or five big

orchid growers, we can get such a big amount of

foreign exchange. If there is proper organisation

and research, I, think the orchid industry can

assist our economy to a certain extent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make this suggestion to the

Minister for his consideration. Since our climate

is very suitable for orchid growing and we have

what I would call a natural greenhouse, would he

consider the establishment immediately of an

orchid institute like the Rubber Research

Institute of Malaysia, and lease out suitable

agricultural land to orchid growers who are

interested in the study of orchids, and build an

orchid nursery subject to the requirements of the

authorities?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in order to make maximum

utilisation of whatever land resources we have in

Singapore, the Government realises that it is

necessary for us to investigate into lands which

are not yet fully utilised. Though we are a small

island, we have smaller islands around us, three

of which are in Changi - i.e., Pulau Ubin, Pulau

Tekong Besar and Pulau Tekong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



Kehil. The two biggest islands are Pulau Ubin and

Pulau Tekong. They have areas of approximately

2,500 acres and 4,500 acres respectively. The populations are small, about 2,000 in Ubin and about

6,000 in Tekong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They are very poor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They are poor, as the

Member for Changi has pointed out. I did visit

these islands not very long ago and I myself felt

that there was scope for the lands to be put to

use. My Ministry has carried out a survey of the

possibilities which these two islands may have to

offer. The survey has been completed and the

recommendations have been made to Government.

According to preliminary information, the lands on

both islands are most suitable for intensive

agricultural use. We have as yet not acted on

these recommendations, but I can assure the Member

for Changi that the matter is well in hand and

Government will soon act on the recommendations of

the report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Member dealt with the question of

orchids. As the Minister for Finance pointed out

the other day, we have little land in Singapore

and perhaps the most economic way of using the

little land we have is to cultivate orchids, sell

them abroad and bring in a lot of foreign

exchange. The Member for Changi has pointed out

that we only have a $10 vote. But I can assure him

that the Primary Production Department has

recognised the importance of the annual export of

orchids which, as the Member has pointed out,

amounts to about US$250,000 per year, and the

Department has taken steps to encourage more

farmers to grow more orchids. Pamphlets and

bulletins are distributed to farmers for the

purpose of instructing them on the technical as

pects of growing orchids. In fact, the Department

is planning a larger orchid nursery than the one

that it has now. It is envisaged that more orchid

saplings will be propagated and sold to farmers at

a nominal charge. The question of selling orchids

abroad, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



course, is another matter. The Government does not

sell orchids. It is the private sector which does

that, and it is the private sector that has its

contacts abroad. We have done nothing in this

respect and, if we do, perhaps objections will be

raised on the ground that we are helping private

persons to make money. We can do a little by way

of the Tourist Promotion Board advertising

Singapore abroad - "Singapore is the land for

orchids." The Land Office has favourably

considered applications for temporary occupation

licences from orchid growers and I can assure the

Member that in this respect there have been no

delays by the Land Office as alleged by some other

Members. We are definitely behind the campaign to

grow more orchids and sell them abroad. We will

make available whatever land we have for the

propagation of orchids.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at least I

have a supporter in this House in my appeal to the

Government to explore markets for our orchids. In

fact, I stressed this in my debate on the Budget

statement on 14th December, 1967. Orchid growing

at the present moment is confined to a few private

growers who from time to time make use of the

Botanic Gardens. That is why I suggested to the

Ministry of Social Affairs yesterday that the re

search work, the breeding and growing of orchids,

should be transferred to the Primary Production

Department. If I remember correctly, the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social

Affairs said yesterday that if the research work

was transferred to the Primary Production

Department, there would be a duplication of work.

In this case, I am inclined to agree with him

because there is already a token vote provided in

the Development Estimates under Primary

Production. Here again in the Main Estimates we

find some provision put down also for research

work. All I want to know from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



Minister is whether he will agree that this is

really a duplication of work and, if so, will he

consider which department is the proper department

to do this kind of work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to stress is this. Orchid

growing should be widely cornmercialised so that

our farmers can benefit. Our national wealth

should be widely distribu'ted instead of its being

confined to a few nursery growers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> From the estimates before me, though

subhead 205 comes under Primary Production, no

vote appears throughout the years. But as the

Member for Mountbatten has pointed out, the

Botanic Gardens does research in orchids and the

botanists there are really interested in improving

our species of orchids and crossing orchids. The

Primary Production Department also has a nursery,

but I can assure the Member that there is no du

plication of work. In fact, the Botanic Gardens

will be transferred from the Ministry of Social

Affairs to the Ministry of National Development

very soon. This would mean that orchid research by

the Botanic Gardens could be tied up with orchid

research by the Primary Production Department.

me detailed information on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to come to the

In fact, clearance action is in progress. The

affected property has been acquired by Government.

The owner of the factory will be offered

alternative land not to exceed one-quarter acre in

a resettlement area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second project is for the widening and

extension of Jalan Kolam Ayer. About 83 squatter

families have been affected. Of these, 60

families, including a family occupying a shop,

have been accommodated in Housing and Development

Board flats. About 18 families have found their

own accommodation. One shopkeeper has done the

same. They have also been paid cornpensation.

There are five other squatter cases. The total

amount of compensation so far paid is in the

region of

$55,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third scheme is widening of Upper Serangoon

Road to Paya Lebar Road. Twenty-two huts have been

affected and 65 squatter families disturbed. Of

these, 14 have taken up Housing and Development

Board accommodation. Twenty-four families have

found their own alternative accommodation. Twenty

families were only partly affected and therefore

were not required to vacate the site. Seven

families still remain on the site but we hope to

clear them soon. They will be offered alternative

accommodation in Housing Board flats and they will

be paid compensation of about $5,000. In all, in

this third case, compensation amounting to about

$15,000 has been paid. So there really is no

problem and the Member for Aijunied will not have

so much trouble for the next elections.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am conscious of the fact that overhead

bridges can be white elephants as far as

pedestrians in Singapore are concerned. I have

observed that many pedestrians do not make use of

the bridge at Collyer Quay. Instead they cross the

road by cutting through the traffic. I have also

observed that construction work is being carried

out on the road divider at Collyer Quay which

appears to be designed for the purpose of inducing

pedestrians to use the overhead bridges. This is

very timely and useful. But the erection of

physical obstacles to compel pedestrians to use

overhead bridges where available for crossing

roads is rather an expensive way of popularising

overhead bridges and underpasses. A more suitable

remedy, I think, is to obtain legal sanction

against pedestrians crossing the roads at their

whim and fancy instead of using overhead bridges

where these are available. The remedy is to legis

late against jay-waiking by pedestrians as it has

been done in many other countries. I am no

motorist myself but I think it is only fair that

pedestrians should be made to observe, as the

other road users, the same set of rules that are

designed to protect life and limb and to promote

the smooth flow of traffic. In the absence of any

legislation, it appears to be a waste of time to

erect more overhead bridges. It is an expenditure

of money which pedestrians do not appreciate and

which do not materially benefit the other road

users. The provision of overhead bridges merely

strives to remedy the symptoms without removing

the cause of the problem of the kamikaze attitude

of Singapore residents. I should think that the

money set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



aside for overhead bridges and under-passes will

be more fruitfully devoted to the education of

road users, including pedestrians, and to bring

home to them the point that by failing to observe

traffic rules, they are not only risking their

lives and the lives of other road users, but they

are also guilty of social indiscipline.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the answer to the questions

posed by the Member for Telok Blangah is to

educate the public. We must educate them not only

not to dirty our beaches; we must even educate

them on how to cross roads. If we do not build

pedestrian bridges in Singapore, we will be

criticised because anyone trying to cross

Finlayson Green/Collyer Quay at rush hours without

the use of a pedestrian bridge will be attempting

to commit suicide. But we build the bridges in the

interest of pedestrians to enable them to cross

roads safely. And these bridges should help to

reduce traffic accidents and provide for a

smoother and faster flow of vehicular traffic. If

the pedestrians do not want to use them and are

prepared to risk their lives and limbs, perhaps

sometimes through sheer laziness, then I do not

see how a set of rules could serve to force these

people to do so. However, my Ministry has not been

idle. We are not prepared to watch these people

just risk their lives trying to cross roads. So we

have built safety fences along the centre divider

and on the edge of the footpaths to deter these

people from crossing the road and to encourage

them to use the overhead bridges. But if some high

jumper decides to take a jump over that fence, I

say let him do it. The position is continually

under review and it is hoped that, in conjunction

with the assistance of the traffic police, more

effective measures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



will be taken to ensure that all pedestrians will

eventually use the available overhead crossings.

But, as I have pointed out earlier, this is a

matter of education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I would like to dwell on

this topic - pedestrian overhead bridges and

underpasses. I fully agree with what the Minister

has said. But I have another point here and that

is two pedestrian crossings were obliterated at

Upper Serangoon Road 6¼ m.s. An overhead bridge was

constructed near one of them. But over on the

other side, away from Tampines Circus where

traffic lights have just been installed, the

pedestrian crossing has been obliterated by the

Public Works Department. I did point out to the

traffic police and the P.W.D, that they should

have studied the case first before removing such a

crossing, since this has caused a lot of

inconvenience to the public in that the pedestrian

crossing happened to be used mostly by the

residents in Punggol and those living around that

area. Although that pedestrian crossing has been

removed, people are still treating it as if there

is still a pedestrian crossing there and crossing

the road at random, and on many occasions I had to

slow down my car in order to enable the

pedestrians to cross. On this note, will the

Minister kindly look into this matter regarding

the obliteration of the pedestrian crossing at

Upper Serangoon Road 6¼ m.s.?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, do you have any remarks

on this subhead?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am well aware of the position

at 6¼ m.s. Upper Serangoon Road. Previously there

was no overhead pedestrian bridge. There was a

zebra crossing and people using the crossing

interfered with the traffic. In compliance with

popular demand headed by the Member for Upper

Serangoon, we built a pedestrian bridge and we

took away one of the pedestrian crossings.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if people do not choose to use the overhead

bridge but prefer to cross



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



the road where the pedestrian crossing was and no

longer is, what can my Ministry do? I say again

that it is a matter of education. We can block the

centre. We can prevent people crossing the road by

building this safety device about four or five

feet right along the central divider. But even

that will not prevent them. They are in a hurry to

get across to do whatever they want to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But basically, Sir, I say once again that we

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister whether it cannot be made law that a

pedestrian must use the overhead bridges otherwise

he will be committing a traffic offence. I per

sonally think it is a waste of funds to build more

overhead bridges if people do not use them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This law can be passed.

but it will probably be a very unpopular law. I

feel it is better to encourage people to use the

bridges perhaps by placing traffic policemen at

strategic spots and getting the policemen to ask

them to use the bridges. At this stage when

pedestrian bridges are somewhat new to the island.

I myself would not favour laws forcing people to

use these bridges. I would much rather persuade

them to use them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to

subhead 101 - Special Study on Traffic Planning

and Mass Transit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



System. Can the Minister say who are the people

undergoing this study and why is there such a big

increase of expenditure for 1968?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 102 refers to "Implementation of

Traffic Management Measures". In 1967, $316,000

has been spent. May I know what has been

implemented so far?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

the implementation of any mass transit or

transportation system, a careful and detailed

study is essential. The P.W.D, is now carrying out

the study with the assistance of the United

Nations Development Programme Special Fund. A

special unit was formed in September this year and

its aim is to formulate long-term comprehensive

guiding concepts for the development of the

Republic in the fields of transportation, urban

renewal and redevelopment and even in industrial

development. But a comprehensive transportation

study forms an important component of all these

projects and is aimed at producing a long-range

plan for the most efficient transportation system

possible within the limitations of our financial

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the scheme comprises a series

of traffic surveys to collect data on the nature

and pattern of the distribution of people and

goods on the island of Singapore. This data, when

collected, will provide the basis for traffic

forecasting which is necessary for the preparation

of road network and mass transportation plans. In

October and November this year, pilot surveys were

carried out. A pilot survey was carried out also

on taxi-passengers and the main surveys are

scheduled to be launched within the next few

months and are expected to be completed by August

1968. Following this, the data collected will be

processed and work on planning of the

transportation system will then follow. The whole

project is expected to be completed within three

or four years, but the surveys and experts cost

money. Hence the provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flooding in Singapore is not uncommon even

in the dry season. All we need is a heavy downfall

coinciding with the high tide, and low-lying areas

in Singapore are flooded. Flood alleviation

schemes have been carried out in the areas

affected, but looking at the Estimates for next

year, I feel that priorities have not been

carefully considered. My colleagues whose consti

tuencies are also affected by flooding may not

agree with me. Nevertheless, I wish to bring this

matter up not on the ground of inconvenience

caused to the people by flooding, but on the

grounds of the suffering that people undergo when

the areas in which they live are flooded. For

instance, Bukit Timah Road has been flooded ever

since I can remember. Sir, how much misery has it

caused to the people other than its being a

temporary inconvenience? Although Bukit Timah Road

is a trunk road to the city, all you have to do is

to by.pass it if it is flooded or wait until the

flood subsides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flooding in other areas cannot be treated

as lightly as that which occurs in Bukit Timah.

Flooding in areas such as Lorong Kinchir or Lorong

Chuan, which is in the Serangoon Gardens

Constituency, and even those bordering Braddell

Road, is not only an inconvenience to the people

in the area, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



it also destroys all the vegetables which they

have toiled from morning to night to cultivate,

and their chickens and pigs which cannot swim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of the people of Singapore who

live in urban areas do not probably realise how

much toil and sweat is put into the growing of

vegetables or the rearing of pigs. I can assure

them that it is no picnic and that if they tried

it they would not even get to first base, because

from experience I know what it is like. The

farmers in Singapore are a tough breed, but I do

not think the Government should take it for

granted that just because they are tough they can

withstand misfortunes forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore appeal to the Minister to review the

expenditure under this head and to give more

priority to areas more deserving than those which

have more sums allocated to them in the Estimates

for just concrete lining. To mention a few, for

such subheads as 102, 107, and 108.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Gonzales, if you want

the Minister to reply, you will have to finish

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> Yes, Sir. All I say is that if

there is a fairer allocation of priorities, the

people will be very much happier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, subhead 109 refers

to the extension of Sungei Kallang. This scheme is

one of the schemes under the Development

Estimates. During the First Five-Year Development

Plan prior to 1966, Sungei Kallang between Braddell Road and Upper Serangoon was realigned,

straightened, widened and deepened. As a result,

flooding at Potong Pasir has been greatly reduced.

In 1966, the improvement in realignment of Sungei

Kallang was extended beyond Braddell Road by 2,500

feet towards Peirce Reservoir to alleviate

flooding of the low-lying Lorong Chuan area. This

year the improvement was extended further from

2,000 feet upstream of Braddell Road to 5,900

feet. In 1968, it will be extended by another

3,000 feet. So we are not neglecting Upper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



Serangoon, as it were. The flooding in Bukit Timah

has been neglected for the last ten years. In my

view, it should have been done in 1955 or 1957, because the floods along the main trunk road between

Singapore and Johore Bahru lead to utter chaos on

the island. During the last floods, school

children had to be rescued and it was fortunate

for us that, when these areas were flooded a few

days ago, the schools were having their holidays.

But the effect of floods along Bukit Timah Road is

to cause traffic diversion to Holland Road ---

reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that this subhead refers to

sewerage in Serangoon. As Punggol is next to

Serangoon, I wonder whether the sewerage system

can be extended to that part of Punggol which is

quite well developed. As for the rest of Punggol,

the Minister will probably turn round and say that

it is a rural area with a low population density.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am well aware

that Punggol adjoins Serangoon and Upper

Serangoon. But I regret to inform the Member for

Punggol that there is as yet no concrete plan for

sewage facilities in his constituency, which is

essentially a rural area with a low population

density! Priority on the basis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



of economic feasibility has to be taken into

consideration for phasing out the overall sewage

schemes. In view of this, no site for a sewage

pumping station or sewage treatment work has been

selected for this area. But in the long term, I am

sure sewage facilities will reach Punggol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the onerous duties you have to

perform, I do not know how much time you have to

watch TV. You may, however, have seen flashes

which appear from time to time on TV advising

motorists not to have "One for the road", and

generally to drive more carefully. All the posters

put up and all the appeals made on TV are for the

sole purpose of saving life and to reduce the

number of accidents on the road. On

the one hand, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Gonzales,

is it possible that there is a clerical error

<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> Sorry, Sir. Subhead 208.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought you were making a speech

against drunken driving!



<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> No, Sir. On the one hand, you have

TV appeals to motorists to drive more carefully,

and, on the other hand, there is .this question of

certain Government departments, especially the

P.W.D., which carry out road repairs, resurfacing

of roads and so forth, all over the island.

Generally, Sir, if you go round Singapore, you

will find that roads are being dug up, materials

for resurfacing of roads are piled up on the

roads, and all without the usual customary red

lights and caution notices that road repairs are

being carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is actually criminal, as far as the

P.W.D. is concerned. And not only the P.W.D., but

possibly the P.U.B. and the Telephone Board whose

men go out and dig up the roads, and in their

anxiety to get home by 5 o'clock, leave the holes

uncovered. If you go to the insurance companies, I

think you will be surprised to find that many

people have been seriously injured, especially

motor cyclists riding at night, by riding over

bumps, breaking their arms and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Minister, where

the question of Stores and Equipment comes in, to

provide more lights and caution signs, and insist

that Government departments, especially the

P.W.D., carry out road repairs, and to use these

signs ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 67 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 208."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Barker, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Member has

pointed out that it is not only the P.W.D. but

also the P.U.B. and the Singapore Telephone Board

that use our roads. But I understand why he feels

very strongly about this is because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



his motor-car was badly damaged as a result of

its running into earthen stones that had been

heaped up, according to him, right in the middle

of the road. He has my sympathies and I would

advise him to see an advocate and solicitor and

sue the Government for damages!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, strictly speaking, instructions have been

issued to the P.W.D. that whenever road repairs,

sewage, and other works are undertaken, suitable

warning signs to be lighted at night should be

set up to warn motorists and pedestrians. But

should the Member for Serangoon Gardens come

across other obstacles or danger spots without

any warning signs, I shall be grateful if he will

inform the Director of the P.W.D., so that

precautionary measures can be taken and other

road users will not follow in his footsteps and

be without their motor-cars for about two weeks.

<br><br>7.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Head, I would like to ask

several questions. We all know that every year

the Urban and Rural Services Committee is

allotted large sums



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



of money to be distributed to various

constituencies. But in some constituencies the

money is not fully used or even used, and in

certain rural areas the sums allotted are not

sufficient for their use. So will the Urban and

Rural Services Committee consider re-allotting

those sums of money which are not made use of to

other constituencies which are urgently in need

of more money? In some areas, not a single cent

was spent out of the vote given to them, while in

my constituency Paya Lebar, two years have

already elapsed without the necessary funds being

approved for the construction of a drain. $60,000

is required for the building of the drain, and

yet only $2,000 is allotted each year. Sir, I

would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Minister for National Development whether he

will consider transferring the unspent sums to

needy areas for such development projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another question I would like to

ask the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the

neighbourhood of Housing Board estates in certain

constituencies. It usually happens that when a

new housing estate is being built, the roads are

made up and street lamps are provided. I wonder

whether in such cases the balance of the vote for

these constituencies can be transferred to the

rural constituencies to be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I would like to ask is about

the principle and basis of allotment. 95 per cent

of the Paya Lebar area is rural and the rest is

suburban. We are getting less funds now for the

improvement of this area. What I mean to say is

this. There are some constituencies where one-quarter or one-eighth of the area is rural or

urban. I would like to ask the Parliamentary

Secretary whether he can adjust his allotment so

that the overall development of the

constituencies is fair.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, it is a pity

that the time allotted for this Head is limited.

Services for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



urban and rural areas are very important,

particularly for the constituency of Kampong

Kembangan. I have often placed the question of

conditions in Kampong Kembangan before the House.

I am sure the House is tired of listening to my

complaints, but the voters in my constituency

continue to make complaints and representations to

me asking me to forward them to the Government. I

am their elected representative, and it is my duty

to forward their representations to the Government

in this House, even if it is tired of listening to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials of the U.R.S.C. from the Katong

District have visited my area, and have

investigated its conditions. Pictures taken of the

visit were shown over TV. I myself have put

forward representations to the Minister, but his

reply is that the money is in the hands of the

Minister for Finance who, when he spoke on the

11th instant, in his capacity as Member for Kreta

Ayer, said that not a single cent had been spent

on development in Kreta Ayer. May I ask, if he has

ever strolled in Kampong Kembangan, and whether he

is aware of the conditions of the drains there? On

the other hand, I have been to Kreta Ayer. The

Minister for National Development once passed

through one of the areas in Kampong Kembangan and

he was in sympathy with me. He has only visited

one particular place, and he is not, therefore,

aware of the conditions of other areas in the

constituency.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the Minister for Finance and the

Minister for National Development may know the

true conditions in Kampong Kembangan, I wish to

table some photographs showing the conditions

there. I ask you, Sir, to hand over these

photographs to the Ministers so that they will

know the bad conditions of the drainage in Kampong

Kernbangan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photographs handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



Paya Lebar has just now touched on the allotment

of funds by the U.R.S.C. in respect of the various

constituencies. On this matter of allocation, I

would like to air my views. I remember this matter

was brought up in last year's debate on the

Development Estimates in this House. At that time

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National Development said that the allocation of

funds was based on the population density as well

as the area of the constituency concerned. The

allocation is based on the principle that the

money of the ratepayers is allotted to the con

stituencies in a fair and just way. But what

result do we get under this princi, pie of

allocation? The Member for Paya Lebar has just

mentioned it. In some constituencies the funds

allocated have not been made use of because they

have already been developed to an advanced stage.

They have all the modern facilities and amenities,

and they do not have to use these funds. For

instance, Delta Constituency, Havelock

Constituency, Moulmein Constituency and Rochore

Constituency have not made use of a single cent of

the sums allocated to them. On the other hand,

some rural constituencies, which are in need of

funds, do not receive enough funds. For instance,

Changi, Choa Chu Kang and Paya Lebar Constituencies are badly in need of more funds to

spend on development.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, these rural areas do not

have modern facilities. We know that if you want

to construct metalled roads in these areas or

connect pipe-lines, the sum required would be in

the region of thousands of dollars. But according

to the principle of allocation, each constituency

can only get a few thousand dollars. The situation

is such that when a constituency requires a pipe-line to be laid, there will not be enough funds to

carry out other projects. Can the Parliamentary

Secretary tell us whether the principle of

allocation can be changed or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



adjusted? That is, do not base the allocation on

the density of population, the size of the

constituency or the locality, lt should be based

on the stage of development of each constituency.

For instance, if a constituency does not require

any funds for development, then this sum of money

should be allotted to other less developed areas

in order that they may have enough funds for

development. For instance, the rural areas should

get more funds so that in future they can make

better use of the sums allocated to them for

development purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

sentiments of the Member for Paya Lebar and the

Member for Jurong. My own constituency is not

actually a rural area. But I would like to say a

few words on behalf of the rural constituencies.

Rural constituencies are normally very large in

area. Therefore, there are more projects to be

carried out there. They therefore require more

money to carry out these projects. I have a

suggestion to make. Can the Parliamentary Secre

tary consider whether in next year's estimates it

is possible to transfer part of the vote belonging

to the urban area to the rural areas? In this way

the rural areas will have more funds to carry on

with their development projects and thus provide

more amenities to the people there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as an M.P.

from the rural area I have to dwell on the urban

and rural services. I notice that in 1966 and 1967

there was an estimated expenditure of some $2.78

million, but for next year it is only $2.2

million. That is a big slice of about half a

million dollars less for the provision of such

services. I would say that instead of provision

for urban and rural services, it should be

provision for rural services. I take in particular

item 001, for which $700,000 is provided. There is

a big cut of more than $600,000. I fully subscribe

to what my colleagues from the rural areas have

stated; that is, give a little bit to the urban

areas, just a token provision, as what has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



listed in many items in the Development Estimates.

If there is a project which warrants a particular

sum of expenditure, then the Urban and Rural

Services Committee would decide whether that money

should be spent. The funds to be proportionately

allocated to the constituencies should take into

consideration the fact that the rural

constituencies need these funds most. The rural

folks lack a lot of social amenities. For example,

you can see under item 011, extension of water

supply, that the vote has been increased to

$600,000. Many motions on the adjournment have

been made in this House pertaining to the needs of

the rural folks in these constituencies. I am

happy to note that the provisions have been

increased for certain items. However, in the case

of agricultural and kampong roads, there is a big

cut. I hope with this $2.256 million the Parlia

mentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development will take into consideration the fact

that when the U.R.S.C. meet and decide what to do

with the requests from the various constituencies,

it will not be necessary just to say, "All right,

we have expended the provision under the

particular item; therefore, nothing can be done

further."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on that note I hope the rural constituencies

will benefit more as a result of the many requests

made by my colleagues, the Members of Parliament

representing the rural areas, and also as a result

of the motions on the adjourn, ment put before the

House sometime this year.

grievances here, I can sum up by saying that they

are merely asking for more sums of money to be

allocated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



to the rural constituencies for development

projects. They want the Urban and Rural Services

Committee to allot more

funds to them. I sympathise with the situation of

these Members of Parliament. But sometimes when I consider this matter 1

could not sympathise with

them. Thc reasons are that at the beginning of

September this year, when

there was still a substantial amount of funds in

the Urban and Rural Services

Committee, my Minister wrote a letter to Members

of Parliament of the rural

constituencies, requesting that if there were any

projects in the rural areas

which needed to be completed within this year,

then they should, within one

month, put their suggestions to the Urban and

Rural Services Committee. This was a good opportunity for them and yet they

missed ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho is not prepared to give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

But they missed this opportunity. We gave it to

them because we wanted to

accommodate them and in order to reduce some of

their troubles. We also

approached the Ministry of Finance on this matter.

Yet these Members of Parliament did not make use of this opportunity given

to them. Now they want

to ask for more funds. When we offered them this

sum of money which they

needed, they did not want to take it, and now they

turn round and ask for

more funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an incident. This year

Sembawang could make use of $75,000

and yet only five projects were suggested. It made

use of only $55,000, thereby

saving $20,000. In the case of Paya Lebar, we gave

them more funds than

they needed to complete their projects. Paya Lebar

completed only $35,000

worth of projects. They were allotted $56,000 and

yet they spent only $35,000

on their projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members have claimed more money under these

circumstances. If

they could only redouble their efforts and be

more efficient in carrying out the

various projects, I think they would go a long

way towards getting more funds. Let me quote an example in Choa Chu  Kang

Constituency. This year ---



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b> rose ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b> remained standing.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Lim, Mr

Ho is not prepared to give way. You have not

spoken. He is not replying to

you. So there is less reason why he should give

way to you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

For instance, 30 miles of agricultural road have

been built this year in the

Choa Chu Kang Constituency under the planning of

the Member concerned and

the Citizens' Consultative Committee. If this work

had been undertaken by the

Government, it would not have been completed

within one year. The expenditure for making up this 30 miles of road was very

small. If other Members of

Parliament can follovv this example, I believe it

vvill go a long way towards

reducing their own difficulties. And Members can

also make use of this

opportunity to have more contact with their

electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Punggol and Thomson have also

raised the question of

transferring part of the vote allocated

to the urban areas to the rural areas. I feel it

is rather early for them to raise

this matter but I think this suggestion merits

some consideration. Perhaps when

the Economic Planning Unit of the Ministry of

Finance considers the allocation of funds to the 58 constituencies, I will

ask them to consider this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, may I deal with one

particular point which the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National Development has pointed

out? It is in regard to a circular his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



Minister sent out to all rural M.P.s asking them

to come forward with their

recommendations to utilise the surplus funds that

vvere not expended. Sir, in one

breath he stated that all the rural M.P.s did not

do their job. Therefore, in refuting this I produce the Urban and Rural Services

Committee's list showing

the aniount of money approved by the U.R.S.C. and

Projects Committee for

urban and rural services for the year 1967. Let me

trouble the House with a

little bit of detail. Changi, for example, is a

rural constituency. The revised

allocation of funds stood at $87,969; the amount

expended was $98,180.

In other words, a debit amount of  $10,211.

Therefore, the  M.P.

has done his job. Similarly, Choa Chu Kang, which

is a rural area, was allocated $77,500, and it expended $89,900; over-expenditure $12,000. Now let us

come to Kampong Kembangan. Amount allocated was

$44,100; amount expended

was $68,420; amount over-expended was  $24,350.25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Punggol?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I have to point out that

the rural M.P.s did their job

as a result of that circular. Pasir Panjang over-expended more than $3,000.  Paya Lebar was allocated $35,000; it  spent

$56,000; overspent by $20,000. Punggol was allocated $78,247; it spent  $88,383;

overspent by $10,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Well done!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> If others do not make use of

the funds, we, the M.P.s

in the rural areas, must ask that these  funds be

expended. Serangoon Gardens,

for example, was given only $21,521. Amount

expended - I think it is a

shocking amount - was $143,931.50. In other

words, Serangoon Gardens has

overspent -

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, for my in formation and

the information of other Members, what is the document you are referring

to?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I have just mentioned it.

I can table this in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



House. It is a list showing the amounts of money

approved by the U.R.S.C. and

Projects Committee for urban and rural services

for the year 1967. I was just

going to establish the fact that the M.P.s in the

rural areas are not sleeping.

They are working and in some cases have already

asked for more funds than

necessary. I think it is not fair of the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for National Development in one breath to make it

appear that all M.P.s in

the rural areas are sleeping and not working.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Without my entering into the

debate, this is a double-edged

argument. It merely means that in some areas more

money has been spent than

should have been spent, and to use the Minister

for Finance's words, "What is

the Member for Kampong Kembangan complaining

about?" Very shortly, Mr

Ho Kah Leong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now

the Parliamentary Secretary has said that the vote for this year has not

been used up in some rural

constituencies. He blames the Members concerned

for not having done their

duty. I think there are some inaccuracies in his

speech, and, therefore, I

would like to say a few words. I remember in an

adjournment speech in this House sometime this year, the Member for Choa Chu

Kang complained about

going through complicated procedures before

projects could be implemented. Approaches have to be made to various

departments. Every application for a

project takes more than six months to  be

processed before it can be implemented. Because of this complicated procedure,

the projects were not tabled

in time before the U.R.S.C. So it is not fair for

the Parliamentary Secretary to

say that Members are lazy just because funds are

not being fully made use of.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I will specially touch on under expenditure

of votes allocated. I would

like to ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not want to be unfair to you,

Mr Lim, but can you make your point very shortly,

because a number of important points have been

made and I must call on Mr Ho to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> I shall be very brief, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In fact, many projects had been

proposed by Members of Parliament concerned, but

were not approved by the U.R.S.C. Therefore, the

funds were not being fully made use

of.  Secondly, either the Chairman of the U.R.S.C.

or the Chairman of the Projects Committee was

sleeping. Members of Parliament are not sleeping

because several projects proposed to the U.R.S.C.

years ago are still pending and Members are still

being asked whether they support the projects. It

is the Chairmen of these committees who are

actually sleeping.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I did not mean to say that Members of

Parliament of the rural constituencies are lazy.

It is because they asked for more funds for their

constituencies that I suggested to them to

redouble their efforts and organise more work

teams to implement all the projects and expend the

votes allocated; and perhaps get more funds for

their constituencies. Comparing of votes expended

is not much of a criterion. The most important

thing is for the projects to be approved so that

funds will be provided. The Member for Bukit Merah

has never mentioned to me what he has just said.

My impression is that certain requests by Bukit

Merah related to areas which the Housing and

Development Board wanted to develop. Certain areas

are affected by proposed development and,

therefore, the requests have to be thoroughly

investigated before Government allocates funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, can you please conclude

your remarks very soon?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

If an area is to be developed in two or three

years' time, and if we are asked to provide this

area with roads and street lamps and so on, it is

a waste of funds. Therefore, the committees concerned cannot waste public funds on this request.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. Mr Tay Boon Too, I

take it that you are withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I am not satisfied with the answer given by

the Parliamentary Secretary. But because of time ---



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have reached guillotine

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,256,000 for Head 68 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure

in respect of which no amendment stands on the

Order Paper Supplement are heads 01, 03, 04, 05,

06, 23, 30, 33, 41, 50, 51, 57 and 90. I propose

to take all these heads of expenditure en bloc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those heads

of expenditure which appear in the last column of

the Summary of Estimated Expenditure on pages 5

and 6 of Paper Cmd. 27 of 1967 stand part of the

Development Estimates," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sum of $296,772,162 shall be

supplied to the Government under the heads of

expenditure for the public services shown in the

Development Estimates for the year 1968 contained

in Paper Cmd. 27 of

1967," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There upon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the

Committee of Supply has come to a certain

resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution reported -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $296,772,162 shall

be supplied to the Government under the heads of

expenditure for the public services shown in the

Development Estimates for the year 1968 contained

in Paper Cmd. 27 of 1967.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That

Parliament doth agree with the Committee on the

said resolution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution accordingly agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I call the Minister to move

the adjournment, may I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



just say that, like the Minister for Finance with

money, I have limited time at my disposal and I

thank hon. Members for the indulgent way in which

they have accepted my sometimes very harsh rulings

on the question of time. And may I also take this

opportunity to thank the Parliamentary staff for

having, as occasion required, worked without a

suspension.
