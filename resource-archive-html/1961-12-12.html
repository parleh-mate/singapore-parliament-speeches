&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Member has, under the provisions of

subsection (2) (g) of section 42 of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, obtained from

the Speaker, permission to be or to remain absent from

<div align="center"><b>(Assent to Bill passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to report that I have been

informed by His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

that on the 11th day of December, 1961, he assented to

the Final Appropriation (1959) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of

Supply [4th Allotted day].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (11th December,

1961),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by  $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1."-(Mr Tee Kim Leng).



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center">MAIN ESTIMATES, 1962 (Cont.)</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understood there is going to be a debate on the

People's Association in respect of this item.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, if a civil servant makes a declaration

which is of a political character, then he is not

acting properly as a civil servant. The Director of

Social Welfare has done this. We know the Department

of Social Welfare is a department which has to

shoulder many responsibilities, including assistance

to needy people. Therefore, if the Director of Social

Welfare makes statements of a political nature, they

tend to confuse the people and cause misunderstanding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

explained  last  evening that the Director  of  Social

Welfare was appointed Secretary and Treasurer  of  the

People's  Association  under the People's  Association

Ordinance.  Since community centres  are  one  of  the

social   services  provided  by  the  Social   Welfare

Department,  therefore the Director of Social  Welfare

was appointed to serve the People's Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that he is being asked

to issue public statements of a political nature, as I

explained  last evening, he is purely an employee  and

he carries out the instructions of the Board. Whatever

statement  that is issued through him is  the  opinion

and policy of the Board.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang can  hardly

expect  to  get  away  with the statement  that  civil

servants are being used as political instruments of  a

political  Party.  All the published  statements  that

this  officer has made related to acts of  hooliganism

and  violence  indulged in by the former employees  of

the  People's Association. I see nothing political  in

them.  He  was  just  stating  that  they  went  round

centres,  breaking  windows and inciting  children  to

damage  property. Where is the political line? If  the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang says that  the  officer  is

engaged  in  a  political light  against  the  Barisan

Sosialis and  this  assumption is  implicit  in  his

statement it  just  proves what we have  been  saying,

that  the  Barisan Sosialis are supporting the  former

employees of the People's Association.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to put it to a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Seow Peck Leng, amendment (1) on

the Order Paper Supplement.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to seek your guidance on this. Could I  take

amendments (1) to (21)* as a whole first, as there  are three questions I would like to ask, which I shall have to  repeat  20  times if I do not take  them  together?

After I have done that, I will pick out a few and speak

on them. Can I do that?



<hr size="2" noshade>

*Amendments (1) to (21) read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced by $10 in respect of items (23) to (43) of

subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, certainly. First, move the first

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Thank you. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (23) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the three questions that I said I intended to

ask  on  the posts shown in items (23) to (43)  are - how

many of these posts, except the new post that is to  be

filled  in  1962, are vacant; how long have  they  been

vacant; and why have they been kept vacant?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the hon. Member should pose

all her three questions.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. The three

questions  are - how many of them are  vacant;  how  long

have  they  been vacant; and the reason why  they  have

been kept vacant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only this

morning  obtained  a  list  of  the  personnel  in  the

Department  of Social Welfare and this was complied  as

at 1st January, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this list, we have only one vacant post

of  Aftercare  Officer,  two posts  of  Assistant  Lady

Superintendent,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



one  post  of Assistant Warden, two posts of Cook,  two

posts  of  Welfare Attendant. The two vacant  posts  of

Cook  are  in  Grade II. These are all the vacancies  I

find on this list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when they have been vacant, as I said, this

list was complied as at 1st January, 1961, and I do not

know  the dates when these posts were vacant, but I  am

sure the Director of Social Welfare

must have taken action to fill these posts.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just saw the

day before yesterday in the programme of the exhibition

next   door   that   the   two   posts   of   Assistant

Superintendent  have been filled, but  I  do  not  know

about the others. Why I ask whether there are vacancies

is that I know there has been a clamour for more staff;

the  homes  are  inefficiently run not because  of  the

inefficiency of the staff, but because of the  lack  of

staff. Since we have the vote, I do not quite know  why

those posts have been kept vacant. What I would like to

know  is  whether  it  is difficult  to  get  qualified

people.  Or  what is the reason for keeping such  posts

vacant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember

sometime  last  year I enquired from  the  Director  of

Social  Welfare whether he had taken steps to fill  all

the  vacant posts in the Social Welfare Department.  He

told   me  he  had  referred  this  question   to   the

Establishment. It seems the Establishment  Branch  held

up  the establishment because they anticipated a  batch

of  graduates  from the Social Science Faculty  of  the

University of Malaya. I do not know whether  the  posts

have been advertised by now.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that

that is an assurance that in 1962 the vacant posts will

be filled. Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on item (24), I wonder why one person is getting

$565 up to a maximum of $685.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member has finished

on   general  principles  covering  the  whole  of  the

Residential  Institutions,  perhaps  I  could  now   go

amendment  by  amendment.  Are  there  any  matters  of

general principle? No? I will put the Question  on  the

first  amendment if the Member for Mountbatten wants  a

vote  on  it.  The  first amendment  is  on  the  three

Superintendents.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that will not

be  my  first amendment. My first amendment will be  on

item (24). I have covered item (23).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the hon. Member want a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No. I beg to withdraw my

amendment in respect of item (23).*



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No dissentient voice? Amendment (1)* is

withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (2). Will the hon. Member moved formally if

she wants to comment on it?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (24) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, item (24) shows "2 Lady

Superintendents", one drawing $565-685  and  the  other

(Salary  Code  II-24) drawing $595-675.  So  while  the

latter  starts with a higher salary, she  ends  with  a

lower  salary.  And the former, while starting  with  a

lower  salary, ends with a higher salary, and  that  is

supposed to be a personal scale. I wonder whether there

is  any  special reason why a personal scale,  separate

from the timescale, is given to her.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The answer is quite simple, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Every now and then  salary  scales  are

revised  because  of abnormal rates in comparison  with

other scales. And quite often salary scales are reduced

or altered to the advantage of the present holder. When

such a thing happens, the present holder



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



can opt to remain on the more advantageous salary scale

while  new  recruits will he brought in at the  revised

salary scale.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In view of the explanation, may

I have your permission to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (25) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 2 Assistant

Superintendents against this item. In view of the  fact

that  more Assistant Superintendents are asked  for  in

the  Junior Approved School when it comes up, could the

Minister    tell   us   whether   the   two   Assistant

Superintendents  would  be sent  there  or  would  they

remain where they are now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter will

be  looked  into by the Director of Social Welfare.  No

doubt when the time comes he will make recommendations,

and  we  will see that there is justification  for  the

transfer  or  recruitment  of  additional  staff.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am not trying to be impertinent,  but

the Member for Mount-batten is a member of the Board of

Visitors  and  I  am  sure all these  things  could  be

clarified by the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is exactly why I am asking

this. I notice there is a grant for the building of the

Junior  Approved  School in the Development  Estimates.

But I do not see anywhere else a vote for its staff.  I

am  just  wondering whether these people will be  taken

out  to fill the posts there, or whether the Government

intends to put in Supplementary Estimates later  on.  I

see  no  Estimates at all for the staff of  the  school

that is coming up.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is typical of the hon.  Lady.  She

comes  to  see me in my office and tells me  there  are

dirty  drains  along  Haig Road. I send  the  Cleansing

Department  men  there to get them  cleansed.  And  she

comes into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



this  Assembly  and asks me to make a  report  to  the

Assembly on the dirty drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten is a

member of the Advisory Committee on institutions which

are run by the Social Welfare Board. When I was in the

Ministry, Mr Speaker, Sir, I chaired a meeting  every

month and all members of the Committee were present at

the meetings. It was their duty to break themselves up

into  sections,  one  section visiting  regularly  the

Boys'  Home, another the Girls' Home, and another  the

Mount  Emily Home, and one section visited  the  Homes

for the Aged Persons, at Woodstock and at Bushey Park.

All  the  information gathered, Mr Speaker, Sir,  was

regularly  discussed at our meetings. The hon.  Member

used  to  attend  these meetings very irregularly.  To

make a show of it, she comes to this Assembly and asks

me  questions  the answers to which  would  have  been

available  to  her  had  she  attended  the   meetings

regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Junior Approved School is concerned,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, she would know, if she had attended

the meetings, that we have brought a Mr Riley out,  a

U.N. consultant,  to advise us on the  site  for  the

school and the type of building required. One proposal

is to convert the Buona Vista Community Centre into an

approved school. As soon as we get a report from  him,

Mr Speaker, Sir, plans will have to be put in for the

building  of  the school, and we would  also  have  to

enter provisions for instructors posts for this Junior

Approved  School.  The  experience  required  for  the

running  of  the  Junior Approved School  is  entirely

different   from  that  required  of   the   Assistant

Superintendents who are running the Orphanage  at  the

Perak Home for boys, and the Assistant Superintendents

at the Gimson School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have now explained the position to the

satisfaction of the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

Minister's  information, the drains he  mentioned  are

still in the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



condition  as they were. I shall be bringing  up  this

matter again and again until the drains are cleaned. I

went   round  there  yesterday - I  will  not  go   into

details - and I saw what I saw last Wednesday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is typical of the Minister to avoid the issue. I

know  Mr  Riley has sent in a report asking  for  one

Supervisor,  one Assistant Supervisor,  and  3  House-masters.  I will not go into the details of this  list

of  officers.  I  see  there is  no  increase  in  the

staffing except in one or two cases. And that is why I

ask:  what is to happen to the recommendations by  the

expert   from  the  United  Nations,  Mr  Riley?   Is

Government  going  to supply all the  staff;  or  does

Government  think that he is asking too  much;  or  is

Government going to decide later what he is  going  to

have? I have seen the vote already. Knowing that it is

a  conversion of a building and not a new building,  I

except  it to be finished by next year. Had it been  a

new  building, I would not have asked but  would  have

taken  it for granted that the building would  not  be

ready  by  next  year.  But  knowing  that  it  is   a

conversion  of  the  Buona Vista Community  Centre,  I

expect  it to be ready. If it could not be ready,  all

that Government need say is, "It will not be ready and

so  we  will  not  need the staff."  It  is  a  simple

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a saying,

"Don't  count your chickens before they are  hatched."

When  the building comes up, all we have to do  is  to

put in an A.S.V. for the extra funds required.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no wonder the

Government  are  in  chaos. They do  not  plan  ahead.

Anyway, Mr Speaker, in view of the explanation given,

I beg to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

moving  my  amendments to items (26), (27), (28),  and

(29), but I shall be moving my amendment to item (30).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving amendments (4), (5), (6) and (7),

but will move amendment  (8), i.e., in respect of item (30)?



<hr size="2" noshade>

The amendments read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (26) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced by $10 in respect of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (29) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please move.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (30) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (30) says, "1 Child Care Officer". There is

in  existence a boarding-out scheme for babies, and it

has  long  been requested that Government  supplies  a

Child Care Officer. There is another request from  the

expert  from the United Nations, I believe it  is  for

the  boarding-out  scheme for Perak House.  He  thinks

that  is  overcrowded  and that a boarding-out  scheme

should  be started. And for that, he has also, in  his

report,  asked for one Child Care Officer. Now,  could

the  Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary  tell  us

whether  this  Child Care Officer is  to  be  for  the

babies   or  for  the  new  project  that   has   been

recommended?  I  just  want to know  whether  the  new

project  is  to  come up and whether this  Child  Care

Officer is for that project.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from our experience we

have  found  that it is much more beneficial  for  the

child if it is hoarded out with a family who agrees to

look  after the child. Also it is much cheaper if such

arrangements are made. Mr Speaker, Sir, we did have a

Child  Care Officer for babies sometime ago,  but  for

some  reason or other that appointment was  abolished.

Now, the intention is to introduce a new post of Child

Care  Officer so that this officer will be  in  charge

not  only of babies but of children up to the age  of,

say,  10 years, so that he will be able to look  after

and supervise proper and suitable boarding-out

young girls at the Girls' Homecraft Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I do not know whether I

interpret  this  correctly. Do I  take  it  that  the

Minister  means  that this officer  will  do  the  job

connected with the old project as well as the  project

that  is  existing, as well as starting a boarding-out

scheme  for  Perak  House? Of course,  it  is  only  a

recommendation and has not come into existence yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  the Minister means that one officer  will  be

sufficient. I would like to draw his attention to  it,

and  I  hope he will look into it and see whether  one

officer  is  sufficient - he is the  authority  on  the

subject.  With  that, I would like  to  withdraw,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this item shows "1 Lady Warden",

which is a new appointment. The note says, "For Girls'

Hostel".  As far as my knowledge goes, I  think  I  am

correct in saying that the Girls' Hostel has one  Lady

Warden now, who has been drawn from the Yorkhill Home,

what  they call the Girls' Homecraft Centre. I am just

wondering,   Sir,  when  this  new  Lady   Warden   is

appointed, will the Lady Warden from the Girls' Hostel

go back to Yorkhill and this new Lady Warden will take

over  her  job in the Girls' Hostel? Or will the  same

person be allowed to remain and the new appointee goes

to  Yorkhill?  I  feel very strongly  that  this  Lady

Warden who has been posted from Yorkhill to the Girls'

Hostel  is doing the job most efficiently, and  having

done it for a few months, I feel it is wiser that  she

be  kept there to continue her work so that there will

be  a continuation of work, and for obvious reasons it

is better to keep her there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We had provision from the previous

estimates for the building of a Girls' Hostel. We also

have  funds from C. D. & W, for that purpose. We  have

found'  the girls temporary accommodation  in  an  old

Government  building in Canning Rise. The Ministry  of

Finance  wants  this  building  for  the  housing   of

overseas  officers. We shall have to look for  an  old

building and convert it for this purpose, or use C. D.

&  W, funds to build a new Girls' Hostel, in any case,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as the Member for Mountbatten  has

rightly pointed out, to start off this hostel we  have

to  transfer somebody from the Girls' Homecraft Centre

to  this  hostel.  These jobs are filled  through  the

Public  Service  Commission.  They  will  have  to  be

advertised. There will be other people also  who  will

be  applying.  It  will be up to  the  Public  Service

Commission to make the selection. We cannot  give  any

assurance to the Member for Mountbatten that, because

she   considers  this  lady  who  is  acting  in  this

view of the Public Service Commission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (36) shows there will be one extra

instructor. There are already 23. May I ask, Sir, what

qualifications are required for this extra instructor?

I  am  a  bit doubtful because I see here the  sum  of

$90,130  as  against $84,000, which is an increase  of

$5,870.  If the instructor is to be appointed  on  the

same  salary scale as the existing instructors,  which

is  $220 a month to start with, there is an excess  of

$3,230, is this instructor a special instructor who is

going  to be paid on a higher scale, or is the  $3,230

just  the  normal  increments  for  the  existing   23

instructors? It might very well be. But I just want to

know  whether it is a special instructor who is  going

to  be appointed, at a special salary scale since  the

amount is so different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The salary codes are indicated here, Mr

Speaker, Sir - one for men instructors and one for women

instructors. There is nothing special. This instructor

will not be given any special salary. If it is a woman

instructor,  she will get a salary within  the  salary

code  of  III  41, and if it is a man instructor,  his

salary will be within the salary code of III 22.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It looks as though it will be a woman

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It will be so.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Then I take it, Sir, that the

beg to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (37) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (37) says "Projects Supervisor". I was just

comparing  item (36) with item (37), and thinking  that

they were having a special instructor for item (36),  I

was wondering a projects supervisor does not need a man

who  is  better qualified than an ordinary  instructor.

You  will  notice, Sir, he is on the same pay scale  as

the  instructors.  I feel that since  the  man  has  to

organise  projects, the Government might  need  a  more

efficient  or  better qualified man on a better  salary

scale  for the sake of the efficiency of the  job  that

this supervisor is going to undertake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, some of the boys remain in

the  hostels for a period of about six to nine  months.

The  system  of organisation there is quite unlike  the

system  of  organisation in the homes like  the  Gimson

School, where the boys are placed in the custody of the

home  for three years, and where courses of instruction

and training can be organised for the boys. In the case

of  the Bukit Batok Hostel and other hostels for  boys,

Mr  Speaker, the boys are there for short periods.  It

would  be  the  duty  of  this projects  instructor  to

organise  worthwhile projects for them,  projects  that

they  can begin and complete within the short time that

they  are  living  in these hostels.  It  is  for  this

purpose  that,  on the recommendation of  the  Advisory

Committee,  of which the Member for Mount-batten  is  a

member,  this  provision  has  been  entered   in   the

Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister

for that information. I realise this is what the Board

has recommended, but we have not stated the

qualifications of the instructor. I was just pointing

out to the Minister, in case it is an oversight, that

this is a more important job and whether it would not

need a better qualified man. But the matter is in his

hands. Because of my interest in social work and

because of my desire to see that the homes function as

efficiently as they can, I am bringing these points to

his notice from the experience that I have had in my

social work. In view of the explanation, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (38) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Assistant Housemistress". I notice that

the salary scale is III 77.

which  means  that  she draws a salary  of  $122  to  a

maximum  of $270. I was just wondering what her  duties

are  for $122. An ordinary domestic amah gets that.  If

her  duties are no more than an ordinary amah - but in  a

glorified    term,    she    is    called    "Assistant

Housemistress", I am quite satisfied. But in  case  she

is  really  to assist the Housemistress in  doing  some

sort  of organising work, I feel that that salary scale

will not get the type of person we want.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The scale is from $122 to $270, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, this really proves that the

Member for Mountbatten has not been doing her homework.

The   provision  for  this  post  was  entered  in  the

Estimates for the Woodstock Home. That is the home  for

old  ladies, Mr Speaker, Sir. As the Member for Mountbatten  knows, when we started this home we had a  male

officer  who was, seconded from one of the institutions

to  this  home  to  look  after  the  old  ladies.  The

subcommittee in charge of this home has repeatedly made

representations to the committee that it is not fair to

keep this man, a single male, amongst the old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>



ladies.  They  consider we should introduce  this  new

post so that a lady house-mistress can be employed  to

assist  him in caring for the old ladies. That is  the

position.  If  the Member for Mountbatten  had  really

done her homework, she would have known all about this

post.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

typical  of  the Minister. A straightforward  question

does  not  get a straightforward answer.  I  know  all

this. He is telling me nothing new. We did recommend a

female  to be there. But all I ask is, is this  female

going  to  share  the work of the male,  whatever  the

officer  in  charge there is called, or  is  she  just

going to do more or less the work of an amah? I feel a

salary  of  $122  is  not sufficient  if  we  want  an

Assistant  House-mistress of calibre  who  can  really

work  with  the housemaster, if he is known  there  as

such.  Anyway, in view of the difficulty the  Minister

has  in  answering that question, I will not  cause  a

delay, Sir. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member begs leave to

withdraw, she should not preface the request by a long

speech.  That might indicate she does want an  answer.

wishes  to  answer.  There  is  no  dissentient  voice

anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (41) is on welfare Attendants - two posts

for  the Homecraft Centre and one post for the  Girls'

Hostel,  I had better explain why I ask this  question

in  case the Minister accuses me of not having done my

homework again. Why I ask this question is that I know

the  post for the Girls' Hostel was not for a  Welfare

Attendant but an assistant warden. Do those two do the

same jobs, although they have different names?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears from the

estimates  for last year that there are 21 attendants.

We propose to increase the number to 24. These are the

servants  who  look after the girls at  the  Homecraft

Centre.  It was thought by the Committee that  it  was

not  fair to put older girls in charge of the  younger

girls  in  that home. It is necessary for these  older

girls  to  go  to school and to do their homework.  To

relieve  them  of  these  chores,  the  Committee  has

recommended  that we employ two more amahs.  They  are

posts of amahs - maidservants - in this home. Two more

posts for this home and one more for the Girls' Hostel

at Canning Rise.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In other words, Sir, the request

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my question here seems redundant

because  of the Parliamentary Secretary has  said  the

post  is  vacant.  From  investigations  made  and  by

reading  reports, I find that there is  a  controversy

over this post of Farm Overseer. In some reports, they

say  it has been filled, and in others they say it has

not  been filled. I have tried to ring up some  people

to  find out. Some say it has been filled, and  others

say  it  has not been filled. I wonder whether it  has

been  filled.  I think this post of Farm  Overseer  in

Gimson  School  is very important. So I  am  wondering

whether the Minister can just tell me yes or no. Is it

filled or not?

after  the  rehabilitation side. This post is  on  the

very  necessary that we have a woman officer in charge

of this work. In the past we used male officers and we

with  the  brothel-keepers. To be sure that  does  not

happen, it is proposed that we enlist the services  of

a woman officer for this work.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring to the notice of the

Minister  certain matters which I feel  are  important

and  he should take note and try to rectify them.  The

first  thing is about the frequent changes of officers

in  the  home.  In many of the homes,  especially  the

boys'  homes, the officers in charge have been  change

so  frequently that there is no continuity at all. The

officer,  when  put  in that position,  scarcely  gets

enough time to settle down to learn about the problems

and  difficulties of the home before  he  is  switched

oil'  and  taken to another department, while somebody

else  is  put  in his place. I remember the  Visitors'

Board  once complained and said that the previous  man

was good. He was put back, and all of us rejoiced. But

we rejoiced too soon. Before we knew where we were, he

was  taken  away  again. The children  too  will  lose

confidence if there are frequent changes. They do  not

have  enough  time  to  be friendly  enough  with  the

officer  in  charge  to have confidence  in  him.  The

children  too are very confused. For the sake  of  the

homes  and  the children, I appeal to the Minister  to

look  into  this matter and, if he will, see  that  in

future there will be as little changes as possible  in

these  homes.  The children in the homes  are  already

handicapped, or underprivileged, or they are  juvenile

delinquents, and they cannot be confused like that. It

is  going  to make them worse. So I hope the  Minister

will do something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there is a Parole Board for

well-behaved  boys in the homes. If they behave  well,

they  can he let out sooner than their term. But as  I

have pointed out in the last few days, Sir, whenever a

thing is for the benefit of the females, it just  does

not  happen.  There is no Parole Board for  the  well-behaved  girls.  So  I  hope  the  Minister  will   do

something  about  this. He should either  empower  the

present  Board to parole the girls as well, or appoint

a new Parole Board for the girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned the Junior Approved School. I

have  not  seen  the  posts,  but  the  Minister   has

explained. There is, however, another point, i.e.,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



creches. I notice the Government has promised this  in

The Tasks Ahead:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. Government will establish more creches

to look after children while mothers are at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will encourage factories employing large numbers

of women to provide creches or, factory sites.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no extra vote for creches. I very much doubt,

Sir,  that  there has been an increase of  creches  or

there is an intention to increase them. But I ask  the

Minister to tell me if there have been increases, both

in  factory  sites  and Government creches,  with  the

exception of the four from the City Council which they

have  taken over, and the two Government creches which

they are continuing with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I notice in the Budget some posts

in  the  Community  Recreation Section.  One  lot  was

actually put "abolished post", another lot - has no vote

for  1962.  I  am just wondering whether the  Minister

could tell us the reason for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the movement of

staff,   I   entirely  agree  with  the   Member   for

Mountbatten.  In  fact, that was the advice  I  always

received  from  the  Board  of  Visitors  when  I  was

Chairman of that Board. The Director of Social Welfare

is  aware  of  the  position and I understand  he  has

issued  instructions  that, as far  as  possible,  the

stall  who  are recruited for service in a  particular

home remain in that home to develop an interest in the

work of that home. So that matter is in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a Parole Board for female delinquents, so

f  at I am glad to report to the House that there  are

very  few  female delinquents. They behave  themselves

better  than  the boys, so that as far  as  girls  are

concerned  we do not need the equivalent of  a  Gimson

School   for  them.  The  Parole  Board  looks   after

delinquent boys who get remission of sentences  whilst

they  are  working in the Gimson School.  A  different

problem  arises with regard to girls. They are usually

inmates  of the Mount Emily Home and I think it  would

be dangerous to put such girls out on parole, unless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Mountbatten wants to look after  these

girls and be the Chairman of their Parole Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as creches are concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have  four City Council creches and two Government

creches.  We have also opened a creche at New  Market.

There  are  two  creches  run by  Government,  one  in

Victoria Street and one in Banda Street. Both are very

popular. When I was in the Ministry, we opened the New

Market  Creche, but for some reason or other,  it  has

never  proved  as popular as the Banda Street  Creche.

Again. Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if the Member for

Mountbatten has not gone down to her own constituency,

because there is also a creche here that has just been

built behind the community centre in Mountbatten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin): Did you invite her to

the opening?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> No. P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With regard to the entry on page 418 of

the   Estimates  affecting  the  Community  Recreation

Section,  it is not necessary to maintain a  Community

Recreation Section any more in the Ministry.  All  the

work  of  community recreation has been taken over  by

the  People's  Association. All the  staff  that  were

employed in the Community Recreation Section have been

found other jobs in other sections of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information  of the Minister, I dare not  go  anywhere

near  the Mount-batten Community Centre because it  is

known  as the P.A.P. holy of holies! The Minister  did

not  invite  the elected representative of that  area,

i.e.,  myself, to be present for the opening  of  that

community  centre.  So, if it is the  P.A.P. holy  of

holies, how can I be found there? Anyway, can  I  now

withdraw, Mr Speaker. Sir, in view of the fact that I

have made that statement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Unless any Member wants to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the honourable lady

must have the last word!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 4.*

*The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Tee Kim Leng and Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Development and Intergration of Community

Associations.  Sir,  I  understand  the   Government's

community association project has, in fact,  met  with

tremendous  failure  in  that the  response  from  the

people  has  not been to the liking of the Government.

Strangely  enough, as the Member for  Mountbatten  has

pointed out, many people are inclined to look  at  the

People's  Association centres as institutions  of  the

P.A.P. and not as community institutions. Sir, we have

all  heard quite a lot about the People's Association.

We  have  read a lot in the papers, and in this  House

the  Prime  Minister and various other Ministers  have

said  quite  a  lot.  In all talks  referring  to  the

People's  Association,  the  Government  have   merely

seemed  to  be  interested  only  in  connecting   the

People's Association's current strike with the Barisan

Sosialis. They have been so eager to hold the  Barisan

Sosialis responsible for the strike that they have, in

fact,   ignored,   first   and   foremost, to   give

consideration  to  the legitimate  grievances  of  the

employees  of the People's Association and,  secondly,

to  find the solutions to the legitimate grievances of

these  employees. Sir, in the first place,  I  do  not

know  how and in what pattern these community  centres

are  built.  I  believe they are situated  within  the

boundaries of the electoral constituencies. There  are

constituencies  which  do not  have  even  one  single

community  centre, while at the same  time  there  are

constituencies  which  have more  than  one  community

centre.  But I am aware of the circumstances in  which

the  officials  of  the  People's  Association,  maybe

community centre leaders, etc., were appointed. I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



not  want  to go into the circumstances, but  I  would

like to take this opportunity briefly to touch on  the

position  that  is  prevalent today in  the  community

centres.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was giving, Sir, the Government's interest

seems   to  be  just  to  hold  the  Barisan  Sosialis

responsible  for the strike. But this is something  on

which we must be clear. I think most of the Government

Ministers will at least secretly agree with me that if

we have 100 or 200 workers going on strike, there must

be,  in  the first place, a legitimate reason.  It  is

completely  ridiculous  to suggest  that  anybody  can

force 10 or 20 workers to go on strike, let alone  100

or  200 people. Therefore, I say it is important  that

the  Government should - after they have done enough  of

smearing - at least try to concentrate on the legitimate

grievances of the workers. They, in fact, ask for  the

formation  of a union through which they can  constitu

tionally put forward their grievances, and that  right

has been denied. The Prime Minister said the other day

that  because these workers do not belong to  a  union

they  have no right to go on strike. On the one  hand,

they deny these workers the right to form a union;  on

the  other hand, they said, "Because you are not in  a

trade  union, you have no right to go on strike."  The

fact  remains that there are grievances and they ought

to be looked into. The Government must attempt to seek

solution.  Insofar  as  I  can  gather,  the  People's

Association, employees are employees who do  not  come

within   the   same   category  as   civil   servants,

particularly they are not governed by General  Orders.

As   such.   I   think  the  Government   must   state

categorically that whatever political views individual

employees of the People's Association may hold, it  is

not  necessarily  inconsistent with  the  objects  and

ideals of the People's Association. I am told that the

Prime Minister, in an interview with a delegation from

the  employees of the People's Association, said  that

he  expected the employees of the People's Association

to be loyal to the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> This is something which the Ministers can

confirm  or  deny,  but  I have sufficient  reason  to

believe that this was said - of course, not only loyalty

to   the   Government  but  also   to   the   People's

Association.  But insofar as loyalty to  the  People's

Association  is  concerned, I do not  think  that  any

employee  involved is disputing that fact. Insofar  as

loyalty to the Government is concerned, I do not think

anybody  is disputing that fact. But if employees  are

to  be penalised because their political views are not

consistent  with  the views of the P.A.P. leadership.

then it is an entirely different matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I hear that the dispute in the People's

Association  is centred around this fact,  that  seven

members  of the P.A.P. left the P.A.P. and joined  the

Barisan Sosialis - I do not know whether they joined the

Barisan  Sosialis or they are members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. The point is that even if they had been  mem

bers  of  the P.A.P. and had resigned from the  P.A.P.

and  have now joined the Bansan Sosialis, that  should

not  be  the  reason  for  their  expulsion  from  the

People's   Association,   unless,   of   course,   the

Government can show why the political beliefs  of  the

employees   of  the  People's  Association   must   be

subjected  to  the views of the P.A.P. leadership  by

virtue  of  the  fact that they are employees  of  the

People's Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the cost of building community  centres

is  paid by the public. But during the past two  years

we  have  seen know the Party in power has turned  the

community  centres  into branches of  the  P.A.P.  The

Government have said that it is to the credit of their

Party  that  they  have put up the community  centres.

After  putting up the community centres,  the  elected

representatives  of  some  constituencies   were   not

invited to the opening ceremony but officials  of  the

P.A.P. were invited. We know that the cost  of  these

community centres is paid by the public and  not  from

the  purse  of the P.A.P. Public money should  not  be

used for the Party. We have seen that the employees of

the  People's  Association  are  responsible  for  the

activities  of the community centres but they  do  not

agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



with the political ideas of the P.A.P. They want to be

loyal  to  the  People's Association  but  the  P.A.P.

leadership  want them to be also loyal to  the  P.A.P.

This   is  unjust.  The  P.A.P. make  use  of   these

organisations as their Party branches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Last year there were two by-elections. The P.A.P. got the employees of the

People's  Association  to  take  part  in  their  mass

rallies.   We   know   this  was   very   unjust   and

unreasonable. I do not know why the Government want to

spend  such a big sum in 1962. Do they want to set  up

community  centres in constituencies which  belong  to

the P.A.P. or in constituencies which do not belong to

the  P.A.P.? There is one community centre  which  has

been  closed down by the Government. There is  another

one, which is a very shabby building built during  the

Japanese occupation. This is not fair.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to   relate  the  circumstances  before  the  People's

Association came into existence. In the Annual  Report

of  the Social Welfare Department (Cmd. 6 of 1961), it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Towards the second half of the year, the community

Recreation Division assumed direct responsibility  for

the  Social  Welfare and Rural community centres.  The

term of office of the Management Committees...'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member should realise

that  her speech is being interpreted. She is going  a

bit too fast.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I wanted to give time to the

others to speak. Anyway, I will go slower:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Towards the second half of the year, the community

Recreation Division assumed direct responsibility  for

the  Social Welfare and Rural Board community centres.

The  term  of office of the Management Committees  and

Advisory  Committees for the Social Welfare community

centres  and  the Rural Board community  centres  were

terminated. The Director of Social Welfare  took  over

direct  control  of these centres  and  those  run  by

community associations.'



<br><br>Sir,  that is what they tell us but what they omit  to

tell us is that soon after the P.A.P. came into power,

these community centres which had been run by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



the  communities themselves, by the people elected  by

the  communities  and  by  the  people  interested  in

community welfare, were suddenly stopped and they were

idle  for  months. The people were all confused.  They

did  not know whether they could or could not go  into

them. When the community centres came under the direct

control  of the Government, the officers were  changed

so  often that the people who went there did not  know

who  they  were. The whole place was in confusion  for

several  months. Then one fine day we were told,  "Oh,

yes,  the community centres have been returned  to  the

community. The Government is not controlling them now.

The   committees  are  elected  from  the  communities

themselves."  We were all very happy only  to  realise

that  that  was done because the People's  Association

were then con rolling them. As soon as the P.A.P. came

into  power - if I am not mistaken, it may have  been  a

few  days  or a few weeks after they came  into  power - they learned that the President of the Singapore Youth

Council  was given a grant to go to America. The  next

day,   it  was  published  in  the  papers  that   the

Government intended to withdraw the $15,000  that  was

given   to  the  Singapore  Youth  Council.  Now   the

Singapore  Youth  Council had 35  youth  organisations

affiliated  to  it. It did a very  good  job.  It  was

affiliated  to  a  world body - the  World  Assembly  of

Youth.  At the next function of the World Assembly  of

Youth,  Singapore was not affiliated to be represented

because   the   Government   virtually   killed   that

association.  First,  they said  they  would  withdraw

their grant. That is the unfair part of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> resumed her seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I heard the hon. Lady say just now that

because of all this, Singapore was not represented  at

the  last  World Assembly of Youth Conference.  May  I

inform  the Member for Mountbatten that Singapore  did

send  a representative as an observer and he came from

the People's Association? I have had meetings with the

World  Assembly  of  Youth  representatives  and  they

agreed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>



that  in place of the Youth Council they would be very

happy to have observers from the Youth Section of  the

People's  Association sent to their conferences.  That

was done.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I did qualify my

statement by saying that Singapore was not represented

as  an  affiliated member. I realise what the Minister

has told us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, the next day they said they were

going to withdraw the $15,000. The workers there  were

so  interested and dedicated in their work  that  they

said,  "All  right, then we will try to find  our  own

finances."  What did the Government do? The Government

were  determined  to kill the S.Y.C. They  said,  "All

right then, if you find the finances, we withdraw  the

loan  of  our premises. You cannot use our  premises."

And so on, Sir,It went on stage after stage. Whatever

the  S.Y.C. put  up, the Government  fought  it.  The

S.Y.C. gave up when they could fight no more.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing happened to the Safety First Council

which  was  affiliated  to the  other  Social  Welfare

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> resumed her seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As far as the Singapore Youth Council is

concemed,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  became   the

Government there was a meeting called by the  Director

of Social Welfare. He ad

vised  me  on  the  work  of  that  Council.  Their

representatives were duplicated, Mr Speaker, Sir. The

same  group  of  representatives on the Youth  Council

were  also  on  the Council for Social  Services.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the proposal to the Youth Council -  that

they should dissolve themselves - was made on the advice

of our senior civil servants who were knowledgeable in

these  matters. The Council for Social Services, which

was a duplication of the Youth Council,

has  also  existed  since  we  have  been  in   the

government. They had been doing very good work  indeed

and  we  are very grateful to them. It was because  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>



advice  that  I  received from the Ministry  officials

that  the  proposal was made to the Youth  Council  to

dissolve  themselves, and the Youth Council  made  the

decision themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I am very surprised to hear

that  the  Youth Council took the decision themselves.

From  the officers of the Youth Council who approached

me,  I heard they were trying to survive! Anyway,  the

Safety First Council was the same, Sir. The feeling of

the  members of the Safety First Council was - and  this

was  actually said - that the Safety First  Council  was

dissolved  because  there were not  sufficient  P.A.P.

members in the Council.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am just wondering whether the

Safety First Council will come under this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us try and confine ourselves to

community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

going into details. I am just mentioning it in passing

to substantiate my statement on the S.Y.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, what happened? Their guns misfired! Their

bullets  boomeranged. The People's  Association  staff

turned against them, and some were sacked. I hear that

now  they  have employed some people to replace  those

who  were  sacked, and it is rumoured that  these  are

either

P.A.P. or pro-P.A.P. or at least in sympathy with  the

P.A.P.  There is a rumour that as they could not  find

enough pro-P.A.P., they even got people sympathetic to

the P.A.P. Sir, this is an outrageous breach of trust.

Why  should  the  tax that is paid by Members  of  the

Opposition  and by those who are evidently  what  they

are - anti-P.A.P. - our  supporters who  are  anti-P.A.P.,

and  the  tax paid by you and your staff, who are  not

supposed to take part in politics - why should all  that

money  be  used  to  run the People's  Association  to

promote  P.A.P. propaganda and to ensure  success  for

the P.A.P. in the next general elections?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their Siamese boxing has brought their proud

majority of 35 to a tragic majority of one. The sooner

they  turn to Queensberry rules, the better  for  them

before they lose that majority of one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are accusations that the staff of the

People's  Association have been asked to be  loyal  to

the P.A.P. if they want their jobs. The Prime Minister

has denied that, saying that he has tape re-cordings made in his office to prove that he  had  not

called  upon their loyalty to the P.A.P. I  regret  to

have  to say this, Sir. In fact, I am still trying  to

decide whether I should say it or not. It is not

nice  for the Prime Minister. But I would like to tell

him  this: it is no use denying it. When the  People's

Association went on strike, the strikers  came  to  my

house  and handed me a tape which recorded the  speech

of  the Prime Minister given on his first day of  leave

when  he  went to the People's Association.  And  that

tape  definitely  said, "You  must  be  loyal  to  the

organisation  (meaning the People's  Association),  to

the  Govemment, and to the P.A.P." Now, they have given

me  this  tape. I do not know to how many more  people

they  have  given this tape. I do not think the  Prime

Minister should deny it, as there is evidence. And  if

the  Prime Minister wishes to hear the tape,  or  does

not believe that I have it, he can have it anytime  he

wants.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is useless for the

Member for Thomson to pretend that the trouble in  the

People's  Association is unconnected with the  Barisan

Sosialis. In fact, the whole furore in the

Association started at the time the Barisan Sosialis

members formed themselves into a political Party. The

genesis of all this is quite simple, Mr Speaker, Sir.

The key and important staff of the People's

Association were recruited by a sub-committee of the

Board of Management of the People's Association. On

that sub-committee the two most important members - in

fact, the members who decided on the appointments - were

the Member for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper

Serangoon. Of course, they packed important positions

in the Association with their cronies. In one of the

law courts, the Member for Upper Serangoon stated that

his Branch Secretary, who had been out of work for

about ten years, suddenly passed the examination paper

marked by them, and got appointed to the post of

community centre organiser in that district. Now that

is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



background. When the Barisan Sosialis members  - former

members  of  the P.A.P.  - defected, it is only  natural

that  their  views would be transmitted to the  former

staff  of the People's Association. The opinion  among

the  former  staff was very simple. They said,  "Well,

the Government is falling. There will be a revolution

in October when a new government will take over." Some

of the people who generally opposed us thought we were

wrong. Other thought they might as well

climb   on   the  winning  bandwagon.  So  it   became

impossible  to enforce discipline in the  Association.

Top members were openly conspiring right down the line

to  oppose  the Government. In the first instance,  it

was  necessary  to  make  an  example  of  a  few   by

dismissing  round about half a dozen members.  Instead

of  having the salutary effect that we had hoped  for,

this led to more agitation. And it became necessary to

dismiss more people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, the ringleaders were running

the   Association  and  its  facilities  as  if  these

belonged  to them and not to the people of  Singapore,

let alone the Board of Management of the

People's Association. They defied orders. They  held

meetings as and when; and where they liked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it became obvious that control over a section of

the  staff  had been completely lost, and it therefore

became necessary to force the issue. Accordingly, when

the  ringleaders sought an interview  with  the  Prime

Minister,  he agreed to talk to the general  rank  and

file  of  the  staff  of the People's  Association  and

explain to them the situation. The ring leaders agreed

to convene such a meeting. I think the House has heard

from  the Prime Minister what transpired - that contrary

to the agreement with the Prime Minister, they held  a

rival  meeting at a different place at the same  time.

After that, of course, these misguided persons went on

what  they called their "strike". Sir, the strike  was

not,  as the Member for Thomson was trying to suggest,

because  they wanted to form a union and  were  denied

the right to form a union. That was not the issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did not say the cause of the strike

was  the  demand  to form a union. I said  there  were

legitimate grievances.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, when one talked of

grievances, one meant grievances leading to a  strike.

Therefore, the inference must be that they  wanted  to

form  a  union and were denied that right.  Sir,  they

never  wanted  to form a union. That came  about  only

after they had vacated their posts. Then we told them,

"You have walked out of your jobs. You are not walking

out on strike, as you have not got a legal union."  It

is  only  then they said, "Let us form a union."  When

they  applied  to  the Registrar of Trade  Unions,  he

quite  naturally  pointed out to them,  "You  are  not

being  employed by anybody. So you cannot be a  member

of  a union of the People's Association staff, because

you  are  no longer the staff." That is a side  issue,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir. The main point is that  once  they

embarked on a so-called strike, Singapore saw a series

of  examples of utterly reprehensible conduct  on  the

part of these persons. They resorted to violence. They

beat  up  people.  They broke the windows  of  certain

community centres. They broke up furniture of other

community centres. In one place they even spilled  pig

excreta   on   the   premises.  That  was   absolutely

disgusting, uncivilized conduct. And all the time they

tried  to  prevent members of the public  from  having

access  to  the community centres. Community  centres,

Sir,  are meant for the public. They provide a  useful

service - people rest there, read newspapers, listen  to

the radio, play

games, and enjoy other facilities for recreation.  But

this   gang  of  undisciplined  louts  took  it   upon

themselves,  with  no  legal  right  whatsoever,   to

prevent  members of the public from entering community

centres. In somecases they turned up in big force  and

frightened  the loyal staff who wanted to work  there.

There  have  been numerous instances of staff  members

being assaulted by these ruffians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in these circumstances, may I suggest that

when the Member for Thomson said that we must find a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



solution to this problem, we have found a solution  to

this problem? These persons have been dismissed. In so

far  as  the  Government or the Board of the  People's

Association is concerned, there is nothing for  us  to

do.  They walked themselves out of their jobs and they

stay out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first round of the scrap between the

P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis and the pro-Communist

supporters.  The result of this, Sir, is that  persons

whom  they have duped into this foolhardy action  have

lost  their jobs, and lost a good permanent career  in

the  People's Association. There was round two.  Round

three - students did not sit for examinations. But the

majority  did, and they never got the support  of  the

majority  of  the Chinese students. Only  a  misguided

minority did not take the examinations. The result  is

that one year's work in school

is wasted.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it could go on. There is trouble in the Work

Brigade. Perhaps several hundreds of people will  have

lost  their  jobs and no opportunity to get  work.  If

this  is  the way the Barisan Sosialis think they  can

rally  the  support of the working masses, by  leading

them  to misery, loss of employment, then, Sir, I wish

them the best of luck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely the result of political

manceuvres. My colleague, the Minister for Health  and

Law, will be able to recount to the House when one  of

the  persons  who was dismissed at an earlier  period,

approached him and pleaded that she be given back  her

job.  The Minister for Health and Law said, "Well,  we

will  be glad to take you back. But you must give some

undertaking that there will not be a repetition of the

disgraceful  conduct  which  these  people  have  been

indulging in." The long and short of it is that,  when

she found that she would not be taken back, this young

girl shook her fist at the Minister for Health and Law

and  said,  "You just wait for the October revolution.

You  will be out. We will be in office." This was  the

way these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



foolish  and  misguided  young  men  and  women   were

inveigled into mounting their so-called strike.  Their

attempt  to  get support and sympathy from the  public

has  failed dismally. Indeed, they are now reduced  to

forming two littte outposts, one in Havelock Road  and

one off Geylang Road, as a gesture of futile defiance.

They  attempted  to  mount  what  they  called  mobile

pickets.  They  tried to block the  entrances  of  the

People's Association. For what reason, I do not  know,

Mr  Speaker, Sir,If they think that is the way  they

can  get sympathy from the public, that is, by denying

the  public the means of access to community  centres,

then  there  is something wrong with their  ways.  But

even  their mobile pickets have packed up, having  met

with hostility and opposition wherever they went.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest to the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis that they call it a day and not try  to  make

an  issue  of  a  lost  cause? One  feels  sorry,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   for  the  victims  who   have   been

manipulated by evil men behind the scenes. They had  a

promising career in the People's Association. There is

a salary scheme. There are conditions of service. With

the expansion of recreational facilities in Singapore,

they  had  a bright future and considerable scope  for

improving  themselves. We have arranged with  overseas

governments, including the Governments of Israel,

Australia  and New Zealand, to run training  courses

for  these  persons so that they can  see  what  other

countries  more advanced than we are in  this  respect

are providing. All this they have thrown away in a few

moments of folly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairahill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

opening words of the Minister for Finance are that  it

is  useless for the Barisan Sosialis to defend. May  I

say  here  that  it  is useless for the  Govemment  to

pretend   that  when  they  introduced  the   People's

Association  Bill, it was in their minds to  make  the

People's Association a political arm of the P.A.P.? If

not,  why  should  it be mecessary  for  the  People's

Association



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



to  be  controlled by a Board whose membership is  the

Prime  Minister as Chairman, the Minister  for  Labour

and  Law  as  Deputy Chairman, and  the  Minister  for

Finance. They want to turn it into a political ann  of

the P.A.P. I said at previous sittings that there were

two  Frankensteins  created by the P.A.P.  Government.

One is the Work

Brigade and the other one is the People's Association.

They  thought that in this way they could ensure  to

themselves continued success of the P.A.P.

in future elections. So much so that they even trained

members  of  the  Work  Brigade  and  workers  in  the

People's Association to attend mass rallies,  to  come

along somewhere around the City

Hall  and cheer them when they were getting a  beating

by  the  Member for Hong Lim. In the two  by-elections

that  took place recently, members of the Work Brigade

and  the  People's  Association were  ordered  by  the

Government  to  be  present  at  their  mass  rallies.

Allegations have been made against the Prime Minister,

the   Chairman   of  the  People's  Associat�on,   who

addressed  a  meeting of the employees and  told  them

that  they  must be loyal not only to the  Association

and  the  Government, which no doubt would  have  been

right,  but also to the P.A.P. As has been mention  ed

by the Member for Mountbatten, a tape-recorded message

is in her possession. That no doubt will go before the

Commission of Inquiry when it has been appointed.  All

these things were done

at  a time when the P.A.P. were  arrogant. They  now

try  to say that all the evil things done in the  name

of  the  People's Association were done by Members  of

the  Barisan Sosialis. They were at that time  members

of  the P.A.P., and they were acting on the orders  of

the  P.A.P. Whatever they did, they did it in the name

of   the   P.A.P.   The  P.A.P. must   accept   full

responsibility  for all the political  intrigues  that

have been going on in the People's Association.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although the Member for Caimhill has taken quite a lot

of  time,  I am indebted to him for having raised  and

emphasised certain points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



which  I  myself wanted to raise, points which  become

more  cogent when emphasised by the Member for  Cairnhill,   because  it  is  a  fact  that  the   People's

Association  is  the  so-called second  front  or  the

political arm of the P.A.P. The Member for Cairnhill has

already read the list of members on the Board  of  the

People's Association: the Prime Minister, the Minister

for  Labour  and  Law, the Minister for  Finance,  the

Minister for Home Affairs. All the important Ministers

are  on  the  Board. It is naive of the  Minister  for

Finance  to  suggest  to  this  House  that,  for   an

organisation  of  such importance, the  whole  policy-making body consists of two persons. I myself and  the

Member for Upper Serangoon. It is indeed naive -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member will give way. The

Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Time is running out, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Any organisation can only be run

by the people who are in it, and it is naive of him to

suggest  that  we  put  our  boys  into  the  People's

Association  so that it can be run for  our  purposes.

Surely the People's Action Party is not as stupid  and

as naive as that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> You

were inside.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Yes, I was there. That is

correct,  Sir.  But  I  was there  only  to  take  and

transmit  orders.  If  any  of  the  Members  opposite

dispute that, surely when the Commission of Inquiry is

set  up,  I shall produce all the duly signed  papers,

minutes,   letters,   memoranda   addressed   to   me,

purporting to give me instructions as to how and  whom

to  select,  as to whom to promote, and  whom  not  to

promote,  as  to  who  is  satisfactory  and  who   is

unsatisfactory. All these things are on  record,  Sir.

It is quite naive of the Deputy Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



Minister to call Inc a stool pigeon. After all, I  was

only a Parliamentary Secretary in the Government,  and

I  had  to take orders from my Ministers, particularly

from the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If the Deputy Prime Minister so

disputes.  I  shall produce evidence in  which  it  is

clearly stated that he himself has given me orders.  I

have   carried   out  those  orders,   much   to   his

satisfaction .I could produce also minutes to say that

he  was happy that I had carried out those orders. For

them  now  to say that the whole policy of recruitment

in  the  People's Association was in the hands of  the

Member  for  Upper  Serangoon  and  myself  is  indeed

something which is beyond credulity. To say  that  the

people whom we recruited came with us because we  left

the  P.A.P. is  completely wrong  and  irresponsible,

because we can produce documents to show that many  of

the   people   who  were  sacked  from  the   People's

Association  were actually recommended for appointment

in  the People's Association by some of the Ministers.

The  only  reason  I  do  not want  to  produce  these

documents  now  is  that there  is  no  Commission  of

Inquiry. As soon as the Commission of Inquiry  is  set

up,  and  as  soon  as I have been given  an  adequate

assurance  that  all  those  papers  may  legally   be

produced  without  any trouble befalling  me,  or  any

threat, those papers will be produced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, to answer the Member for

Cairnhill  why  the Ministers are on  the  Board.  The

answer  i3  simple.  We saw complete  failure  of  the

community centres under the previous Government. I was

at  one  time  the Director of Social Welfare,  and  I

found  the  community  centres  were  total  failures.

First,  they were too big. An average community centre

cost  about a quarter of a million dollars.  Secondly,

they  were  sited in the wrong places, far  away  from

where the people stay. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



thirdly, the staff were all wrong. Therefore, in order

to  make sure that former errors are not repeated, and

that  vast  sums  of  money are not  wasted,  we  have

decided   that  we  must  have  direct   control   and

supervision over these community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to comment rather briefly on what the Member

for Nee Soon said. Brave words, Mr Speaker, Sir! They

have  got  documents! I can assure you that  we  shall

insist on the production of the documents. Earlier  on

during  these  troubles, the ex-staff of the  People's

Association,  I think probably on the advice  or  with

the  assistance  of  the Member for  Upper  Serangoon,

issued a statement saying that these were the names of

the  staff,  and these were the persons who introduced

them  or  who recommended them for employment. Against

my  name  was  a  certain Miss - I have forgotten  her

name.  I  found out that I did not even know  who  she

was.  Later  on  I checked with the Treasurer  of  the

People's Association and found out that she was one of

these people. I think probably the Member for Havelock

will know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of order.

The  particular  lady was introduced by  the  Minister

himself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order. Dr Goh,

please continue. There is only one minute more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Members opposite are

given to a fairly great deal of recklessness in making

their statements. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have checked these matters

fairly  closely  with the Secretary Treasurer  of  the

People's Association, and he has in his file  all  the

records which will be produced at the right time. I do

not know what has happened to the Member for Nee Soon.

I  do  not  think  he  has much  reason  for  elation.

Certainly  the Member for Upper Serangoon  is  looking

extremely  nervous because he knows how deeply  he  is

implicated in this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately when I was in the P.A.P. I was

never consulted on the appointment of the Minister for

Culture, and I do not think I was even consulted on

having to have a Ministry of Culture. If I had been

consulted on the appointment of the Minister for

Culture, I would have said that the present Minister

for Culture should be the last man to be the Minister

for Culture. I understand he has extensive training

and experience in propaganda work by virtue of the

fact that he was employed by the Straits Times and the

Singapore Standard for quite some time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think all that is

relevant  at  all.  If  the  hon.  Member  thinks  the

Minister for Culture has failed, he must show  how  he

has failed. I do not think it is relevant to

say what his private life was like before he  was

appointed to be the Minister. Let us now come down  to

the  point as to how the Member considers the Minister

for Culture has failed in his Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I assure you, Sir, I do not want to

discuss his private life. I was just leading up to the

point that the present Ministry of Culture is not,  in

fact,  the Ministry of Culture. It is the Government's

Ministry of Propaganda and has become the Ministry  of

P.A.P. Propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You have got the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, today we find the staff and the

functions  of the Ministry of Culture, and  everything

else go to make up the propaganda machinery of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Sir, we understand the Minister for  Education

issues   a  statement  and  the  Ministry  of  Culture

distributes it. That is perfectly in order.  There  is

no  complaint.  But  if the P.A.P.  Central  Executive

Committee  issues a statement for it to be  typed  and

printed and distributed by the Ministry of Culture, it

is quite a different matter. How can you use paper, to

say  the least, which is bought with public money, for

typing out P.A.P. Central Executive Statements?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister says it is

rubbish.  For  his  information,  we  know  that  even

official statements issued by the Singapore Manual and

Mercantile Workers' Union have been distributed by the

Ministry of Culture. Surely, Sir, the Singapore Manual

and  Mercantile  Workers' Union is  not  a  Government

organ.  Unless,  of  course, the Government  wants  to

admit  (I  hope the Minister for Culture  will  admit)

that  the Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union is,  in

fact,  a  Government outfit then I say it  is  all  in

order.  But  I  do not think the Minister  will  admit

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Culture, which indulges

exclusively in P.A.P. propaganda work, is also  guided

by  the  Minister for Culture to get newspaper editors

to  play up or play down news items according  to  the

whims and fancies of the P.A.P. leadership. Sir, I  do

not  suggest that the Minister calls up the  newspaper

editors  and  says,  "This is my statement.  You  must

publish  it  in full. That statement is issued  by  my

political  opponent.  You must not  publish  it."  The

Minister for Culture has sufficient experience  to  do

this  thing subtly so that nobody, in fact, knows that

the  Minister  for Culture is doing the  work  of  the

editor of the Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt that the Minister for Culture

is  going  to  stand  up  and  deny  vehemently  these

allegations.  I  tell  him,  Sir,  before  he   starts

denying,  that  if he is seriously suggesting  that  I

know this to be untrue, then -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Liar!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I heard the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  use  a  word which he knows to be  completely

unparliamentary. He will please apologise to the House

for using that word and withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I apologise.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I tell the Government benches this.

If  they  seriously suggest that I am not telling  the

truth, they can hold a public Commission of Inquiry -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Do you think the Government has so

many commissioners?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and get newspapermen to testify, so long

as  they  can  give  an  assurance  to  the  newspaper

reporters  that no matter what they testify to,  their

jobs  are  safeguarded. I have  some  friends  in  the

journalist  world  and  I have  had  occasion  to  get

information   direct  from  them.  I  say   that   the

Government  are in a position, by the fact  that  they

run  the  machinery of State, to hold a Commission  of

Inquiry.  Get  every single reporter to testify;  give

him  a  guarantee  that he will not be  penalised  for

telling  the  truth; and you shall get the  truth  and

nothing but the truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, they must have been amused to see

Mr  Lim  Ching Siong just getting up from  the  chair

with  the  Prime  Minister seated  in  a  big  picture

appearing in the Straits Times. That picture was taken

in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Room.  I

am  told that the photographer was quietly advised  by

the Minister for Culture to take this photograph. I do

not  know what political capital they want to make out

of  it.  It looks a very silly proposition  to  me.  I

think,  if  at all anybody should get the  credit,  it

should be Mr Lim Ching Siong, who seems to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>



be  standing up. But anyway, Sir, this is the thinking

of  the P.A.P. Government. They thought they had  made

very  big  political capital out of it. But the  point

here  is  this.  That we have reason  to  believe  the

Minister  for Culture ushered the cameraman  into  the

C.P.A.  Room. In fact, the man who snapped  that  shot

was employed by the Ministry of Culture. I am told the

Chinese  papers published the photograph and  added  a

footnote  saying,  "Photograph  by  the  Ministry   of

Culture."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to say much. I am sure the

Minister  for  Culture has quite a lot to  say  and  I

would like to listen to him first. But I want to  tell

him this in all earnestness. If it is the intention of

the  Government to use the Ministry of Culture as  the

propaganda wing of the People's Action Party, let them

at  least  rename the Ministry. Call it  "Ministry  of

Propaganda";  then  you  can  use  it  for  propaganda

purposes for the Government of the P.A.P. But  do  not

go  and  call it the Ministry of Culture and  do  very

uncultured  work. This is, I beg to  submit,  Sir,  an

insult to a most honourable term - culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I say how disappointed I am  in  the

way the Member for Thomson has tackled this particular

item?  He indicated to me that there were going to  be

fireworks,  but  what  we  really  heard  were  things

fizzling   out.   There   was  nothing   concrete   or

substantial. For example, he queried whether we should

not  name it "Ministry of Propaganda" and he would  be

quite  satisfied.  Surely, Sir, as a very  intelligent

gentleman, he is not going to be satisfied by a change

in  a terminology and not the work of the Ministry. It

is  quite true, Sir, that a Ministry such as this - and

government   itself - relies   on   propaganda.    Every

Assemblyman  in  this Chamber came  here  because  his

Party  or his election agent managed to put over  good

propaganda  to convince the electorate  that  what  he

stood  for  was right. I am told the august origin  of

the   word  "propaganda"  started  at  the  time  when

Christianity was being propagated. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>



word  "propaganda" means really to propagate a  belief

or  a faith. To that extent, we who are elected as the

government   certainly  have  a  right  to   use   all

propaganda  machinery to put over a point of  view.  I

can  quite understand why Members of the Barisan  have

suddenly  developed an antipathy for  Radio  Singapore

over  which  many  of  them were  not  only  eager  to

broadcast but also got our Ministry officials to write

the speeches for them. So they were using at that time

the  propaganda machinery to put over a point of view.

What  has  happened is that we have used the machinery

of  propaganda effectively. What they are  complaining

about   is  not  that  we  are  using  the  propaganda

machinery,  but  that we are using it  so  effectively

that  today many of them have been reduced to silence.

In  fact,  they have even to quit the Chamber  because

there are lots of propaganda even in this Assembly. We

are  not claiming that the propaganda machinery is not

being   used.  It  should  be  used,  and   by   every

government, to put over a point of view.  If  it  were

improperly  used, that is, if we were doing  something

which  should  not be done, then that is  a  different

matter. The radio department, publicity, and films are

in  tended to convey a particular type of message. But

I  will  say this: that never in any instance have  we

used  Radio  Singapore or any of the other  propaganda

organs  of  government  to put forward  purely  P.A.P.

propaganda. We have used it to put forward  Government

propaganda.  It happens to be a party government,  and

to  that extent we put forward the Government's  point

of  view; the Government's attitude to certain things;

the  Government's stand on certain problems.  That  is

something which every democratic government, if not  a

totalitarian government, uses. The only difference  is

that  in the case of a totalitarian government,  there

will be no Barisan Sosialis to ask questions about the

Ministry  of  Culture. But in a democratic government,

they   can  even  very  light-heartedly  ask   certain

questions,  knowing full well, Sir, that they  can  go

back home quietly and go to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>



sleep  without hearing a strange knock on their  doors

at 2 o'clock in the morning.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I just correct one misapprehension, Sir? An

allegation  was  made. I do not think the  Member  for

Thomson  really believes it. He has a way  of  putting

forward certain things without proving them or stating

the  facts, just as he insisted that I worked for  the

Straits  Times,  the  Malayan  Tribune  and  for   the

Singapore Standard as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did not say the Tribune.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To that extent, he has a way of

putting forward half-truths and then withdrawing them.

He says we use the property of the Ministry of Culture

to   issue   statements  by  the   Central   Executive

Committee. I would like to point out to you, Sir, that

we  have  never gone out of our way to  use  even  the

radio  to  put over reports of our P.A.P. conferences

except insofar as they may have national implications.

In  fact, I remember when the Member for Hong Lim left

the  Government, we felt that there was a  case  where

the  matter had gone beyond party politics to national

politics.  Here was a Minister who had  to  leave  the

Government, and in that case we did issue a  statement

from the Central Executive Committee over the radio. I

understand  the previous Government used to  broadcast

over  the  radio the opening of every  branch  of  the

Labour   Front.   In  fact,  we  have   given   strict

instructions -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, this is the height of untruth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Check this up, because it was pointed

out to me that when the former Chief Minister - I am not

saying   this   Chief  Minister - opened  Labour   Front

branches,  radio  broadcasts  were  made  about  them.

[Interruption] (The trouble is that when a  Party  had

two Chief Ministers, it becomes a bit difficult. So  I

will say that I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>



sorry.  I  was referring to the first Chief  Minister.)

But  we  have  never done that. The only time  we  have

issued  party  statements is when  they  have  national

implications,  just  as when we had  a  special  Review

Committee which made certain suggestions as to how  the

work  of  the government should be improved. Since  the

Committee  included  not only Ministers  but  also  the

former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home

Affairs who deserted half-way through, we thought  that

since  these  recommendations  were  being  made  by  a

responsible  group, to that extent  we  broadcast  them

over  the  radio. Again, Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis

had  their two inaugural meetings, those meetings  were

broadcast over Radio Singapore. So I would ask them  to

say  whether we have at any time used the radio or  any

of  the  other instruments of propaganda at our command

to  propagate  purely party politics. I say  that  they

cannot produce such evidence because we have never done

so, but we do certainly use the machinery of propaganda

to  put forward Government's views on any questions  of

national importance to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation "Oh, the Minister for

Culture, of course, does not intimidate editors. He

does not call them into his office and frighten them

into playing up this or that news.". let us say quite

openly that we do call the newspaper editors and we

discuss things with them and say, "We think it is

important news. These are the implications behind it.

Would you give us good play?" Just as the Members

opposite who criticise the papers for not giving them

due play, are at liberty to ring up the reporters or

the editors concerned. If the newspapers do not listen

to them, it is just their bad luck. They do not happen

to be the Government. But we certainly ask the press

for publicity - and it is quite legitimate; it happens in

every democratic country. A government can call the

editors to a Press conference and say, "This is what we

intend to do. These are the reasons why we are doing

it. We would like full play given to it." - When a paper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>



refuses to give publicity for some reason or other

and then you close down the Press - then we say the

freedom of the Press has been infringed. But we try to

persuade, argue -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Intimidate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We never intimidate. In fact, the

Member for Thomson himself said so earlier. At  least,

he  gave  me enough credit by saying that  we  do  not

resort  to such crude methods as twisting the thumb  of

an editor and saying, "You had better print this in the

newspapers." Most newspaper reporters and  editors  are

responsible people. They respond to sensible argument.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sensible intimidation!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And to that extent they do play up

certain news. For example - it was mentioned earlier  - it

is  quite true about Mr Lim Ching Siong and myself  in

the  C.P.A.  Room  calling not one photographer  but  a

group of photographers asking whether they wanted  good

news.  You  have gentlemen walking out of this  Chamber

saying that they were hungry and that they wanted to go

home  early because they feared being waylaid. But what

did  they  do?  They were drinking beer in  the  C.P.A.

Room. From the news point of view, that was something.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Surely Mr Lim Ching Siong was not sipping

beer the other night in the C.P.A. Room. This is a very

serious allegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, not only Mr Lim Ching Siong but

I  think the Member for Nee Soon and two or three other

Barisan Socialis Members were sitting around a table -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Lest the Minister go into

further  details, I think this is personal conduct.  It

should  never  be even referred to under  our  Standing

Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point I want to make is that

the  moment they saw the cameramen, they were  scooting

along  the corridor. It showed that that thing  was  of

great  news value. Mr Lim Ching Siong saw it from  the

news point if the Member for Thomson did not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am making enquiries about that

photograph.  I  am  not  quite sure  whether  that  was

completely  against the directive which  I  have  given

about  the use of the C.P.A. Room. The least said about

it, the better. [Interruption] Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the gist of the

argument put forward by the Member for Thomson was that

the Government was using the radio and other propaganda

machinery for putting over propaganda. That, I  submit,

is  nothing  irregular. In fact, any  government  which

does  not  use its propaganda machinery effectively  to

put over its message deserves to fail.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Culture said that

he was responsible for putting over a point of view and

that  P.A.P. propaganda was never solely put  over.  At

the  present moment, the P.A.P. and the Government  are

both the same. If the Minister says he is going to  put

over Government propaganda, in actual fact, he is going

to  put  over  P.A.P. propaganda. If he  wants  to  put

forward any point of view, it is only fair that he  put

forward  both points of view. Why should he put forward

only  one  point of view? This is very pertinent,  Sir.

During the recent debate on the merger issue, you  will

remember that I complained in this House that there was

complete blackout of news of speeches from the  Barisan

Sosialis. On the first and secon4 days, nearly half  an

hour  was  devoted to the speeches of the Minister  for

Finance  and  other  people, but hardly  one  line  was

devoted  to the speeches made by Members of the Barisan

Sosialis.  In  this  particular  case,  there   was   a

deliberate blackout, I think, on the citizenship issue.

Even the English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>



newspapers were told that that question should  not  be

brought  up.  If the Minister wants to  be  fair  about

anything, it is only fair and right that the people  be

rightly  informed. If Radio Singapore is to be  put  to

proper use, then all controversial questions should  be

put  forward to the people and they would then be  able

to judge. It is now the general talk in town that Radio

Singapore is no more Radio Singapore but Radio P.A.P. I

hope the Minister will be able to correct this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned a little while back that there was

no  party propaganda put forward. I will even go so far

as  to  say that the Minister has instructed the  civil

servants  in  his department to put forward  his  party

propaganda line. There were talks by one P.S. Raman. He

is  the  Programme Supervisor. He gave three  talks  on

merger   arid   they  smacked  completely   of   P.A.P.

propaganda. He never gave both sides of the picture.  I

am  sure what he said must have been dictated to him by

the  Minister. We would like to know whether, in actual

fact,  the  Minister is encouraging neutrality  of  the

civil service or encouraging the civil service to  take

part in politics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if and when the

Barisan Sosialis do come into power, then I gather that

what  they  are  going  to do is  to  take  over  Radio

Singapore and use it to put over their own propaganda.

Any  government  which comes into power will  naturally

put  over its own propaganda. Everybody knows - in  fact,

the  whole  town knows  - that the Member for  Queenstown

has  been  repeatedly invited to come to a radio  forum

and  we are still awaiting a reply from him whether  he

is  prepared to have an encounter with the Minister for

Finance,  the Member for Farrer Park, and I  think  the

Member for Hong Lim as soon as it is convenient. So we

are  far  from  wanting  to keep out  the  Opposition's

views.  We are inviting them to come and say what  they

like  openly over Radio Singapore, subject to the usual

laws of libel, sedition, slander and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown had complained that Radio

Singapore had been blacking out reports of speeches  by

Barisan  Sosialis and other Opposition  Members.  So  I

asked the News Section to give me a summary of how many

lines  were  allocated  to  Government  and  Opposition

speakers at a given period. They chose the period  21st

to  23rd  November. On 21st November,  the  total  news

items  at 7 p.m. was 190 lines of which the Member  for

Queenstown  merited  185 lines. On 22nd  November,  the

Government  speaker had the bulk of the time.  On  23rd

November, during the 7 o'clock news, there was a  total

of 346 lines out of which - I had been speaking then -  I

had 161 lines and the Member for Anson had 166 lines.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd November, in the 10.30 p.m. round-up of news,

there  were altogether 436 lines, of which I  had  156,

the   Member  for  Anson  had  176,  the  Minister  for

Education  had  87, and the Member for  Changi  had  12

lines.  So it is not quite true to say that the  Member

for  Queenstown  has  been blacked  out.  It  is  quite

difficult to compress a speech which extended over 7�

hours  into something like 5, 7 or 8 minutes. In  fact,

Sir,  I would like - perhaps not on this occasion but  on

some  other  occasion - to ask the Member for Queenstown,

as  an  experiment, to try and compress his 7�-hours

speech into a ten-minute bulletin, which runs to  about

190  lines, without his complaining that some  material

points  or some pungent phrases have been left out.  He

made  another  allegation - allegations are  made  by

indicating that they do not know whether it is true  or

not,  but  they think that it is so. For  example,  the

Member for Queenstown said the English newspapers  were

told  not  to  play up some statements  he  made  about

citizenship.  Sir,  I  myself had great  difficulty  in

following   the   point  he  was   driving   at   about

citizenship.  In  fact,  he  had  great  difficulty  in

sorting out his notes. But I can assure him that at  no

point  did  I bother to ring up any newspaper  or  even

Radio Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>



to  say,  "Blackout  whatever  points  the  Member  for

Queenstown  made  about Singapore citizenship."  It  is

obviously ridiculous. I thought it would be more to the

advantage of Government for people to read the kind  of

nonsense that had been talked about citizenship then to

have  it blacked out and, therefore, give to the Member

for  Queenstown the intellectual stature  and  standing

which he does not otherwise merit. So I can assure  him

and  everybody else that I do not ring up any newspaper

and say, "Keep so-and-so's speech short", or "Black-out

so-and-so's speech."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson said he had made enquiries.

Can he produce any newspaperman or any editor who could

say that I said that at any time? What we often did was

to  ring  up newspaper editors or journalists and  say,

"Look,  the  P.M. has made a speech. We would  like  as

full  a coverage as possible." Or, "An Assemblyman  has

made a speech. We would like a full report." In fact, I

remember the time the Member for Queenstown went  to  a

C.P.A. conference. His speech, I think, was written  in

conjunction   with  my  Political  Secretary,   and   I

corrected it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is an untruth, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, many Parliamentary Secretaries

do  go abroad to C.P.A. conferences. A speech was  sent

to  me  consisting  of  his  notes,  and  my  Political

Secretary and I expanded it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is very untrue, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> After he had made his speech, the

script was sent to us for distribution to the Press. In

fact,  Sir, I told the Press that in view of the  fact

that   the   Member  for  Queenstown  represented   the

Government at the C.P.A. conference, would they give it

good  publicity?  The  radio  certainly  did,  and  the

newspapers certainly did. I can assure him  I  did  not [Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - call up any newspaper editor and

force  him at the point of a gun to see that the speech

by  the  Member for Queenstown was published.  To  that

extent,  we  do  that, in fact, every political  party,

whether  in  or  out  of  office,  always  does   that.

Therefore,  to complain that prevailing upon  newspaper

editors to give play to speeches or statements  by  the

Government  is  a transgression of the freedom  of  the

Press  is  something which no newspaperman would  agree

with,  because  it  is  a  normal  part  of  government

practice  and  is  something which is accepted  by  all

newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to say only a few words, Sir,I am

glad  the  Minister for Culture has  admitted  that  he

calls up newspaper editors and speaks to them. In other

words,  he  gives guidance. I agree with the  Minister,

Sir,  and  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Minister

is  not a crude operator to tell the newspaper editors,

"Please, you must play this statement up, or your  head

goes  off." Sir, I give the Minister full marks  in  so

far  as ability as a propagandist is concerned. I  have

no doubt he knows how to operate his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I attended a meeting of English-educated workers

on Sunday. I was secretly delighted when I heard one of

the  speakers  refer  to the Straits  Times  and  Radio

Singapore as "Rajaratnam Times" and "Radio Rajaratnam".

That  is a fact. We do not object to the fact that  the

Government   has   necessarily   to   have   propaganda

machinery. I am not [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The leader of the House must

contain himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not attaching bad connotations to the

word  "propaganda". I realise that if you want to  have

an  information service, you have it. Having a Ministry

like  this  for government propaganda, in my  view,  is

something that is proper, just and reasonable.  But  if

you  have it for P.A.P. propaganda, well then, it is  a

different matter. Sir, the Minister for Culture can say

that the only things dealt with in the radio talks, the

only items touched on by radio announcers in their news

items, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>



only things that we tell the newspapers to play up, are

matters  which  are  connected with the  government  or

matters which are of national interest, it only needs a

little bit of common sense to know that you can have  a

wide  range of matters under the definition of "matters

of  national  interest" and "Government  matters".  For

instance, the Prime Minister gave 12 radio talks.  They

were  supposed  to  be matters of merger - what  merger

means  to the people. But he used the 12 talks to carry

on   a   character  assassination  of   his   political

opponents.  I  read in the newspapers, and  I  am  sure

quite a few others also read in the papers, that the 12

radio talks were intended to be followed by radio talks

to be given by Mr C. V. Devan Nair. In the case of the

Prime  Minister, it is the Prime Minister of the  State

speaking  to the people. But Mr Devan Nair? I  do  not

know  why they have not put him on the air. It  may  be

because they know we were prepared to raise objections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the point I want to make, Sir. One can

easily  raise  any  matter, a pure  and  simple  P.A.P.

political  propaganda  matter,  under  the  pretext  of

raising a Government matter, because the Government  in

office  today is the P.A.P. Government. When the Member

for  Hong  Lim was expelled, the Minister  for  Culture

said  that  that was a national matter and, under  that

pretext,  Radio Singapore was used. I am not  going  to

argue  with  the  Minister  on  the  principle   of   a

government  wanting  to  use the government  propaganda

machinery for propaganda purposes. But, Sir, as far  as

Radio  Singapore is concerned, I ask the  Minister  for

Culture  to  read the Hansard which recorded  what  the

Prime  Minister said in 1955. I think one of the  first

matters   the  People's  Action  Party  representatives

raised in this Assembly, when they were on this side of

the Chamber, was to have Radio Malaya transferred to  a

public  corporation. I do not have the time to look  up

the  Hansard, but if the Minister for Culture looks  it

up, he can find the sort of argument the Prime Minister

put forward. He then downed the previous Government for

using Radio Malaya as a propaganda medium for the Party

in power, it is now more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>



than  2� years since the P.A.P. assumed office, and  I

have  not heard any Minister talking of Radio Singapore

being transferred to a public corporation, because  all

this  is  forgotten  so  long as  they  can  use  Radio

Singapore for P.A.P. propaganda purposes, and  so  long

as it suits their convenience.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any further speeches on this?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to stress one further

point,  Sir:  that we are not against the P.A.P. using

the  radio. But let them not make Radio Singapore  into

Radio PAP. Let them really be fair and give everybody a

chance, and on national matters like this both sides of

the picture must be presented to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the insinuation of people writing speeches

and  all that, I was in the P.A.P. for quite some time.

I  am  sure  the  Minister for Culture never  wrote  my

speeches, neither did the Minister for Home Affairs. In

fact, I did some of his speeches myself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not go into that now. It

is irrelevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will say a few words and I

will then wind up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> First of all, Sir, it is quite true

that  it is very difficult to find out where Government

propaganda  ends and where party propaganda  begins.  I

quite  concede  that. It is one of the difficulties  of

anybody  operating a propaganda machine.  But  I  would

suggest  that  we have, as far as is humanly  possible,

avoided   using  Radio  Singapore  for   purely   party

propaganda  purposes. It is obviously  a  region  where

there are borderline cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the 12 talks by the Prime Minister are

concerned, at no time was any of the talks used to  run

down  any political Party as such. The main purpose  of

the talks was to pinpoint those who are playing the pro-Communist game.

Individuals were mentioned, and  groups

associated with such individuals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



were  also  mentioned. To that extent, we contend  that

those  talks  were  of  national  importance,  and  not

intended  to put over P.A.P. propaganda. There  was  no

claim  to get the people to support the P.A.P. as such,

but  to  support  merger as such  and  to  support  the

nationalist cause as such. It might have meant to  find

out,  who  are nationalists and who are for merger.  To

that  extent,  it  was  a campaign against  anti-merger

elements or against pro-Communist elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is this. I say that the

invitation to the Member for Queens-town is still open,

and if he wants to put forward his point of view, Radio

Singapore will readily accommodate him.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Parliamentary Secretary is closely associated

with  the  Government. He is a part of the  Government.

Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries of a government

are, in fact, the managers of the civil administration.

They  are,  therefore,  the  employers  of  the  public

employees.  I would like to ask the Government  whether

it  is  right and proper that a Parliamentary Secretary

can  be  the Secretary-General of a union of their  own

employees. If an assistant manager



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



of  a company were to be the Secretary-General of  the

union  of  that  company's employees,  the  Government

would be the very first one to stand up and decry that

union   as   a  yellow  union.  The  fact   that   the

Parliamentary  Secretary is the  Secretary-General  of

A.U.P.E. makes A.U.P.E. a yellow union. What  is  more

significant is that the Secretary-General of A.U.P.E.

should  be the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry

of  Culture. What a culture! If one were to talk about

yellow  unions, then that kind of culture  is  nothing

but yellow culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Parliamentary Secretary can only owe one

loyalty,  and  that is to the Government.  I  find  it

difficult   to  describe  the  situation   where   the

Parliamentary   Secretary,  as  Secretary-General   of

A.U.P.E.,   issued  a  warning  in  the   Press   that

Government  employees may strike. Sir,  this  is  just

like  an  assistant  manager of a  company  issuing  a

warning to himself that his employees may go on strike

against himself. What a joke!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point about A.U.P.E. is that in the

Ministry  of  Culture there may be employees  who  are

members of A.U.P.E., although I hope not. If they have

a  grievance  to lay before their employer  the  boss,

they will then have to go to him, who is the Secretary-General of their union, and say, "Come on, we have  a

grievance against you. "Will you please lay it against

yourself?"    What   an   invidious    position    the

Parliamentary  Secretary would be in  should  such  a

situation arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to say much on this subject

which  leaves a very bad taste in the mouth, a subject

which can bring no credit to any man who wishes to  be

accepted   as  a  genuine  trade  union   leader.   A

Parliamentary Secretary, as I said, can only have  one

loyalty,  and  that  is to the Government.  He  cannot

pretend  to  owe  loyalty to the trade  union  of  the

Government's own employees which he claims to lead. It

is  for  the  Parliamentary Secretary to  declare  his

loyalty.  If his loyalty is to the Government,  as  it

should  be,  then  he must resign  from  the  post  of

Secretary-General of A.U.P.E. and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>



unions,  and  also as honorary adviser to other  trade

unions.  But  if he feels so strongly that  his  first

loyalty is to the trade union movement, then he cannot

and  must  not be the Parliamentary Secretary  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this matter is a simple one. It is for the

Parliamentary  Secretary  himself,  up  to   his   own

conscience,  to  decide  whether  he  wishes   to   be

Parliamentary Secretary or to be a genuine trade union

leader.  While  being  a Parliamentary  Secretary, he

should not organise unions of his own employees and of

other   employees,  and  then  for  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  in the Ministry of Labour to stand  up  and

say, "There are no P.A.P. unions."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Thomson is not

speaking. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always

thought  the  Ministry  of  Culture  deals  only  with

cultural affairs. But I understand from the Member for

Cairnhill  that  I  should be drawn into  an  argument

whether a Parliamentary Secretary can continue  to  be

an  officer of a union. If the argument put forward by

the  Member for Cairnhill is correct - that by being  a

Parliamentary Secretary there is therefore a  conflict

between   his  loyalty  to  the  Government  and   his

responsibility   as   a   trade  unionist - then   every

Assemblyman, who is a member of the Government, should

also  come  under  the  censure,  because  there   are

obviously  possibly  conflicts  of  loyalty   to   the

Government  as  such and to any outside  organisation.

whether  it  is a trade union or any other association

to  which  he  belongs. So the question, is  not  that

because he is a Parliamentary Secretary, and therefore

more  closely  associated  with  the  Government,  the

conflict  of  loyalty is more acute than when  he  was

just  an Assemblyman and Deputy Speaker. I can  assure

you that there will be no occasion when his duties  as

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture

will  conflict with his loyalty to a trade union.  But

if  it  is  true,  Sir,  that just  because  he  is  a

Parliamentary   Secretary,  his   position   is   more

invidious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



than  if  he were an Assemblyman, then the question  is

whether an Assemblyman, especially one with connections

with  the  Government, should or should not be involved

in  a trade union, because then obviously there may  be

occasions when he cannot reconcile his loyalty to  the

Government with his loyalty to the trade union.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the

Minister has got it wrong. A Parliamentary Secretary is

a  part of the Government. How can he be the Secretary-General  of a union of its own employees? So  if  there

are  grievances in, say, the Ministry of Culture,  then

members   of   A.U.P.E. will  go  to  the   Secretary-General - according to the Minister, it is not wrong  for

him  to  be the Parliamentary Secretary - and say,  "Hey,

boss,  you  as  Secretary-General go and speak  against

yourself,  and  say  we want this,  etc."  How  is  the

Parliamentary  Secretary going  to  do  his  duty?  The

Minister for Labour and Law - he is now the Minister  for

Health  and Law - in 1959 and 1960 was most critical  of

yellow  unions. Would he not describe a union  where  a

member  of  the management is leading his own employees

as the biggest yellow union, if the term "yellow union"

is not to be distorted?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Assemblyman is entirely different, Sir. An

Assemblyman can owe his position to the fact that he is

connected  with  the  trade unions,  and  that  he  got

himself elevated to the position of Assemblyman because

of  his  close connection with and his good work  among

the workers of Singapore. An Assemblyman should, as far

as  possible, know for himself what he can do and  what

he cannot do. But it does not matter, he can still lead

a trade union. But if he were to belong to the Party in

power,  then  his  position would  be  very  indivious,

because  every  time  if  he went  down  to  his  union

employees  and say. "Boys, be patient.  Do  not  be  so

fast,"  then what would the unions say? "Ah, you stooge

of  the  Government! You running dog of the Government!

Do  not come to us and talk rubbish!" Although he might

at that particular time sincerely believe that patience

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>



necessary. It would make his job more difficult.  But

for  a  Parliamentary Secretary, who is a part  of  the

Government, to  be controlling a union  of  Government

employees,  it is, I am driven to say it,  the  biggest

attempt by the P.A.P. to control its own employees,  by

saying "Shut up! Do not say too much! We are your boss,

and we also lead you!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for

Cairnhill   has  overlooked  the  provisions   of   the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance. If he  will  carefully

look  into  that  Ordinance,  he  will  see  that   the

employer, as far as the civil service is concerned,  is

the  Minister for Finance. In matters of affecting  the

civil service, he has the power to make appointments to

the panel of the Industrial Relations court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true and we concede that we

are  all  members  of  the  Government,  but  we  have

different functions.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Minister for Finance takes

responsibility for the terms and conditions of  service

of   civil   servants.   Of   course,   the   ultimate

responsibility is with the Cabinet. But the  day-to-day

affairs  of the civil service are within the  portfolio

of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Culture is concerned, we were very particular, when

this appointment was made, to ensure that he was not in

any way connected with any department of the government

where it could be said that he was placed in a position

where  there  could  be a conflict  of  loyalties.  For

instance, he was not put in the Deputy Prime Minister's

Ministry.  The  reason is that we  all  know  that  the

Amalgamated   Union   of   Public   Employees   is   an

amalgamation   of   certain  Government   unions.   The

important  Government unions that form the amalgamation

are  the  union of postal clerks and the union  of  the

uniformed  postal staff. So it would  have  been  quite

improper  if  the  Member for Kampong  Kapor  had  been

placed  in  the  position  of being  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to, the Deputy Prime Minister  whose  portfolio covers the postal department. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



he  is  tucked  away  now in the Ministry  of  Culture,

having  nothing to do with the organisations of  public

employees  in  their relationship to the  work  of  the

Ministries  where  they  are  employed.  So  that,  Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  we  submit that  this  appointment  was

properly   made,  and  there  can  be   no   suggestion

whatsoever  that, because the Member for Kampong  Kapor

is the Secretary-General of A.U.P.E. and he is also the

Parliamentary  Secretary of the  Ministry  of  Culture,

this  is  a  case  where  a  member  of  the  Board  of

Management  is  also on the Executive  Committee  of  a

union. That is not the case, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  the

Member for Cairnhill knows that very well.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I know other things very well

too.  Take  the case of .A.U.P.E. There was trouble  in

the  Health  Ministry  between  the  Singapore  Medical

Workers' Union and A.U.P.E. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is this relevant to the issue we

are discussing?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is. If I can crave your

indulgence,  you  will find there is a  meaning  to  my

words here. There was a ballot. The medical workers won

the  ballot. Therefore, they should be recognised,  and

they have been recognised by the previous Minister  for

Health  as  the only union to represent the workers  in

the  Health Ministry. The then Minister for Labour  and

Law  came along. He felt that because A.U.P.E. was led

by a Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, he also was in

the  invidious  position  of having  to  slap  his  own

colleague.  He  said that A.U.P.E. could  also  collect

subscriptions. That nearly caused another strike by the

Singapore Medical Workers' Union. Fortunately,  he  saw

the  error of his ways. He said, "All right, since  the

S.M.W.U. is the legally recognised union for employees

in the Health Ministry, therefore, A.U.P.E. should have

nothing  to  do with it." All these things are  putting

the  Parliamentary Secretary himself and  the  Minister

and  the whole Government in an invidious position. The

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



says  he has found nothing. I am not worried about what

the   Government  think,  because  we  know  what   the

Government think. They want to control the unions.  But

as one trade unionist to another trade unionist, Sir, I

say  this to the Parliamentary Secretary, that you  can

only  owe  one loyalty, that you cannot owe loyalty  to

both,  and they are conflicting interests. It is up  to

the man himself to declare his stand. But if he were to

say  that he can still be Parliamentary Secretary  and

continue to be Secretary-General of a union of his  own

employees, then I, for one, would begin  to  lose  alt

respect I have for a trade union leader.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has

misunderstood the dispute between the Medical  Workers'

Union  and the A.U.P.E. It is true there was  a  ballot

taken.  There  was intense trade union rivalry  between

these two organisations. Following on the result of the

ballot.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Woodhull - he was at  that

time in the Health Ministry - issued instructions to  say

that the union which won the ballot should be given the

exclusive  right  to  collect union subscriptions.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  all know that a  ballot  determines

recognition  of  a union. The winner  of  a  ballot  is

recognised by the employer. Every employer is so bound,

and the Government as an employer is equally bound. But

in  this  case Mr Woodhull went further than that.  He

said  he  would give the union the exclusive  right  to

collect  subscriptions. If I am a worker,  I  have  the

right to pay my subscription to the union of my choice.

Who   is  Woodhull  to  compel  a  worker  to  pay  his

subscriptions  to a particular union? That  was  wrong.

And  when  that came to my notice, I, as the  Minister,

had  to do something about it. First of all, I proposed

that  we  would see what we could do to  come  to  some

arrangement. We would give equal facilities to  collect

union  subscriptions to both unions.  But  the  Medical

Workers' Union disliked it. They said they would want a

ballot  to be held again. That was the proper thing  to

do,  Mr  Speaker,  because in the ballot  the  Medical

Department  did not extend the ballot to the  employees

of Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Woodbridge Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



If  a  ballot  were to be taken of the  whole  of  the

medical  service,  the ballot should  be  taken  right

through the service. But for some reason or other,  in

the  ballot,  Tan  Tock Seng and Woodbridge  Hospitals

were  excluded. However, the A.U.P.E. would not  agree

to  the holding of another ballot. The matter has been

put  right  by  granting  the  union  which  has  been

recognised  in  a  particular  establishment  all  the

facilities  for  collecting subscriptions  from  those

employees  who  are working in that establishment  and

denying  those facilities to the rival union which  is

not  recognised. That is how a solution was found. But

the principle remains that we could not give any union

the exclusive right to collect subscriptions. That was

the  point at issue in the dispute between the Medical

Workers' Union and A.U.P.E. Surely the Ministry cannot

be accused of playing politics in this matter now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Minister  for Health and Law has seen fit  to  discuss

the  whole  issue again, I think I am the only  Member

left in this House who knows the exact facts that  led

to this ballot. The argument in the beginning was that

A.U.P.E. represented Woodbridge Hospital, and that the

Medical  Workers'  Union  represented  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.  Each had the exclusive right of  collecting

trade union dues in their own sphere of influence.  In

the other hospitals we were not very sure whether this

union or that union would have the majority of workers

supporting them, and therefore a ballot was taken.  It

was  mutually agreed upon that the ballot should  only

concern  hospitals other than Woodbridge Hospital  and

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital, and that the results  of  the

ballot  would  give  whichever  union  that  won   the

exclusive  right they had enjoyed hitherto  in  either

Woodbridge Hospital or Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  It  so

transpired,  Sir, that originally A.U.P.E. represented

Woodbridge Hospital and the Singapore Medical Workers'

Union represented Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and each had

the exclusive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



right  of  collecting dues in the respective hospital.

Therefore,  when the ballot was held and  the  results

made  known, naturally the Singapore Medical  Workers'

Union  which had won then had the exclusive  right  of

collecting  membership  dues from  all  the  hospitals

except  Woodbridge  Hospital.  These  conditions  were

agreed  between the two unions before the  ballot  was

taken  and  I was one of the persons involved  in  the

meeting that resulted in this ballot.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill  has been speaking about A.U.P.E. and  about

myself  on  three or four occasions and  I  have  been

wondering  what are the motives or objectives  of  his

attacks. But I think today he has made it quite clear.

He  has  suggested that I should resign not only  from

A.U.P.E. but  also from the advisership  of  several

unions.  Sir,  this is the crux of  the  problem.  The

United  Workers  in  the  Petroleum  Industry  is  the

amalgamation  of  two  unions  and  the   Member   for

Cairnhill  has  very great interest in  one  of  these

unions -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not going to allow this

debate  to  range  over  all  these  disputes  between

advisers and so on and so forth. The Member for Cairn-hill  has  raised  an issue. It is whether  or  not  a

Parliamentary  Secretary  should  be  the   Secretary-General  of a union of Government employees.  That  is

all.  I did suggest that mention of this ballot  would

take  the debate out of the issue, but the Member  for

Cairnhill was certain in his mind that it was relevant

and  I  allowed it. I will not allow the debate to  go

further than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill has had the advantage of saying many things,

and  I  bow to your ruling. If I cannot explain  about

the  other  unions, I shall not be able to answer  the

points raised. However. I shall abide by your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain here that the Permanent Secretary

of  each Ministry is the only person who has the right

to  hire  and  fire.  It is not the  Minister  or  the

Parliamentary Secretary. If there is any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>



dispute  between the workers and the head of department

in  any Ministry, it is the Permanent Secretary of that

Ministry  who  has the final say. If he cannot  resolve

it, then it is the Public Service Commission, which has

fuller  powers.  It is not the Parliamentary  Secretary

nor  the Minister. If tomorrow a peon or a clerk in the

Ministry of Culture is disciplined, that issue  is  not

raised  with  the Minister for Culture; neither  is  it

raised  with  me.  It  is  raised  with  the  Permanent

Secretary and only he can take a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for a union becoming P.A.P. or otherwise, the

Secretary-General is one among so many members  of  the

Executive  Council.  In A.U.P.E.,  Sir,  there  are  48

members in the Executive Council. The Secretary-General

is  one of 48. It is the majority of the 48 that  will

make  decisions on the policies of the union. It  might

be  interesting to mention here that several members of

the  Executive Council of this Union are  members,  and

active  members, of U.M.N.O. Indeed, Sir, the President

of the Union was, in the opinion of the Member for Hong

Lim  when he was Mayor in 1958, a S.P.A. member. Is the

Member for Cairnhill saying that all these people  have

now become P.A.P. men?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I do not know who the President of

this Union is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Sir, I shall explain it for the

benefit  of  the Member for Hong Lim. The City  Council

Services  Union had a dispute with the  Mayor  at  that

time.  They  appealed  to  the  T.U.C. and  I  led   a

delegation to see the Mayor and it was -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not have all the details.

I  think the Member for Hong Lim would like the name of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>



President  to  see  whether  he  can  remember  him,  I

suppose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> The name of the President, Sir, is Mak

Kum Heng. I think that will register -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first

time  I  hear  that  Mak  Kum  Heng  has  been  closely

associated with the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> So be it, Sir, if his memory is that

short.  Sir,  the  decision whether  a  man  remains  a

Secretary-General of his union or not is dependent upon

his  membership. Indeed, Sir, the more the  Member  for

Cairnhill  attacks A.U.P.E., the more members  seem  to

join  A.U.P.E.  I  think the final decision,  in  fact,

rests  with  the  members and not with the  Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am the Minister

for Culture and, sorry to say, I could not quite follow

the  intricate  arguments going on  for  the  last  few

minutes. It reminds me, if I may say so, of the  Polish

painter  who  was  asked  to  write  an  essay  on  the

elephant.  Instead of writing about  the  elephant,  he

said,  "Before I can write about the elephant, let  me

start  with the Polish question." Similarly, I  suspect

that this particular post of Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Culture has been made an  opportunity

for ventilating an old trade union vendetta.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me say this about the duties of the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture.

They  are quite plain. They include, as the Member  for

Thom, son  said,  keeping an eye on newspapers,  Radio

Singapore,  printing, the National  Theatre,  attending

shows  that I cannot attend. So I cannot see  which  of

these  duties conflicts in any way with his trade union

activities.  I can assure the hon. Member that  as  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture - not  as the Parliamentary Secretary as such - his duties

conflict in no way with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



his   trade  union  activities.  Therefore,  all  these

interesting  arguments about the  various  trade  union

disputes and so on have nothing to do with the question

before  us, whether, as the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Culture, his duties in the  Ministry

conflict  with his activities as a trade  unionist.  In

any   case,  as  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Culture, his duties are simple.  As  has

been  explained,  he  carries out  the  duties  of  the

Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of  Culture.  I

can  assure the Member for Cairnhill and others that  I

have  nothing to do with trade unions. Occasionally,  I

do  transmit any statement that comes from the Ministry

of  Labour about trade union matters. Beyond  that,  my

Parliamentary Secretary and myself have nothing  to  do

with trade union matters as such.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, carrying a little further

the  point made just now by the Parliamentary Secretary

when  he said that the man who finally hires and  fires

an  employee  is  the  Permanent  Secretary,  and  that

neither  the  Minister nor his Parliamentary  Secretary

has  anything  to  do  with it.  I  would  like  to  be

enlightened by him, whether, in his opinion, a Minister

can  also be a Secretary-General of a union; and if  he

cannot  be  one,  how  is  it  that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  can  be one, and why the difference  between

the two?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir,I have made the point just now, that

as  far as the civil service is concerned, the Minister

responsible is the Minister for Finance, and it  is  so

laid  down  in the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  The

Cabinet  has a collective responsibility no doubt,  but

the  Parliamentary Secretary is not  a  member  of  the

Cabinet.  In  any case, the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Culture is not in any way  concerned

with  the terms of employment of officers in the  civil

service. That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, I thought I had made myself

clear.  I said that I was amplifying upon the statement

made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Culture  when  he  stated that  neither  Ministers  nor

Parliamentary Secretaries had anything to do  with  the

hiring  and  firing of the staff, and that therefore  a

Parliamentary  Secretary may become a Secretary-General

of  a  union. Following his own enunciation, I was only

asking  him whether a Minister can also be a Secretary-General. I was awaiting his answer. I just seek  to  be

enlightened on a statement made by him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The point of order I want to raise

is  that the question put by the Member for Nee Soon is

purely  hypothetical and therefore it is out of  order.

It does not call for a reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister is misreading his

Standing Orders. Hypothetical propositions are  put  in

debate. It is only during Question Time that no  Member

may raise a hypothetical question.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now very,

very  clear  from  the course of the debate  that  the

Government  maintains that one of its own Parliamentary

Secretaries -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To the Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - can be a Secretary-General of a

union of its own employees. We say it is wrong. We  say

that  would  make the union concerned  a  yellow  union

inasmuch  as the Government or the Minister for  Labour

would  describe  a  trade union  led  by  an  assistant

manager  of a company as a yellow union. We say  it  is

wrong for a Parliamentary Secretary to lead a union  of

the  Government's own employees. If they  say  that  is

right, there is no more to be said about it other  than

for you to put the question, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the sum to be allocated for Head

49  be reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead

1."

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr S. T. Bani.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political)

for  whom the post was created when the P.A.P. came

into  power  resigned in October 1959.  Since  then

this  post  has been kept vacant. A  lot  was  said

during the debate last year and I do not propose at

this juncture to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



more  than to ask the Minister whether he wants  to

keep  this post in his Ministry and whether he  has

hopes of filling it.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for

this  post was explained in the Budget debate  last

year.  The reason still stands, but may I indicate,

Sir,  that  there is some difficulty about  filling

the  post, not because we cannot get qualified  men

but  because it is a political post? Perhaps by the

end of this year if we do not get it filled, then I

think we will have to abolish it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, if we do not get it filled,

then  it  will  not be shown in next year's  Budget

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, from the reply of the

Minister, it would seem that he wants to keep  this

post  until the end of 1962. May I remind him  that

in the debate last year, he said that this post was

fixed  at  $1,400 as against $1,100  for  Political

Secretary, because it was a special post  requiring

the    services   of   a   person   with    special

qualifications.  Therefore,  it  was   $300   more.

Political  Secretaries  now  have  their   salaries

jacked  up  to  $1,350, and  when  I  queried  this

increase, in comparing this salary with that of the

Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political), the  Prime

Minister mentioned in this House that there was  no

need  to  fill  this post. Now, who  gives  us  the

correct  version, Sir? The Prime  Minister  or  the

Minister for Culture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know whether it was in

the  Chamber that the Prime Minister said there was

no need to fill the post.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is why the salary of this

post was not jacked up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No. The post could not be filled.

We  have been trying for the last one year or so to

fill  it.  If  by  the next Budget  we  cannot  get

anybody to fill it, then I think there is not  much

point in retaining this particular post,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



though the need for it is still more evident than

it was last year, because we are having other

facilities and instruments of propaganda, such as

television and so on, and the need for an officer

of this calibre is necessary. But if we cannot get

him, then I think we will have to dispense with

such a post. But I cannot recollect, Sir, whether

the Prime Minister said there was no need for this

post and indicated that it was to be struck off.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> As far as my memory goes, Sir,

he  did  say that that was why it was not necessary

to  adjust  the  difference between the  salary  of

Political Secretaries and that of Publicity Liaison

Secretary (Political).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in view of the assurance of the Minister that

if  he could not find anyone for this post he would

advise its deletion at the end of the year,  I  beg

leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have already indicated that if a

Member  wishes  to ask for leave  to  withdraw,  he

should not preface his request with a speech.  That

is  why  I am hesitating to ask for leave.  Anybody

who wishes to speak, may speak.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is more likely, Sir, that the

Prime Minister might have said that, in view of the

fact  that the post had not been filled, there  was

no  need to make the necessary adjustments. I might

be  wrong,  because  both of  us  may  be  hard  of

hearing.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now then, does the Member ask for

leave to withdraw?

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49

be reduced by $10 in respect of item (34) of

subhead 1.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, item (34) concerns News, item (40) Publicity, item (82) Broadcasting, item (102)

Programmes; subhead 10 deals with News Services,

subhead 14 Civics Programmes - I am sorry, I will not

touch on amendment (20), subhead 14 - subhead 15 Main

tenance of Publicity Equipment, and item (1) of

subhead 16 Photographic Services. All these

facilities, Sir, I claim, have been misused. The

Ministry of Culture exists with the aim of building

a Malayan nation, fostering and promoting Malayan

culture, to foster good relations among the

different races, and to inform the public of Government's policy. How have these been carried out,

Sir? How successful have these been? What have they

achieved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is supposed to be a public

relations organ of the Government and, as I have

said before, to promote good relations and under

standing between the Government and the public.

Now, are the current events, like the picketing of

the Chinese School students a sign of good

relations and understanding? I know the students'

picketing arose from an educational issue. There is

no doubt about it. But it is the duty of the

Ministry of Culture to bring Government policy to

the public so that the public understand and

appreciate it enough not to create trouble over the

misunderstanding. I am sure there is a lot of

misunderstanding in the Chinese educational system

of 4-2. As I have said before, I myself

misunderstood it until I had a chat with the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education. I now see the point. I do not know

enough of Chinese education to say whether I

support it or not. But I know what I used to think

of it before. I was ignorant, and so were the

student picketers. Probably they too are thinking

the wrong way, as I used to think. Has it been

brought to their notice? Have the public been

convinced of the 4-2 system? When I was speaking to

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education, Sir, there were a few guests there. They

themselves learned a new thing. When I said, "Is

that so", I was not the only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



one  to  say  that. My voice was echoed by  several

guests  there. It just shows, Sir, that the  public

do not know what is the real principle behind the 4-2  system.  It is the Ministry of Culture  that  is

responsible for bringing Government policy  to  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same with the People's Association. If the

People's  Association exists for the  good  of  the

public,  again I say it is the duty of the Ministry

of  Culture to bring that to the public. But as  it

is,  there is trouble there. And the Work  Brigade.

And as mentioned just now, P.A.P. unions versus non-P.A.P. unions. If there is no such thing as P.A.P.

unions  versus non-P.A.P. unions, then  why  should

the public say so? What has the Ministry of Culture

done  to see that if it is not so, then the  public

understand it is not so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Sir, I claim the Ministry of Culture

has  failed in its duties. What it has done has not

been to bring Government policy to the public,  but

to glorify P.A.P. Members and Ministers -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was afraid that might come

out.  I think we have had enough of debate on Radio

Singapore,  Radio  P.A.P., and  all  that  sort  of

thing. The hon. Member has been in order up to now,

but  if  she  carries on and attacks the Government

for  making these services the instruments of party

propaganda,   then  I  think  she  has   lost   the

opportunity. We had a debate on that.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just

point  out  that  in amendment (22)  [item  (1)  of

subhead 16], under Photographic Services, I believe

there  is  a  vote of $100,000 for Film production?

May  I touch on that? It is the same argument, that

the  money  spent  on filming is not  to  show  Gov

ernment's policy to the public. I do not know  what

they  intend to do this time, but the last  time  I

believe $200,000 was paid to Cathay Organisation to

film  Ministers  using the changkol,  sweeping  the

streets,  cleaning - I  do  not  remember - maybe   not

cleaning  the  drains  because  they  do  not  like

cleaning drains or such things -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It was the wrong film!

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> There was a film, Mr

Speaker, and thousands and thousands of dollars was

spent  on that. It was shown to Assemblymen. I  was

there  at one of the filmings. Sir, at a time  when

there  were  enough workers to clean  the  streets,

when  the  workers were functioning quite normally,

Ministers,  who were paid over $3,000 each  by  the

public,  swept  the  streets and  changkolled  when

there  were labourers to do those jobs.  Yet  at  a

time,  when  there was a strike and  the  whole  of

Singapore was filthy, the Ministers did not go  out

to  clean  the streets. I am not maintaining,  Sir,

that  it  is  the  Ministers'  duty  to  clean  the

streets. Far from it. We do not pay street-sweepers

$3,000-odd each. Oh, no, I am not maintaining that.

But  following the point of argument that Ministers

should   he  filmed  cleaning  streets  and   using

changkols  and  clearing dumps  or  stones  on  the

roads, Sir, the proper time to do it is when it  is

needed. At least if they had filmed that and  said,

"Well, you see, when Singapore needed cleaning,  we

ourselves went out and cleaned it," probably  there

is  justice in that. I am not saying that Ministers

must  clean  the streets, but I do say  that  since

they  did sweep the streets, they should sweep them

when  it  was  necessary and not  when  there  were

labourers to do it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand, Sir, that we are

taking a few items together

amendments (7), (8), (11) and (12). I  wish to

speak on amendment (11)*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See footnote at col. 2014.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the best way to do it is

confine ourselves to the two issues raised  by  the

Member  for  Mountbatten - firstly, whether  or  not

Government policy is being brought to the notice of

the  public  sufficiently through these media,  and

secondly, whether it is right that photographs  be

taken of Ministers sweeping the streets. Those  are

the two issues. Perhaps the Member will confirm it.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



6.30 p, m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Those are the two issues. Later

on,  I  will  ask  the  hon. Member  to  move  the

amendments so that that could open up a debate  on

item (82) . Mrs Seow.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, it is not only sweeping

the   streets  to  glorify  Ministers  and  P.A.P.

Assemblymen.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Shall we deal with these two

issues? Mr Rajaratnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had some

difficulty  in following the point the Member  for

Mountbatten was trying to put across. What  I  can

understand  is that, unlike the Barisan  Sosialis,

she  believed that the Government should  not  use

the  media of propaganda to put forward any  point

of  view. The Member for Mountbatten chided us for

not  having  put  forward more explanations  about

Chinese   education   and   about   the   People's

Association.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> The Government's point of

view.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, the Government's point of

view. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the question  of

Chinese   education  is  concerned,   a   lot   of

statements  issued  by the Ministry  of  Education

were  put  over  the radio. These were  discussed.

There were statements by the various Parliamentary

Secretaries,  long  statements  read  over   Radio

Singapore. Though the Member for Mountbatten takes

a  great interest in radio, I suspect she does not

listen to enough of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards glorifying the Ministers, I would

like  to  say  that, in fact, I did  read  out  an

extract from the Straits Times last time in  which

they   indicated  their  disappointment  that   we

produced  a  film where, unlike previous  regimes,

the  Ministers  were  not  glorified  at  all.  We

probably  shot  a  short scene showing,  I  think,

Ministers  digging trenches and  levelling  roads.

But  I  can  assure you that one of  the  standing

instructions  in  making  films  is  not  to  show

Ministers in it. This year, for example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  we  have produced seven films in the  series,

"People's  Singapore". One of the  things  we  tell

them  is that, unless it is of specific importance,

Ministers  should not appear in the films.  But  if

the  film needs a particular scene of a school, and

if  a  Minister has made a statement about schools,

then he

might  be shown in a short flash. But by and large,

out of the thousands of feet of film that have been

shown,  very  few Ministers have appeared.  If  the

Member  for  Mountbatten and any  other  Opposition

Member would like to spend, say, six hours and  run

through  all the seven films that we have produced,

they  will  see very few shots of Ministers.  I  am

quite  prepared to take the Member for  Mountbatten

along and show her that one of our instructions  is

that  we do not want Ministers in the films. People

do  get tired seeing Ministers doing this and  that

in films.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked, in a very broad sense, about the

misuse of propaganda media. These include the  News

Division, the News Services and so on. All  she  in

dicated  was that we have not given the problem  of

Chinese  education  and  the  People's  Association

enough play over the radio. We feel that enough  of

it  has  been  said. If the Member for  Mountbatten

would  like to look at some of the scripts, she  is

quite welcome to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

arguing  over  the amount. I say the  Ministry  has

failed to achieve what it has set out to achieve-to

make the public understand Government policy enough

to  appreciate it. The fact that trouble has broken

out  in  the quarters that I have mentioned - I  will

not  repeat it - shows that the attempt to  make  the

public understand has

failed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I make the procedure clear to

the   Member   for  Queenstown?  The   Member   for

Mountbatten, in moving amendment (7), has indicated

that she wishes to speak generally on

amendments (8), (11), (12), (19), (21),



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



and  (22). That, I take it, is correct. The  Member

for  Queenstown  has indicated that  he  wishes  to

speak  on  amendment (11). If what the  Member  for

Queenstown  wishes to speak an item (82),  that  is

amendment  (11), covers the aspects raised  by  the

Member  for  Mountbatten  - first,  that  Government

policy  is not being put over sufficiently  to  the

people via these media, and secondly; that the vote

on  filming is being used for the glorification  of

Ministers  and P.A.P. members, then  he  can  speak

now.  But if he wishes to speak on another,  aspect

of  item (82), then he will have to depend  on  the

Member  for  Mountbatten whether or  not  she  will

move, at the proper time, amendment (11).



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

said all that I wanted to say, but for the sake  of

democracy, I think -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member should wait her

turn. We have other amendments intervening. We  are

on amendment (7). Does the Member want a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, Sir. I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (8)* is not being moved.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (41) of  subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item 41 is in respect of a new post of

Publicity Editor for the Publicity Division. As far

as I can see from the Estimates before me, Sir, the

Publicity Division has only one person so far,  and

he  is  the  Head.  He is the head  of  a  division

without  the arms and the legs to run the division.

It  is  felt  that the Publicity Editor  should  be

created,  I  think, to help him.  May  I  know  the

duties of the Publicity Editor vis-a-vis the  Head?

Is there no duplication?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a new

post  created to meet not so much the expansion  of

the  Ministry  as  such but of the  particular  Publicity  Division, where so far the  Head  has  been

doing work such as sorting out photographs, writing

captions for photographs, going through manuscripts

and  pamphlets and so on, when, in fact, he should

not be concerned with this routine secretarial job,

but should be concerned more with co-ordination  of

the  various publicity media under his control.  In

view of that, it was felt that the Publicity Editor

would relieve him of the secretarial jab of reading

proofs,  containing captions to photographs,  doing

lay-outs   for   posters  and  so   on.   But   the

qualifications required of the Editor would be that

he  is  either a university graduate or he  has  experience in journalism.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, from the reply of the

Minister,  it  would appear that the  Head  of  the

Publicity Division has been sorting out photographs

and  writing captions for photographs.  Because  he

has  no, arms and legs, therefore, he has to do all

those  things. In order to help him do this sorting

out  of  photographs  and writing  of  captions,  a

Publicity  Editor is now required. Is it  necessary

to  have  one  so high just to sort out photographs

and write captions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Cairnhill

misunderstood   me.  The  Head  of  the   Publicity

Division  was  doing this job in  addition  to  his

normal job. The Publicity Editor would not only  be

writing  captions  but he would also  be  producing

material  and  so on under direction,  leaving  the

Head  to do his own work. The Head is in charge  of

not  only  publicity but also  of  such  things  as

tourism, cultural matters, the Aneka Ragarn Raayat.

All  these  come  under him. The  Publicity  Editor

will,  therefore, relieve him of many  of  the  edi

torial tasks which' he now undertakes and which, we

feel, is a little bit too much for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said what I wanted to say,. Sir, except

that  it  has been repeated again that I said  that

the  Ministry  of Culture has not given  sufficient

publicity.  I  repeat that I  did  not  say  "sufficient".   I  said  they  have  failed  to   promote

understanding  between  the  Government   and   the

people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

refer to the Head of the Broadcasting Division.  We

in  the Barisan Sosialis recently received a letter

from  him. Before I go further, let it not be  said

that  it  is  a personal attack on him,  because  I

would  be  the  first to congratulate  him  on  his

recent promotion. But the whole wording of his  let

ter  to  us had a political overtone. I thought  it

would  be  to  his disadvantage as a civil  servant

that  he should be under pressure from the Minister

to such, an extent. I will just quote one sentence:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is more illuminating [he is asking us to

attend a forum. Sir] to hear impromptu exchanges in

discussion  than to listen to the  reading  out  of

long  prepared statements with no relevance to  the

subjects people are interested in.'

<br><br>Sir,  for  a civil servant to utter such sentiments

is  definitely uncalled for. As representatives  of

the people, we can definitely tell him that we know

what  are the things people are interested  in  and

what  are the things which are relevant. I  do  not

think  a  civil servant will dispute that.  If  the

Head of the Broadcasting Division had been fair  in

his reporting, Sir, he would have given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>



us the chance and given us enough publicity so that

people  would have known our viewpoint. But  for  a

civil  servant to speak like that, it is, first  of

all,  an  insult to Assemblymen. I may even venture

to  say, Sir, that it is partially an insult to the

Speaker  himself, because you rule on our  speeches

here  and it is absolutely not in order for anybody

outside to say that our speeches are irrelevant.  I

would -

<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Does the sentence in that

letter relate specifically to what happened in this

Chamber? Because if it is, I would like a copy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, it is in the letter

from Radio Singapore. This is addressed to me and I

am  sure copies must have been addressed to Mr  A.

P. Rajah and Mr Ong Eng Guan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the letter handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we can say

with, any certainty that paragraph 3 refers to what

happened  in the Assembly at all. I think the  hon.

Member should read paragraph 3 in toto. It is up to

the  Speaker to decide whether or not it  does,  in

fact, refer to something said in this Assembly.  If

it  does, then, of course, there is prima  facie  a

breach of privilege, because there seems to be

an  indirect criticism of the Chair. But looking at

it,   there  does  not  seem  to  be  any  specific

reference to what happened in this Chamber. Perhaps

the Member could read the whole of paragraph 3 for

the record.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The relevant paragraph reads

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The radio can help to clarify the viewpoints of

the  respective political parties and bring out the

truth  regarding the proposals for  merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation. Informal discussions

in  which  members  of  the  Forum  freely  express

themselves on

relevant points put to them by the audience

can do much to put the truth before the people. It

is  more  illuminating to hear impromptu exchanges

in discussion than to listen to the reading out of

long prepared statements with

no relevance to the subjects people are interested

in.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you say, Sir, it could be interpreted that they

have  no  relevance to what has  happened  in  this

Chamber. But as you must have known, Sir, the Prime

Minister  spoke so much about it and even  the  Minister for Culture only a little while ago said  the

same  thing,  and this has particular reference  to

what has happened in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member  can make that allegation. If he  wishes  to

make that allegation, then, I think the proper  way

is  to  move a motion that there is prima  facie  a

breach of privilege and then that motion under  our

Standing  Orders will be referred to the  Committee

of  Privileges. He could move that tomorrow  if  he

wishes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not prepares to go so far,

Sir, because it is a waste of time. Actually -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If what the hon. Member says

is  correct, it is not a waste of time because  the

Speaker  is the guardian of the privileges  of  the

Assembly  and  any criticism of any action  of  the

Chair  is  a criticism of the Assembly as  a  whole

and, therefore, it is a matter of some seriousness.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you allow me, Sir, I may

consider  this point and later on bring it  forward

again.  But  in  the meanwhile, I will  just  touch

lightly on

the  matter and say that if it is a case of wanting

the  truth to be out, then it is only fair that the

radio  should give a very fair report of  all  that

has happened !in this Assembly, instead of giving a

one-sided version over Radio P.A.P. But for a civil

servant  to be pressured by the Minister  to  write

things  like that - you see, Sir, we understand  the

position  and we are not blaming the civil  servant

at  all. We know what is exactly happening. Let  it

be clearly understood that when we say these things

at  the  present moment, it is not that we want  to

attack  the  civil servants. We are  attacking  the

Ministers   behind   those  civil   servants,   the

Ministers  who  force these civil  servants  to  do

things which they normally would never want to  do.

As everybody knows, we agree with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>

principle,  which  the Prime Minister  himself  has

enunciated,  that  the  civil  service  should   be

neutral  and not only be neutral, Sir, but also  be

very  polite;  and in the writing of  any  letters,

politeness should be the keynote with the civil ser

vants. That was one of the points raised yesterday,

Sir,  about  the  Central  Complaints  Bureau.  The

discourtesy of civil servants was at one  time  the

main  complaint of P.A.P. Assemblymen and branches.

This led to the formation of the Central Complaints

Bureau. Therefore, if civil servants write letters,

let  the  Ministers behind them not force  them  to

write  letters  that  may be  construed  that  they

themselves   are  entering  the  political   arena.

Because  if  any civil servant should go  into  the

political  arena, then he would have  to  take  the

consequences. I am sure the Minister would not like

that  to happen. I hope the Minister will bear this

in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was wondering, Sir, whether it will

be  convenient  now for me to move amendment  (13)*

in  my name because the basic issue involved is the

same.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*Amendment (13) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (103) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. I think we will have to wait,

unless there is going to be an attack on the holder

of  the  post of Assistant Head. But if the  Member

for  Thomson  is  going to speak on  the  principle

whether  a  civil servant should be  courteous  and

should not be guilty of apparently taking sides  in

a political issue, then he can speak now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not going to speak on the

principle  of  the civil servants taking  sides  so

early  in  the  day.  Since  it  has  already  been

mentioned that the holder of this post had given  a

series  of talks on merger, I have nothing more  to

say  on  the post. I would just like to  follow  up

what  the  Member for Queenstown has  said  on  the

principle  of  a  civil  servant  taking  sides  in

political issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not like the P.A.P. Ministers who at

one  time  took  pride  and went  about  arrogantly

warning the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



civil  servants. Sir, we realise that the  majority

of  the people in the civil service are working for

their  living.  In  so  far  as  their  duties  are

concerned,  they  want to carry  them  out  to  the

satisfaction   of   the   people   in   government,

irrespective of what political Party is in  office.

But,  Sir, we are disturbed to note that there  are

one  or two here and there who, so to say,  bend

backwards  to  please the Ministers. Sir,  we  feel

that  to  some extent it is understandable where  a

civil  servant  is  told to write  letters  with  a

certain   amount  of  political  overtone,  putting

forward  the views of the Party in power. But  when

it  comes to a civil servant who, as I  said,  bends

backwards  to  please the Ministers in  office  and

performs functions for which he is not in the first

place  paid,  and, secondly, performs duties  which

are  in  contradiction  to  the  governing  General

Orders  which  are  binding  on his  conditions  of

service, then we feel it is time that we tell  such

civil  servants in quite plain and simple  language

that  the P.A.P. Government is not going to  be  in

office for ever and ever -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not the line of

approach. Let us go on to the principle of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did point out, Sir, that I am not

going to take the sort of line the P.A.P. Ministers

took before the elections. Nevertheless, I feel  it

is  important  that  members of the  civil  service

ought  to  realise that no matter what pressure  is

applied  by  those in power, they have a  duty  and

they will be within their rights in performing this

duty  and be neutral and non-political. All that  I

want  to  say is this, Sir, that we do not want  to

see civil servants performing P.A.P. functions.  We

do  not  want to see P.A.P. Ministers hiding behind

the  civil servants and letting the civil  servants

carry  out P.A.P. propaganda. Sad will be  the  day

for  the  individual civil servants who risk  their

necks in bending backwards to please the Ministers.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chua Kang) (In Mandarin):

Just  now  my colleague pointed out that the  civil

service  must keep its neutrality. Now  I  want  to

stress  specially that the Head of the Broadcasting

Division  should  keep his neutrality  because  the

radio  broadcast cannot only be heard by the people

here  but can also be heard by the people in Malaya

and the whole of South-East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to raise one point. On Sunday, there

was  a radio programme reviewing the debate in this

House  on merger. But in this review, the views  of

the Barisan Sosialis were unfairly treated. As Head

of  the  Broadcasting Division, he  should  comment

fairly  on  the  whole  debate  and  other  affairs

conducted in this House. He should not be one-sided

and   in   favour  of  the  Party  in  power.   The

commentator was, as far as I know, the Head of  the

News  Division,  Li  Vei-Chen.  The  Head  of   the

Broadcasting  Division  must  try  to  avoid   this

situation;  otherwise, the neutrality of Government

servants  will  not be maintained. I  do  not  know

whether  it was the Government's directive  to  the

Head of the Broadcasting Division t, allow the Head

of  the News Division to make such an unfair review

of  the debate which was broadcast to the people of

Singapore  and  the Federation. Therefore,  I  hope

that   in  future  the  Head  of  the  Broadcasting

Division  should not make any unfair  criticism  or

comments  on the debate in the Assembly, especially

on the merger question.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice one

thing. When it comes to debating subjects like  the

radio and films, vague general statements are  made

like  "The Ministry has failed." What are the facts

on  which  you form that opinion? If you  just  say

that  the moon is made of cheese, you will have  to

give  a reason for saying so. Similarly, the Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang says that the  report  of  the

merger

debate  over the radio last Sunday was  unfair  and

unjust.  Why? Where was it unfair and unjust?  What

is the point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>



that  should have been put over and which was  not

put  over?  In what way was there a distortion  of

what was said in the Assembly? It is not enough to

say  that  it is unfair and unjust. So unless  and

until he can say, "This is unjust because this  is

what  was  said. This is not what we said  in  the

Assembly."  Or,  "It is unjust and unfair  because

very  material  points, such as these,  have  been

left out."



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Not from the Minister but

from the Member for Choa Chu Kang.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Lady is too late.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, on what the Minister

has  raised. He says the Member for Choa Chu  Kang

has  not brought up any constructive criticism  of

how  it is unfair. I may be mistaken, but I  think

the  Member  did say - the Member can clarify  this - that  the announcer made his own comments on  what

had  happened here. Did he say that the  announcer

should  not  make  his own comments  on  what  had

happened  here?  Is he accusing the  announcer  of

having introduced his own opinion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether the Minister

can answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, the announcer makes a

commentary on the Assembly debates. If we have  to

telescope  proceedings which took many hours  into

half an hour or twenty minutes, obviously the  man

who  wrote the report has to make his comments  to

say that during the course of the debate there was

strong  opposition  from the Barisan  Sosialis  on

such  and  such a point. It is a summary  and,  to

that  extent, it is a comment and no reporter  can

ever  write  a commentary without introducing  his

personality  into it. There was a summary  of  the

two weeks' debate on merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to the more interesting point about the

criticism   directed  against  the  Head   of   the

Broadcasting  Division, I am glad  the  Member  for

Queenstown has indicated that it was not  the  Head

of the Broadcasting Division who wrote the letters.

In fact, the letters did make it clear. I have some

copies here and one of the early letters reads,  'I

am directed by the Minister to refer to your letter

...'.  This referred to the invitation to the forum

sent  to  the  Member for Queenstown. It  is  quite

clear that this forum was at my suggestion. In view

of   the   fact  that  merger  has  become - a   very

controversial   and  important   question - I   did

suggest  that  various political  personalities  be

invited.  The  letter, as such, was  brief  and  it

asked,  "Would you come to the forum?" Because  the

Member for Queenstown or some of his colleagues had

shown  great reluctance to enter the arena, in  the

next  letter  it  started off with,  'I  have  been

instructed by the Minister to refer to your  letter

of the 5th October . . . .'. It is quite clear that

these  letters were written to various  individuals

on  the instructions of the Minister concerned, and

that  the  civil servant was merely a  vehicle  for

transmitting  this invitation. If  the  Member  for

Queenstown  and  the Member for Thomson  are  quite

clear on the point that it is not the civil servant -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why hide behind them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In fact, I am saying that far from

hiding behind them, we started off by saying in the

letter, "I am instructed by my Minister to tell you

this." We are not hiding. I think the rather  vague

hints  about the P.A.P. Government not  being  here

and the

Barisan Sosialis succeeding it and so on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>



are  unnecessary, because we are not hiding behind

any civil servant, and the letters make that quite

clear.  I had hoped that instead of this amendment

being moved under the Head, News Division, or  the

Head,   Broadcasting  Division,  Members  of   the

Barisan Sosialis would have been wiser - and perhaps

a  little more to the point - if they had moved an

amendment to the Head, Minister. It is clear  that

all  invitations are sent under instructions  from

the   Minister,  and  therefore   he   takes   the

responsibility. In fact, Sir, the  Minister  takes

responsibility  for  every  action  of  any  civil

servant.  Therefore,  the  allegation  that  civil

servants  are entering the political  arena  is  a

veiled  hint that unless they rebel against  their

Ministers they may not find things to their liking

when   the   Barisan  Sosialis   take   over   the

government. I do not think they really mean it. It

is  purely  an attempt to frighten a  few  of  the

civil servants. Let me state quite clearly that we - the  Ministers  in particular - take  responsibility

for  the letters that were sent to the leaders  of

the various political Parties.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I said before, we do not

blame the civil servants, but if a letter is going

to be political, let the civil servant not sign it

but let the Minister himself sign it, and then  we

will deal with the Minister accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 6.



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, a sum of $42,000 will be spent in

1962  in connection with National Day Celebrations.

I  feel  it is normal expenditure, but I  think  it

would  be  even more beneficial and  better  if  we

abolish National Day celebrations in Singapore. One

of  the  reasons is that the P.A.P. Government  and

the Alliance Government in the Federation of Malaya

have  agreed  on  merger in a Greater  Malaysia  in

accordance with the White Paper. Would  it  not  be

out  of  place for Singapore to celebrate  National

Day   celebrations?  What  sort  of  National   Day

celebrations?  Would it be Singapore  National  Day

celebrations or other National Day celebrations?  I

think  it  is  time  for us now to  create  a  true

National Day which will be celebrated by the entire

people  of  Malaysia. A vote has been provided  for

Singapore  to  celebrate her own  National  Day  in

1962,  but then in 1964 the big question will arise

whether we are going to celebrate National Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a difference in the

nature  of  the  celebrations carried  out  in  the

Federation  and  those carried  out  in  Singapore,

because  of  the  position of the  people  in  both

territories. To my mind, we should save this amount

of   $42,000  and  spend  it  on  other   essential

necessities  which  would  benefit  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, U.M.N.O. has participated in

National Day celebrations, although originally  we

were opposed to the displaying of flags. It is not

my  intention  to support any Party,  but  I  feel

there  will  be  a  show of strength  between  the

P.A.P. and  the Barisan Sosialis  when  the  time

comes  to celebrate National Day. Each Party  will

try  to  demonstrate its strength in the  hope  of

convincing those present that one is stronger than

the  other  with  an  eye to  forming  the  future

government. As far as the P.A.P. is concerned, the

Malaysia  proposals are going ahead.  If  Malaysia

celebrates  National  Day, a conflicting  position

will  arise. For instance, in 1964, the Federation

Military Forces, the Federation Regiment  and  the

Malay  Regiment  or the Malaysian  Regiment  which

will be formed will take part in the parade in the

Federation  of Malaya. But if it is also  held  in

Singapore - I do not know what the defence  position

will  then  be - I think the Federation of  Malaya

will also take part. In addition, the question  of

the  National Anthem will arise. If we  celebrate,

we  will certainly not forget our National Anthem,

but  then  the question will arise  as  to  a  new

National Anthem for Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Culture will clarify the

exact position with regard to this item.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is

Malaysia, obviously there will be many changes  in

this part of the world. National Day, the National

Anthem  of Singapore, Merdeka Day, and so on  will

actually have to fit into the context of Malaysia.

Obviously Malaysia National Day will have priority

over  all  other functions. Therefore, I  want  to

keep it open and cannot state here and now whether

National  Day will be abolished. But National  Day

celebrations will definitely take on  a  different

character,  so  long as National Day  is  a  State

celebration, and what we





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>



call  the  National  Anthem  will  become  a  State

anthem. So the character of these celebrations will

certainly  change - but  in  what  way  and  in  what

degree, it is too early for me to say. But I  quite

agree  with the Member that National Day  certainly

cannot  have  the importance that  we  give  to  it

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me say one thing: the purpose

of  National Day is not only a State festival,  but

is  also  used as a means of driving  home  to  the

various communities in Singapore the concept  of  a

common identity, of a common purpose. Even after we

get  Malaysia,  we  will have to  do  something  to

dramatise   by   way  of  popular  participation - as

National  Day  seeks to do - the sense  of  a  common

identity,  of  people getting together  to  declare

their  faith,  their willingness, their  readiness,

and  their  determination to become a nation.  That

function can be taken over if and when they  decide

on  a  Malaysia  National Day or Malaysia  Day,  in

which  case  the date would certainly not  coincide

with  June 3rd but with the day when Malaysia comes

into being. So until such time as that happens,  we

have to keep on with our National Day celebrations,

which  I  hope  would  become  progressively   less

important  in  scope,  less and  less  national  in

character,  and  become  more  and  more  a   State

function and a State celebration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item has been in the Estimates for a

number  of years. Some Ministers have said in  this

Assembly  that  they may consider withdrawing  this

post  from  future Estimates. Can the Minister  for

Home  Affairs give such an assurance? He has  never

had a Political Secretary in his Ministry. That  is

why  he  does  not  have all the trouble  that  his

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs has

taken  a  good holiday, but we do not know what  he

has really done for the Home Affairs Ministry. What

I  would like to raise are just a couple of points,

Sir. Who really rules the Home Affairs Ministry - the

Minister or the Special Branch? If the Minister for

Home  Affairs has to take orders from  the  Special

Branch  everytime, then I do not see what good  the

Minister can do in the Ministry of Home Affairs. As

we all know, Sir, the Special Branch was originally

trained and orientated towards one objective  only,

and  that  was to preserve the colonial empire  and

colonial interests.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

countries. The P.A.P. has always prided  itself  on

being  a  non-Communist, socialist party,  but  all

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need any

Head of the Special Branch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the P.A.P. branches are no more with the

P.A.P., and Assemblymen are no more with the P.A.P.

and  can  not make further representations  to  the

P.A.P.  Committee of Review, I hope they  will  bye

able  to relax their blanket ban on books, so  that

more  publications from all over the world may come

into Singapore. The Prime Minister himself has said

on   many  occasions  that  he  would  prefer  open

discussion  to  inhibition and  ban  on  books  and

ideas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>



Let  him  really live up to his words - let  all  the

books  that the people want come in. If  his  ideas

are  so  good, let the P.A.P. and the Minister  for

Finance  try  to convince other people that  P.A.P.

ideas  are better than ideas which we can get  from

books.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards citizenship, Sir, I may add that, as a

result  of representations from ex-P.A.P. branches

and ex-P.A.P. Assemblymen, a lot of improvement has

already taken place in the department. There is not

so  much  bureacracy now. There is hardly any  more

discourtesy. But we are still wondering  when  they

will  release  their stranglehold on the  grant  of

citizenship rights to people who have been  in  the

forefront of the anticolonial struggle.  A  lot  of

people,  because of their not having  been  granted

citizenship, have not been able to get jobs. For  a

government that professes the socialist  creed,  to

deny   citizenship  rights  to   people   who   are

progressive and socialist in outlook is  definitely

not  the  correct thing to do. A number  of  people

wanted   jobs   as  teachers  or  jobs   in   other

departments, but because their citizenship had been

held  up, and because it is the requirement of  the

Singapore  Government that all applicants  must  be

Singapore  citizens, therefore, these  people  were

denied a chance to get jobs in the Government.  Not

only jobs in the Government, Sir, but also work  as

seamen.  I  understand  that certain  people,  just

because   of  the  delay  in  their  being  granted

citizenship rights, have not been able to go to sea

and  get jobs as seamen. I hope the Government will

look  into this and reorientate its policy so  that

all  the people who have been most forward in their

anti-colonial  struggle will  be  given  their  due

elementary and basic human rights.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Queenstown has just now claimed

that  we ban all publications coming from China  or

other iron curtain countries. In the first place, I

must deny this entirely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publications from Communist countries, especially

those  from China, have not been altogether banned.

The  Member for Queenstown also says that all books

or  publications on socialism are  not  allowed  to

come  into  Singapore. This allegation is  baseless

and  not  factual. By his making  such  a  baseless

allegation,  we can see that in the past,  when  he

was  Parliamentary Secretary in my Ministry, he did

not  get  himself  to understand  the  work  of  my

Ministry.  Perhaps what he was interested  in  were

yellow  publications, because I remember that  when

we  banned some yellow publications this  year,  he

asked me why I should ban them. He said he did  not

see any reason why they, should be banned. That  is

what he told me at that time. Of course, the Member

for  Queenstown is a doctor. Maybe he could have  a

detached view of such publications, as though he is

treating  his  patients  without  any  discernable

emotion. But we are not concerned with whether the

Member  for Queenstown is a doctor or not.  Because

he  has  long experience, he is less likely  to  be

influenced  by  undesirable  publications.  But  to

young  people in general, it is necessary to ensure

that  their  mental and spiritual  health  are  not

corrupted. Of course, to the Member for Queenstown,

such  publications pose no question at all.  I  can

tell   him  further  that  when  we  banned  yellow

publications, the Member for Nee Soon, who was  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health,

also  said that these should not be banned. So from

the  allegation  he made just now, the  Member  for

Queenstown  is  perhaps  only  interested  in  free

importation and sale of yellow publications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, it was a pity the Member for

Queenstown did not give the Minister for Finance  a

chance  to  speak.  He was referring  to  socialist

publications.  I  can  tell the  Member  that  such

publications have not been banned. All  progressive

publications  are welcomed by us. Maybe  he  cannot

distinguish  between  Communist  publications   and

socialist publications. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>



have  banned  many  publications  of  a  Communist

nature.  Our  policy in this respect is  generally

like this.

All publications in praise of the Communist way of

life  and  advocating  unconstitutional  means  to

overthrow  the  government and publications  of  a

purely  propaganda  nature  must,  of  course,  be

banned and will continue to be banned. But we will

not  ban classical works by Marx and Lenin. If the

Member for Choa Chu Kang does not know about this,

then  he  is  not  clear about  the  work  of  the

government.   Even  in  the  case   of   Communist

publications  we  consider each case  as  its  own

merit  whether it should or should not be  banned.

For  example, some publications have been sent  to

University  professors. If they  can  ensure  that

these  publications will not be  abused,  then  we

will  consider their cases and allow them to  have

the books.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, I ask them to consider the Report

made  by  the Review Committee of the  P.A.P.  The

Review  Committee has made recommendations to  the

Government  and these have been accepted.  One  of

the     recommendations     concerns     socialist

publications.   It   is   recommended   that   all

literature and songs imported from other countries

will be allowed as long as they do not incite  our

people  to  do  unconstitutional  things  in  this

country, and as long as they benefit the people of

Singapore socially and intellectually. That is our

attitude  in regard to censorship of publications.

We  can say that our system of censorship is a bit

more  lax  than that in the Federation of  Malaya.

But  it must be understood that in deciding on our

policy  of  censorship, we must also consider  the

policy of the Federation of Malaya, because Malaya

and  Singapore are only separated by the  Causeway

and the chances of circulating publications in the

Federation  are  very great. Books circulating  in

Singapore can easily go into the Federation. At  a

time  when  we are trying to struggle  for  merger

with  the Federation, we must try to stop all acts

and  influences which are detrimental to our fight

for  merger  and  to  the building  of  a  Malayan

consciousness,   although  the  intermingling   of

cultures  should  be encouraged  between  the  two

territories.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I can tell the Member for Queenstown

that when he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Home Affairs, he did not pay attention

to  certain facts. It is this. Some books had  been

banned by the Lim Yew Hock Government. But when the

P.A.P. took  office,  these  banned  books   were

reviewed and some of them were released. Since June

1959,  wheat  the  ban  on books  published  by  53

publishing companies was reviewed, some 8,500 books

have been released by the P.A.P. Government. So  we

can  see  clearly that the allegation made  by  the

Member for Queenstown is groundless.

<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship and the

Citizenship   Registry,  I  will  say   this.   The

administration  of  the  Citizenship  Registry   is

always  in our minds. We always try to improve  the

work  of the Registry and we have done a great deal

in   this  respect.  I  can  tell  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  if he does not know about  this,  that

all   genuine  nationalists  have  not  had   their

applications    for   citizenship   refused.    All

progressive people whose citizenship was denied  by

the  Lim Yew Hock Government have, during our  term

of  office, had their cases reviewed by us and many

of  these cases have been approved. Therefore, such

allegations  are not based on facts.  There  is  no

point for me therefore to reply to them one by one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  I  was not prepared to speak,  but  after

hearing  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  I  think

there is something which is not quite true. He says

that  we  are  now  having  discussions  with   the

Federation of Malaya on merger. Since merger is now

in  view, he is afraid that certain books  will  be

circulated  in  the Federation of Malaya.  On  this

point,  I  will say we know that the Federation  of

Malaya  has banned books published by 53 publishing

companies.  Any book published by any of  these  53

publishing  companies  will be  banned.  Since  the

P.A.P.   Government   is   negotiating   with   the

Federation Government on merger, perhaps  this  may

materialise. The P.A.P. Government is always trying

to comply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



with  the many policies and laws of the Federation

of Malaya. It has taken steps to ban certain books

and  has  also lifted the ban on certain books.  I

think in the earlier period perhaps there was such

a  practice, but if it is still the practice, then

I  am  afraid the P.A.P. type of merger  will  not

take  place  easily,  because,  according  to  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs, these books  will  he

circulated in the Federation of Malaya. Of course,

the Federation of Malaya will oppose the inflow of

such books into their territory.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not want to

inconvenience  you,  Sir, but since  the  Minister

used  Mandarin,  I too want to  reply  to  him  in

Mandarin.  He  said  I could  not  understand  the

affairs and the administration of the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs. I want to say that it is because  I

understand  it  too  well that  I  have  left  the

Ministry!   There  are  many  things  inside   the

Ministry  which  cannot be  disclosed  to  outside

people.  When I was there, I saw all those  things

with my own eyes. If these things are disclosed to

the  public of Singapore, then I do not think  the

public  will  let  them  escape  so  easily.   The

Minister  has  mentioned just now  certain  things

relating to the anti-yellow culture campaign.  But

I  want to tell the Minister for Home Affairs that

it is most important that one must not pretend. If

anything  needs to be countered, then counter  it.

It  should  not be said that anything relating  to

the anatomy of the human body is something yellow,

and  therefore to be countered. Perhaps  when  the

Minister was a bachelor, he had different views on

certain things. He was entitled to his own  views.

But if he had been an older man, perhaps his views

would not have been so contradictory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs also says that the

ban  on  many books has been lifted and that  they

have  been  allowed to be imported into Singapore.

He  and the Minister for Finance always talk about

Mao  Tse-tung,  that Mao says this  and  Mao  says

that.  But has the Minister for Home Affairs  ever

allowed books written by Mao Tse-tung to be

imported into Singapore for us to see.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



and  read? As true non-Communist, Socialists,  they

should  allow  certain books to  be  imported  into

Singapore.  They  should  also  allow  books   from

various countries, other than America and the Right-wing  countries  to  come into Singapore.  If  they

think  they  can win the ideological  battle,  then

they  should allow free competition of  thought  by

permitting  these  certain  books  to   come   into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to touch upon what the

Minister   says   about  the  anti-yellow   culture

campaign. There is a book called Huo Tih Hui I (The

Reminiscences   of  Fire).  This  book   has   been

classified  under the category of "yellow  books.".

May I ask him whether this book is really yellow or

red or white? Or what colour is it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  first,  I   want to tell  the  Member  for

Queenstown  that it is only because we are  a  non-Communist Socialist Party that we have no  duty  to

propagandize  for the Communists  or  to  propagate

Communism   on   their  behalf.  The   Member   for

Queenstown  should enumerate facts to  substantiate

his  allegations. When we have reviewed these books

which  are  nothing but propaganda  for  Communism,

then, of course, we will ban them. It does not mean

to say that we are siding with any particular side.

I  can  tell him that many books from Formosa  have

been  detained, although we have not disclosed this

to  the local Press. In the same way, many American

books,  since  they were entirely of  a  propaganda

nature, were also banned. There are two ways to  go

about it: one is to publish in the Gazette the  ban

on  these  books. The other way is to  detain  them

without  publicity. If the books are few in number,

then  we usually detain them. Such publications  as

America  Today  or The World today  or  books  from

Formosa, The New World and The Present Continent of

Red   China,  are  all  detained.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  says  that  when he  was  Parliamentary

Secretary  to me, my views on certain  things  were

different from those I hold now, because I was then

a  bachelor.  But  I want to tell him  about  these

books  which  he  deems not to be  "yellow"  books.

These   are   novels  exploiting  sex,  crime   and

immorality for base ends. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>



author  is Fung Yoke Chee. Other examples are  "The

Diary  of a Virgin", "Love letters", and "Night  at

Niang  Niang  Temple". They  are  stories  about  a

spinster, a maid, a flying man, and others. How can

he  say  that these publications are not  "yellow"?

The  Member for Nee Soon once said about  books  of

this nature, "What does it matter? Why should these

books be banned?" [Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. The  difficulty

is that the interpreters will not be able to follow

the  interjections. The Chairman also will  not  be

able  to  understand what they are. So  as  far  as

possible, the Opposition should try to avoid making

interjections.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, the

accusations and allegations made by the Member  for

Queenstown are all groundless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Havelock has raised the

question of our relationship with the Federation of

Malaya.  We understand the Federation of Malaya  is

an  anti-Communist Government and we understand its

policy. That is why we must consider the sources of

certain books. We must not make it easy for certain

books  to be circulated in the Federation of Malaya

to  embarrass the Government there. If we  want  to

have  merger with the Federation of Malaya, we must

not  take  any step or measure which will  put  the

Federation   of  Malaya  in  a  very   embarrassing

position. Therefore, the censoring of books  cannot

be carried out in isolation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Deputy Speaker left the

Chair  of the Committee and took the Chair of the

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to

report  that  the  Committee  of  Supply  has  made

progress  on the Main Estimates, and ask  leave  to

sit again tomorrow, 13th of December.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Tomorrow then.
