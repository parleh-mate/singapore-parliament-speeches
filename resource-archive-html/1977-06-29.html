   <b>SINGAPORE-JAPAN PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his recent discussion with the Japanese Prime Minister on the proposed $2 billion petrochemical project in the Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I met Mr Fukuda, the Prime Minister of Japan, on Monday, 30th May, this year, all issues regarding the Singapore-Japan Petrochemical project in Singapore had already been resolved by officials of both Governments. Mr Fukuda confirmed that the project had been agreed to by, and will receive the support of, the Japanese Government. This endorsement and support was repeated by all the Japanese Ministers concerned, i.e., the Ministers for International Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs and Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are the main points of the Agreement. The joint venture "upstream" company of the project will be owned on an equal basis by the Singapore Government and Japanese participants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese participation in the "upstream" company will be through an investment company being set up in Japan The Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF), which is a Japanese Government institution for overseas development assistance, will invest three billion yen (about
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $27 million), equivalent to 30% of the equity of the investment company. The remaining 70% equity will be taken up by private Japanese companies, including Sumitomo Chemical, Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Mitsui Petrochemical, Asahi Chemical, Showa Denko, Idemitsu and other Japanese petrochemical companies. In addition, long-term loans for the project would be provided by the Export-Import Bank of Japan both for equity participation by Japanese companies as well as for the purchase of machinery and equipment from Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore project will be the first petrochemical complex to receive OECF equity participation. The project has the support of both the Japanese Government and the Japanese petrochemical industry. It goes without saying that continuing cooperation between Singapore and Japan is a key factor in the success of the project.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrochemical complex when completed in 1981 will consist of an "upstream" company and initially three "downstream" companies. The "upstream" company will own the naphtha/gas oil cracker, which is the core of the complex and other common-user facilities. The "downstream" companies will purchase ethylene and propylene from the "upstream" company for conversion into plastic resins and other end products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will make a significant contribution to our economy, both during construction and during operation. Much of the engineering, plant fabrication and construction work will be done locally. The project will require about 4,000 direct
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> workers during the peak of the construction period and about 2,000 employees for the operation of the complex. Engineering companies, plant manufacturers, plastic fabricators and other end-product users are likely to be attracted to set up in Singapore. The multiplier effects of this project will therefore be considerable.

   <b>(Medical facilities)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Health what measures will be taken to provide better general medical facilities for the people in Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong as such facilities are lacking in the two islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, a trained Nurse Practitioner visits Pulau Tekong daily, except Tuesdays when she goes to Pulau Ubin, to provide outpatient services. She attends to about 20 patients daily at Pulau Tekong and 10 at Pulau Ubin.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of cases are common ailments, like cough, cold and sore throat, poor appetite, diarrhoea, sores, boils, sore-eyes, insect bites and so on. If in the Nurse's assessment a patient requires a doctor's opinion, she will refer him to the Somapah Outpatient Dispensary. When hospitalisation is required, the patient is referred to Changi Hospital. However, such referred cases form only about 10% of total cases seen by the Nurse Practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a Maternal and Child Health team consisting of Staff Nurses and Midwives visits the two islands once a week. A Maternal and Child Health doctor visits Pulau Tekong once a month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bulk of the cases at the two islands involves minor ailments and in view of their small population, the present medical facilities provided are considered adequate.

   <b>Village residents)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Health whether the Changi Hospital will also provide outpatient treatment for residents from the nearby Changi Village, as most of the time residents from this village who call at the Hospital for medical attention are re-directed to the Somapah Outpatient Dispensary in Somapah Road which is about 6 1/2 kilometres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Changi Hospital has an Accident and Emergency Department to attend to traumatic and emergency cases. Its Specialist Outpatient Department caters for follow-up treatment of discharged patients and those referred by OPD doctors or by private practitioners for specialised consultation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in other hospitals, it is not the policy for these two departments to attend to non-traumatic/non-emergency cases or those not requiring specialist consultation. For this reason, patients with common or minor ailments reporting at Changi Hospital are advised to go to the Somapah Outpatient Dispensary. This is necessary to ensure that costly specialised services at hospitals are properly utilised to treat the acutely ill, especially when treatment for minor illnesses can be obtained from outpatient dispensaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a four-month survey carried out recently in six hospitals a total of 79,951 cases were seen at the Accident and Emergency Department. Among the self-referrals more than 40% were non-emergency and non-traumatic cases. This is misuse of the Accident and Emergency Department which is already congested. I would therefore like to advise the public to go to the outpatient dispensaries if they are suffering from minor ailments. In this way, they will not overload the staff at the Accident and Emergency Department and will be helping the Government to hold down the rising costs of running hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there are genuine emergency cases the Accident and Emergency units will attend to them since the outpatient dispensaries are closed at night.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if he is aware that zebra crossings without traffic control lights are dangerous to both pedestrians and motorists and if he will consider installing traffic control lights at all zebra crossings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, zebra crossings are used at locations where vehicular traffic flow is relatively light such as minor roads in housing estates, factory roads and slip roads at junctions. Usually beacons, flood lights and traffic signals are installed at these crossings to attract the attention of motorists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrian signals, on the other hand, are normally used at locations where vehicular traffic flow is heavy and fast moving. The Public Works Department will convert zebra crossings to signalised crossings at locations where vehicular traffic has since increased appreciably.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications whether there is any plan to develop the plot of vacant land, viz. Lot No. 266-2384 in Mukim XVIII, which is adjacent to the Serangoon Garden Market, and if not, whether it can be converted into a car park.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the plot of land in question previously had a septic tank located within it. The septic tank has since been demolished and the area is now landscaped. From the planning viewpoint, there is no objection to convert this lot into a car park provided access is obtained via the existing access to the market off Serangoon Garden Way. In view of its critical location in relation to Serangoon Garden Circus, a new access to the site either from Serangoon Garden Way or Chartwell Drive is not desirable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is presently no plan to develop the vacant land. However, the PWD will undertake a further study into the feasibility of using it as a car park.

  <br>

  <br>
  <br> its tenants, whether it is a large limited company or a small limited company incorporated with limited liability under the Companies Act. The point here is that in the case of a limited company, the company is a separate legal entity from that of its shareholders. The incorporated company's entity remains unchanged, even though there is a change of shareholders. A change in the shareholders of a limited company therefore does not, in law, require an assignment of the tenancy where the tenancy is in the name of the company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is otherwise in the case of a sole proprietorship or a partnership company. A change of the sole proprietor or substantial changes of the partners can amount to a change of the managements of these companies which may require a new tenancy agreement and a review of the current rental.

  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if he will give the figures of unoccupied two-room flats in all the Housing and Development Board housing estates: and how long such flats have been left vacant and the reason for not letting them out to applicants who are urgently in need of larger accommodation due to congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are altogether 447 units of vacant two-room flats in HDB housing estates as at June 1977. These units have been offered to resettlement families who are given priority in their applications for flats. Those units not taken up by the resettlement families will then be allocated to the one-room tenants who have applied for transfer and the public applicants on our waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 20 to 30 two-room units which have been vacant for two to three months as at June 1977. These are usually the units which have been rejected by three or four applicants in succession.

  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications whether he is aware of the numerous complaints by telephone subscribers of wrong charging over the Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) system and if he will request the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (i) to review the STD system and rectify any faults: and (ii) to allow subscribers the choice of whether or not they wish to be provided with the STD facility.

  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 190,000 subscribers use the Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) system, 40,000 of whom are regular users.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each month the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore has to go through 275,000 exchange lines to bill users of the STD. Of these, there are on the average about 20 cases of wrong charging mainly due to human error. The error rate is therefore only 0.007%. In all these cases, the subscribers' bills are subsequently corrected accordingly. The TAS is monitoring this matter closely to reduce the number of faults and improve the quality of service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present automatic STD system is convenient, efficient and cheaper for subscribers who want to make calls to Peninsular Malaysia. Without this automatic STD system, the manually operated service will not be in a position to handle the volume of telephone traffic to Peninsular Malaysia. The manually operated service is generally inefficient, uneconomical and requires more manpower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eliminate wrong charging in the STD system, the TAS is investigating the use of sophisticated computer switching equipment which can print out all the details of STD calls, such as the destination of call, the called party number, date of call and duration of call. However, the deterrent factor of this equipment is its high cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TAS is also looking into the practicality of providing trunk-barring facilities to subscribers who do not want STD facilities. The TAS has been cautious in considering the offer of such an option because it results in the inefficient use of the automatic STD equipment and may overload the manual trunk service. If this happens, the manual service will deteriorate. To sustain an acceptable grade of service, the cost of providing the manual service will increase; and this additional cost would have to be passed on to the public, a situation which we would want to avert.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Finance to what extent our economy will be affected by the proposal of Saudi Arabia to increase its oil price by five per cent on 1st July, 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> (for the Minister for Finance): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance. There has been no official announcement by Saudi Arabia to increase its oil price by 5% on 1st July, 1977. There have been, of course, speculative press reports. Let us hope that these reports will not be borne out by events. Any further increase in oil prices will adversely affect the economic development of many non-oil producing countries like Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In itself, a 5% increase is not substantial. But since more than 60% of our crude oil imports comes from Saudi Arabia, this will represent a further aggravation of the already high oil burden for Singapore. Posted prices for crude oil have gone up by 330% from US$3.01 per barrel in October 1973 to US$13.00 per barrel at present.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct effect of an oil price increase would be greatest on the domestic oil bill. There would be an increase in the cost of such oil, with a substantial proportion of it having to be paid by our industries. Besides this domestic impact, the effect of a further oil price increase on the economies of the other countries, especially the advanced industrial countries, has to be considered. The economies of such countries are recovering, albeit slowly. Any adverse effects from an oil price increase on their economies would affect Singapore's exports to these countries, thereby affecting our economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that we are fully dependent on external sources for oil like many other non-oil producing countries, it is our hope that the reports on Saudi Arabia's proposal will not materialise. If the effect of any price increase is to be at all ameliorated, there must be a conscious effort by Singaporeans to conserve

  <br> energy, thereby reducing our need for oil imports.

   <b>MOSQUE BUILDING FUND SCHEME</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Social Affairs)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the House may recall that in September, 1975, the Administration of Muslim Law Act was amended for the implementation of the Mosque Building Fund Scheme. The objective of the Scheme is to ensure a steady source of funds for mosque building purposes. Under this Scheme, all employers are required to pay a 50-cent contribution per Muslim employee per month to the Fund and to recover the contributions from the wages of their Muslim employees. Since the Scheme started in May, 1975, contributions to the Fund have averaged 108,000 persons monthly and the average monthly collection is $68,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mosque built under the Scheme at Toa Payoh was officially opened on 8th April 1977 and the second mosque at Queenstown will be completed in September 1977. The third mosque at Jurong is scheduled for completion in early 1978 and sites have been reserved for mosques at Woodlands, Bedok/Chai Chee and Ang Mo Kio New Towns. A total of six mosques will be built under the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more Muslims are moving into new towns, it is necessary to build additional mosques. Over the course of the next few years, mosques costing approximately $1.5 million each will be built in HDB new towns in Tampines, Nee Soon, Bukit Batok and Clementi. This will be the second phase of the mosque building programme. It is obvious that more funds will be required to ensure the early completion of these mosques.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been decided to increase the Mosque Building Fund contribution from 50 cents to $1 per month with effect from 1st July 1977. The increase
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is necessary to ensure the availability of funds for the mosque building programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to increase the rate of contribution is made after consultations with Muslim Members of Parliament and the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. They support the increase and are confident that it will have the support of Muslims. The Majlis reported receiving requests from Muslims to increase the rate of contribution to speed up the mosque building programme to meet the needs of Muslims who are resettled in the new towns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is compulsory for every employer of a Muslim employee to pay contributions to the Fund on behalf of his employee through the Central Provident Fund Board and to recover such contribution from the wages, Muslims who are financially unable to afford to contribute may either opt to contribute 50 cents or nothing. Muslims wishing to exercise this option will have to file an application for a Certificate of Option valid for a period not exceeding 12 months with the Majlis. This is a very simple process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Muslims who wish to contribute more than $1 can notify their employers by submitting a Notification Form to state the desired amount for a period of six months. The Notification Form can be obtained from the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura or the employers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis will continue to appoint its own agents to collect contributions from Muslims who are employers or are self-employed, since they do not have CPF accounts. The Central Provident Fund Board will be the collecting agent for contributions payable in respect of Muslim employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the building of mosques is a logical outcome of Muslims moving into new towns. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura supports the policy of the Government in building one new mosque in each new town where the Muslim population is sufficiently large and agrees that this is the most practical way to meet the religious needs of the Muslims as they are resettled in the new towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Muslims living in the new towns. the new mosques to be built under the Mosque Building Fund Scheme will have facilities for educational, cultural and social activities besides religious programmes. The mosques will generally have a library, a hall for social gatherings and rooms for educational purposes. The concept of a large and modern multi-purpose mosque to serve all Muslims within a satellite town is a new and bold one. I hope that the new mosques will become the hub of community life for Muslims, and there will be maximum utilisation of the facilities for constructive and positive objectives. Through religious guidance given in mosques, we should be able to teach young people the right values and proper attitudes necessary for the continued well-being of everyone. Seen in this way, the Mosque Building Fund Scheme is a translation of a social ideal into reality.

  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, ships working cargo on Sundays have to pay Sunday Labour Permit Fee which ranges from $60 to $200 according to the tonnage of the ship. The money collected is paid into the National Maritime Fund. The Fund is administered by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the National Maritime Board whose functions are mainly to develop and regulate maritime employment and to administer welfare and training schemes for seafarers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday Labour Permit Fee originated in the late 19th century and was meant to aid destitute seamen. It is an anachronism for a port like ours which now operates 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The present system of collection also has various shortcomings. At present, the National Maritime Board collects the Sunday Labour Permit Fee based on information furnished by the Port of Singapore Authority and the Marine Police. But the Board has no facilities to check whether ships are working cargo on Sundays, resulting in cases of evasion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from the Sunday Labour Permit Fee amounts to about $1/2 million every year and constitutes an important part of the Board's income, of which a substantial portion is channelled towards the welfare and training of seamen. On this basis, the original criterion of collection has not been lost. To retain this income but without the administrative shortcomings, the Board proposes to replace the Fee with a new levy to be known as the Maritime Welfare Fee. The new Fee will be levied on all vessels of 75 gross registered tons (grt) and above calling at Singapore on a per call basis. The proposed rates of the new Fee range from $15 to $100 per call per vessel according to the size of the vessel. Concessionary rates, of course, will be provided for. The Maritime Welfare Fee will be collected by the Port of Singapore Authority which has agreed to be the collecting agent on behalf of the National Maritime Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Fee will have only a marginal effect on shipowners' operating costs. A study of selected ships has indicated that the imposition of the Maritime Welfare Fee on a per call basis will amount to only about 1% of a ship's daily operating costs. As most ships stay several days on calling in port, the effect would therefore be negligible. In fact, if we were to consider instances of specific
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tonnages, we will see that the rates of the new Fee are considerably lower than the rates of the existing Fee. For example, for ships between 1,000 and 1,500 grt the existing Fee for working on a Sunday is $150 whereas under the new Fee similar-sized vessels will pay only $25.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Shipping Association and the Singapore Shipowners' Association were consulted. They both agreed that the Sunday Labour Permit Fee should be replaced by a more equitable and administratively more efficient system. Hence the proposed Maritime Welfare Fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fee will be levied on a date to be signified in the Government Gazette.

  <b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act which was passed in this House in 1974 seeks among other things to safeguard public interest by ensuring that undesirable foreign elements do not gain control of our newspapers and use them against the welfare of our society. It is not intended to interfere with newspapers as an economic activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the danger of local newspapers falling into the hands of foreign interests has been contained, the situation is still far from satisfactory because the ownership of some major newspapers remains in the hands of a small group of people. It is undesirable to allow any person or family to have monopolistic control of any major newspaper. In view of the great influence the news media has on public opinion and the possibilities of it being used to manipulate weaker elements in an open society like Singapore, it is essential to spread the ownership of newspapers as widely as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments in democratic countries are elected every four or five years, and are accountable to the voters. Because of this Governments so elected must be responsive to the societies they serve. But this does not apply to the press which is answerable only to its owners. The press may claim that it is answerable to its readers, but whenever there is a real conflict of interest between the public and the owner of the media, it is the owners' self-interest that the press will look after first. In seeking to break the monopolistic hold of newspapers by a few families and a small group of people, we are trying to spread the ownership of newspapers to as wide a public as possible. In doing so, the interest of the public will coincide with that of the newspapers and we will truly have newspapers owned by the people for the people. If everything goes on well there is a real hope that a free, healthy and responsible press will gradually be institutionalised in Singapore. Newspaper editors and reporters need not be afraid of newspaper owners breathing down their necks. There will be no interference from the owners. The journalists will be able to carry out their duties according to their best professional judgment and with the interest of the nation at heart.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prohibit any person from holding either directly or indirectly through a nominee or a holding company more than 3% of the ordinary shares issued by a newspaper
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> company. In the case of newspaper companies with an issued capital of more than $4 million, persons holding shares in excess of the 3% limit will have to find their own ways and means of disposing of them by 1st December 1977. After that date, no one is allowed to hold more than 3% of the ordinary shares in a newspaper company unless he is given exemption to do so, otherwise, he will be committing an offence and his surplus shares will be forfeited to the government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for small newspaper companies whose issued capital is under $4 million and whose shares are therefore not quoted in the Stock Exchange, there are other provisions. In order to help the shareholders to dispose of their surplus shares, the Public Trustee will be entrusted with the responsibility to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of such shares. It will be his duty to sell the surplus shares by ballot to the public at a price sufficient to cover his fees, expenses and the net asset value of such shares. After the sales are completed, he will then pay to the newspaper owners, whose shares he has helped to sell, the proceeds of sale less his fees and expenses. In evaluating the surplus shares, the Public Trustee will not take into consideration the value of the goodwill as a result of the grant of a licence to publish a newspaper. We feel that if there is any value in the goodwill at all, the value arises out of a government act, i.e., the grant of a newspaper permit, and the benefit of such an act should go to the public and not the newspaper owner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to make other minor amendments to some of the existing provisions in the Act and to repeal those which, experience has shown, serve no useful purpose.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ought to inform the House that the Bill has nothing to do with health but I am taking this Bill as acting Minister for Social Affairs who is on leave prior to leaving for Jakarta as Ambassador.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were misgivings when the Bill was first published. However, as a prelude, let me mention that between 1952 and 1966 seven pawnshops went bankrupt. Their total declared assets at bankruptcy were only $1,678,498 while $5,914,294 were owing to 1,551 depositors. The causes of bankruptcy ranged from using funds in the interests of the principals of the pawnshop companies, poor management, paying of high interest rates or using depositors' money in uncertain business ventures other than the pawnbroking business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 55 pawnshops with about 16,000 depositors. At the end of March 1977 their combined fixed deposits amounted to $79 million. It is hard to believe that with rising GNP per capita Singapore citizens are becoming more and more insolvent. The liquidity position of pawnshops can be seen from statistics collected for the years 1974-76.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average amount of loans issued in pledges varied from $15 million to $18 million per month or an average of $16.6 million per month. On the other hand, income received from pawners including payment of interest, public auction and sale of unredeemed pledged articles varied from $13 million to $22 million per month or an average of $16.73 million per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the alarming part of the pawnbroking business. The fixed deposit is obviously too large and more than adequate for the purely pawnbroking business. It must
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be assumed that a substantial sum is being diverted to other types of financial activities. In other words, some pawnshops are functioning as finance companies but do not offer security to depositors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two alternatives to solving the problem relating to deposits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Pawnshops that wish to take on the functions of finance companies by accepting deposits can do so by registration under the Finance Companies Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Pawnshops will be allowed a grace period of 2 1/2 years to wind up that part of their business involving acceptance of deposits from the public. This can be done by reducing their fixed deposits by 10% every three months during the 2 1/2 year period. No new deposits will be allowed during this period but renewal of existing deposits during the grace period can be permitted provided the total amount of fixed deposits does not exceed the level as required by the phased run-down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no intention to stop pawnshops servicing those members of the public who are in need of small loans. This aspect of the business can be carried out with lesser capital as the loans given are only 50%-60% of the value of articles pledged. Pawnshops with a history and good standing will not disappear. In fact, their business will increase as the pawnbroking business is brought under control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Bill are minor and deal with the administration of the Pawnbrokers Rules such as substituting an office of a Registrar for the Pawnbrokers Licensing Board. They are clearly spelt out in the explanatory statement at the end of the Bill.

   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.25 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am moving the Second Reading of the Bill on behalf on my colleague, the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to incorporate into the Income Tax Act the tax concessions which the Minister for Finance granted in last year's Budget Statement The opportunity is also taken to include, in the Bill, amendments which redefine tax terminology in order to remove ambiguity. The Bill also seeks to give the Comptroller additional powers to ensure prompt collection of taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement in March 1976 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced that to continue to develop Singapore's financial centre and to promote the Asian Dollar Market, income received by Asian Currency Units for advising, confirming or re-financing off-shore letters of credit will be taxed at the reduced rate of 10% instead of the normal 40%. That tax concession is now given effect under clause 7.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also announced in his Budget Statement in February of this year that the basis of the tax on pensions would be revised. Members may be aware that a pension payment, like the annuity paid by insurance companies, can be treated as consisting of two elements, one element being part repayment of the capital, and the other interest on the capital. At present, both elements are subject to income tax. Clause 3 provides that only the interest portion will be treated as income and taxed accordingly; for purpose of assessment the interest element is calculated at one-half of the pension. This concession applies to all pensions set up by law in Singapore as well as to approved pensions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal with the other amendments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present definition of source of income does not cover interest accruing from suppliers' credit or deferred payments for the sale of goods, royalties and other payments for the use of movable property, management fees, payments for the use of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, and rents or payments under agreement for the use of movable property. Clause 4 provides that where these are paid directly or indirectly by a Singapore resident or a permanent resident in Singapore, or are deductible against income accruing in Singapore, the source is deemed to be in Singapore and therefore liable to income tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill lifts the restriction on the exemption from income tax, in respect of interest received from Asian Dollar bonds, to issues emanating in Singapore. Henceforth, all approved Asian Dollar Bond issues are tax exempt, whether issued within or outside Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law allows a taxpayer to claim relief for maintenance of his dependants who reside with him outside Singapore. Clause 6 now restricts the tax relief to the taxpayer whose dependants are living with him in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 provides for the deduction of withholding tax on royalties and management fees paid to non-residents similar to that provided in the Act regarding payment of interest to non-residents. The rate of withholding tax is 40% although the Comptroller has the discretion to give notice to make deductions at a higher or lower rate, where appropriate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the amendment provides for full or partial exemption of income under double taxation agreements. Any income so exempted under a double taxation agreement will be taken into account in determining the effective tax rate to be applied to other income in respect of which tax is payable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of granting double taxation relief can in certain cases result in less tax being collected, because of a large
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> foreign income, than would have been the case had there been no foreign income. Clause 11 now rectifies this anomalous situation. It provides for any tax credit allowed under the double taxation agreement not to have the effect of reducing the tax payable on any source of income derived from Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax for the year of assessment is based on the income of the preceding year. There is therefore a time lag. In the case of a business or trade whose accounting period ends in the early part of the year, the deferment of tax payment is even longer. Indeed some businesses choose the early part of the year as the end of the accounting period to take advantage of this provision. To prevent such abuse, clause 12 imposes an obligation that where the accounting period of a business or trade ends on or before 30th September, an estimate of the tax should be given to the Comptroller within three months after the end of the accounting period to assist the Comptroller in raising an advance assessment without undue delay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment, clause 15, vests the Comptroller with reciprocal right to apply to the Board of Review or High Court for appeal cases to be heard in public instead of in camera. Hitherto, only taxpayers can make such an application.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final amendment as contained in clause 16 makes it the employer's responsibility to ensure that the amount deducted from the emoluments of the employee for purpose of payment of income tax is forwarded to the Comptroller not later than ten days after the date of such deduction. There have been occasions when employers deliberately delayed the remittance of tax so deducted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>3.35 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is to provide for, among other things, the clarification of income from off-shore financing and the clarification of the effect of a double tax arrangement. It is to be expected that, in the course of Singapore's development as a financial centre for the region, there must arise the need to amend the Income Tax Act to cater for new sources and new categories of income from new financial activities. In that sense, the various provisions in the Bill relating to off-shore financing and such matters as Asian Dollar Bonds and Asian Currency Units may be classified as consequential legislation, that is, consequential to the Government's programme or blue-print of development for Singapore. I do not think any Singaporean, who is truly appreciative of Singapore's ever constant need to ensure the viability of its economy in a competitive world, will question the necessity and desirability of the various provisions in this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular provision in the Bill I particularly endorse is clause 3 which provides for all pensions, granted under any written law in Singapore, to be taxed on a 50% basis. Such a provision means, in other words, that a pensioner will receive half his pension free of tax. That should be a considerable relief to all pensioners in Singapore, particularly when the pension is determined at the time of retirement of the pensioner and is normally not adjusted against subsequent inflation which can effectively reduce the real monetary value of the pension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am grateful, as a trade unionist, to the concession accorded under the Bill to pensions, I wish to enquire whether the Government would extend its concessionary treatment to retrenchment gratuity. As it is, the position regarding retrenchment gratuity is most confusing and perplexing to workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may know, a retrenchment gratuity is payable when the service of a worker is terminated on the ground of redundancy or of reorganisation of the employer's business, trade or profession. Under the Employment Act, the liability of an employer to pay a retrenchment
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> gratuity is stated to be conditional upon the retrenched worker having a minimum of three years' service at the time of retrenchment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Department had on several occasions decided that if a retrenchment gratuity is payable by virtue of a contract of service or a collective agreement, it is deemed to be a gratuity paid or granted in respect of the employment of the retrenched worker. Therefore, it is taxable. On the other hand, if a retrenchment gratuity is not paid or granted by virtue of any previous contractual agreement, but decided upon by an employer at the time of termination of service, it is deemed to be a gratuity paid or granted in respect, not of employment, but of the termination of employment. Therefore, it is not taxable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To workers who are faced with the traumatic experience of being retrenched, the confusion over the question of income tax liability for the retrenchment gratuity simply adds to their woes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing the attention of this House to the unsatisfactory and invidious distinction between retrenchment benefit as a contractual payment and retrenchment benefit as a non-contractual compensation, it is my intention to draw the attention of the Government to the purpose of retrenchment gratuities and that is, a payment to compensate for the abrupt loss of career prospects to a retrenched worker through no fault of his own, and to enable the retrenched worker to tide over the period when he seeks alternative employment. Whether a retrenchment gratuity is a contractual or non-contractual payment, it does not make any difference to the purpose for which it is granted or paid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Income Tax Department has made certain decisions on this matter but these have not been made known to the public. Could the Hon. Minister kindly throw some light on the subject?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to say that I am in a position to throw some light on the point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh. He did make a representation
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to the Income Tax Department on the point about retrenchment gratuity given as a result of a negotiated agreement with a trade union or as a result of a contract signed between the parties. Hitherto this retrenchment gratuity is subject to tax. But following the representation by the Member for Toa Payoh, the Income Tax Department has agreed to make it non-taxable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.44 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E.W. Barker) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister in charge has asked me to move this Bill on his behalf.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Parliamentary Pensions Act, the quantum of death gratuity payable to the dependants of a deceased Member of Parliament is fixed at a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> year's emoluments. In the corresponding sections or provisions of the Pensions Act for the civil service, the death gratuity payable to the dependants of a civil servant who dies "in harness" is equivalent to one year's emoluments or salary or, alternatively, to a commuted pension gratuity, whichever is the greater. For the purposes of determining such commuted pension gratuity, the officer is deemed to have retired on medical grounds at the time of his death.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Pensions Act so that the death gratuity provisions will include the alternative of a commuted pension gratuity as in the more generous provisions for the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Parliamentary Pensions Act, a Member of Parliament has to satisfy two conditions in order to qualify for a pension and hence for a commuted gratuity, namely:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) he must have had at least 9 years reckonable service;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he must have attained the age of 45 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amending Bill will enable the payment of a commuted pension gratuity based on the years of reckonable service completed (where such gratuity exceeds one year's emoluments) even if a Member of Parliament dies before fulfilling the two conditions to qualify for a Parliamentary pension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be interested to know that the commuted pension gratuity will exceed one year's salary or emoluments only if the Member has completed more than 7.2 years of reckonable service. In the case of a civil servant, the dependants will get a bigger gratuity by way of the commuted pension gratuity only if the deceased civil servant had more than 16 years' service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> When we met last month, I made a statement about the illness and hospitalisation of the Honourable Member for Bukit Merah, Mr Lim Guan Hoo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a copy of his latest medical report which indicates that Mr Lim's condition remains unchanged: he is still in a coma and unresponsive to his environment. He cannot move his limbs voluntarily and has to be tube-fed. The medical report goes on to say that Mr Lim is unlikely to recover at all and be able to perform his duties as a Member of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim was absent from our last sitting in May and is also absent today. Article 30(2)(d) of the Constitution provides that the seat of a Member of Parliament will become vacant if, during two consecutive months in each of which sittings of Parliament are held, he is absent from all such sittings without having obtained from the Speaker permission to be absent therefrom. As Parliament will not be in session tomorrow, which is the last day of this month, Mr Lim's seat will become automatically vacant thereafter.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with sorrow and regret that we listened to your announcement about one of our Members. Mr Lim Guan Hoo was first elected to Bukit Merah on the 18th January, 1966. He has been a Member of this House for more than 11 years, but is only 38 years old. He will not qualify for a pension until he
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> attains the age of 45 years, which he is unlikely to do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I moved the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1977, I explained that the amendment will also provide for the payment of a commuted pension gratuity to the dependants of an MP who has had 9 years of reckonable service but dies before attaining the age of 45 years. Mr Lim's dependants will unfortunately not benefit from this amendment as he would have ceased to be a Member of this House before the Bill can receive the assent of the President. His dependants will also not be entitled to receive the death gratuity of a year's emoluments payable to dependants of deceased MPs because he will soon no longer be a Member of this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has considered his long years of loyal service and his present unfortunate circumstances, and decided that it would be just and proper to pay to his dependants a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> gratuity of a year's emoluments upon his death, as if he were a Member of this House and Parliamentary Secretary at the time of his death. He is married and will leave behind his wife and two young children, both boys, one now aged six and the other three years. Honourable Members join me, Sir, in extending our sympathies to his family.
