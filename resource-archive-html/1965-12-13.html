<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX ORDINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Exemption)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the resolution,

passed  on 20th November, 1951, by the Legislative

Council  of  the  Colony of  Singapore  under  the

provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947  (No.

39 of 1947) to exempt any person resident in Italy

and  carrying  on  the business  of  shipowner  or

charterer  otherwise than through an establishment

in Singapore from all the provisions of the Income

Tax  Ordinance,  1947, which relate  to  gains  or

profits  from  such  business, be  rescinded  with

effect from the 1st day of January, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, until it was amended in 1964, the Singapore

Income  Tax  Ordinance contained  a  provision  in

section  13  sub-section  (1),  paragraph  (p)  to

exempt  from  tax  the gains or profits  from  the

business of shipowner or charterer carried on by a

person  not  resident  in  Singapore  subject   to

provisions which I will deal with later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1951, Singapore was asked by the

British Colonial Office to agree that exemption be

granted  under that section to Italian  shipowners

whose  vessels  called regularly at  the  port  of

Singapore,  provided the Italian  Government,  for

its   part,  agreed  to  exempt  any  British  and

Singapore shipping calling at Italian ports  where

such shipping did not maintain an organisation  in

Italy.  There  was,  however, a  proviso  that  an

equivalent  exemption from tax must be granted  by

the country under reference to persons resident in

Singapore or the United Kingdom. As exemption from

Italian income tax conferred on foreign shipowners

by  Italian  Income Tax law was  limited  to  such

shipowners as did not possess an establishment  in

Italy, whereas the Singapore Ordinance contained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



no such limitation, the proviso to section

13  (1) (p) was not fulfilled, and therefore  that

section should not properly be construed so as  to

exempt  non-resident Italian shipowners. Since  it

was  considered  anomalous that  British  shipping

benefitted from the exemption under Italian Income

Tax  law, while Italian shipowners were not exempt

from  income tax in the then Colony of  Singapore,

the  then Legislative Council was asked to approve

a resolution that any person resident in Italy and

carrying  on  the  business  of  a  shipowner   or

charterer  otherwise than through an establishment

in   Singapore  shall  be  exempt  from  all   the

provisions of the income Tax Ordinance,  1947,  in

regard  to the gains or profits from his business.

The   Income  Tax  Ordinance,  as  amended  during

Malaysia, now provides relief from tax on shipping

only  where  such  relief has been  secured  by  a

double   taxation  agreement.  As   the   previous

resolution   was   passed  primarily   to   accord

reciprocal  income tax exemption  between  British

and  Italian  shipowners during the colonial  era,

the  resolution has become an anomaly when the law

was  changed during Malaysia, and therefore should

be  rescinded  and replaced by a  double  taxation

arrangement  between  the  Singapore  and  Italian

Governments,  it follows that Italian non-resident

shipowners  are  placed in an  identical  position

with all other foreign countries which do not have

a double taxation agreement with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the resolution,

passed  on 20th November, 1951, by the Legislative

Council  of  the  Colony of  Singapore  under  the

provisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  1947

(No.39  of 1947) to exempt any person resident  in

Italy and carrying on the business of shipowner or

charterer otherwise than through and establishment

in Singapore from all the provisions of the Income

Tax  Ordinance,  1947, which relate  to  gains  or

profits  from  such  business, be  rescinded  with

effect from the 1st day of January, 1966.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the resolution,

passed on 16th September, 1952, by the Legislative

Council  of  the  Colony of  Singapore  under  the

provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947  (No.

39  of  1947)  to  exempt any person  resident  in

establishment in Singapore from all the provisions

of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947, which relate to

gains  or profits from such business, he rescinded

with effect from the 1st day of January, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a resolution similar to the one I have

referred  to  in the case of Italy  just  now  was

passed  by  the  Legislative Council  in  1952  to

exempt  residents  of Sweden from  income  tax  or

shipping profits, and the remarks I have made with

regard  to the Italian case apply equally  in  the

case  of  Sweden,  except that in  1954  a  double

taxation   arrangement   was   effected    between

Singapore and Sweden by extending the then  United

Kingdom/Swedish  Double  Taxation  Convention   to

Singapore. This agreement was terminated  in  1961

and action was taken to negotiate a new agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of Malaysia, such agreements

were   the   prerogative  of  the  then   Federal Government, and as at Singapore Day no  agreement

had   been   reached.  Meanwhile  the   anomalous

resolution   of  the  then  Legislative   Council

requires to he rescinded so that the way  may  be

prepared  for  the conclusion of  an  appropriate

double taxation agreement with the Government  of

Sweden.

<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my privilege to present

the  first  Budget of the independent Republic  of

Singapore  to  this House today. The events  which

led  to  the separation of Singapore from Malaysia

are still fresh in our memories. I would not dwell

on  them,  except to say that whilst  independence

has  brought  about an immediate relief  from  the

frustration of being governed by a hostile Central

Government and given us greater freedom of  action

in  the field of international relations, as  well

as  restoration  of control over fiscal,  monetary

and   economic  policies,  we  also  acquire   new

responsibilities and new dimensions are  added  to

our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my duty, as Finance Minister, to take

a  dispassionate and searching look at Singapore's

position  today and mark the steps we should  take

to  ensure,  first, our survival, and second,  our

prosperity.



<br><br><i>Basic Problem</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My predecessor has never failed to remind us that

basically  our  problem stems from our  large  and

increasing  population living in  a  small  island

with  no natural resources. The entrepot trade  on

which we thrived and prospered in the past is  not

expanding fast enough to provide the jobs for  the

increasing  population,  nor  is  it  capable   of

generating  sufficient  revenue  to  maintain  the

level  of education, housing, medical and  welfare

services  that a modern civilised society expects.

Hence,  five years ago we charted the  course  for

industrialisation to complement entrepot trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Entrepot Trade and industrialisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy will have to be the maintenance of our

traditional  position as a trading centre,  whilst

adding  an  industrial  base  to  our  traditional

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation and entrepot trade are not

incompatible  as has been shown in  Rotterdam  and

Hamburg.  The  needs  and  requirements   for   an

entrepot  trade  within an industrialised  country

can  be met by the creation of a free trade  zone.

It  is  not  the  Government's intention  to  levy

duties on goods not produced and not likely to  be

produced  in Singapore. Thus, traditional  imports

of  products such as rubber, copra, pepper and  so

on,  will not attract duty. Similarly, goods which

feature  in  the tourist trade like cameras,  tape

recorders,  fountain pens and watches will  remain

duty  free. For those which are dutiable  we  have

set  up  an  area to cater for the  needs  of  our

entrepot trade. An expert from the United  Nations

is  studying ways and means of improving our  free

port   facilities   so   that   our   policy    of

industrialisation will not, in any way, hinder the

efficient handling of our entrepot trade.



<br><br><i>Neutral Stand</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy of being friendly to anyone who wants

to  trade with us has begun to pay dividends.  The

goodwill  mission led by the Deputy Prime Minister

has  met  with  favourable response from  all  the

countries visited and has returned with reports of

the  desire of countries wanting to increase trade

with  us. Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R. are  sending

trade missions and have invited us in return. This

policy of friendliness to all nations is beginning

to  show  results,  for the People's  Republic  of

China has already purchased rubber from us after a

long lapse of time. Therefore, we can look forward

to an increase in our trading activities.



<br><br><i>Indonesian Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, naturally, since Singapore's

independence and the events in Indonesia following

30th September, resumption of trade with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia looms large in the minds of many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat again that our position as

a  trading  centre in South-East Asia is  open  to

everyone,  including Indonesia,  so  long  as  our

security  and  that  of  our immediate  neighbour,

Malaysia, is not jeopardized.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole machinery of Government is geared to

give  the maximum incentives to existing  and  new

industries but it now has to help find markets for

them  too.  We must make every effort to  increase

the   rate  of  expansion  to  provide  sufficient

primary  jobs  in industry to absorb  the  growing

army of unemployed.



<br><br><i>Prospective Markets</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Mr Speaker, to go into some

detail on the question of prospective markets  for

our  manufactured goods. These fall  roughly  into

four categories:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Markets in the developed, highly

industrialised countries of the world;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) New markets in Africa and Eastern Europe;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Markets to be provided by those countries

which have been consistently running favourable

balances of trade with us; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Markets in those countries which have a

vested  interest  in  ensuring  that  Singapore

remains  viable  and stable so that,  in  turn,

their   own   security   interests   are    not

jeopardized.



<br><br>In  recent  years  increasing attention  has  been

focussed  on  the  need for highly  industrialised

countries  to  provide  outlets  for  the  simpler

manufactures of developing countries,  if  for  no

other   reason  than  to  assist  the  latter   in

financing  imports of machines and  other  capital

equipment   needed   for   development.    Various

international conferences have been held and there

appears   to   be   increasing  realisation   that

enlightened   self-interest   among   the   highly

developed economies would lead to enhanced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



market opportunities for the developing countries.

But this can only come about slowly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to developing new markets, this can

and should be done. Our policy of neutrality,

non-alignment  between the big power  blocs,  together

with our active identification with the Afro-Asian

world  gives  us  a  good  start  with  a  growing

consumer  world in Afro-Asia. Trade missions  will

soon  be  sent to these countries to  explore  and

develop these markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a cursory look at our trade

statistics  will  reveal that  there  are  several

countries  which  enjoy a favourable  position  in

their  trade with us. We propose to persuade  them

to  buy  more  of  our  products,  especially  our

manufactured  goods,  and  thereby   redress   the

imbalance. We will shortly take the initiative  to

enter into trade agreements with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed, Mr Speaker, in the three

categories  of  prospective markets  that  I  have

mentioned, even with the necessary effort, results

will  be  slow in coming, nor are they  likely  to

have   an   immediate  impact   on   our   growing

unemployment problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the fourth category of markets -

markets in those countries which have more than  a

passing  interest in our survival. My  predecessor

and   colleague,  the  Minister  of  Defence,  has

already referred in passing to this subject a  few

weeks  ago. Our asset in this respect is  that  we

occupy  a  position  of  some  importance  in  the

strategic   defence  chain  of  South-East   Asia.

Countries  such  as the United Kingdom,  Australia

and New Zealand, amongst others, are therefore not

uninterested  that  the  link  through   Singapore

should  remain  intact. These  countries  have  an

interest that we survive and to this end  to  give

us  export  opportunities. It would be unrealistic

and  futile  to demand unlimited and  unrestricted

access  to  these  markets,  for  no  nation   can

countenance  imports  of such  volume  that  would

imperil   their  domestic  industries.   We   have

estimated that it will be necessary to find  about

8,000 to 10,000 new jobs in industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



each  year  for the next five to seven  years.  In

value  terms this only means an additional  export

of  M$120 million each year on a cumulative basis.

This  is  well within the capacity of  the  highly

developed countries to share and absorb. Care  and

restraint will be exercised in selecting  products

which  will not disrupt their domestic industries.

They range from cutlery and ceramics to electrical

and  automobile component parts, optical equipment

and  so on. In all, Mr Speaker, about 200 to  300

products. Essentially, emphasis will be  on  those

products   which  we  can  make  efficiently   and

competitively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually, over a period of time, Singapore

should be able to acquire the necessary efficiency

to  compete in world markets on her own  strength.

When  we have reached that stage, we in turn  will

be  prepared  to  extend to  others  the  kind  of

assistance which we are now seeking. Our proposals

are,  therefore,  a logical step  in  the  overall

industrial  development pattern of the undeveloped

sectors of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be making formal approaches to these

countries.  In  the  event  that  no  satisfactory

solutions  are  reached, then our whole  political

future  will  have  to be re-assessed  and  a

re-alignment is inescapable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to attain our objective in

transforming  Singapore into a  modern  industrial

nation, Government action alone is not sufficient.

There  must  be a concerted effort by  Government,

entrepreneurs and workers alike - the whole nation

must work as one. We have laid the infrastructure,

we  have provided the incentives and we have shown

the way ahead to more rapid industrialisation.  It

is now up to the people of Singapore to respond to

the  call.  The  entrepreneurs must  ensure  by  a

proper   choice   of  industries  and   industrial

associates that the products manufactured are of a

quality   and   price  competitive  with   foreign

products.  Our workers must also be  prepared  for

factory  discipline and hard work  to  make  costs

competitive  in  the international  market.  There

must   be   restraint  and  discipline   on   both

entrepreneurs and workers if we are to emulate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



efforts  which  brought about the  great  economic

recoveries  after  the world war  in  Germany  and

Japan.  Let  our industrialisation be  established

first  on a firm basis before we think of  sharing

the  gains. Anti-nationalist elements even now are

trying  their best to foil us in our  attempts  to

bring  about a more just and stable society.  They

will  try to dupe the rank and file of our workers

into  prematurely  demanding immediate  short-term

benefits which will kill the goose even before the

golden  eggs  are laid. This is where  progressive

entrepreneurs and responsible trade unionists need

to  exercise  restraint, patience  and  above  all

discipline and judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of our entrepreneurs who are

pursuing labour policies more suited for a  bygone

age.  They  simply  do  not recognise  that  trade

unions  exist, even responsible ones. Unless  they

sit  up  and take notice that we are living  in  a

modern world where responsible unions have come to

stay, they will be letting themselves in for a lot

of  inconvenience and trouble. On the other  hand,

trade  union  leaders must dissuade their  members

from   following  the  suicidal  lines  of  action

advocated by the anti-nationalists. It pays  these

anti-nationalists  to create  unemployment,  chaos

and  disorder, for these are the conditions  under

which they thrive. It is the duty of every one  of

us  to see that they do not succeed in their  evil

intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<br><br><i>Relationship with Malaysia</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it will be fitting, at

this  stage,  for  me  to  dwell  briefly  on  our

economic  relations with Malaysia since  Singapore

Day.  The immediate effect of separation  was  the

loss of the expectation of a Common Market and the

retention  by  Singapore of all its revenues.  The

quota  restrictions which were  in  force  on  the

recommendations  of  the  Tariff  Advisory  Board,

prior  to Singapore Day, were also made applicable

to  goods from Malaysia after that day. Honourable

Members  will  be  aware  of  the  arguments   and

counterarguments that were put forth on both sides

of  the  Causeway for removal of restrictions  and

freeing of the trade. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



our  part, we suggested that there should be broad

agreement   on  principles  relating   to   closer

economic  co-operation  and  that  following  this

trade  restrictions must be simultaneously lifted.

They  maintained that restrictions should be first

removed  before  talks  on  economic  co-operation

could begin. Finally, we agreed on 9th October  to

mutual removal of restrictions. Events since  then

have  shown that negotiations will take some time

in producing any result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers entering Malaysia are treated

as  those of a third country, as indeed they  have

been all these years. There has been no change. On

the  other  hand,  our manufacturers  now  have  a

protected  Singapore market where there  was  none

before.  But Singapore's separation and  the  fact

that  there is no common market with Malaysia does

not  mean  that all economic, cultural  and  other

ties  between  the two countries  should  also  be

severed. One-third of their trade is with  us  and

about  a quarter of our trade is with them.  These

ties  have been built up over the last 140  years.

No  one can deny that continuation of these  links

is  of mutual advantage. Furthermore, in terms  of

history,   the   two   territories   are    really

inseparable. And it must not be forgotten that the

destruction of one means destruction of the other.

For this reason, we will never initiate any policy

which will have the effect of further severing the

two  countries.  We have made many proposals,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  without  receiving  any  positive

rejoinder.  Perhaps we may be going too  fast  for

Kuala Lumpur in putting up these proposals so soon

after separation. But we are always ready to adapt

ourselves to their tempo of working, provided they

are  willing  to  meet us half-way.  If  they  are

sincere  in  working towards closer  economic

co-operation,  let  us in turn hear  from  them  what

their  proposals are. Let us start  the  New  Year

right.  Let us sit round the table, Ministers  and

officials, instead of each country being forced to

work  out how each can do without the other. I  am

willing, Mr Speaker, Sir, to meet the Malaysian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



Ministers and their officials at any time  and  at

any place of their own choice early in January  to

work out measures for co-operation in the field of

trade and industry. We will continue to reason, to

discuss and argue that economic co-operation holds

no  dangers  to  either. But in the meanwhile,  we

will  launch  forth into new markets and  redouble

our   efforts  to  increase  our  trade  with  all

countries of the West and of the East and of

Afro-Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			<br><br><i>Currency</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on relations with Malaysia, Mr Speaker, I

should  like  to  refer to the traditional  common

currency  which  we  have  had  all  these  years.

Honourable  Members may recall that the  Malaysian

Government  in December 1964, while Singapore  was

still  a  State  of Malaysia, gave notice  of  its

intention to Brunei to wind up the Currency Board.

Under  this system our currency is backed  to  the

extent  of 110 per cent or more by external assets

and  is one of the main pillars on which financial

stability has rested in the past. We have now been

informed that the notice referred to earlier still

stands  and  discussions are now in progress  with

the   Malaysian  Government  as  to  the  currency

arrangements  which  should  be  entered  into  on

expiry  of the notice in June next year. I am  not

in   a   position  to  divulge  details   of   the

discussions.   The  Government   recognises   that

soundness  of  the currency is a prerequisite  for

financial  stability  and public  confidence.  For

this reason, so far as Singapore is concerned,  we

will  ensure that whatever the arrangements  which

may  be arrived at, our currency will continue  to

be  backed  by  100 per cent or more  in  external

assets.



<br><br><i>External Resources</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of a period of momentous change in

our  history, it will be well to take stock of our

present financial position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to prudent budgetting and careful

allocation  of resources by the Government  during

the  past  six years, our external debt stands  at

only M$59



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



million, whereas our official foreign reserves  by

September  this  year, stands at M$914.7  million,

made up as follows:



<pre>

                                          Million

Singapore's share of

 Currency Board Reserves

 (estimated)            ...                M$276.4



 Government Reserves    ...                M$484.7



Reserve of Government

 Agencies such as Post

 Office Savings, C.P.F.,

 E.D.B.                 ...                M$53.7



Reserves of Public

 Authorities such as

 Public Utilities Board

 and Port of Singapore

 Authority              ...                 M$99.9



</pre>



<br><br>This sum of M$914.7 million is adequate to finance

retained  imports  for  more  than  a  year   - a

position  which  is  strong by  any  international

standard  -  and it is our intention to  maintain

this  position  of strength. We will  explore  and

take advantage of all opportunities for loans from

international  bodies such as the World  Bank  and

will  seek  other  avenues of  external  loans  to

finance our development projects. But it would  be

unwise to rely too much on them. Our aim, Sir,  is

for  more  trade, not more aid,  for  by  this  we

retain our freedom of action and self-respect.



<br><br><i>Review of Economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy continues to be

robust.  There was steady growth during  the  last

few      years,      Indonesian      confrontation

notwithstanding.  The economic  performance  of  a

country  from year to year is best judged  by  the

rate  of growth of its national income. The  House

will  recall  that  when  assessing  the  economic

effects of confrontation, it was estimated that if

the  Indonesian  embargo  on  trade  with  us  was

completely successful, it would lead to  a  direct

decline  of  about 8.7 per cent  in  our  national

income. It gives me great pleasure to report  that

in  1964,  Singapore's national  income  stood  at

M$2,811 million, which reflected a rate of  growth

of  some  two per cent over 1963. This meant  that

the   growth  in  the  other  sectors   not   only

completely offset the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



loss  in national income as a result of Indonesian

confrontation but, indeed, went on  to  achieve  a

net increase. This clearly shows the resilience of

Singapore  to  absorb  and  overcome  sudden   and

drastic declines in earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's capacity to overcome such national

occupational hazards is rein forced by our

performance in external trade in the current year.

The value of external trade during the first nine

months of the year totalled M$5,041.0 million,

showing a 8.6 per cent increase over the

corresponding period of the previous year. This is

a creditable performance considering the fact that

trade in 1964 declined by about 19 per cent

compared with 1963, as a result of Indonesian

confrontation. Exports for the year were also up

by 7.9 per cent while imports rose by 9.3 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a third good economic indicator is

the  volume  of business transacted by banks.  For

the first nine months of 1965 deposits as well  as

loans  and advances of banks have shown increases.

Commercial  bank deposits at the end of  September

1965  stood  at  M$1,164.3 million  compared  with

M$1,137.2  million  at the end  of  December  last

year. This is an increase of 2.4 per cent in  nine

months. The most significant increase occurred  in

fixed  deposits which showed a rise  of  12.4  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average monthly level of loans and advances

to  customers  in  1965 stands at M$937.4  million

which  is  an increase of 11.2 per cent  over  the

average  monthly  level in  1964  which  stood  at

$842.9  million. Despite Indonesian  confrontation

and  the  sudden shock of separation,  banks  have

maintained  confidence in Singapore's  economy  by

increasing credit necessary for the transaction of

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, we have seen that Singapore's

national income in 1964 showed a net increase of 2

per cent. One of the underlying factors which kept

economic  activity at this level in 1964  was  the

substantial  growth  of  gross  capital  formation

which  rose  from  $323 million in  1963  to  $415

million in 1964, an increase of $92 million or  28

per  cent compared with an average rate of 22  per

cent during the years 1959 to 1963.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increased rate of investment was undertaken by

both  the  public and the private  sector.  Public

sector capital formation consists of public  works

such  as  construction of new ring roads, low-cost

housing, expansion of utility services, e.g. power

and    water,    and   industrial   infrastructure

development,  e.g. the Jurong Industrial  Estate.

Details  on the rate of development will be  given

later  on  in my address when I review development

expenditure in the past year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private sector capital formation consists mainly

of  two  components, namely, building construction

and investment in new manufacturing industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly average area of building commenced in

the first eight months of 1965 is 1,564,000 square

feet,  which is an increase of 28.9 per cent  over

the  average monthly building activities commenced

in   1964.   In  value  terms,  the  corresponding

increase in building commenced is $1,482,000 or 17

per  cent  above  the  average  monthly  level  of

$1,265,000  in  1964.  Area  of  buildings   under

construction  as at end of August 1965  stands  at

29.2  million square feet or 34.4 per  cent  above

the  area under construction at the end of  August

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of private sector capital

formation   takes  the  form  of   fixed   capital

investment   in   new  manufacturing   industries.

Capital    investment   on   fixed    assets    by

manufacturing     companies    awarded     pioneer

certificates  at  the end of October  1965  totals

M$223.5  million compared with $170.4  million  at

the end of the corresponding month last year. This

is an increase of 31 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth of Singapore's economy in the past year

can  also  be  seen  in  increased  production  of

manufacturing  industries. In terms of  industrial

output,  provisional data derived  from  the  1964

Census of Industrial Production indicate that even

with the fall in rubber processing activity, there

was  an  estimated growth of 16 per cent  in  1964

over 1963. Industrial output in 1964 was estimated

at  $1,052  million compared with $909 million  in

1963.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, 35 new pioneer manufacturing companies

commenced production, bringing the total number of

pioneer firms in production up to 82. In addition,

another    63   pioneer   factories   are    under

construction or being established. The 82  pioneer

firms  already in production are presently  giving

employment  to 9,000 workers compared  with  4,200

workers  employed in 1964. The level of employment

will  rise  to  14,300 workers  when  these  firms

achieve full production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's gratifying rate of economic

performance  in the year under review has  enabled

our people to buy more of the good things of life.

The number of new motor-cars registered during the

first  ten months of 1965 showed an in, crease  of

7,528 or 7.6 per cent over December 1964. We  have

reached the stage today where there is one car for

every  18  Singaporeans. Motor-cycles and scooters

registered have also gone up by 5,263 units or  10

per  cent above December 1964. By the end  of  the

year  the overall rate of increase in new vehicles

registered  may  well be 10 per  cent  over  1964.

Similarly,  television sets  imported  during  the

first nine months of the year were valued at  $7.6

million compared with imports of $5.9 million  for

the  corresponding period of 1964, an increase  of

28 per cent.



<br><br><i>General Review of Revenue and Expenditure in 1965</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now come to the general

review  of revenue and expenditure for this  year.

In   the   original  Estimates  of   Revenue   and

Expenditure for 1965, when Singapore was still  in

Malaysia,  revenue  accruing  to  the  State   was

estimated  at $339.6 million and State expenditure

(including  a  transfer  of  $20  million  to  the Development   Fund)   at  $359.8   million.   With

separation  both revenue and expenditure  in  1965

will he substantially increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of additional revenue reverting wholly to

the  Singapore  Government are shown  in  a  paper

being  presented  as  Supplementary  Estimates  of

Revenue, 1965. The increase in revenue amounts  to

$43.2 million, representing the 40 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



cent  that would have been payable to the  Central

Government  under  Malaysia.  Total  estimates  of

revenue  for the year will therefore be  increased

to $382.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October $310.3 million of the total estimated

revenue was collected. Another $72 million  should

be  collected in the last two months of this year,

bringing total revenue to $382.3 million, or  $0.5

million short of the estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side Singapore will now have

to  bear  the expenditure of those departments  in

Singapore which were formerly Federal departments,

e.g.  Police,  Posts and Telecoms, Civil  Aviation

and  so  on,  as  well as two new  Ministries  -

Defence  and  Foreign Affairs.  For  this  purpose

provision  of  $39.3 million is  being  sought  as

Supplementary Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Supplementary Estimates a sum of $6.7

million  is  also being sought for five  heads  of

expenditure  whose 1965 provision is insufficient.

The  total of $46 million being sought will  bring

total  estimates of expenditure for  the  year  to

$405.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual outlay up to 31st October, 1965, amounted

to  $286.4 million. Expenditure for the  last  two

months  of  the  year,  including  a  $20  million

transfer to the Development Fund, is estimated  to

be approximately $103.4 million. Total expenditure

for  the  year  will, therefore, be around  $389.8

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With total expenditure for the year amounting to

$389.8  million  arid  total  receipts  of  $382.3

million  only,  a  deficit  of  $7.5  million   is

expected.  Since the expenditure figure of  $389.8

million includes a capital transfer of $20 million

there is, in fact, a surplus of $12.5 million from

our  current account. The surplus in 1964 was only

$3.1  million. Considering the problems we had  to

face  on  account of confrontation and  the  large

sums  that  we had to contribute to the  Malaysian

Government towards defence and internal  security,

things  have  turned out far better  than  we  had

dared to hope.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Revenue, 1965</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of tobacco duty and stamp

duty, revenue from the other taxes has come up  to

expectations.  Income  Tax is  expected  to  yield

$99.3  million -- which is nearly $5 million  more

than  the  sum  collected in  1964.  Although  the

increase could be attributed partly to the changes

in the rates and basis of assessment introduced by

the  Malaysian  Government, whereby tax-payers  at

the base had to pay more and the withdrawal of the

concession to working wives of separate assessment

for  earned  income,  the yield  from  Income  Tax

clearly indicates that the effect of confrontation

on    taxable   earnings   in   1964   has    been

insignificant, if at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indications are that duty from petroleum will

reach  $51.8  million this year. This exceeds  the

sum estimated for the year by $7.8 million and  is

$11.3  million more than the amount  collected  in

1964. Registration fees for vehicles are likely to

show  an  increase from $5.9 million  in  1964  to

approximately $6.4 million this year - a  rise  of

slightly more than half a million dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs duty and excise duty on liquor are

expected  to  amount to $19.5  million  and  $14.8

million  respectively. The sum  of  $19.5  million

from  Customs duty is about the same as for  1964.

Excise  duty has, however, risen by about  half  a

million   dollars.  Entertainment   duty,   though

expected  to  be  about  $0.2  million  below  the

estimate of $7.5 million, is in fact $1.4  million

more  than in 1964. These increases, though small,

are all significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipts from stamp duty are anticipated to yield

only  $5.7  million this year -  a  drop  of  $1.3

million  below  the  amount  collected  in   1964.

Property  tax,  however, is not affected  and  the

estimated sum of $58.1 million is expected  to  be

realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco duty is likely to suffer a fall from

$43.6  million  in 1964 to about  $42  million  in

1965.  The  fall  is  due to  a  decrease  in  the

consumption of imported cigarettes and  the  trend

to  switch  from  the use of leaf-tobacco  bearing

full  rates  of  duty  to leaf-tobacco  attracting

preferential rates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Expenditure, 1965</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in expenditure are as usual in

respect   of   expenditure  on  social   services;

especially  expenditure on Education and  Hospital

services.  The Ministry of Education is seeking  a

supplementary provision of $5.4 million. This will

raise  expenditure on Education to $113.3 million.

This  is about $10 million above that of 1964;  an

increase   of  approximately  10  per  cent.   The

Hospitals Division requires an additional  sum  of

$780,000 making a total of $38.7 million  for  the

year; which is also about 10 per cent higher  than

the  previous year. The Ministry of Health is  the

second  largest head of expenditure and  like  the

Ministry  of  Education has also  been  showing  a

rather  steep rise in expenditure during the  past

few  years.  The  supplementary  provisions  being

sought by the remaining three heads of expenditure

are  minor ones. A sum of $300,000 is being sought

by   the   Public  Works  Department  for   street

lighting.  This  is on account of the  accelerated

pace with which streets are being lighted up.  The

Accountant-General   is  seeking   an   additional

$76,000 and Inland Revenue $96,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of the five heads of

expenditure  just mentioned, the  other  heads  of

expenditure  are expected to manage  within  their

provisions.   However,   as   the   Estimates   of

Expenditure were based on an assessment of  actual

requirements, no substantial savings are  expected

from any head of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<br><br><i>Financial Arrangements Under Malaysia</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it would not be out of place

for me to mention here the various implications of

the  financial  arrangements which  existed  under

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Annex J, 40 per cent of taxes which were of

a  Federal nature and collected in Singapore  were

to  be  paid  to the Central Government  to  cover

Singapore's    share    of   Central    Government

expenditure covering:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the expenditure of Federal Departments in

Singapore;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a share of expenditure for defence and

internal security;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) a share of expenditure for external

affairs,   Parliament  and   other   common Central

Government services.



<br><br>For  1964,  Singapore's share of  expenditure  for

defence  was  assessed at $75 million  out  of  an

estimated  total expenditure of $441.5  million - that  is  roughly  17 per cent of total  Malaysian

expenditure;  and  its share  of  expenditure  for

external  affairs  and common  Central  Government

services  estimated  at $7.5  million  out  of  an

estimated  total expenditure of $43.19  million - again also about 17 per cent of total expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to available figures, the actual

expenditure  for 1964 of these items  amounted  to

$97.5  million  while the 40  per  cent  share  of

revenue   derived  by  the  Malaysian   Government

amounted   to   $119.9  million.   The   Malaysian

Government, thus, gained a gross surplus of  $22.4

million in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computed on the same basis, the Malaysian

Government suffered a small loss of $5.13  million

from  Malaysia Day (that is 16th September,  1963)

to the end of 1963, but gained a surplus of $31.64

million for the period from 1st January this  year

up  to  Singapore Day. For the whole  duration  of

Singapore's  inclusion  in Malaysia,  the  Central

Government  gained  a  gross  surplus  of   $48.91

million.  This  total does not take  into  account

some  ten  odd  million dollars  per  annum  since

Malaysia  Day representing our share  of  currency

profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the State Government rendered

certain   services  on  behalf  of   the   Central

Government  during Malaysia and  these  claims,  a

substantial part of which were agreed in principle

during  Malaysia, are expected to be settled  next

year.  These  do  not include old claims  such  as

Malaysia's   share   of   contributions   to   the

University  of  Singapore  which  are  yet  to  be

settled.



<br><br><i>Estimates 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased responsibilities, which Singapore

has  to  bear on account of its new status  as  an

independent nation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



are  clearly  reflected  in  the  1966  Estimates.

Estimated expenditure is $506.56 million.  Revenue

has also correspondingly increased, mainly because

Singapore  no longer has to share the proceeds  of

its taxes with any other Government. Total revenue

for  the  year  is estimated at $537 million.  The

estimated   surplus,  before   transfer   to   the

Development  Fund, is thus $30.44 million.  It  is

proposed  to transfer $30 million next year.  This

will leave a small balance of approximately half a

million  dollars.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   most

gratifying feature of the Budget for next year  is

that  it is being balanced without having  to  run

down our reserves and on top of it we hope to show

a small surplus as well.



<br><br><i>Expenditure 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure of the Ministry of Education for next

year remains the highest. The estimate for 1966 is

$129.2  million,  which is  nearly  $16.3  million

above the sum expected to be spent this year.  The

increase is on account of the increasing number of

children  moving  up  from  Primary  to  Secondary

Schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the expansion in hospital services, a

sum  of  $43.6 million is estimated to be required

for  the  Hospitals Division of  the  Ministry  of

Health,  a  rise of $4.9 million over  expenditure

this year. The rate of increase is thus almost  as

high as that of expenditure on Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial increase of about $5 million,

bringing  the  provision up to  $28.8  million  is

being provided for the Public Health Division, The

major  part of the increase is for the acquisition

of   more  staff  and  equipment  to  improve  the

standard of cleanliness of the growing city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new major burdens which Singapore now has to

bear are in respect of internal security defence.

Expenditure for the Police is estimated at $40.3

million. Details of expenditure for defence have

yet to be finalised. Very roughly, a sum of

approximately $30 million will be required, and a

block vote of this sum has  been entered under the

Ministry of the Interior and Defence head of

expenditure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $4.2 million has been provided for the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main cost of this

Ministry  is  in the expenditure of  our  missions

abroad.  The  amount required will depend  on  the

number  of  missions we are able to  set  up  next

year. It is, therefore, difficult to estimate with

any  precision  at  this stage, and  supplementary

provision  may  he required in the course  of  the

year if more missions are established.



<br><br><i>Revenue, 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the major taxes are expected to show

increases next year. Customs and Excise duties  on

petroleum   products,  together   with   the   new

protective  tariffs  introduced  in  October  this

year,  are  estimated to yield $47.8  million,  an

increase of $3.8 million over 1965 Estimates.  The

estimated  revenue of $20.1 million  from  Customs

duties  on liquor is $1.6 million higher than  the

estimate  for this year. Property Tax is estimated

to  increase from $58.1 million estimated for 1965

to $65 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a steady decline in the revenue

from  tobacco  tax.  Based on present  trend,  the

revenue  for  1966 is estimated at  $42.5  million

against  the  1965  estimate of $48  million.  The

reasons have been dealt with in the review of  the

current year's revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a tax on fuel oil by the

Malaysian Government created considerable problems

in certain manufacturing industries as the cost of

production was increased. Within powers  available

under   the  Customs  Ordinance,  all  bona   fide

manufacturers   utilising  fuel  oil   have   been

exempted  from  the  fuel oil  tax  as  from  19th

November  this  year. The Public Utilities  Board,

also  a  major consumer of fuel oil, has not  been

exempted  from the fuel oil tax as such.  Measures

are  examined to ascertain whether it is  possible

for  the Public Utilities Board not to pass on  to

manufacturers the tax element on fuel oil used  in

generating electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective duties introduced on 11th October

this  year  in  the  wake  of  duties  imposed  by

Malaysia also have a revenue effect. Revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



from  these new 154 protective duties are expected

to yield $14.6 million next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No new Customs duties are expected to he

introduced  for revenue purposes next  year.  Such

Customs duties as will he introduced will  be  for

protective reasons and are not expected  to  yield

any significant revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review must now be made of other taxes. On the

day  of Singapore's separation from Malaysia,  the

repeal of the Turnover Tax was announced. Nineteen

days  later, the Capital Gains Tax was  rescinded.

No revenue was derived from these taxes. As

three-quarters  of  the  fiscal  year  had  expired   by

Singapore  Day, it was not possible to  change  or

rescind  all  the  unsatisfactory fiscal  measures

introduced  by the Central Government during  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Income Tax Bill has been introduced at this

meeting  of Parliament to make such amendments  to

the income Tax law as are necessary to accord with

the sovereign and independent status of Singapore.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will now point out  the  main

features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) With effect from 1st January, 1966,

exemptions  from tax in respect  of

owner-occupied  houses  will  he  limited  to   a

maximum  net  annual value  of  $3,000  and

restricted to a single property as  it  was

in    Singapore   before   Malaysia,   thus

rescinding    the   Central    Government's

unrestricted  exemption  of  owner-occupied

houses  without limit as to value or number

since  1st  January,  1965.  Indiscriminate

exemption  wil1  favour  wealthy   property

owners unduly, and such a policy is not  in

accordance  with the objective  of  a  more

just and equal society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For the year of assessment 1966, working

wives in Singapore will again be allowed to

choose to be assessed separately from their

husbands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



in  respect of their earned income.  During

Malaysia  the combined incomes  of  working

husbands and wives were aggregated for  the

purpose  of  income tax, and only  a  small

relief was allowed for the wives' earnings.

To  encourage half our population to engage

in   productive  work  and   increase   the

national  income,  wives will  be  assessed

separately next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The opportunity will also be taken to restore

the   rates  of  certain  personal  reliefs   for

individual taxpayers and bodies of persons to the

pre-Malaysian  levels, with  the  exception  that

child allowances will apply to a maximum of  five

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The rates of tax on the higher income

group  will  be  restored to  pre-Malaysian

levels as the rates imposed during Malaysia

are   considered  incompatible   with   the

principle of imposing the heavier burden of

taxation on those best able to bear it. For

example, the Singapore upper rate of tax of

55 per cent on personal incomes of $100,000

or more per year was reduced by the Central

Government  to 50 per cent during  Malaysia

with  effect from 1st January, 1965.  There

will  be provision in the Bill to re-impose

upper  tax of 55 per cent with effect  from 1st January, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already announced on

I9th  November proposals to give added  incentives

to industry. Double deduction for tax purposes for

market  development  overseas  and  for  increased

local    advertisement   expenditure    for    our

manufacturers will be provided in the Bill.  There

will  also  be  flexible  powers  to  accord   key

industry, particularly expert-orientated industry,

increased rates of depreciation so that plant  and

equipment could be written



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



off  for  tax  purposes  within  three  years,  if

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these remedial measures, income

tax  collections in 1966 are expected to fall  as

compared with this year. A sum of $95.5 million is

estimated  for  1966, or a fall  of  $3.8  million

below  the estimated collections this year.  Under

the  rate  to be reintroduced, separate assessment

for earned income of working wives, which is to be

restored,  will  also reduce the  tax  payable  on

their incomes. We are also reverting, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to  the pre-Malaysian rates with  regard  to

estate duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here the intentions of the

Government  in  regard  to  the  tax  position  of

persons  who  are resident either in Singapore  or

Malaysia  but derive income from both territories.

It  is  quite  clear that in view  of  Singapore's

independent status the existing "combined  income"

provisions  in  both  the  Singapore  and  Malayan

Income   Tax  Laws  will  have  to  be   reviewed.

Discussions with the Malaysian Government are  now

in train with the objective of concluding a double

taxation  agreement at an early date so  that  the

position of taxpayers in both territories  can  be

put on a proper basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I may

also  mention that the Government desires to enter

into   double   taxation  agreement   with   other

countries, especially those whose residents are or

will  be  investing in Singapore. These agreements

will  remove the inhibition to investment inherent

in double taxation of profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<br><br><i>Second Five-Year Development Plan</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, 1966 marks the first year of - the

Second  Development  Plan  of  Singapore.  It   is

opportune  for  us  to assess  what  was  achieved

during the past five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating the First Development Plan, major

emphasis  was  laid  on  economic  development  to

create conditions favourable for industrial growth

through construction of infrastructure facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



such  as  power, water, port, industrial  estates,

arterial   roads   and  other   ancillaries.   The

Government also provides more direct assistance to

industries    by   establishing    the    Economic

Development Board. The Board provides loan as well

as   equity  capital  for  the  establishment   or

expansion of industries. In the social sector, the

aim  was limited to providing a satisfactory level

of    social   services,   particularly   housing,

education and health amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Plan drawn up for the period 1961-64

envisaged a total development expenditure of  $871

million.  However,  at the  end  of  1964  it  was

decided to extend the First Plan for another  year

so  that  Singapore, as a State of Malaysia  then,

could  follow the development planning  period  of

Malaysia  as a whole. Hence, final expenditure  of

the  extended First Plan for 1961-65,  instead  of

from  196l-64, is estimated to total $944 million.

Plan  allocation and final expenditure are  likely

to be as follows:-

<pre>



                  		Plan Provision

                       		   1961-64

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of expenditure on development in the

public  sector  under  the  First  Plan  showed  a

substantial  increase over the  five-year  period.

Expenditure rose from $132.11 million in the first

year  of the Plan to around $242 million in  1965.

This  is  an indication of increasing capacity  of

the  public  Sector  during  the  Plan  period  to

successfully  mobilise  resources  and   undertake

developmental work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the results of the First Plan, it

will  be useful to assess the performance  of  the

economy  as a whole during this period,  including

private sector investment as well. National income

has  gone up from $2,030 million in 1960 to $2,811

million in 1964, showing an annual growth of 7 per

cent.  As population increase averaged only 3  per

cent per annum, there has been an increase in  the

per  capita  income of the country. Gross  capital

formation  has  increased even more substantially.

It  has  increased from $137.3 million in 1960  to

over  $414.7  million in 1964. This  reflects  the

level  of  increase in investment in  the  country

during this period and also clearly indicates that

private  sector  investment  has  expanded  up  to

expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the performance of the

manufacturing  sector has been  most  encouraging.

Total  output  of firms employing  more  than  ten

workers  excluding  rubber  processing,  increased

from  $465.6 million in 1960 to $843.7 million  in

1963,  while value added had increased from $142.1

million   to   $252.6  million.  These  aggregates

furnish  a measure of the substantial achievements

of the manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is now independent, the formulation

and  implementation  of the Second  Plan  must  be

within   the  new  political  framework.  A   more

realistic approach is needed in planning  for  the

future.  The Second Plan fully reflects  this  new

outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the First Plan has also helped to

change  the  strategy of planning for the  future.

Some  of  the problems, especially in  the  social

sector,  relating  to primary  education,  general

health services and housing, are now less pressing

than  they were in 1959. The birth rate has fallen

from about 4.3 per cent to about 3.2 per cent  and

the  rate of natural increase is now only 2.5  per

cent  as against 3.3 per cent in 1959. Though this

is not likely to have any immediate effects in the

Second  Plan period, it does provide for a  change

in  emphasis  in the long run. The development  of

power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



and  port  facilities  has  also  been  more  than

adequate  and  has  been  significantly  ahead  of

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, the provision of employment

opportunities  has become even  more  urgent.  The

number  of  persons  likely to  enter  the  labour

market  during  the  Second Plan  period  is  much

greater  than  in  the  previous  period.  It   is

estimated  that  about  95,000  persons  will   be

entering  the  labour market in  this  period.  In

addition, the backlog of unemployed as at the  end

of 1965, is estimated to be around 55,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a need for even more stringent

evaluation  of  development  projects.  Basically,

industries must become more competitive  in  world

markets sooner than was necessary in the past. The

emphasis in the Second Plan period will be on  the

building  up  of the industrial base largely  with

export markets in view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total Second Plan size is about $1,520

million.  Economic development  will  account  for

about 64 per cent of the total Plan outlay. Social

development projects will take up 32 per  cent  of

the  outlay and the balance of 4 per cent will  be

Public Administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocation of the Second Plan by type of

expenditure is broadly as follows :-



<pre>

                         Million



Economic development     $975.9    64.2% of Total Plan Outlay

Social development       $484.1    31.8% of Total Plan Outlay



Public Administration    $ 61.1    4.0% of Total Plan Outlay



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to Singapore's new political status

and  the need to secure alternative export markets

for our industries, the Economic Planning Unit has

been directed to re-evaluate development proposals

and  basis  of allocation of expenditure  to  take

into account the changed circumstances. Subject to

changes which may be necessary as a result of this

re-evaluation, sectoral allocation is  broadly  as

follows:



<pre>

                 		  Million

Rural and Land Development        $130.1

Public Utilities                  $316.1

Industry and Trade                $342.8

Transport and Communications      $186.7



</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



All  these  will  give the money to  be  spent  on

economic  development 64.2 per cent share  of  the

total outlay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development will account for $484 million

or 31.8 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Administration $61.4 million or 4 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the time for me to

go  into  further detail on the Second  Plan.  The

Second  Plan, which will be given a more  thorough

re-evaluation   in   the   light    of    changing

circumstances, will be tabled in the new year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<br><br><i>1966 Development Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn our attention to the 1966

Development   Estimates   which   call   for    an

expenditure  of $275 million. Total public  sector

investment  in  1966,  including  development   by

statutory  bodies financed from  their  own  funds

will,  however,  be around $314 million.  Allowing

for  a  ten  per  cent shortfall  in  performance,

actual  Government development funds required  may

total only $250 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in the 1966 Development Estimates will

be   spent  on  projects  to  be  undertaken   by

Government  Departments, tentatively approved  for

inclusion  in  the  Second Plan.  There  are  also

provisions  for  loans  and  grants  to  statutory

bodies  to  assist  them  in  carrying  out  their

development programmes as envisaged in  the  Plan.

As 1966 is the first year of the new Plan, most of

the  provisions  are for new schemes  whose  total

cost  adds up to $242.4 million, or 88.9 per  cent

of  the  total provision for the 1966  Development

Estimates.  The balance of the Development  Budget

is  made  up by revotes for spillover schemes.  In

other  words,  these are schemes  started  in  the

First  Plan  but will be completed  in  1966.  The

revotes amount to $33.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be noted that many projects, with

provisions  in the Estimates, will be  subject  to

the  sanction of the Economic Planning Unit.  This

is  to  enable further examination of the projects

to determine the best means of implementing them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds allocated to Ministries in the 1966

Estimates are as follows: -



<pre>

                   		        (In $ million)



Deputy Prime Minister    		     6.95

Ministry of Interior and Defence            16.25

Ministry of Education    		    28.74

Ministry of Health			     5.81

Ministry of Finance 			    82.93

Ministry of Culture and Social Affairs       4.83

Ministry of Law and National Development   130.14

					-------------

             				Total 275.65

					-------------



</pre>

<div align="center"><b>					</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<br><br><i>Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest claim on $6.95 million expenditure

provision for the Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry

is  Telecommunication development  which  accounts

for $3.64 million. It includes the purchase of  13

new  sets  of subscriber teleprinter equipment  in

1966  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for   the

service.  The  submarine  cable  project,  namely,

SEACOM,   has   reached  an  advanced   stage   of

implementation. By the end of 1966 or early  1967,

SEACOM   would   link  Singapore   with   Britain,

Australia,  New  Zealand and Hong Kong  with  high

grade  radio  circuit working on a 24-hour  basis.

Together  with  COMPAC  and  CONTAT,  SEACOM  will

connect  Singapore to America and Europe.  To  get

the  best advantage from this new circuit and  the

fact  that  Singapore  has been  selected  by  the

International   Communication    Union    as    an

International Telephone Switching Centre for

South-East   Asia,   it  is  proposed  to   install   an

International  Automatic Telephone Switching  Unit

which  will  cost $700,000. The amount  voted  for

1966 will be $600,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for Civil Aviation is $2.75 million.

The  main proposal is to extend the Airport runway

from  the  existing  9,000 to 10,000  feet.  Other

improvements   envisaged  for  our   International

Airport  at  Paya Lebar will be to  modernise  the

navigational  aids  to  increase  the  operational

safety  of  aircraft landing and taking  off  from

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postal services will receive $411,000 to build

two new post-offices and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



renovate  the  General Post  Office  at  Fullerton

Building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<br><br><i>Ministry of Interior and Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic and social development can only take

place,  Mr Speaker, Sir, within the framework  of

law   and   order.  Now  that  Singapore   is   an

independent  nation,  necessary  provisions  must,

therefore,  be made to strengthen and  expand  our

Police  and ancillary Forces. Hence, a sum of  $16

million  has  been allocated to  the  Ministry  of

Interior  and  Defence next  year  to  ensure  the

maintenance  of lass and order within the  country

and  also  to withstand any threats from  outside.

The  balance of the vote of $253,000 will be  used

for community development by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<br><br><i>Ministry of Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure provision for Education in 1966 has

increased  to $28.74 million compared  with  $24.8

million  provided in 1965. The funds will be  used

to construct and complete four primary schools and

19 secondary schools. In the programme of bringing

existing schools up to standard size requirements,

provisions are made for major extensions  to  five

existing  schools and the reconstruction  of  four

rural  primary  and island schools  into  standard

size schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<br><br><i>Ministry of Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Health, a scheme worth

mentioning  is  the development of a  Radioisotope

Therapy  Centre  within the Institute  of  Medical

Specialities  which the Government is  setting  up

jointly  with  the University of Singapore.  These

will  he housed in a nine-storey building  in  the

grounds  of  the General Hospital. The  Government

will  contribute up to $2.375 million. The Medical

Progress  Fund has up-to-date mobilised  donations

of over $3.0 million from the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the shortage of land and the rapid

pace  of  development in Singapore, areas suitable

for dumping rubbish and garbage waste are becoming

scarce. A careful study of the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



led to the conclusion that Singapore should resort

to  mechanical  techniques  of  disposing  garbage

waste by using a Garbage Disposal Plant as adopted

by  modern cities of other countries. In 1966  the

first Plant of 100-ton capacity will be erected at

Redhill Industrial Estate at an estimated cost  of

$2.5 million. It will take oven a year to complete

the  scheme for which $1.68 million will be  spent

in  1966.  Two  more such Garbage Disposal  Plants

will  he  built during the next five years.  Other

schemes  under Health will improve and extend  the

health services which have already achieved a high

standard    comparable   with   other   developing

countries in the region.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Finance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed expenditure for the Ministry of

Finance  is $82.93 million. The main provision  is

for   the  Jurong  Industrial  Estate  which   the

Economic   Development  Board  will  continue   to

develop. Phase I of the scheme is almost completed

and  the provision of $36.0 million for 1966 would

substantially he for the development of the Second

Phase of the scheme. Another 55.0 million has been

provided  for the development of light  industrial

estates at Kallang Park and Kallang Basin, as well

as  the  construction of a seven-storeyed  flatted

factory at Redhill Industrial Site. Government has

also provided a $10 million loan to the Board  for

industrial financing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another $30 million provision has been made under

the  Ministry of Finance to serve as a loan  which

the Public Utilities Board may require in 1966  to

finance their expansion schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Ministry of Culture and Social Affairs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Culture and Social Affairs,

ten  more children playgrounds will be built  next

year. A new fire station is proposed for Toa Payoh

which  is being rapidly developed into a satellite

town.  It will be larger than Queenstown and  will

hold  a  population of 250,000 people when  it  is

completed  as  compared to 150,000 in  Queenstown.

The Mount Emily Girls' Home will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



receive  $100,000 to extend its capacity to  house

40 more girls, bringing the total to 85 girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Printer will acquire a Rotary

Press costing $300,000 to cope with the increasing

amount  of  work.  The new year will  witness  the

completion   of  the  permanent  T.V.   Studio   at

Caldecott  Hill  which would cost  the  Government

$11.4   million.  $1.9  million  is  required   to

complete it in 1966.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Law and National Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development has

the   largest   share  of  the  1966   Development

Estimates. More than $130 million or some  50  per

cent   of  the  total  capital  Budget  has   been

allocated  to  this  Ministry. The  Housing  Board

alone will spend $45 million to build about 12,000

units  of low-cost housing in 1966 as part of  its

Second Five-Year Housing programme. The Urban

Re-development Scheme will continue next year. So far

$8.14  million has been spent and $15 million  has

been  provided for 1966. Singapore  is  the  first

developing  country to undertake an Urban  Renewal

programme  of  such size. The programme  can  only

succeed  with  the  support and  participation  by

private enterprise. As an incentive the Government

has  decided  to give a substantial  reduction  in

property  tax on new buildings completed with  the

approval  of  the  Urban Renewal  authorities.  In

other  words, Mr Speaker, Sir, private developers

participating  in  Urban Renewal  would  obtain  a

quicker and higher return from their investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Coast Reclamation and Kallang

Reclamation  Schemes will also he carried  out  by

the Housing and Development Board on behalf of the

Government. The two schemes will reclaim  300  and

100  acres  of land respectively next  year.  When

completed  in two years' time 2,000 acres  of  new

und  would  be  added  to Singapore's  territorial

domain.   A  total  of  $20.4  million  has   been

allocated for land reclamation work in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-storey car park at Market Street has

proved  successful. It is more than  75  per  cent

occupied and will soon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



fall  short of demand for more car park  bays.  In

view  of  this,  a second multi-storey  car  park,

although  on  a  smaller scale compared  with  the

existing  one,  will be built at  Phillip  Street.

This  project  will  cost $1.5  million  of  which

$300,000 will be provided in 1966 for piling  work

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development in a

joint  venture  with the Housing  and  Development

Board  will build a 22-storey building at  Erskine

Hill  to house all the departments of the Ministry

and  the  Board. The cost of the scheme  is  $14.0

million  and  Government's  share  will  be   $7.0

million. In 1966 $1.0 million has been entered  in

the Development Estimates for this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main project of the Primary Production

Department  of  the Ministry of Law  and  National

Development is the Central Abattoir and Quarantine

Station  which is being built in Jurong.  Such  an

abattoir   is   necessary  to   provide   adequate

slaughtering     facilities     to      recognised

international   standards   in   order   to   gain

acceptance  of Singapore's canned meat exports  in

world  markets. The scheme will cost $5.4  million

of  which  $4.5 million has been voted  for  1966.

Other   projects   of   the   Department   include

construction   of  more  extension  centres,   the

expansion   of   the  farm  school  at   Sembawang

Agricultural Station and the provision of improved

facilities  for extension services to farmers  and

the rural population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. has a development expenditure Budget

of $28.31 million for 1966 as compared with $23.40

million last year. For roads and bridges a sum  of

$12.38  million  will be spent; for  drainage  and

flood  alleviation,  $2.52 million,  and  sewerage

works,  $11.65 million. Construction of new  roads

and   bridges,   extensions  and  improvement   of

existing  bridges have become a  matter  of  great

urgency  because  of  the rapid  increase  in  the

number  of motor vehicles. Amongst the interesting

projects authorised for next year are the widening

of  Merdeka  Bridge and an elevated  highway  over

Mountbatten Road beginning from Guillemard  Circus

to Fort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



Road.  In regard to drainage and flood alleviation

schemes,  1966  will  see the  completion  of  the

Geylang River Scheme. The First Phase of the flood

alleviation for Bukit Timah would begin next year.

This scheme has become urgent because of the rapid

housing  and other developments along Bukit  Timah

Road   and  these  rapidly  built-up  areas   have

aggravated the flooding there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development programme of the State,

Government  does not intend to lag behind  in  the

field  of  modern sanitation which is an essential

requisite  of  a clean and healthy city.  Sewerage

schemes  will be developed to keep pace  with  the

progress  in  the  development of  industrial  and

residential  estates  and  in  the  Urban  Renewal

programme. A start will be made in 1966  to  bring

water-borne sewerage facilities to such  areas  as

the Jurong Industrial Estate, Kallang Basin, Pasir

Panjang,  Toa  Payoh  and the  two  Urban  Renewal

precincts  Sewerage schemes to  be  undertaken  in

1966  will cost $11.65 million. This brings me  to

the  end  of  the  review of next year's  Ordinary

Estimates  of Expenditure and Revenue as  well  as

the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, with wider areas of

authority  and  greater freedom  of  action  after

independence,  never  has  there  been   such   an

opportunity  as  we  now  have  to  plan  for  the

prosperity and well-being of our people.  What  is

now needed is a return to the pioneering spirit of

our  forefathers who by their dynamism, hard work,

and self-sacrifice turned what was an inhospitable

swamp  into  the largest port in South-East  Asia.

Singapore  has never before failed  to  seize  any

opportunity  for its advancement and  I  am  sure,

given the right direction, they will not let  slip

this golden opportunity to build themselves into a

great  and  prosperous nation, a  spur  for

like-minded neighbours to achieve for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>ISSUE OF BACK-PAY OF THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC DAILY RATED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYEES UNION FEDERATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw your attention to the

dispute  in  the public sector between the  Public

Daily-Rated Employees' Unions Federation  and  the

Government which has received sufficient publicity

in  the press. I can therefore safely assume  that

Members of this Parliament are conversant with the

wrongs  alleged  and this makes my  task  so  much

easier in taking up the cudgels for the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal issue involved is the question of

back-dating of wage revisions provided in  clauses

5  and 9 of the Agreement signed in November  1961

after the strike by these workers was called  off.

The strike was called off because the workers were

confident  that  the pro-labour  Government  would

abide  by the promises solemnly given and  written

into the Agreement. Clause 5 runs as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wages, working conditions and all other

terms and conditions of service of the daily-rated

employees of the Government shall he revised to be

the  same  as  those of similarly employed

daily-rated  employees  of  the  City  Council  who  are

employed   in  Government  Ministries.  The   cash

emoluments  so revised shall be payable  from  the

1st day of January, 1961."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 enveloping clause 5 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wage structure of the daily-rated employees

of  the  Government shall be revised generally  at

the  same time as the wage structure of the

daily-rated  employees of the City Council  employed  in

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



Ministries.  The cash emoluments so revised  shall

be  payable  from the 1st day of January  1961.  A

Committee  of  Representatives of the  Government,

the  City  Council,  the Housing  and  Development

Board and the Federation shall undertake the  said

revisions and shall attempt to conclude it  within

two  months from the making of this Agreement. Mr

C.  V.  Devan  Nair  may be present  at  Committee

meetings at the request of the Federation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several counts on which the Government

is   to   be   blamed  for  the   delay   in   the

implementation   of   these  clauses.   The   most

important  we could consider is that the  proposed

Committee  of  Representatives  to  undertake  the

formulation  of  a  new  wage  structure  was  not

formed. Instead one year after the Agreement,  the

Treasury   put   to  the  Union   a   unilaterally

formulated scheme, in direct contravention of  the

clause which provided for a Committee to set about

the  establishment of a new wage  structure.  This

was  signally  wrong and in our opinion  generated

most  heat.  It must be apparent to all  and  even

more to the Treasury officials that the unilateral

approach  is the quickest route to a deadlock.  It

is  therefore  difficult  to  understand  why  the

Treasury    officials   ignored   the    Agreement

stipulated   procedure  of   revising   the   wage

structure.  Joint  consultation, joint  discussion

and  joint formulation has become part and  parcel

of  healthy  industrial relations. And  those  who

signed  the Agreement in 1961 knew perfectly  well

that  a joint approach would be the only means  of

producing  quick  results. The only  thing  to  be

deduced  from  the  manner in which  the  Treasury

officials  have  gone  about  in  this  matter  is

perhaps bureaucracy has not altogether disappeared

and  the proper orientation is yet to take  place.

How else can one explain this glaring disregard of

a  provision in a collective agreement between the

Government and its workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the nearest the Commission of Inquiry came to

castigating  the  Treasury  officials  for   their

failure  here  was  in  these  words:  "that   the

procedure stipulated in clause 9 be implemented as

soon  as  possible", when on this score there  was

ample  justification for lambasting  the  Treasury

officials for their contempt of the Agreement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission of Inquiry which looked into the

grievances of the workers seems to have taken  the

view that a revision of the wage structure was  an

extraordinarily  complex  task.  This  is   hardly

credible  in  Singapore  when  we  have  shown  an

extraordinary  ingenuity  in  solving  even   more

difficult problems. What is extraordinary is  that

four  years have gone by and that we are no nearer

a  solution. The whole issue reeks of the lethargy

of  the  Treasury  officials and probably  on  the

mistaken  belief  that here is  a  sector  of  the

public   service   whose  just  demands   can   be

comfortably ignored by the higher echelons in  the

civil  service.  I hope it is a belief  they  will

hasten to correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this, I would now like to come to

the central argument of the N.T.U.C. in this case.

The Prime Minister invited the N.T.U.C. to discuss

this issue in the Parliament, where he assured us,

Members would be free to speak their minds on this

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's grounds for Parliamentary discussion of this dispute were that certain fundamental principles are involved when questions of back pay are raised. The Prime Minister has not said something new. Public funds are perennially involved in the payment of public workers, and

back-pay is no exception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal arena for a resolution of this dispute

between both parties when collective bargaining is

exhausted is in the Industrial Arbitration  Court.

The   suggestion   by   the  Prime   Minister   is

unprecedented.  Nevertheless, we have  no  quarrel

with  the  suggestion because we believe  in  this

Parliament,  rational argument will be  given  its

proper weight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary stake to us in the dispute is the

sanctity of the collective agreement. In  fact  in

Singapore today, the collective agreement  is  the

touchstone  of  industrial stability.  Both  trade

unions  and  employers have adopted a  responsible

attitude  towards  collective  agreement  that   a

measure  of the Queensbury rules has been possible

for  some  time  now between both  management  and

labour, where fury and scorn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



were  the  order  before. Dr Goh Keng  Swee,  our

Minister  of  Defence,  in  his  address  in   the

International Labour Seminar gave pre-eminence  to

social  values  in the development  of  a  country

which  to our minds must include moral obligations

and  in  this dispute the moral obligation of  the

Government is to respect the undertaking given  to

the  workers in the Agreement that the back-dating

of  wage  claims  has  to be  effective  from  1st

January,  1961. In short, we expect the Government

to  honour  the undertaking it has  given  to  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this Parliament will realise that

since  the  democratic trade  union  movement  has

assumed  command  of  the labour  situation  after

defeating  the  anti-national forces,  strikes  by

trade  unions  have been few and far between,  not

for  pure love of virtue, but because we  want  to

establish  a  climate  for  economic  growth   and

advancement and we are proud to say that  we  have

made a direct contribution in this regard. We have

gone  out  of  our way to emphasise the  need  for

orderly industrial relations, not only in our  own

interests simply because we want to stay alive  as

a  movement but for our collective interests. This

may  not be palatable, but the settlement of  this

dispute  on  the terms of the 1961 Agreement  will

prove  to be the acid test of principled response.

The Government's integrity in industrial relations

has   to  he  immaculate.  So  we  would  say  the

fulfilment of governmental moral obligations is of

supreme  importance because it goes  to  the  very

roots  of the political philosophy and the  ideals

of high civilisation we are striving to evolve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less than the Prime Minister himself was an

eloquent spokesman on moral obligations.  In  more

or  less these words he said: "Workers should  not

be  made to suffer for delays in negotiations  for

which  they are not responsible" - referring to  the

interim bonuses paid to the Harbour Board workers.

because of prolongation of negotiations for  which

the  Harbour workers were not to blame. The  Prime

Minister when he said this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



was   in   the   distinguished  company   of   the

Arbitration   Courts  of  Australia,   India   and

elsewhere  who have upheld that the  principle  of

retrospective  payments  is  justified  in   those

circumstances in which the satisfaction  of  union

claims  has been delayed through no fault  of  the

Union.  Such delay, the Courts have declared,  may

occur  because of administrative reasons,  or  the

unwillingness   of  employers  to   take   matters

seriously at the negotiating table or even because

of  delays  in  the hearing of trade  disputes  by

Arbitration    Courts.   In   all   such    cases,

retrospective payments have been justified in  the

past and will continue to be so justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of retrospective payments must be

regarded  as a penalty provision on employers  who

are inclined towards procrastination and delays in

the  face of legitimate union claims. Such penalty

clauses  are  obviously  necessary  if  industrial

relations in a civilised community are to  proceed

on  an  even  keel. Employers are  no  more  above

penalty provisions than trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established the validity of the Public

Daily-Rated Workers' claims for back-pay,  and  we

have no doubt that an Industrial Arbitration Court

has  incorporated this principle in  its  body  of

law,  we would like to say that it has taken us  a

long  time and effort to formulate rules  for  the

preservation of industrial peace with justice  and

the  N.T.U.C. views  this  principle  as  a

pre-eminently  major contributing factor  to  securing

industrial peace not only in the public sector hut

in   the  private  sector  as  well,  because   in

particular,  employers in the private sector  tend

to  watch  which way the cat jumps in  the  public

sector and when it jumps in the direction to their

advantage,  they  would  have  no  hesitation   in

adopting  that course. We would also like  to  say

this,  that  the  N.T.U.C. has  no  intention  of

degenerating  into an effete movement.  That  will

not  be  in the interests of Singapore as a whole,

nor  do  we believe that the Government is anxious

that  we should deteriorate to that level, as only

quite  recently the Minister for Labour,  when  he

opened  the  Second Convention  of  the  N.T.U.C.,

stated that a docile



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



trade   union   movement  is  not  a  constructive

alternative to a pro-Communist movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the situation in the Public Daily-Rated

Services is one of open frustration, aggravated by

stern  warnings  on behaviour and  discipline  and

should  the  continued delay engender a  trial  of

strength, we must make it clear that our  sympathy

will be thrown effectively on the workers' side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not relish the idea of challenges or

showdowns. We would much rather put them behind us

and  regard  ourselves as part of the constructive

composite which Singapore has become but we can do

so  only on the confidence and the respect of  the

workers  of Singapore which we have so far earned.

We  shall not put this in jeopardy because  it  is

not good for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlemen, I have elaborated the case of the

Public Daily-Rated Employees sufficiently and have

three things for you to consider:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The claims of the workers are just - they

have been deprived by the tardy conduct  of

the  Treasury officials of a wage  increase

for the past four years;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The back-pay demand is not something extra

being  demanded but the accumulation of  an

increase in wages that is due to them,  and

finally    that    once   principles    are

established we cannot afford to  shift  our

ground.  We do so imperilling the  progress

and stability achieved.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, just now I had of

necessity  made a lengthy statement outlining  the

fiscal  and  financial policy of Singapore  as  an

independent  and sovereign country  and  also  the

Budget  for  the coming year. I do not propose  to

make  a similar lengthy statement, but if I might,

I  would  like  to summarise what the  Member  for

Telok Blangah has said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it can be put down under three headings,

that is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government acted unilaterally in

formulating a scheme to implement the  wage claims

in the Collective Agreement,  1961, entered into

between the Government and the Public Daily Rated

Employees Unions Federation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Due to its procrastination, Government

deprived the workers of their just awards;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The demand for back-pay is nothing unusual

in matters of wage increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the first two points together, as

they   seem  to  me  curiously  linked.  My  first

reaction   is   that   these   two   points    are

contradictory.  How can you accuse the  Government

of  having taken unilateral action and in the same

breath  also allege that it procrastinated?  True,

on   the  point  of  the  unilaterally  formulated

scheme, the facts of the matter are that after the

agreement  was  signed between the Union  and  the

Government, instructions were given to  Government

departments  to implement forthwith those  clauses

which  were clear-cut and straightforward. On  the

clauses relating to wages, it was not at all  that

straightforward, and a number of discussions  took

place   between  the  Union  representatives   and

Treasury   officials.   Arising   out   of   these

discussions, the Treasury presented to the Union a

draft  scheme  setting out full  details  for  the

implementation of the wage clauses as a basis  for

further discussion. This action is nothing new and

in  fact is common practice in all meetings. It is

useful  and  it  is  an occasion  on  which  draft

proposals  are put forward as a basis for  further

deliberation.  This  was exactly  what  the  draft

scheme  sought  to  achieve.  After  a  number  of

meetings, agreement was reached between the  Union

and  Treasury  representatives.  Indeed  a  signed

statement   is  on  record  in  a  Treasury   file

signifying the consent of the Union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



to  the  issue  of  that scheme. It  is  therefore

highly misleading for the Union, four years  after

the  event  has  taken place, to  make  a  general

allegation of unilateral action on the part of the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of procrastination or delay,

thereby depriving the workers of just increases in

their  wages, this is unfair. The scheme  referred

to   earlier  provides  for  implementation   with

retrospective  effect from the 1st January,  1961.

Every employee received some increase in wages. In

the vast majority of cases, each employee received

an  increase of 40 cents per day and in some cases

benefited up to a dollar and fifty cents per  day.

The  annual cost of this wage revision was in  the

region  of  $� million a year. Among  the  actions

taken   by   the   Government   to   hasten    the

implementation  of the collective agreement,  when

there  were  allegations by the  Union  that  some

clauses of the Agreement had not been implemented,

was  the  establishment of a Commission of Inquiry

under  the  chairmanship of  the  Commissioner  of

Labour  with  members nominated to  represent  the

interest  of  the  Union. The  Commission  made  a

thorough study of the matter and made a number  of

specific  recommendations and wage adjustments  in

its  findings.  All these specific recommendations

of   the   Commission   had  been   accepted   and

implemented  by the Government with  retrospective

effect from the 1st of January, 1961. There are  a

number  of  disputed  grades  on  which  even  the

Commission  was not in a position to  make  direct

recommendations. And as the Union is aware, on the

instructions of the Prime Minister with a view  to

effecting  a  speedy  end to this  long  drawn-out

dispute  and  concluding a complete settlement  of

the  1961  collective agreement, a Job  Evaluation

Team with Union participation has been working for

some time. The Job Evaluation Team is expected  to

make its recommendations soon. Everything possible

has  been  done  to conclude the  1961  collective

agreement and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



Union  is aware that the Government is as anxious,

if not more so, to see an end to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that the Member for Telok Blangah

made is of fundamental importance. The Member made

a  point  that backpay is not unusual. But  I  say

that   back-pay  must  be  discouraged,   if   not

altogether  disallowed, because no Government  can

plan  its  financial policies and administer  them

wisely  if there is a sinister threat that out  of

nowhere  someone is going to produce a  bill  that

the Government has to make arrears for back-pay. I

am  of  course  aware that in certain  situations,

Industrial  Courts  as  well  as  managements  had

agreed to some arrears in wage increase, but  this

must  be  the exception rather than the rule.  The

policy of Government on back-pay is well known  to

all  the Staff Unions. As Minister for Finance,  I

am  particularly anxious to see that  considerable

financial  resources  are not  frittered  away  by

demands  on  back-pay  when  such  resources   are

desperately  needed for the financing of  economic

projects in the country for the general upliftment

of  the  standard of living of the people  in  the

country.   It   is   only  in   very   exceptional

circumstances that I would be prepared  to  see  a

departure  in  this  ruling  provided   that   the

financial  implications are not  considerable.  In

this  connection,  Sir, I am reminded  of  a  very

valid point made by the late Dr F.C. Benham  when

he  was  entrusted  to report  on  a  revision  of

salaries for Government officers in 1951. In  that

Report,  the  author expressed the view  that  the

practice  of backdating, that is giving  back-pay,

is  erroneous in principle. He went on to say, "If

Government  were to follow the general  rule  that

whenever it revised any of its contracts it should

backdate  the  revision in order to  redress  past

injustices, it would be unable at any time to make

a  proper  estimate of its financial  position.  A

great deal of unnecessary clerical and other  work

would  be  created  and  the  business  of  public

administration  would be hopelessly  complicated."

There is also the question of tactics,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



Mr   Speaker.  Back-pay  weakens  the  bargaining

position  in negotiation. If the Union is  assured

of   backdating,  there  would  be  no  compelling

incentive  for  the  Union  to  desire   a   quick

conclusion  in negotiation as it would be  assured

that  whatever  form  of agreement  is  ultimately

reached the benefits therefore would be backdated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to remind the Member for

Telok  Blangah, and all other Members who  harbour

similar   sentiments,  that  this  Government   is

committed to raising the standard of living of all

its  people, most of all the working class people;

but in doing so,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



it  must  plan  its  limited  financial  resources

carefully  and wisely, and that the guiding  motto

to  be followed should be one of looking ahead for

further  achievements rather than looking backward

and  long  drawn-out disagreements that do  nobody

any good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this house do now adjourn.
