<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Mr Speaker Sir,

thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate on the

Budget  Statement.  I rise in support of the  motion  in  the

name of the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has already been said on how to make our

economy  strong  and competitive. After all,  the  Budget  is

about the economics of governing Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr Inderjit Singh's magic of doing business

through  the  Internet is fascinating,  I  am  glad  that  Mr

Sinnakaruppan  has  reminded us of  the  concerns  about  the

digital divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I find Dr Hu ending his

remarks  on the Budget Statement with a sober reminder  about

the  importance  of  social cohesion as interesting,  if  not

telling. I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most important of all, we have to work on preserving

our social cohesion, without which we will be much weaker  as

a nation in weathering a future crisis."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

Perhaps a coincidence, or perhaps to buttress the point,  the

Straits Times released, a day after Budget Day, survey

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>

results  on  ethnic  relations which  say  a  lot  about  our

vulnerabilities   as   a  multi-racial  and   multi-religious

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Sir, I would not bore you with more rhetorics about

why we must not get complacent about race relations and multi-racial harmony, but suffice to say that those survey findings

should  serve as a wake up call for us that all is  not  well

when it comes to our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, I can see the progress we have made. But

there  is still a lot of ground to be covered before  we  can

really  say  that  we are truly race and colour  blind.   The

survey results proved this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the survey results could have been more positive

if  it  were  carried  out in better times,  when  Singapore-Malaysia  relations were warmer.  The letter by  a  Malaysian

Malay,  Malik Tahir, published in the Straits Times,  looking

at Malaysia-Singapore relations from the point of view of the

so-called  abang-adik, or big brother and small brother,  and

ethnic Malay-Chinese angle, would not help.  So with the  May

1997  anti-Chinese  riots in Indonesia and  the  off  and  on

Christian-Muslim killings in  Maluku.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, all the more we need to continue to work hard at

improving  race  relations in Singapore.   Whether  it  is  a

question  of promoting understanding and even more difficult,

to build better trust, something that will take a longer time

to achieve, we have to soldier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to share with you a conversation I had with my

son,  an  officer in the army.  He was of course appalled  at

the  survey results.  He was saddened that about 60% believed

that  there  was a need to check the background  of  a  Malay

officer  before putting him in an important position  in  the

SAF.  He protested pointedly - I quote: "Put yourself in  the

position  where you are putting your best foot  forward,  you

are  all hearts and soul to serve the SAF and Singapore,  how

would you feel about such survey findings?" - when responding

to  the survey finding about the question of whether to trust

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>

Malays in times of war with a Malay/Muslim country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comforted himself by saying that perhaps the survey

could  be seen academically.  "What matters", he said,   "are

practical  situations."  He was confident that his men,  whom

he  served  NS with, would feel differently.  Having  trained

and served together under NS would have made that difference.

He  feels  that  whatever the feelings shown in  the  survey,

primordial  or otherwise, we must continue to develop  better

bonding and better trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share that sentiment. We have no choice. When

we  believe  in  our Singapore, we have to  soldier  on  with

better  bonding.  We must continue to work hard at  nurturing

better  understanding and trust.  That may sound  rhetorical,

but  there  is  no other way.  We all know, of  course,  that

slogans and speeches are not enough.  Each one of us has  got

the  responsibility and a role to play.  Let  us  spread  the

gospel of harmonious living as wide as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in developing Singapore, Dr Hu said in

his   Budget  Speech  that  the  challenge  is  for  us   "to

differentiate ourselves by finding creative ways to add value

to our infrastructure."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu cited the development of Jurong Island as one

example  of  that  creativity.   He said,  "Amalgamated  from

seven   offshore islands, Jurong Island is to become a world-class  integrated chemical hub, the first of its kind in  the

region."   Such  is  also our challenge for social  cohesion.

Let  us  "amalgamate" our different races together,  wherever

possible,  into one main Singapore race.  There is definitely

more room for better racial and social chemistry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu went on to say that Jurong Island, "Through

clustering and sharing of common facilities, it will generate

synergistic  linkages across a wide spectrum of petrochemical

industries."   He  said,  "For  example,  the  provision   of

centralised logistics and common corridors for material flows

will   significantly  reduce  feedstock  transportation   and

handling cost."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should try to transplant those same concepts in

forging  multi-racial harmony.  We will need to see a greater

sharing of common efforts that will not only generate synergy

but also open new highways of opportunities for the different

ethnic  groups to integrate.  This way, we will  be  able  to

reduce the constant heartaches that every so often show their

ugly  heads.  The political cost of racial discord could also

be avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein of the formation of JurongIsland.com,

mentioned  by  Dr Hu in his Budget Statement,  let  us  build

HarmonyIsland.com, either under the Prime  Minister's  Office

or  the Ministry of Community Development, to help us open  a

new  corridor  to a more harmonious living in our  Singapore.

Let  this  HarmonyIsland.com be far more meaningful than  the

commercial Orchard.com, for it will encompass the  spirit  of

Chinatown.com,   Geylang.com,   LittleIndia.com   and    even

Katong.com.  And, in short, making the true spirit of  multi-racial  Singapore come to life through the magic of  Internet

and IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should apply the same zeal and creativity that we

often exercise for our economic achievements to our effort at

ensuring racial and religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim community recognises the dangers of a

possible  digital  divide.   They  have  embarked  on  a  KBE

movement launched by the Prime Minister last December to help

the community equip itself with the right skills, in order to

play its part in competitive and global Singapore. Obviously,

this is just a beginning, a modest start.  More will have  to

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim organisations will have to speed up its

momentum   in  this  area,  work  in  tandem  with   national

programmes and Government agencies to keep abreast  with  the

demands  of  the  digital  race.  Government  Ministries  and

agencies  too  should  help  complement  and  supplement  the

efforts by the Malay/Muslim community towards this end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the community continues to work hard to tackle its

lingering problems in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>

education  and  socio-economic realms, neither the  community

nor  Singapore can afford another divide to emerge  from  the

digital era.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I trust Dr Hu will say "yes" to

HarmonyIsland.com, to help promote better racial  harmony  in

Singapore and alleviate the potential divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  behalf  of  the  business  community   in

Singapore, I would like to thank the Government for its  able

leadership  in  strongly advocating  the  tripartism  of  the

labour,  management  and the Government to  adopt  the  cost-cutting  package  to  deal with the Asian  financial  crisis,

enabling  Singapore's economy to recover steadily  last  year

and achieving  a 5.4% growth for the whole year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after having gone through this financial crisis, I

deeply  appreciate the spiritual strength  of  tripartism  of

labour,  management  and  the  Government  which  is  a  pre-requisite  for  Singapore's economy  to  develop  and  remain

stable  in  the  face of chaos.  We must carry  forward  this

spirit of tripartism  at all costs.  In view of this, I  must

present  for  discussion  in this  House  the  views  of  the

business  community on the way the Government dealt with  the

cost-cutting  package  and the huge budget  surplus  achieved

last  year, with the hope that the Government would  continue

to  conform to the wishes of the people and adopt appropriate

measures  to  enhance the business community's confidence  in

the labour-management-Government tripartite strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the economic recovery in FY 1999, we

were  able  to  turn  deficits into  surplus,  enabling  most

workers to retain their jobs and many enterprises to survive.

It  can  be  said to be happiness all round.   However,  many

Singaporeans told me that the Government could be said to  be

the   biggest   winner  in  the  financial  bumper   harvest.

According  to the Finance Minister, last year's revenue  from

COEs and income tax was much more than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>

predicted.   On  the  other  hand,  tender  prices  for   the

Government's  development projects were substantially  lower.

At the same time, the Government had also shelved some of the

less  important development plans, thereby saving some  hefty

sums  of  expenditure for the Government.  As such, not  only

has  the Government not injected the $5.1 billion as promised

into  the economy, but it received a bumper surplus  of  $3.2

billion instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the business community's point of view, the surplus

obtained  by the Government  on this occasion could not  help

but  give people the feeling of "robbing Peter to pay  Paul".

Those  in the construction industry are particularly unhappy.

Because  of  the  serious  impact of  the  financial  crisis,

coupled with intense competition, building contractors had to

resort  to  bidding  below  cost for  the  limited  contracts

offered by the Government, in order to survive and to  retain

their  staff  and  workers,  much  to  the  benefit  of   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big and small building contractors in Singapore

could  be  said  to be in a sorry plight in  the  process  of

dealing with the impact of the financial storm.  They had not

only  to  try  and save the industry which seemed  unable  to

recover after a setback, through self-sacrifice, but also  to

try  their  best  to keep the rice-bowls of their  employees.

This is something that warrants our attention. Moreover,  the

construction industry has all along been an important link in

our  economy, and cannot be neglected.  As such, I would urge

the  Government  to  bring forward as soon  as  possible  the

development  projects  which  it  had  shelved  so  that  the

construction  industry can restore its vitality  earlier  and

catch up with the other sectors of our economy on the road to

recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in actual fact, the difference between the $3.2

billion  FY 1999 budget surplus achieved and the $5.1 billion

budget  deficit  predicted was really  tremendous.   This  is

incredible!  Many Singaporeans could not help asking: Has the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>

Government been over cautious in formulating and implementing

the  cost-cutting  package introduced  by the  Government  to

help  the  people tide over the financial crisis? Or  was  it

because the Government had been  half-hearted in its efforts,

resulting  in  it  being unable to produce  better  and  more

comprehensive  results?   Perhaps  the  Government  was   not

practising  what it preached when it advocated the tripartism

of  labour, management and Government.  Furthermore,  is  the

Government planning to conduct a full review on the manner in

which  it  formulates the annual Budget to avoid a repetition

of  such  a  huge gap in the estimates which sends the  wrong

signal  to  the  business community and causes  the  business

community   to  lose  faith  in  the  Government's   economic

strategies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally, enterprises must have rich financial

resources   to survive, develop and undertake risks  involved

with  exploiting innovative business.  At this time when  our

economy  has  just  recovered  from  the  recession  and  the

situation of our neighbouring economies is still not certain,

most  enterprises would need to accumulate more reserves from

their operating surpluses for contingency use, just like  any

government.   However, it is regrettable that our  Government

seems  to  be in a great hurry to withdraw the 10% rebate  on

corporate tax from this year's Budget. At the same time,  the

property tax rebate on industrial properties is reduced  from

55% to 25%.  Although the Government announced a reduction of

0.5 percentage point in the corporate tax rate to 25.5%, this

will not take effect until next year.   Generally, the people

will  find such lack of generosity  difficult to accept.   No

wonder  some  businessmen are now asking: "Is the  Government

sincere in wanting to share the happiness and bitterness with

the  business community?  Why is the Government  not  sharing

the  fruits of the economic recovery with them in  line  with

the spirit of tripartism?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are strongly encouraging our businessmen to

be  adventurous in opening up new markets and developing  new

products,  we should appreciate that these businessmen are in

dire need of more surpluses and capital to back them up in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>

order  to  accept the challenges.   As such, I hope that  the

Government  would  further reduce more taxes  to  enable  our

enterprises to enhance their competitiveness, and strive  for

more  operating  surpluses and accumulate enough  capital  to

develop  their business.  In this respect, I would  urge  the

Government  to grant our local enterprises, particularly  the

newly  established  SMEs, special tax  concessions,  such  as

allowing  them reliefs from their taxable income, similar  to

the    personal   reliefs   in   individual    income    tax.

Alternatively, the SMEs could be allowed to pay their  income

tax on a progressive scale to alleviate their tax burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend the Government for allocating funds to

the  Medifund, the ElderCare Fund, and the top-up of $250  to

the  ordinary accounts of the CPF members, so that our people

would  get  to share as much as $685 million from the  budget

surplus  of  YA1999.  However, compared to the  $3.2  billion

surplus, this amount is still relatively small.  Perhaps, the

Government  would  consider allocating some  funds  from  the

surplus  to  finance  the various industrial  and  commercial

organisations  so  that  they could  conduct  various  skills

upgrading  activities and training programmes for workers  in

the various trades and industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that in the new fiscal year, the

Government  will  be allocating $3.3 billion  to  the  public

service  for manpower expenditure, an increase of as high  as

10.8%.  Yet, the Government is forecasting an economic growth

of  only  4.5%  to 6.5% for this year.  As we all  know,  any

increase in salaries in the public sector would bring about a

vicious  cycle in the other sectors of the economy, resulting

in  an  unconstrained escalation in wage cost  in  Singapore.

Now,  the private sector is trying to exercise wage restraint

to  cut down business cost, but the public sector persists in

its argument of having to attract talents and keeps on making

substantial  upward  adjustments  to  wages.   Is  this   not

contrary  to  the  cooperative spirit of our  tripartism?  As

such, I would urge the Government to exercise extreme caution

whenever  it  raises the salaries in the  public  sector,  to

avoid accelerated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>

escalation  in  business  cost   and   the  burden   on   the

taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget for the new century is of utmost

importance to our development.  It is the motivating force to

move  us into the knowledge-based economy.  I am very pleased

with  the  Government  for all its efforts  in  this  aspect.

However,  we  must always take note that in  this  globalised

economy  and era of information technology,  we are bound  to

face  some  rapidly changing situations.   I  hope  that  the

Government   will  continue  with  its  style  of    adopting

appropriately to changes  and conforming to the wishes of the

people.    Whenever  necessary,  the  Government  should   be

resolute  in  making  prompt  decisions  and  adopt  suitable

measures to lead the people in the spirit of our tripatism to

counter  the challenges of the new century and move into  the

knowledge-based economy for our future development.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Sir, we must thank and congratulate

our  Government for its outstanding management and leadership

in  pulling  Singapore out of its worst economic crisis  that

hit this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, Sir, can deny that the Government has done well

indeed  for  the people and for the country.   In  comparison

with  other governments, this Government stands up and stands

tall,   as  one  with  the  vision,  the  courage   and   the

determination to see us through to the promised land, and  to

bring us to new heights in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we were surprised the other day to hear

from  the  Minister for Finance that for the  last  financial

year,  instead  of  the  projected $5  billion  deficit,  the

Government  has turned in an estimated $3.2 billion  surplus.

Any  surplus  is good and most welcome.  But the question  in

our  mind  is:  had the Government been overly  cautious  and

extraordinarily  conservative in holding  back  expenditures?

Had  the  Government not held back so much and released  more

funds into the economy, would there not have been a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>

greater multiplier impact and faster recovery of the economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Government has quickly cut and reduced some of

the  rebates,  and increased significantly, for example,  the

development  charges for properties.  Are these  actions  too

drastic  and  too  soon?  Will they lead to other  Government

departments and agencies raising their charges quickly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pendulum must not swing the other way too quickly,

otherwise  business costs will rise sharply,  and  that  will

hurt  the competitiveness of our economy and our own country.

We  should  give  more time for companies to restructure  and

consolidate.  Do not forget, ultimately, we have  to  compete

against other regional economies, like Hong Kong, Taiwan  and

Thailand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am glad that the Government is taking good

care  of  the man-in-the-street, with rental rebates, rebates

for  S&C  charges and utilities rebates, and the  CPF  top-up

scheme.   This shows that the Government has a heart for  our

heartlanders,  and  appreciates the sacrifices  made  by  the

people in taking pay and CPF cuts in difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this budget, we are spending the lion's share on

education.  This is the right move.  People are our precious,

and  only  resources, more so in the knowledge-based economy,

the very foundation of our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we invest so much on education, will it not be

wise  for us to do a strategic review of education, a  stock-taking and seeking new directions in the new economy, in  the

new  world  of  the Internet, wired together  in  one  global

village?  I ask this as it is clear that the pace  of  change

has  quickened,  and the momentum may be  overwhelming.   Old

methods  and old ways of teaching, for example,  may  not  be

relevant  any more.  It is an IT world, yet many  schools,  I

observe,  are still mainly using the blackboard,  the  duster

and chalk.  The classroom need not be square, with tables and

chairs all facing the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>

direction towards the blackboard.  We should use more  IT  in

the  schools  and in teaching. This will make  learning  more

fun.   And  how  do we impart good moral values or  highlight

character development when students and schools are bent  and

preoccupied with examination grades.  Examination grades  are

important, but not everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we bogging down our students with too many facts and

figures  that  they  do  not  have  the  time  to  think  for

themselves? Is it stifling initiative and creativity?  Are we

producing a generation that is averse to risk-taking, that is

so kiasu?  This is a pertinent question as Singapore enters a

new phase of development in the new economy, which beckons us

with   opportunities  and  challenges  of   risk-taking,   of

entrepreneurship, of going global, and of daring to do.   But

is  our education system preparing our young to take on these

challenges in the new economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they taught the right skills in our schools? Are

our  young well prepared for life in the outside world?   Are

they street-wise?  Are they equipped and ready to take on  or

deal with businessmen from China, Hong Kong, Korea or Japan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society as a whole should also be more tolerant of those

who  dared  to try but failed.  There should be no stigma  in

failure.   Remember, failure is the mother of success.   This

climate  of  support will then encourage more to strike  out,

take risk and be entrepreneurial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education should also include the training and

retraining  of  our  working adults.  It saddens  me  to  see

workers in their 40s in my meet-the-people sessions, who  are

retrenched in the economic restructuring, who could not  find

new  jobs  easily,  as they have no new or  relevant  skills.

Some  are  still  looking for canteen stalls, security  jobs,

cleaning  jobs, and such like, when the economy  has  changed

radically.  Many are fast becoming unemployable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore do more for this group of workers,

and retrain them for the new economy.  We have apprenticeship

training scheme for the young, why not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>

more  apprenticeship training scheme for the  older  workers.

If  necessary, pay them a subsistence allowance when they are

under  intensive training, as they have families to  support.

We  should  therefore allocate more grants  from  our  budget

surplus for adult retraining, and make it a people's movement

for skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we go global, many of our graduates have to

go  overseas to work, we must remain rooted in Singapore.  We

must  anchor every Singaporean to our own homeland.  But  how

do we cultivate this sense of belonging and bonding, when our

schools  do  not  give much emphasis to our own  history  and

culture?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History lessons are downplayed or not given much

attention  in  schools.  Whereas in the United States,  every

child  in  school  knows  about  George  Washington,  Abraham

Lincoln,  John  Kennedy, or the American War of Independence.

We  must  therefore  give more thought and  priority  to  the

teaching of history in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion standing in the

name of the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  his first Budget Statement for the millennium,  the

Finance  Minister said that we could expect to get back  soon

to  the  pre-crisis  growth rate.   We  can  expect  measures

designed to help businesses tide over the crisis will not  be

extended and  Government charges will be increased very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate of 55% is now reduced to 25%.

The  Ministry  of  National Development  has  also  announced

increases  in  the development charges.  With the  increases,

will  we  once again face the pre-crisis situation  of  asset

inflation?  Will the rent plus other increases cause the cost

of  business to rise and our competitiveness to be  depleted?

We can rejoice that we are out of the economic difficulty and

can  expect better prospects in the new millennium.  But what

kind  of  a  reward do those people who have made  sacrifices

get?  The Government announced that it would top up their CPF

by $250.  Is this meagre

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>

amount of $250 the only reward that they are getting?   Those

who  have  not  contributed to CPF also made  sacrifices  but

they do not even get a single cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1998 when we faced the regional

economic crisis, the Government announced a $10 billion cost-cutting package.  But the thrust of cost-cutting was  on  the

workers,  through the 10% CPF cut and the  5%  pay  cut.   So

through  the  sacrifices of the workers, the  Government  was

able  to  cut  down  the cost by $7 billion.   In  1999,  the

Government announced a budget deficit of $5.1 billion.   This

was  played  up  in the media as if the Government  was  also

affected very greatly by the crisis in order to justify  that

requiring workers to cut their pay and to make sacrifices are

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate in 1999, I said that the deficit

was not a true deficit but  was a result of large increase in

development   estimates.   The  Minister  for  Finance   just

announced   that  there  is  now a surplus  of  $3.2  billion

instead  of  a  deficit.   This was because  the  development

expenditure  estimated in the 1999 budget was  not  used  up.

The  Government  has the responsibility  to  explain  to  the

people  whether  the  1999 budget was one  with  a  political

motive to persuade the people to make sacrifices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, many businessmen faced losses, some factories

even  had  to close down.  Many Singaporeans had  to  tighten

their purse strings and their belts because of a pay cut, CPF

cut,  and unemployment.  But the Government was not affected.

There  was  no  deficit  - it was played  up  at  that  time.

Instead, there is now a surplus.  No wonder when the  economy

was  still recovering, the Government could not wait  even  a

moment in taking the opportunity to announce in November 1999

the  restoration of the pay cut for civil servants, including

the  Ministers' pay.  Otherwise, the surplus  would  be  more

than $3.2 billion.  The Government has forgotten that in 1999

they wanted workers to have their pay cut to pull through the

economic  crisis  together.  The workers' pay  has  not  been

restored to the previous level.  The 10% CPF cut in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

employer's contribution will only be restored by 2%.  But the

Government took the lead in pay increases for themselves, and

enjoyed the fruits of economic recovery, while the people  in

general  were still suffering from the impact of  the crisis.

The  people  were hoping that better time would come  in  the

form of bonuses.  But the Government has beaten them to it by

taking  the chunk of the fruit of the economic recovery  with

the withdrawal of the 10% tax rebate.  So when times are bad,

the  Government's policy is to first require workers to  make

sacrifices  by  reducing workers' wages but  when  times  are

good,  the Government took care of its own pocket.   This  is

the true colour of the PAP Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, the Government has even announced that

the  water tariffs will be increased and the water borne  fee

will  be  increased by 100%.  All the utilities charges  will

also be increased as a result.  It will add to the burden  of

the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking from the first Budget of the

new  millennium after the economic crisis, we  can  see  that

whether in good or bad times, the Government's fiscal  policy

is  always  "win-win" for the Government and "lose-lose"  for

the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in  presenting the first Budget  for  the  new

millennium,  the  Minister  for  Finance  laid  out  the  key

challenges facing Singaporeans. His message is that if we  do

not  respond  well, we will lose our economic competitiveness

and  social  cohesion.  This is similar to the very  familiar

expression in Chinese, ie, you must fight to win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang said that the

Government wins but the people lose.  What we are doing is to

make  everyone win - the Government wins; the people win;  Mr

Low  wins, and even the Opposition parties win.  Mr Low  said

that  the Government had been acting against the interest  of

the  workers.  But we NTUC leaders know very well why we must

take a wage cut, and why there had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>

to  be  a reduction in CPF.  There is this Chinese expression

which  says:  "liude qingshan zai, bu chou  mei  chai  shao",

meaning  as long as the green mountains are there,  one  need

not  worry  about  firewood.  So the important  thing  is  to

retain  the  job,  retain our rice bowl - that  is  the  most

important point.  That is why at that point of time,  we  all

agreed  that, with the factories facing the financial crisis,

many  of them had to close down, and the most pragmatic thing

to  do  was  to  let the factories survive, so that  everyone

would  at  least   retain their jobs.  That is  why  we  were

prepared  to take a wage cut.  We were all fighting  for  the

survival  of the factories.  All the workers had agreed  that

we  would  take a wage cut to retain our jobs.  Even  if  the

factories could not survive just with the wage cut, then  let

us  cut  some of our working days.  Let us take home a little

less, but let the factories survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could all see where the crisis was. We were willing

to  undergo  re-training.   Over the  past  few  years,  many

workers,  about 40,000 of them, had undergone  retraining  to

upgrade their skills.  But there was one thing that I need to

point  out,  that  is,  in the Budget Statement  the  Finance

Minister  mentioned that we needed to have  an  educated  and

highly skilled workforce augmented and invigorated by foreign

talents,  but  did not specifically assure the older  workers

and low-skilled workers that they would not be neglected.  In

the  next few years, the Government will be setting  up  more

funds for the upgrading of skills for the workers.  Just now,

Dr  Ong also said that for the workers, particularly the low-skilled workers, we should have enough funds to help them  in

their training.  Dr Hu only said that we need a team of high-skilled workers supplemented with foreign talent.  We  should

help the older workers to solve their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that the

lower  skilled workers are not necessarily older workers  and

the  older  workers  are not necessarily  the  lower  skilled

workers.   These  two  groups of  workers  have  become  very

sensitive  to  any news about their company's  restructuring,

merger and acquisition.  They know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>

that  when  any of these processes happens to their  company,

they are sure to "tio" (in Hokkien) or "kena" (in Malay), ie,

they  will  be "hit".  And if the lower skilled  workers  are

also  older, they are, like what the Hokkiens say,  "tia  tio

tio"  or in Malay "mesti kena", that is, very sure that  they

would be hit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many low-skilled workers and older workers have not

been  able  to  find new jobs once they are retrenched.   The

older  workers are worst hit.  They are prepared  to  go  for

retraining.   They are prepared to lower their  expectations.

But  they  have  great  difficulties  in  finding  new  jobs.

Therefore, I propose that the Government introduce  some  tax

incentives  to encourage employers to hire older workers.   I

will elaborate on this during the Committee of Supply debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that under the Manpower 21, we can do more for

workers' training and skills certification for them to  enjoy

lifelong  employability.  This might be the  reason  why  the

Finance  Minister  did not elaborate on  this  issue  in  his

speech.   However,  during our dialogue sessions  with  union

leaders,  we  learned  that older workers  were  particularly

concerned that they were being discriminated against.  I hope

the  Government can address this issue before  it  becomes  a

social  problem.  The older workers can be out of job  for  a

short  period  as  our social safety net  is  adequate.   But

prolonged unemployment of a particular group is not desirable

to  our society.  To the family, to the individuals, it  will

be a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister should be

commended  for including the grandparents when he grants  tax

relief  for  topping-up  CPF accounts.   Taxpayers  who  live

together  with their parents will also enjoy a tax relief  of

$5,000.   Although the increase is only $500, it is a gesture

of  the Government which the people will appreciate.  It also

shows  a  policy change in that the Government  now  includes

grandparents as members of the family for tax purposes.  This

is in keeping with our oriental tradition, and this will also

help foster cohesion and avoid conflicts in the family.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS), may I also

urge  the  Government  to  give  further  tax  incentives  to

encourage  husbands to contribute to the  accounts  of  their

wives who have given up working to stay at home to look after

the family, so that their children would score A1s and A2s in

their  examinations.  They do not have any CPF  and  probably

very little savings for their old age.  So it is only logical

that husbands should be encouraged to contribute towards  the

wives'  accounts  in the SRS.  I will also touch on  the  SRS

scheme  in  further  detail during the  Committee  of  Supply

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member for Hougang is not

happy  with  the  top-up of $250, the workers  by  and  large

appreciate  that  this  is  like a  bonus,  like  winning   a

starter's  prize  in  a 4-D draw.  It is  a  gesture  by  the

Government to show appreciation for the sacrifice the workers

had  made  during  the crisis.  Even the  self-employed  will

enjoy  the top-up of $250 if they have made contributions  to

their  CPF  accounts  in the past year.   In  the  past,  the

Government required  the self-employed to produce evidence of

contribution  to the CPF, particularly the Medisave  account,

before  their business licence could be renewed.   There  was

some  unhappiness among the self-employed. But  now  I  think

they  will  appreciate the Government's intention  by  making

them  contribute to CPF.  Now, they can have a share in  this

top-up bonus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now facing new challenges in a new knowledge-based economy. We need foreign talents to lay a strong

foundation for our transition to a knowledge economy.  And we

know  that in the next 20 years, we will be facing a  lot  of

problems with an ageing population.  So we must take whatever

measures possible.  We must fight hard so that the Government

will win and the people will win too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, can I have your

permission to seek clarification, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Seng has said just

now  that we have to fight to win.  But,  after the fighting,

it  is  the Government that wins.  He also mentioned that the

workers  have received some rewards.  During the crisis,  the

workers made sacrifices.  The Finance Minister has said  that

our economy has recovered, and we want to achieve high growth

rates  as before.  Yet, as of now, apart from retaining their

jobs and  continuing to receive lower wages,  they are unable

to receive their CPF contribution as in the past ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, you rose on a point of

clarification.  Can I ask you to get to the point and ask  Mr

Seng what part of his speech that you do not understand?  You

are embarking on a totally different speech.  Can you get  to

the point?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am asking him to clarify ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  some  of  the  questions have to be  answered  by  the

Minister for Finance himself.  I am only replying to him from

the  point  of  view  of the NTUC.  He was  saying  that  the

Government  should allocate a big sum of money  to  help  the

workers  in  their  training.  In the  past  few  years,  the

Government  spent  as much as $120 million to  implement  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme.  As I  have  mentioned  just

now,  about  40,000  workers benefited  from  the  retraining

scheme.   Funds  were  indeed  granted  for  the  workers  to

upgrade their skills.  If Mr Low wants more details on  this,

he  can come to NTUC.  I can give him a good briefing on  how

these workers have benefited from the scheme.  As far as  the

workers  are  concerned, so long as they retain  their  jobs,

there is still opportunity for them to go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked whether the workers will go back to their

previous  standard of living after the economy has recovered.

Yes,  they can, but they must first  upgrade their skills  as

their  previous skills may well be useless and obsolete  now.

In  order  to enjoy a better standard of living in Singapore,

we have to create new jobs.  Now in Jurong Island, we have  a

number

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>

of   petrochemical  factories  offering   various   new   job

opportunities  which require new skills.  We have  a  lot  of

jobs  available  but  the workers do not  have  the  matching

skills   to  take  on  these  jobs.   So  they  must  upgrade

themselves,  upgrade their skills so that they  can  take  on

these  new and better-paid jobs.  There is a causeway leading

to  Jurong  Island.  If Mr Low has not been there, he  should

make  a  visit.  If he does not know the way, I can take  him

there.   Perhaps, he did not read the newspapers.  Now  there

is an access road leading to Jurong Island.  You can drive or

walk  there.  You do not need a permit to go there.  Perhaps,

he  is  not familiar with that.  It is a public place and  is

open  to  everybody.  I can make an appointment with  him  to

bring  him  there  so  that he can see for  himself  how  the

workers  have  enjoyed  a better standard  of  living.   Many

workers have also not seized the opportunity to enjoy  better

pay for the jobs available to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind both Members that they should

not  be embarking on long speeches under the guise of seeking

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank

you  for  this opportunity to join in the debate.  I beg  the

indulgence  of  the House to hear my views on several  issues

which  have  already  been discussed  by  previous  speakers.

However, the advantage in speaking on the second day is  that

there is no need to explain the background to these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Budget Statement with much

satisfaction  and  pride.  The economy did much  better  than

expected.   The  actual growth was 5.4% to the best  expected

forecast  of  1%.  Instead of an expected budget  deficit  of

$5.1  billion, the fiscal year ended with a surplus  of  $3.2

billion.   The  performance is even  more  impressive  if  we

recognise  that  the  economy last  year  actually  performed

better by $8.3 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the additional contribution of $100 million to

the Medifund.  I welcome the setting up of the ElderCare Fund

and the allocation of $200 million to it.  As our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>

population  ages,  medical expenses  become  more  important.

These  two funds will help our poor and old.  This is forward

thinking towards the future.  We also appreciate the $250 top-up  in  our CPF accounts.  These gestures reinforce the image

of  a  government that appreciates and cares for its  people.

While  the  Government called for sacrifices from the  people

during  difficult times, it also willingly shares the  bounty

harvest   during   good  times.   However,  pensioners   have

expressed  the  hope that they will be especially  remembered

for their contributions and sacrifices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excellent economic performance is the result of the

good  management  by the Government and the  support  of  the

people.  However, much credit must go to the Finance Minister

for his handling of the national purse string.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister sees a stronger economy this year,

but  not  without caveats.  The US economy must not  suddenly

and  violently convulse, and the Japanese, European and Asian

economies   must  continue  on  their  paths   of   recovery.

Singapore  has yet to fully recover its competitive position.

In  view  of  these  uncertainties,  the  business  community

wonders  why  the  Government was so quick  to  withdraw  the

support  that  it  deemed necessary just a  few  months  ago.

However,  I am certain that our businessmen would  prefer  to

make  their  money from better business in a growing  economy

than  to merely survive on Government handouts in a slow one.

We  therefore hope to hear the Finance Minister announce this

good news when he presents his next report card to Parliament

at the same time next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of the Supplementary Retirement

Scheme  (SRS) to complement the existing CPF scheme  is  most

timely.   I  note  that tax is payable only at  the  time  of

withdrawal.  It will encourage those who can afford to  save.

Retirement, however, is a time when a person's means  to  pay

taxes  is reduced.  I hope that the Government will work  out

guidelines   that  if  the  withdrawals  take   place   after

retirement, the taxes payable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>

would  be low.  If this is done, it will encourage even  more

people to save for their old age.  With one out of every four

residents  to be over 65 years of age by 2030, the  SRS  will

reduce the burden of the Government in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, by exempting the interest income of CPF

savings  beyond  the  Minimum Sum, this will  encourage  more

retirees to keep their money with banks than to expose  their

funds  to  risky  ventures.   I think  these  are  farsighted

changes   to   the  CPF  scheme.   The  extensions   do   not

disadvantage anyone, but give everyone more choices where  to

keep their money for their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $500 increase in the tax relief per parent for

children who have their aged parents live with them  is  more

significant  for  the message that the Government  recognises

their  filialness  than the actual financial  impact  on  the

taxpayer's pocket.  The extension of tax relief for CPF  top-up to grandparents is also to be welcomed as this extends the

recognition of the Government to filial grandchildren.  I  am

very certain that, in the long term, the net benefits of such

schemes  will far outweigh the financial loss of  revenue  to

the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Government that globalisation and

increasing competition are realities that we must face.   The

Singapore   economy  will  technically  and   technologically

structure  up.  This will create new jobs which will  require

new   and   more  skills  and  knowledge.   If  our  workers,

especially  the  older  and lower skilled,  some  843,000  in

number  or 42% of our workforce, do not upgrade their  skills

and knowledge, they will become structurally unemployable and

hence unemployed.  These older workers must thus be helped to

acquire  additional skills.  Dr Hu did not  specify  any  new

initiatives though he said that the Government will press  on

with  the various existing initiatives.  Does this mean  that

the  situation now is satisfactory and under control?   Would

the  Minister perhaps share with the House the status of  the

skills upgrading efforts to-date?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my above concern with our economy is aggravated by

information technology which is driving Singapore  towards  a

knowledge-based economy, also called the New Economy.  In the

New  Economy, knowledge and entrepreneurialship will  be  key

ingredients  for survival and growth.  Jobs  will  change  to

become  information  and knowledge intensive.   Literacy  and

familiarity with information technology are core skills  that

all   Singaporeans  will  need.   In  the  globalised  arena,

salaries and wages will be set globally.  IT workers will  be

paid  wages set in the developed countries and the  wages  of

those  doing non-IT work will be set by workers in  the  poor

third  world.  Thus, those who cannot master IT  will  become

the  poor of society.  This will be the dividing line between

the  rich  and  the poor of society in the future.   This  is

often referred to as the digital divide.  Is this threat  for

real?   The  Americans think so and for  good  reasons.   Our

Government has expressed similar concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the answer? The answer is obvious. Make

Singapore  into  an  IT-intensive  environment.   A  national

information  highway is already in place for the  people  and

business.  The PC is now ubiquitous in the workplace, in  our

offices and shops.  Next, make our people IT-literate.  A few

days  ago,  IDA announced several new bold initiatives  under

the  Infocomm 21 Masterplan to make three in four workers  to

be  IT-literate by the year 2010 and to ensure that  we  have

enough  infocomm  manpower.  I am assured and  encouraged  by

these  efforts.  The Government is quick to ensure  that  the

needs  of  our  young are met.  Billions of dollars  will  be

allocated  for  education  of  our  young,  as  much  as  the

Education  Ministry  needs.  Hence, yesterday  I  heard  with

disbelief,  when  the hon. Opposition Member,  Mr  Chiam  See

Tong, accused the Government of being stingy in providing for

education  and  proposed that the Ministry  of  Education  be

allocated  more  money. He is being disingenuous.   He  knows

what  will  happen if more money is provided than is  needed.

In the next election, he and the Opposition will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>

accuse  the  PAP Government of being wasteful,  misusing  and

squandering the hard earned money of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe, for us, the digital divide, if it

takes  place, will come not from our young but from our adult

population.  Young Singaporeans readily accept the  high-tech

life  and this ready acceptance will only quicken the divide.

We have to act decisively and quickly to help our older adult

population to master IT.  In a recent survey, more than  four

in  every 10 people felt that they lagged behind in  a  high-tech world.  I was thus pleased to hear Communications and IT

Minister  announced that $25 million is available to  promote

IT  among  the public.  I believe this amount is too  modest,

but  it  is  a  good  start.  Given  the  importance  of  the

objective,  I am sure more money will be made available  when

and  as  long  as it is needed.  I strongly urge the  Finance

Minister  to  support  this urgent and  worthwhile  cause  to

minimise the threat of a digitally divided society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, we must also pro-act. We do not have the

luxury  to  react.  By the time the problem is  realised,  it

would  be  too late.  I would urge IDA to work with  PA.   PA

reaches   out   to  the  community  through  its   grassroots

organisations  and  centres.  One initiative  is  to  develop

community-based IT resource centres to allow  the  people  to

have  an  easy  access  to learn and use  IT.   If  a  person

understands the PC and its power, and is confident  of  using

it,  the family may acquire one for the home.  Access to  the

Internet  and  its  services should also  be  affordable  and

readily  available.  Many new services  like  e-commerce,  e-learning  and  e-banking would also become available  in  the

future.  Technology will make IT increasingly more affordable

and accessible, but the problem is how to get people to learn

to use IT, to be comfortable with IT and to be confident with

using IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be stingy in our efforts to create an IT

savvy  society. This is a necessary investment for the future

that  will  pay handsome dividend.  The development  of  this

society  would be on-going and continuous. Improvements  must

be  made  in big and small steps. Many steps would be needed.

We must do more.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude this discussion on a perplexing note.

We know that in order to meet the economic imperatives of the

KBE future, many values held by society would need to change.

But these values also underpin our society.  Do we understand

how  the  changes  would affect our society?   Have  we  paid

enough attention to this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I end my speech. I congratulate

Minister  Hu  for a well thought-out Budget  and  express  my

support for the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, reading the Budget, a

remark  made by Mr Ngiam Tong Dow came to mind.  This was  an

observation made by Mr Ngiam in an interview that he gave  to

the  Economic Journal of the National University of Singapore

and  when  I  read it, it struck me because that was  what  I

thought we have been trying to say.  And his observation  was

that, behind every economic decision lies a political goal or

motive  and, of course, we do not need Mr Ngiam  to  tell  us

that.  Economic decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Economic

decisions are made with a purpose and with a goal in mind and

if it is the society that we are concerned with, it must have

to  be  a  political purpose. So I ask myself,  reading  this

Budget, what are the political imperatives of this Government

behind this Budget that it now presents?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give you what I see to be the political

imperatives.   But before I do that, may I say a  little  bit

further  about  the Budget, and that is the  question:   what

does  this  Budget  tell  us of our society?   Because  every

Budget  must  tell  something of the society  for  which  the

Budget  is being prepared and presented.  What does  it  tell

us?  Does it tell us of a caring society, or does it tell  us

of a society that is money-minded and is bent on pursuing the

accumulation of money and reserves and catering only to those

who  are  able to contribute towards this chase, and  leaving

out  those  who, for no reason of their own,  are  unable  to

contribute?  Those are questions that we should ask about any

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also a Budget has to address itself to everyone.

We heard this afternoon

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>

from Mr Zainul Abidin about cohesion.  He was talking largely

about  the cohesion between the different races.  But are  we

not  blinding ourselves to something more important and  just

looking  at  the relations between the communities?  We  keep

talking  about  the bonding of our people, not just  cohesion

between the Indians, Chinese and the Malays, but the cohesion

between  all  our  people, regardless  of  whether  they  are

Chinese,  Indians  or Malays.  There must  be  a  bonding  of

everyone, the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots,

those  who are not handicapped and those who are handicapped.

That  is what we should aim at.  And if we can aim and get  a

society  like  that, where there is a real bond  between  our

people,  then  we  need not worry about harmonious  relations

between the different communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was coming to Parliament, the taxi-driver who

brought  me here said, "Oh, you are going to the Budget."   I

said, "Yes. Have you read the Budget?"  He said, "No, I  have

not read it."  I said, "But you should, you know.  You should

see  what  is being provided and then speak."  He said,  "How

can  I say?  What can I say in this place?"  He said, "I have

got enough work on my hands, trying to earn my living, trying

to  get  $40 to $50 a day so that I can survive.  What  am  I

supposed  to say about the Budget?"  So clearly, it does  not

address him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said about the political imperatives. Reading the

Budget, it appears to me that the political imperatives, as I

have  said earlier, would be the accumulation of our reserves

so  that we can always end up with a budget surplus.  And  by

that,  impress  the world with our figures  of  growth.   Our

statistical  figures  will look impressive  and  significant.

And  so  with this goal, we turned a budget deficit  of  $5.1

billion  into  a  surplus  of $3.2  billion.   That  is  some

achievement.   And  I  see part of it came  from  a  stronger

collection  of  the COEs.  That was a strong  boost  and  the

Minister  for Finance takes pride in this, and he  says  that

"we  are thus back in the happy position of being able to add

to our reserves.  And we need to accumulate budget surplus in

goods years."  But I did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>

not  think  1999 was a good year.  I thought 1999 was  a  bad

year but we somehow were able to accumulate a surplus of $3.2

billion even in a bad year, so I expect this year it might be

a  budget  surplus of $10 billion and then we shall  be  very

proud of ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong about having a budget surplus and

getting Singapore rich.  But I am reminded of the study  that

was made between Singapore and Hong Kong some years ago by  a

lecturer  or  professor  at  the Massachusetts  Institute  of

Technology.   His  conclusion  was  that  Singapore  has  got

richer,  by the Singapore Government digging deeper into  the

people's pockets.  Whereas in Hong Kong, he said, it was  the

true  entrepreneurial skill of the people which has made Hong

Kong richer.  That is something that we have to ponder about.

Are  we getting richer and richer because we dig deeper  into

the people's pockets?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister cites the factors leading to our recovery.

He  cites  two  external factors as I see them  -  upturn  in

global   electronics  and  the  turnaround  in  the  regional

economies.  These are both external factors that have  helped

us  to  recover.   But  he said that there  was  an  internal

significant contribution made in Singapore and that  was  the

acceptance  by our workers of the reduction in the employer's

contribution to their CPF and wage cuts.  So, our economy, it

would appear, has turned round largely because of our workers

paying   the  price  by  accepting  cuts  in  the  employer's

contribution, foregoing that and further accepting wage  cuts

and,  what  is more, accepting being thrown out of employment

for  months,  unable to find any employment.  It  is  to  our

workers, it would appear, besides external factors,  that  we

owe in a great measure the recovery in our economy. There  is

not a word about the contribution from the Ministers. I tried

to  suggest  that  we could have at least made  some  show-of

contributions and that was turned down as it would not help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now gloating over our recovery because the

workers have been able to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>

make  that  happen.   The question that  we  should  ask  is:

should  not  some of the surplus have been used to  alleviate

the  suffering  of  the  workers?  I  proposed  this  when  I

suggested the voluntary reduction of the Ministers' salaries.

It  is  not good enough saying in fine words about Government

appreciating workers, accepting CPF and wage cuts.   What  is

needed  is  a  little more than words. We need  to  show  the

appreciation  in terms that would really get to the  workers.

One  Member  spoke about the possible use  of  some  of  this

surplus  to  further improve the economy by  reducing  costs.

That  is  a good question.  Why are we so anxious to  show  a

surplus, that we perhaps neglect the people who need help and

do  a  bit  more  towards boosting the  economy,  instead  of

leaving it just to our workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the allocation

of  our  monies for this year.  Because here again, it  shows

the kind of society we are and our political imperatives.  In

the  allocation,  I  see  defence takes  the  largest  share.

Somebody mentioned about education taking a lion's share, but

defence takes $7.4 billion of our monies.  Compared to  that,

we are providing for the general education programme  -  I am

not  talking  about the entire allocation for  the  Education

Ministry   -   but  the  general  education  programme,   ie,

educating  our  children in Government  schools,  Government-aided  schools  and other independent schools,  we  are  only

spending $3.13 billion for that.  Defence takes $7.4 billion.

The  education of our children takes $3.13 billion, less than

half.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I looked at the medical services, what is provided

for  the medical care of our people and what do we find?  The

medical services are allocated $815.4 million, less than one-seventh of the defence budget.  So, what does it tell  us  of

our society?  We should ponder as to what is the lesson there

for  someone  looking and reading the  Budget.   Is  it  more

important that we should raise the level of education of  our

people?  Is it not more important that we should see that our

people are in good health, that our people who contribute  to

the  economy  are  able to provide enough  medical  care  for

themselves?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are political goods, not economic goods, education

and healthcare.  Our reserves are not the monies that we have

stashed  away.  Our reserves are our people.  It  is  on  our

people that we depend for the future of Singapore, not on the

monies.  So that is where we should be spending the money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see someone criticised Mr Chiam See Tong. I was not

here,  but  I  completely echo what he said.   We  should  be

spending far more on education than we are.  I will  come  to

the  expenditure on defence.  I have raised this  every  year

and  I  shall be missed if I do not touch on that this  year.

But let me say a little bit about how important it is that we

spend  more money on education and health, not on a  showcase

but on our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and health are the key to the economic

progress of a country.  We do not need an economist  to  tell

us  that.   We  seem to pay lip service to it.  The  Minister

says  that  less  than  half of Singaporeans  above  40  have

secondary  education,  and he says steps  will  be  taken  to

retrain  these  workers.  But should we wait until  they  are

over  40  and  unemployed  before we  begin  the  process  of

educating them?  Should we not catch them young when they are

in  the  schools?  Should our aim not be to  see  that  every

child  in  Singapore  has a minimum of  secondary  education?

That is where we should be concentrating our efforts and  our

money.  If we do that and we see that schools turn out  every

year enough people with secondary education, then we need not

have  to worry about our workforce.  But, obviously,  we  are

not  doing  that at the moment.  We do not want  any  elitist

education.   There is no harm in providing elitist  education

for  some.  But we want education for all.  No one should  be

left out of this.  Let us make that our goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then health. A healthy worker is an economically

productive  person.   If he is unhealthy,  he  ceases  to  be

economically productive.  So, should we not be spending  more

on  healthcare?  I hope when we come to discuss the  Ministry

of Health's estimates, I shall have the time to say something

about the cost of medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>

care in Singapore. But because time is moving on, I will move

to the expenditure on defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are allocating the

biggest  share of $7.4 billion of our monies to defence.   We

have  a  faithful  press in Singapore.   I  see  BG  Yeo  has

suddenly said, "No let up in our control of the local press."

I  am sure the press will say, "Oh, Jeyaretnam doesn't want a

strong Singapore."  "Jeyaretnam wants a weak Singapore."   At

one  time, it was said  that I would rather have the Russians

come  in.  That was when I was here in Parliament in 1981  to

1986.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singaporeans were

told  in  plain language why we have to spend  such  a  large

chunk  of  our monies on defence.  Why do we have  to  put  a

ceiling  of 6% of GDP on our defence expenditure, so that  we

can  go on increasing until we reach that?  Is that the goal,

that we should spend 6% of our GDP on defence?  I see that it

has gone up every year.  From 1995, when it was $5 billion in

the  chart given, it is now $7.4 billion in 2000.   So,  what

are we going up to next year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, I quoted the spending in other

countries.  I have not got the time to do that this year.   I

pointed  out that Singapore was very high in the spending  on

defence.  The only country that exceeded our defence spending

were those countries which were in trouble spots.  I see that

India has suddenly increased its defence spending.  I do  not

know  whether  expressed in terms of GDP  percentage  it  has

exceeded  Singapore's.  But India is in a  totally  different

position.   They have some trouble on their borders.   Do  we

have trouble?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singaporeans

were  told  where  do  we expect the threat.   Where  is  the

trouble coming for Singapore and why is it necessary  for  us

to  spend  the money that we are proposing to spend  to  meet

this  trouble?   We do not want just remarks like,  "Oh,  the

security  of  Singapore is important or paramount."   No  one

questions it.  The Workers' Party does not question it.   The

Workers' Party is second

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>

to  none in asserting that the security of Singapore is  very

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggested, even in the 80s when I was here, that we

set  up  a committee to study the effective cost of defending

Singapore.   Why  do we not do that, so that the  public  can

see?   I  suggested that perhaps we should consider  reducing

the  period of national service.  I see that carries quite  a

bit  of chunk of the operating cost.  Do we need to keep  our

boys  for  2-21/2 years in the army to give them the training

that  they need?  Could we not speed it up and cut the  cost?

Or  are  we just happy to go on and show that we are spending

all this money on our defence?  The trouble is that it may be

sending  the  wrong  signals to our neighbours  to  see  that

Singapore keeps increasing its defence expenditure.  So I ask

that  we explain to the people.  If we explain to them,  they

will  accept  it.  But I am asked by several people,  believe

me,  why is it necessary for us to spend this amount of money

in  our defence when, as I have said before, the world  would

appear to be getting a safer place, particularly this region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a little about the provision for the ageing

population.  I see that the Government plans to provide  what

it  calls  a Supplementary Retirement Scheme.  That,  as  the

Minister  explains, is to be purely voluntary.   If  you  are

able  to put aside, yes, come and put it aside.  What if  you

are not able to put it aside?  If you need all the money that

you  are earning to keep your body and soul together and  you

are  unable to save, so you are not going to be looked  after

when you are 65 and over.  Instead of all these schemes, when

will this Government move on to study a proper pension scheme

for all our citizens above the age of 65 so that the cost  of

this  pension  is met across the board, everyone contributing

towards  this national social security?  What is  wrong  with

that?  What is wrong with a national health service?  Why  do

we  not  set  up a committee to study this?  Or  are  we  not

interested?  What are our political imperatives?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a plea for greater

transparency in information provided in the management of our

finances.   Not too long ago I tabled a Question for  Written

Answer of the Minister for Finance asking whether we could be

told  about all the losses that have been suffered by wholly-owned  Government linked companies from 1965.  I got a reply,

a long one, but in essence, it does not make sense.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, the time allotted

for your speech has expired.

<br>2.02 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support  the motion standing in  the  name  of  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recession that we have just emerged from reminds me

in  many ways of the recession we had between 1986 and  1987.

Firstly,  it  was short and we seemed to have recovered  even

before  the  full impact was felt.  Secondly, the  Government

was quick to take measures to cut costs, improve productivity

and  help  businesses look for new markets further  from  the

region  affected by the downturn.  Thirdly, the cost  cutting

measures,  especially the reduction in CPF  contributions  by

the  employers,  were  fully supported by  the  trade  unions

again.  The speed with which we have recovered ahead  of  our

neighbouring  countries reflects several  inherent  strengths

that have often been taken for granted.  These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, an honest, stable, decisive and competent

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an enlightened trade union body with bold

leaders and supportive members and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a sound banking and financial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many years of conservative budgeting resulting

in healthy cumulative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>

financial  reserves that are able to tide us over periods  of

recessions; and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, business people with the drive and tenacity to

innovate and think of new ways of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable that even in a recession year in 1999,

we  were  able to accumulate reserves of about $3.2  billion.

The Minister has given the reasons for it but I do  not think

we  are surprised any more because in the last 12 years since

I have been in Parliament, the actual surplus has always been

a  few  billion  dollars  more than budgeted,  whether  in  a

recession or periods of economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget reflects the unexpected economic

recovery last year, with a growth rate of 5.4% and forecasted

growth  of  between 4.5% and 6.5% for this  year.   It  is  a

balanced  budget  in that it attempts to retain  certain  tax

concessions given away during the recession, reduce  some  in

sectors  that  have  not fully recovered  and  remove  others

totally  in  sectors  that are deemed to  be  growing.   This

budget   has  also  addressed  the  need  to  be  competitive

globally,  especially  in  the  financial  sector   and   the

promotion  of technopreneurship in Singapore.   At  the  same

time,  the  budget also addresses the need to look after  our

elderly relatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economy has recovered, achieving a

respectable 5.4% last year, the growth is not even across all

the industries.  There is concern in sectors that are lagging

behind, mainly construction, business services and small  and

medium-sized  enterprises.  They fear that the stock  markets

may   have  moved  ahead  of  fundamentals  and  misled   the

Government  into  removing  or  restoring  tax  rebates   and

concessions  a  little bit too early.  Let  me  say  that  my

feedback  on  this  is  based on anecdotal  evidence  through

informal  conversations with business people from  SMEs,  and

not from any formal surveys or studies conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to the specifics of the budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II, page 5 of the Budget Statement, it is stated

that the Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>

Expenditure includes a provision of almost $1 billion for new

priority  projects that may materialise in the course  of  FY

2000.   I  would like to ask the Finance Minister whether  we

always  make such provisions, which is a large amount.   What

are  some  of the priority projects that may arise,  or  have

arisen  in the past, that require the use of such provisions?

Are  these  provisions responsible for  some  of  the  actual

budget  surpluses over forecast that we get  at  the  end  of

every fiscal year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the construction and business

services sectors have not recovered from the recession.   Can

we  not  do  more in terms of tax concessions for  these  two

sectors to help speed up their recovery?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Supplementary Retirement Scheme to

encourage  Singaporeans to supplement their  CPF  savings  by

contributing  voluntarily to private  funds  over  and  above

their  CPF savings.  Since there is already a percentage  cap

based  on  the  employee's salary, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister to make the contributions totally tax exempt.  As it

stands,  the SRS only defers the payment of tax to  the  time

the  savings  are withdrawn.   The system may be  inequitable

depending on the marginal tax rate of the contributor at  the

time  of  contribution, and again, at the time of withdrawal.

Those  who are successful and continue to work way  past  the

age  of withdrawal of the funds may end up paying more  taxes

in  the end than if they were to save the money on their own.

I  hope  the Minister will take this point into consideration

in formulating the details of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laud the Government for bringing down the corporate

tax  rate by 0.5% to 25.5%.  However, I am a bit puzzled  why

the  maximum  personal income tax rate for the individual  is

not  brought  down  in tandem. There is  now  a  gap  of  2.5

percentage  points between the top personal income  tax  rate

and the corporate tax rate.  Will this not encourage the very

wealthy and financially savvy to exploit the difference?   At

25.5%, we are also still about 9.5% higher than Hong Kong.  I

know  that many high net worth individuals and even companies

park

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>

most of their funds in lower tax regimes like Hong Kong.  Can

the  Minister  give us some indication on how much  funds  of

Singaporeans are parked overseas and the estimated  tax  loss

to  us  as a result?  Is there any measure the Minister plans

to take to encourage Singaporeans to repatriate some of these

funds home?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate on commercial and industrial

properties  of 55% will be extended for one more  year  at  a

reduced  rebate  of 25% only.  Given the weak  state  of  the

rental market, I urge the Minister to consider extending  the

rebate at 55% as before for one more year.  This will be  one

way  to  help  the construction sector recover more  quickly.

Similarly,  the tax exemption on property tax for land  under

development could have been extended for another year  or  so

to encourage construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the Government's initiative to give

tax  concessions to inventors and innovators  and  to  extend

such  incentives to cover the non-manufacturing  sector.   To

encourage  entrepreneurship, the Government  should  consider

giving  some  tax  incentives to start-up companies  per  se,

whether   they  have  inventions  or  innovations  that   are

protectable.  Perhaps, all start-up companies should be given

a  reduced corporate tax rate of three years to help them  to

reinvest and grow the business faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government is giving estate duty

exemption  for  residential properties up to $9  million  and

only  $600,000 for all other dutiable assets.  I have  spoken

up  on  this before and I still find that this law encourages

over  consumption  in  residential properties  that  are  not

productive  assets.  I still maintain that other assets  such

as  stocks  and  shares should be given the  same  exemption,

especially  now that we are encouraging more Singaporeans  to

be  entrepreneurs, so they would be owning shares rather than

residential  properties.   I urge the  Minister  to  consider

putting  all  assets together for the purpose of estate  duty

exemption.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the plan to introduce enhanced tax

treatment  for stock options. While the study on the  details

is  still  underway, I would like to ask that tax concessions

be  considered for companies providing supporting services to

such  start-up  companies and who are paid in  shares  rather

than  in  cash.   This  is  getting  increasingly  common  as

lawyers,  accountants,  auditors, consultants  and  financial

advisers  provide  services for such start-up  companies  and

accept  shares  in lieu of cash payment.  The shares  are  of

value  only  if  the  start-up succeeds  and  goes  for  IPO,

otherwise  these professionals end up working for free.   The

tax  treatment  should take the risks of  such  professionals

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every

year  we  all anxiously await the announcement of the  Budget

and  most  of us would have a long wish list.  We would  want

more   to   be  done  for  businesses,  community,  and   the

individuals. Inevitably, based on the average wish list,  one

would always be disappointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual, I would like to have great reduction

in tax rates, greater reliefs, more rebates, etc.  After all,

the  effective  corporate tax rate has  been  increased  from

23.4%  last  year  to  26% and then  to  25.5%  only  in  the

following  year.  It seems that most of us share the  concern

that  many  corporations are feeling the  aftershock  of  the

economic  crisis,  and  could  do  with  continuing  support.

Personal  tax rebates have also been reduced.  I am concerned

because  there  is much less to save for my  post  retirement

era.   I  am  sure  that all who have celebrated  their  50th

birthday will feel this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the forthcoming introduction of the

Supplementary  Retirement Scheme.  We have to  wait  for  the

details  but for those of us who are treated as self-employed

and  do not contribute to the CPF scheme, we await with bated

breath to see if the scheme could be extended to beyond  just

employees.    I  assume  that  contributions  will   be   tax

deductible and I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>

hope that the ceiling on such contributions will be set high.

In  the  final analysis, either we are able to take  care  of

ourselves or we become a burden to society.  With a  generous

scheme, more people would be included to save a greater  part

of their income.  Not every one is savvy enough to mind their

own  savings  through  investments or  even  to  discern  and

identify  the  better  managed  funds.   For  a  majority  of

citizens  there would be a preference in favour of a  secured

scheme  that  pays a decent return.  There are enough  horror

stories  of  CPF  savings being whittled  away  through  poor

investment  decisions.  Whatever the rationale for suggesting

that  this  scheme is for employees only,  I  hope  that  the

Minister  will consider including self-employed  persons  for

the  scheme.  Growingly, the numbers of self-employed  should

increase.  There will be more home-based businesses set up by

individuals,  people  with creative ideas  and  who  wish  to

remain independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the ElderCare Fund is most timely.

Whilst being surrounded by loving family members would be the

ideal  environment for rehabilitative care,  the  reality  is

that  most  homes are unsuitable for such care.  Everyone  is

out working or schooling.  At best the patient is left to the

care  of  a house-help, an additional live-in that crams  the

home   environment  and  often  causes  tension.   With   the

ElderCare  Fund,  there should be available  more  affordable

nursing  home care where the patient can be properly attended

to for rehabilitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People I have discussed the Budget with initially

wondered why I am satisfied with the Budget.  For me,  it  is

the  realisation  that  we are moving from  direct  taxes  to

indirect  taxes through the GST.  I recall that the Minister,

when he introduced the GST, said that he would retain the GST

rate  at 3% for five years.  That was in 1994.  Well,  it  is

still  at  3%.  I hope that it will be kept at this rate  for

another  10  years  at least, or dare I wish  for  it  to  be

permanently so.  With an indirect tax regime, I feel more  in

control.  By controlling my expenses I am saving on taxes and

really there is no limit to how much I can save if I keep  my

life simple.  Incentives and schemes would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>

have  qualifying factors and I might not benefit from any  or

all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my satisfaction with the Budget, I would

like to request for higher basic personal and family reliefs.

Such  higher reliefs should not be conditional such as  those

benefiting  only  graduate mothers,  or  those  who  opt  for

separate assessment, etc.  The basic reliefs such as for  the

self, wife, children should be increased.  It certainly costs

much  more  than $2,000 per annum to maintain  a  wife  or  a

child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is scope for considering a two-tier corporate tax

system.   Small enterprises, including the start-ups,  should

be  taxed  at  a  much  lower  rate.   The  greatest  problem

encountered by start-ups is cash flow management.  They  need

to  plough  every single cent back into the  business.   Very

often the key personnel in a start-up draws very little or no

salary.   Those who are lucky enough to generate a profit  in

the  first  couple of years will feel the pain of  having  to

reduce their precious cash flow through the payment of taxes.

A  scheme  for  start-ups  could be  based  on  turnover  and

restricted to the first three years of the business.   During

this  three-year period, they could be granted a  tax  rebate

of,  say,  50%.  I believe that such a scheme would encourage

more  people to become entrepreneurs.  We should not set  our

sights  on  just  the glamour business.   In  any  successful

community there must be a variety of providers.  We will  not

have  a  healthy manufacturing base if there are  no  support

industries.  We see such problems cropping up in the emerging

economies.  We must retain and encourage the establishment of

more  support industries.  This time it will include  the  e-commerce  sector and there will be many creative  individuals

who  can  remain independent and provide first-class  support

services  such as creative work, including the designing  and

coding of web pages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rapidly ageing society, it is imperative that

people  are engaged in active ageing.  It does not matter  if

they  are  really  financially independent.  Everyone  should

remain active, continuously setting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>

and  achieving goals - having something important to wake  up

to,  to  live  for.  Active ageing could be in the  field  of

voluntary services but in a small nation like ours  and  with

the  belief  that every Singaporean matters, everyone  should

try  to  remain in the workforce - employed or self-employed.

With  lower  taxes or special tax rebates for  older  people,

they  would  have  the incentive to provide  services,  using

their   accumulated   experiences  and  providing   them   at

competitive rates, or even start a small business  that  they

have always dreamt about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more can and should be done for the individuals and

small   enterprises.   We  should  not  focus  only  on   big

businesses.   Big businesses are important for  our  economic

development.   However, our society will be the  richer  when

individuals  are fired-up to explore and try their  hands  at

new  things.   We will be creating a home with a  variety  of

interests  being fulfilled.  There will be greater scope  for

every Singaporean to matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>2.23 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even

as  I  rise in support of the financial policy for the  short

term,  as outlined by the Minister for Finance, I am  mindful

of the multiple challenges that we in Singapore are currently

facing for the longer term:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, ensuring that we stay in play on the global

front, even after emerging from the Asian crisis;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, crafting the appropriate response to the

onslaught of technology in traditional businesses, especially

for sectors which are important to our survival and for which

hitherto we have a competitive edge, whilst;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, putting in place measures to address potential

social  issues,  such as an ageing population  or  a  digital

divide.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the confluence of the above challenges,

maintaining the status quo will not do.  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the economic crisis, we have implemented

cost-cutting measures and made the necessary adjustments.  By

most  accounts, we have weathered the crisis well.   We  need

now  to  balance carefully the intention to restore  the  CPF

cuts  with  staying competitive.  Already, manifestations  of

our  tight labour market, such as rising staff turnover,  are

emerging  again.   This is beginning to  affect  the  smaller

companies.



<br><br><i>Shift in Business Focus</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the global economy is transforming so quickly that

old  logic  and management tools are no longer relevant.   At

the  same time, the consumer's position has been strengthened

substantially by the application of technology.  He  now  has

infinite choices at increasingly efficient prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market offerings will in tandem reflect more

customisation  for  the  individual consumer.   For  example,

buying  a customised motor vehicle, with gadgets and fittings

reflecting  one's  preferences, will soon be  commonplace  in

many  countries.   Really,  the shift  in  focus  is  towards

creating digital value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has the greatest impetus to change as

their  focus  on  profit and loss or P&L is a strong  driver.

They  have  already taken all these challenges on board.   We

are  constantly bombarded with news of yet another merger of,

sometimes seemingly unrelated, businesses.  There is a school

of  thought  which seeks to explain the Dow's gravity-defying

act  - that technology has inspired consolidation and enabled

businesses   to   record   real  productivity   gains,   hype

notwithstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, for our economy, gaps may soon be

evident  and even widened on two fronts, firstly, the  public

sector and, secondly, the individual contributor.



<br><br><i>Role of the Public Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation brought about by technology is

economy-wide, system-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>

wide   and  "the  excellence  of  every  government  is   its

adaptation to the state of those to be governed by it".   The

public  sector  is  not immune to these  dramatic  forces  of

change.   Just  as  businesses must transform  themselves  to

survive  and  compete  in the digital  marketplace,  so  must

governments.   Our  public sector, or  parts  of  our  public

sector,  may  not  be exposed directly to these  same  market

pressures  but  for it to be a more efficient  and  effective

service  provider, it must remain relevant  to  the  changing

economy that it operates in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am by no means expressing dissatisfaction over

our  public sector.  On the contrary, I am very proud of  the

achievements  thus  far.   In  fact,  I  believe  we  have  a

relatively nimble and adaptable public sector which has  made

giant strides in supporting our economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the evolution of the new economy may dictate a

pace  and  an extent of change within the public  sector  far

greater than expected or planned.  Very soon, it would not be

enough  for  Ministries  to just focus  on  total  costs,  as

outlined in the Minister's Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a private business is organised specifically to

manipulate  resources  so  that  it  can  provide  acceptable

shareholder returns.  Increasingly, the public sector must be

organised in a similar fashion, so that it reaps economic and

social  returns for its shareholders, who are the  owners  of

the Singapore economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest two broad philosophies for the

public sector to consider adopting:



<br><br><i>(a)  Privatisation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should accelerate the privatisation

process.  As many public service agencies as possible  should

be  corporatised  or even privatised so  as  to  emulate  the

private industry's more efficient way of managing resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where liberalisation or removal of anti-competition

barriers will render a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>

level  playing  field for all interested  participants,  this

should  be  undertaken purposefully, and as  soon  as  it  is

economically viable to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that we have already made substantial headway in

financial services, and recently in telecommunications.   The

Minister  for Trade and Industry has also announced plans  to

deregulate  power  generation and supply.   However,  several

segments  are  still  outstanding,  for  example,  sea   port

services,   airport   services,   land   transportation   and

eventually even broadcasting.  These are all integral to  the

infrastructure  necessary to support the digital  marketplace

and  any  inefficient link will be a weak link in the  entire

supply chain.



<br><br><i>(b)  Focus on Performance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many public agencies have mandates which are not

tangibly  or directly related to the running of the  economy,

whether  the  old  or the new, for example, the  Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports.  However, as they  utilise

resources and play an important social role, there must be  a

shift in focus away from traditional budgetary mandates, such

as  cost-containment, to a semblance of P&L accountability or

consumer satisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider setting benchmarks from

the  users' perspectives, which can be a modification of  the

stated  Desired  Outcomes  and Productivity  Measures.   More

importantly,  public sector employees should be assessed  and

motivated at the individual level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is already obvious, technology will continue to

enable many Government agencies to better serve consumers  of

public  services,  including businesses.   Yet,  even  though

technology  is  fast  becoming the most  important  input  or

resource, it is still widely viewed as a cost and not a means

to   exploiting   distribution  and  existing  infrastructure

better.



<br><br><i>Mindset Changes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues have alluded to, it is no

longer enough to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>

maintain  the status quo, even if it were possible.   Neither

is  it  about creating barriers to entry.  The incumbent  can

frequently  use its dominant position to build a  competitive

advantage but this cannot be achieved by imposing barriers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither is it about cutting costs to maintain a marginal

price advantage, as the edge will not be sustainable.  It  is

really  about  coming  up  with  new  ideas,  about  thinking

creatively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote from Douglas Aldrich, it is about

innovative  actions  that  take  nothing  for  granted,   not

existing  monopoly,  neither regulatory barriers  nor  market

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember how our fresh food needs used to be met only

during the early morning hours at the wet market.  With  more

dual  career families, supermarkets offering fresh food  like

NTUC  Fairprice and Cold Storage, soon became popular.   Now,

with  a  global  marketplace and irregular working  patterns,

many  consumers would simply want to be able to  order  their

food  needs online and have them delivered at some  appointed

time.   So, e-tailing is fast evolving.  And we can see  from

this   example  that  the  solution  is  not  about   opening

supermarkets round-the-clock but really providing the avenues

for customers to have their needs met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all have certain mindsets that have evolved over

time  such  as career and job aspirations, desiring  after  a

known  pattern  to work and retirement.  But  many  of  these

mindsets  are  not under scrutiny and they will  need  to  be

changed the sooner the better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my colleagues have suggested how we should

change mindsets.  So I will not belabour the point, except to

say a 9-to-5 job for all of our working lives till we retire,

with  a  stable employer such as the Government or  a  multi-national  company, will no longer do.  Instead,  a  good  bet

will  be to contribute towards a 24-by-7 (24 hours by 7 days)

solution that evolves with changing needs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will require us to constantly think out-of-the-box,

acquire  knowledge  and  have  an  appetite  for  uncertainty

without  the comfort of safety nets.  An assumption  of  risk

and  an  open  mind  would  have to be  the  working  mantra.

Contrary to throwing out old models, I believe that the risk-reward  relationship will continue to hold true and that  the

rewards  can  be  handsome for the innovative,  diligent  and

adventurous contributor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Budget as presented by

the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget has generally been welcomed on the

ground.    In  particular,  its  focus  on  the  family,   on

retirement planning and also the high-tech sectors  has  been

commended.  The man-in-the-street of course feels that  there

are  slim  pickings, but of course the optimists  will  argue

that slim pickings are better than no pickings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to comment on the Budget from the

perspective  of three tenets of fiscal policy.   First,  data

reliability;  second, distortionary effects of  some  of  the

policies; and, third, allocative efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion seeks this House's support for the

Government's  financial  policy.   Public  policy   must   be

predicated  on reliable data, and that is especially  so  for

financial  policy.   Robust forecasts of  GDP  growth  rates,

revenue   and   expenditure  engender   confidence   in   the

Government's   financial  programme.    It   also   reassures

Singaporeans  that the choices implicit in  the  Government's

taxation and spending programme are indeed necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this light, the $8 billion turnaround Budget has

raised  many eyebrows.  Many have already commented  in  this

House on the sheer magnitude of this change.  Allow me,  Sir,

to  focus instead on the contributory factors and the  nature

of  this change which, I believe, paints a revealing picture.

The key question is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>

whether this could have been anticipated, if not to the  full

extent,  then  at least partially.  Firstly, expenditure  was

lower  by  10%, or $3.4 billion, compared to the forecast  of

$29.4  billion, and it was attributed to two factors -  lower

cost and the rescheduling of some development expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the relevant agencies who forecast this

development expenditure, in the first place, have anticipated

this  delay?   More importantly, should there  be  safeguards

against   such  needless  reservation  of  scarce  resources,

particularly  in  a  year when there  were  other  compelling

needs?   Otherwise, departments will continue to  over-budget

with impunity, secure in the knowledge that any residual that

is unutilised can be rolled over to the next financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, Sir, there has been a 20% increase,

or  $4.8 billion from the forecast of $24.1 billion.  The  V-shaped  recovery has been assigned responsibility.   Sir,  in

February  1999,  the  Government's forecast  for  growth  was

between -1% and 1%.  The final figure was 5.4% and there were

regular  updates  along the year.  The  question  I  have  is

whether  we  have  sufficient instruments in our  forecasting

methods  to  anticipate some of these changes.  For  example,

the  Minister  has mentioned in his speech the  composite  of

leading indicators which is supposed to lead economic  growth

by  up to nine months.  That would mean that, in February, we

should  have  a  reasonable indication of what  the  economic

scenario  should be towards the end of the year.   Similarly,

we  also use other proxies like the non-oil retained imports.

One   reason   often  given  for  variability  in   forecast,

especially  in Singapore's context, is that we  are  an  open

economy  and that there are several exogenous factors  beyond

our  control.  So the question then is whether we can in fact

separate   out   what   the   impact   of   those   exogenous

uncontrollable factors are as opposed to what is  within  our

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not mere academic questions. The

Government's budget and the premises on which it is built are

of great

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>

political and economic consequence.  The business sector sees

it  as a bellwether of economic health and for the country as

a whole, it is an important tool for shaping expectations and

behaviour.   Sir,  the  greater the  divergence  between  our

forecast and the actuals, the weaker this instrument will  be

as  a tool of economic policy, or social and national policy.

I therefore urge the Minister to review this process in order

to  ensure  that  these divergences are minimised  in  future

Budgets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second aspect is on distortionary effects. As

far  as possible, we would like fiscal policy to leave market

forces  untrammelled in order to pursue their  self-interest,

except  where  the  desired effect is to change  such  market

behaviour.   In  this Budget, one example where  I  feel,  or

fear,  that  a distortionary effect is likely is in  the  tax

treatment  of  ESOPs.  I welcome the Minister's  announcement

that more will be done.  But I ask why the focus on the high-tech start-ups in particular.  I raise this question for  two

reasons.   Firstly,  the  principles  underlying  ESOPs   are

applicable  to  all  aspects of business  endeavour  and  not

confined   to  the  high-tech  sector.   The  knowledge-based

economy,   as  the  Minister  himself  has  said,  emphasises

comparative advantage through the use of knowledge.  That  is

applicable whether a company is in the high-tech sector or in

the traditional sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this favourable treatment of ESOPs for the

high-tech  sector will distort market forces and  lead  to  a

further diversion of talent to the high-tech start-ups.   The

problem  is  already  pronounced  on  the  ground  with  many

traditional  companies  and SMEs  struggling  to  keep  their

talent,  let  alone  attract new talent.   If  we  have  this

asymmetric  arrangement, then I think we will accentuate  the

problem  on the ground.  I therefore urge the Minister  that,

when  making the announcement in May, he extends the enhanced

tax treatment to all sectors of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allocative efficiency. Sir, we would like

to think that, when Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>

earmarks  expenditure to benefit particular segments  of  our

population, it indeed reaches that segment of the population.

In  this regard, I have raised this question before and  wish

to  put it to the Minister again, whether the use of HDB flat

size  as  a  proxy to distribute HDB service and  conservancy

charges  and rental rebates, GST offsets and rebates,  and  a

whole  slew  of  other rebates - I did a  quick  back-of-the-envelope calculation and it is about $73 million this year  - is  an  appropriate  proxy.  Would we  be  channelling  these

resources  to individuals who need not receive such largesse?

And  would we be depriving others who would benefit more from

the additional dollar?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, individually, these amounts are very small per

household, and it is likely to be like manna from heaven  for

many  of  them.   It is just another thing and  makes  little

impact  on them.  If we can aggregate some of these and  give

it  to particular households judged to be needy, I think  the

impact  would be far greater,  psychologically, and  also  in

terms of the social impact on their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to consider a two-tier system,

if not for this year, then in the forthcoming financial year.

One,  where  we can adhere to this HDB proxy-based allocative

system.   But the second tier can be channelled through  Town

Councils and Community Development Councils.  They are closer

to  the ground.  They are in a better position to judge which

households need this form of assistance and which do not, and

they would be able to administer the funds entrusted to them.

I urge the Minister to consider this change.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, yesterday,

many  MPs have already expressed their disappointment on  the

withdrawal  of  some of the rebates and concessions  in  this

year's  budget and the negative effect it has, especially  on

businesses  which have been badly affected  by  the  economic

crisis.   They need time and resources to recuperate  despite

the more than optimistic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>

economic  outlook.   I therefore do not intend  to  elaborate

except  to  reflect  on how those who are  affected  must  be

feeling.  It is like someone who is drowning and the lifeline

is  extended to him, but after he has been pulled out to  the

surface of the water, the lifeline is withdrawn and he has to

struggle  to swim ashore, that is provided he still  has  the

strength to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's reluctance to extend its assistance all

the  way to ensure the complete recovery runs contrary to the

Government's pro-business stand and also not consistent  with

the  Finance Minister's assertion that the manufacturing  and

service  industries  should remain the twin  pillars  of  our

growth engine.   If confidence is the main thrust of business

success,  the latest cut in the rebates and concessions  must

have  dealt a severe blow to the confidence that is so  badly

needed at this critical time of recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, construction is the worst performer last

year.   While  I  am not overly concerned with  the  negative

growth  in the construction sector (they may be cyclical  and

with the economic recovery, I am sure robust growth will soon

return)  I am more concerned with the total lack of  progress

in   the   standard,  quality  and  professionalism  in   our

construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, many MPs have expressed that we must all

operate  business  at  Internet  speed.   Unfortunately,  the

progress  of the construction industry is still moving  at  a

snail's pace.  While other industries make progress by  leaps

and  bounds, the construction industry stays stagnant and  is

persistently  plagued  with  numerous  seemingly   unsolvable

problems.  It is sad to see that, in Singapore, our  building

cost  remains one of the highest compared to other  developed

countries, such as the US, Europe and Australia, and the time

taken for completion of a project, one of the longest and, in

terms  of  productivity, the lowest.  These create a  serious

problem to our national economy as it is an industry that  is

considered  a pillar to our domestic economy and  contributes

over 9%  to our GDP in the year 1998.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am greatly encouraged by the report

submitted  by  the Construction 21 Steering  Committee.   The

report is thorough and comprehensive.  While I hope that this

would  lead  to  a  new era in our construction  industry,  I

remain  cautiously  optimistic.   Through  the  years,   many

studies  and proposed measures have been made to improve  the

industry  but,  sad to say, with very little  success.   Till

today, the same problems faced by the industry throughout the

years remain, and perhaps become more serious because of  the

rapid pace of development and the chronic manpower shortage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By going through the Construction 21 Report, I have no

doubt  the  Committee  has identified most  of  the  problems

arising   from   our  construction  industry   and   the   39

recommendations have just about covered all, if not most,  of

the  problems  that  have  been the  cause  of  putting  this

industry   in  its  present  sorry  state.   But   the   most

comprehensive  recommendation on paper may  not  produce  the

desired result in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you a story which has been told to me by

some  contractors.  Some years ago, when the quality  of  our

finishing  was so deplorable, the authority recommended  that

contractors  who have obtained a project of  a  certain  size

must employ a certain number of skilled craftsmen, otherwise,

they would have to pay a levy or fine for every shortfall  in

the  number required. If I remember correctly, it  was  about

$5,000 for each skilled craftsman. So the contractors went to

source  from Hong Kong the necessary skilled craftsmen.   But

when  they  came,  after  working  for  a  few  months,  they

practically  refused  to  work and just  laze  around.   When

queried by the project manager, they calmly retorted,  saying

that the manager should not complain for even though they did

not do any work by just sitting around, the contractors still

saved  a  sum of $3,000 because their wages were only $2,000.

This is the Hongkonger's street-smartness for you.  No wonder

we lost the SingTel deal!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little story illustrates the complexity and the

intricacies of the industry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>

and  to  implement  successfully the recommendations  by  the

Construction  21 Committee is no simple task.  It  will  need

constant  review  and monitoring and close  supervision  and,

above   all,   manpower   and   financial   resources.    The

responsibility to ensure the successful implementation of all

these recommendations is under the charge of the Building and

Construction   Authority   in  the   Ministry   of   National

Development which I notice has been allocated a sum of  $18.9

million  for the fiscal year 2000.  To execute this  task  of

transforming  our  construction  industry  from   the   worst

economic  performer to a highly competitive global  industry,

this amount looks grossly inadequate, given the magnitude  of

the work involved and the importance of the building industry

to  our  overall national economy.  I hope the  Minister  can

find some ways to allocate more funds to ensure that the work

of  the  Construction 21 Committee will not be another  White

Paper  that will turn into an academic study, gathering  dust

in some storage space in the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have also brought up the importance of keeping

up  with  the  IT, Internet age and that we have to  allocate

more  resources to develop an IT industry which can  make  us

into  a  global  player  in  the  information  age.  While  I

completely agree that IT and Internet development would  have

a  greater impact on our lives than the industrial revolution

and  that  we ignore it at our own peril, I want to  sound  a

word  of  caution on our policy to nurture  a  new  breed  of

entrepreneurs  who  dare to venture  into  the  IT  industry.

Measures  such  as  the opening up of the  stock  market  for

listing  start-up  IT  companies,  as  well  as  the  various

measures and incentives given to encourage venture capital to

support IT start-up technopreneurs are most welcome,  but  we

must highlight, at the same time, that this IT business is  a

very   volatile  undertaking,  one  whose  future  is  highly

unpredictable and full of swift changes.  I have come  across

a  documentary on Silicon Valley in the United States.  It is

said to be a place where some of the richest people are found

but,  at the same time, it is also a place where many of  the

poorest congregate.  The soup kitchens where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>

down and out people in the United States get a free meal  are

well  patronised  in the Valley, and in the  interview,  many

down  and out aspirants stated that they have lost everything

within months of their arrival in the Valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have highlighted this because in Singapore, we have

enjoyed  steady economic progress throughout the  last  30-40

years. Our younger generation has not experienced very severe

setbacks.   Now they are being presented with a rosy  picture

on  how one can become a success overnight and bombarded with

the constant vast exposure of how much opportunities are open

to  everyone who dares to venture into the Internet business.

They  may be misled into unrealistic expectation that success

comes easily to those who try.  The reality is far from that,

for  every successful IT technopreneur, thousands fall by the

roadside. While there is no doubt that the future lies in  IT

and Internet business, we must prepare our younger generation

for  the  likelihood  of failure so that  if  they  encounter

failure,  their lives would not be shattered  but  they  will

have  perseverance and courage to stand up and  fight  again.

More  importantly, the Government has the duty  to  give  the

necessary  balanced information to remind  these  adventurous

young entrepreneurs on the shortfall of such undertakings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember years ago when the Government encouraged

Singaporeans  to  have a second wing by  investing  overseas,

many responded.  Some succeeded, but many failed and ended up

blaming  the Government's vigorous drive in encouraging  them

to  go  overseas.  Perhaps at that time, we have painted  too

rosy  a picture of opportunities lying beyond our shores  and

without, at the same time, pointing out the high-risk  factor

involved  in  such ventures. Therefore, many have  found  out

about failure in a very painful way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already signs that the euphoria of the

spectacular  result  achieved  by  some  of  the  IT   listed

companies are fading and consequently, many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>

investors will be hurt very badly.  It does not mean that all

IT  dot.com companies are in danger of falling apart but  the

ability  to  sort  out  the  genuine  ones  from  the  purely

speculative ones is important for those who intend to venture

into this business, both as entrepreneurs and investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new millennium will bring about some very exciting

time for Singapore and I congratulate the Government and  the

people  of Singapore for so successfully turning the economic

crisis  around.  It says a lot for our Government's pragmatic

policy  and the will of our people to be united when a crisis

confronts us.  But I would wish that at times, the Government

can  be a bit more generous and understanding and ensure that

whenever they extend a lifeline to those who needed it,  they

should go all the way to ensure a safe landing.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, before I

begin, may I have your permission to address the House on  an

article  in  today's  Straits Times  by  Ms  Chua  Lee  Hoong

entitled, "Do we really need 10 days to debate Budget?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short answer to Ms Chua is yes, and it is not

enough.   But  let me first address some of Ms Chua's  points

which I am sure are well-intentioned, if somewhat mistaken at

times.   Ms  Chua is an experienced reporter of Parliamentary

proceedings,   but   she  displays,  in  this   instance,   a

misunderstanding of what Parliament is about.   She  must  be

aware  that  Parliament is the public face of  democracy  and

that   the  executive  is  constitutionally  accountable   to

Parliament. Such accountability, like justice, must not  only

be  there but seen to be there. The Budget each year involves

billions  of dollars of public expenditure. This is the  only

occasion  when  Parliament  has the  opportunity  to  examine

closely  the programmes of each Ministry and how it  proposes

to use the funds allocated to it.  Members of this House take

their job very seriously and file many cuts in order to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>

probe and query how Ministers intend to use public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not just about feedback to Ministers.

Ms  Chua will, I am sure, be gratified to know that everyone,

including  Ministers,  is  on e-mail  and  that  we  do  send

messages  to  Ministers.  But she must also know  that  there

must  be  public debate on such an important  matter  as  the

Budget,  unless  she  and  the  public  are  satisfied   with

government behind closed doors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a full-blown debate, I think it depends on what

that  means.   We  have  never been  very  inclined  to  full

passionate exchanges, except occasionally.  But it  does  not

mean  that  there was no debate on the other occasions  as  a

sedate debate is still a debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me come to the main point of Ms Chua's

commentary whether 10 days are necessary.  Let me put it this

way.   If  Ms  Chua was a Member down here with  us  in  this

Chamber,  and if her cuts were the last in line, as mine  are

in  one  case, she would wish the debate was longer  than  10

days  when  the guillotine comes down.  I hope that  Ms  Chua

would  take the opportunity to state that she does value  the

importance  of public debate in Parliament and  an  essential

element of parliamentary democracy in Singapore.  I hope  her

comments are not intended to belittle the efforts of  Members

of  this House, the effort that we have put into this  annual

Budget debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, may I return somewhat nervously to my

speech  on  the  Budget debate.  Sir, I  support  the  motion

standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the new century dawns, we in Singapore are fortunate

enough  to  find the economy turning around for  the  better.

Indeed,  as  the Minister has pointed out, it is  a  V-shaped

recovery, not an U-shaped one.  Many who have heard the  good

news  expected the Budget to contain more good news  for  the

individuals  as  well as for corporations. In the  Minister's

own  words, 1999 was a year of remarkable economic turnaround

and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>

Asian  crisis  is  largely behind us. More importantly,  more

than  half  of  those retrenched in 1998  went  back  to  the

workforce.   Asset prices rebounded strongly,  stock  markets

saw    strong    rallies,   consumer    spending    increased

significantly,  prospects  are bright,  the  expected  budget

surplus  is $3.2 billion in financial year 1999.  It may  not

yet be the best of times, but is certainly far from the worst

of  times.   Singaporeans can say that they have entered  the

new  century with hope, at least with regard to our  economic

well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the economic well-being or the

prosperity of a country is an important goal for any country.

But  there are other goals that any first world country  will

aim  for.   One would be a high quality of life, in terms  of

good housing, pleasant neighbourhood and environment, vibrant

cultural  life,  arts, music literature and  other  forms  of

entertainment,  and  a  good  variety  of  quality   sporting

activities.   Then  there is the goal of human  security,  by

which  I  mean protection, not just against crime,  but  also

against  being  abandoned or destitute in  old  age,  against

poverty, against ill-health and of course protection not just

for  the  workers  against accidents at work,  but  also  for

families  of those disabled workers. We may add the  goal  of

inter-generational protection, that is, ensuring our children

must   also   have   a  good  education,  opportunities   for

advancement  when they reach working age. Finally,  there  is

the  all-important goal of national security,  which  is  the

defence against external threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of all these goals is revealed in the way in

which  expenditure  is  allocated.   The  Budget  signals   a

relative importance of these goals as reflected in the Budget

outlays   allocated   to  each  Ministry.    Currently,   the

expenditure summary has four sectors:  security,  social  and

community  services, economic and infrastructural development

and   general  services.   Security  includes  Defence,  Home

Affairs and Civil Defence.  It takes up 5.79% of GDP.   Next,

social  and  community  services include  Education,  Health,

Community  Development and Sports, Information and the  Arts,

Environment and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>

Public Housing. This takes up 6.93% of GDP.  The economic and

infrastructural  development includes  National  Development,

Communications   and   Information  Technology,   Trade   and

Industry, Manpower, Research and Development. This  takes  up

3.54% of GDP.  General Services take up 1.26% of GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were to look at this table, one would say that

social  and community services rank the highest in  terms  of

expenditure.  But on closer examination, we find that Defence

takes   up  the  highest  percentage  of  GDP,  followed   by

Education,  Public  Housing, Communications  and  Information

Technology, Trade and Industry and Home Affairs.   All  these

Ministries have expenditure budgets ranging from 1.09% of GDP

to  4.48% of GDP.  The budgets for Community Development  and

Sports,  Information  and the Arts and  Environment  together

constitute  no  more than 1.19% of GDP, and Health  takes  up

only  0.73%  of GDP.  If we say that the quality of  life  is

determined   by   living  conditions,  the  environment   and

encouraging the arts, we find that the expenditure budget for

this  amounts  to  only around 3.34% of  GDP.  This  includes

Health, Community Development and Sports, Information and the

Arts,  Environment and Public Housing, not  an  insubstantial

amount,  but  one feels may be legitimately increased,  given

the economic prosperity of the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the reason in pursuing economic prosperity

if  not  to  improve  the quality of life for  one's  people?

Crude though this comparison might be, it coincides, I think,

with the public perception that more can be done with respect

to  the  goals  relating to the quality of life as  compared,

say, with the economic well-being or the national security of

the  country.  Many Members in this House have already spoken

of the ways and means whereby we in Singapore can improve the

quality  of life of those who live here.  But I wish to  echo

the calls of many Members that more funds should be allocated

to  the  Ministries  that are involved  in  quality  of  life

development  -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>

Ministries   such  as  Community  Development   and   Sports,

Information and the Arts, as well as Health and Environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general point that I would like to emphasise here is

that  we probably should expect more to be spent on improving

the  quality  of  life in Singapore and,  in  particular,  to

ensure that no segment of our society be left out of this so-called  fast,  speedy Internet world.  In  our  preoccupation

with  the  need to pursue a knowledge-based economy, whatever

that  is,  with  Internet speed, whatever  that  is,  is,  of

course,     desirable.     Government     initiatives     for

technopreneurship to flourish in Singapore is laudable.   The

demands  of  globalisation  and the  knowledge-based  economy

however  do  not  just exact a change in  mindset  among  our

population or training, but indeed require also a  change  in

perspective  for both young and old.  It is very  fundamental

that this happens.  The dangers of disconnection, instead  of

interconnection, are very high, when it comes  to  those  who

are  near retirement age or those who did not do well perhaps

in the pursuit of their studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is talk of a digital divide, but I find the phrase

rather clinical.  It pertains more to the virtual world  than

the  real.   The danger is actually very real, in that  those

who do not have the drive or ability to engage in the digital

world  to  participate  in  the knowledge-based  economy  may

become the new poor.  That is why I hope that more funds  can

be  allocated to the Ministries dealing with the  quality  of

life,  so  that they will take special pains to  target  this

group of the potentially disconnected, and provide them  with

the  means to at least understand better the demands  of  the

Internet age as well as its benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving more directly to the knowledge-based economy

and  to  the  tax changes to encourage innovation, creativity

and  enterprise, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

changes to the tax system are sufficient to stimulate the  e-commerce  sector, amongst other things.  One   of  the  major

changes  which  he  mentioned, for example,  relates  to  the

income  tax  concession for royalty payments.  The  exemption

from tax of 90% of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>

gross  royalties  received, of course, is a very  significant

concession.   It  applies to authors and  composers  who  get

royalties  from  publishers, but now  extended  to  royalties

received   from  recording,  film  or  drama   companies   in

Singapore.   As  for  inventors and  innovators,  the  income

derived  from approved inventions, etc, would now be extended

to  non-manufacturing sectors and to foreigners.  Being taxed

at  only  10% of gross royalties is indeed a most stimulating

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have one problem relating to product

innovation.   As  defined, it does  not  include  a  computer

program,  unless  it  is  in the nature  of  a  new  computer

operating system, or new language used in a computer program.

Sir,  I find this limitation to section 10(10) of the current

Income  Tax Act far too restrictive.  It means, for  example,

that  Bill Gates with his Windows 2000 or Linus Torvalds with

his  rival operating system, Linux, could profit from such  a

provision,  but  no  one  else in  the  software  programming

sector,  not the ones who write programs to improve  security

for  e-commerce transactions, not the ones who write programs

for  search engines to improve speed, not the ones who  write

new browsers, not the ones who write anti-virus programs.  My

question is: why not?  For e-commerce to flourish, one should

not  only  be  thinking of companies such as Amazon.com,  but

about the many shareware writers, for example, who contribute

to the vibrancy of the Internet, and provide the interest for

many  of  us  to see what programs these creative individuals

can  come  up  with.   Anyone going to Downlot.com  can  only

marvel at the true technopreneurs in action through a host of

shareware  packages  available.  I hope that  there  will  be

similar  tax  concessions  made in the  software  programming

industry  and  those who are about to embark on  their  first

entrepreneurial project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget this year seems to have attracted some

good comments but also some disappointments, but then that is

to  be  expected.  Even on items such as the  5%  rebate  for

individuals, some have commented that with the alphabet, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>

"u" comes before the "v", ie, the u-turn, in terms of cutting

the  rebate  by  5%, comes before the full  recovery  of  the

economy.   This can be hard on those who are just within  the

tax  net,  who  might have had to borrow  during  the  crisis

years.   I hope the Minster would take into account the  fact

that  recovery for individuals may not have been as quick  or

as fast as the general economy on the whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that comment, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the  motion  in the name  of  the  Minister  for

Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost 40 Members who spoke before me have given

many  suggestions and requests to the Finance Minister.  Some

focused  on  the  need for more support for  families,   some

asked  for more support for workers, and not a few for firms.

Indeed, our economy has recovered in an uneven way that while

some  firms are doing well, some others are still struggling.

While fewer workers were retrenched last year compared to the

number  in 1998, there are still many areas where we need  to

improve  support for our workers in facing the challenges  of

the knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Budget presented by the Finance Minister

attempts  to  respond  to  a number of  long-term  challenges

facing us:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The problems of an aging population, and aging

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The keener competition for investments, jobs and markets

in the face of a globalised economic system; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The speedier changes of technology and the effects on

our economy and our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Budget is a prudent and farsighted one. It

is  not  a Budget to encourage entrepreneurship with  one-off

measures  in  order  to develop a stronger domestic  economy.

Neither is it one to just to give away goodies after we  have

overcome  the  recession.  No, it is not just  an  e-commerce

budget.  Thankfully, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>

budgets  presented  in  this  House  have  been  consistently

addressing  long-term issues.  There have  been  measures  to

build   and  strengthen  our  small  State  with  no  natural

resources to rely on.  Yes, our costs of doing business  must

remain  competitive and we must have the skilled manpower  to

operate  world-class infrastructure and man  our  industries.

But,  more importantly, and here I agree wholeheartedly  with

Dr  Richard  Hu,  that  we  have  to  use  our  resources  in

preserving our social cohesion so that we can overcome future

crises and make our economy more prosperous for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by stating the concern that I have over the

challenges to the cohesion among the races in Singapore.   We

have a nation state that is multi-racial and because of this,

it  is  delicately balanced; a society existing in peace  and

harmony  because all the races recognise the stakes  and  the

risks  involved  if we cannot co-exist, live  together,  work

together and play together.  Occasionally, we find the  lines

distinguishing the differences between the races  drawn  more

clearly, lines that we ourselves have blurred through pulling

together  through  hard  times and celebrating  through  good

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be on guard against actions and even policies

that  could cause frictions among the races.  However,  there

are  also forces outside our jurisdiction that, with  perhaps

malice  or with ill conceived ideas, may have caused problems

within  our own society.  When a term like "Malay Malaysians"

is   used  in  expressing  unhappiness  with  Singapore,  for

example,  as  has happened in recent times, it  automatically

infers a reference to Chinese Singaporeans.  Immediately,  we

have the racial lines drawn and, immediately, it is no longer

a  relationship  between  Malaysians  and  Singaporeans,  but

between Malays and Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reason behind it, it is not the main factor

why  I  have brought up this issue.  I am concerned  with  my

multi-racial country and would not like to see a dent in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>

our  cohesion  as a result of external factors.   What  I  am

trying  to  drive at is that we have to be on  guard  against

events, developments, statements, from external sources  that

could affect our multi-racial cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But social cohesion is not just about race relations.

It  is  also  about  the  bond between  the  people  and  the

Government,  and a good Government at that.  As  demonstrated

during  the two economic recessions that we have experienced,

people  unite when they face common challenges, have a common

goal, and a common hope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from facing the social and political upheaval seen

in neighbouring countries during the  economic turmoil in the

region,  Singaporeans rallied behind the Government and  were

willing to chip in to hold costs down and by agreeing to wage

cuts.  They bear the fruits of their sacrifices now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we all have heard, the problems are far from

over.   As the economy develops into one that is based mainly

on  knowledge  and higher skills, a section of our  workforce

may  be  in danger of being dislocated.  These are the almost

850,000  older workers who are in their 40s and  who  do  not

have  secondary and higher education.  These are the  workers

who  will  be  vulnerable  to technological  changes  at  the

company  level  and structural changes in the  economy.   The

programmes of skills training, which among others include the

Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  coordinated  by  NTUC,  are

implemented to help older workers acquire new skills so  that

they remain employable and able to secure jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed very difficult to guarantee jobs for

workers.  But it would also not be acceptable if our  workers

still  find much difficulties in getting suitable  jobs  even

after completing skills upgrading courses.  I am afraid  this

is  happening and we should be addressing this problem.   The

feedback we have been getting from some of these workers  who

have  lost their jobs is that employers still prefer  younger

workers  and discriminate against the older ones.   This  may

not be seen as a big problem now as we see more jobs being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>

created and more people are able to hold full-time jobs.  But

if we want to maintain social cohesion at this level, between

the  people  and  the  Government, we  have  to  ensure  that

discrimination  on  the count of age or  any  other  form  of

discrimination at workplaces does not exist.   If  necessary,

we  should look at the possibility of amending the guidelines

on  the  employment of foreign workers vis-a-vis older  local

workers.   I  am  raising this issue as it is  foreseen  that

subsequent batches of retrenched workers who take  up  skills

training are likely to be older and probably would have  more

problems  getting  full-time jobs.  And  I  am  raising  this

because  having jobs is the first line of our  social  safety

net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy becomes even more knowledge-based and

companies want to be more nimble and competitive, it is  also

possible that more workers will be involved in part-time  and

contract work.  Most employers engaging such workers  now  do

not  contribute to their workers' CPF accounts.  I hope  this

can  be  reviewed  so  that our workers'  social  safety  net

coverage would be further enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances change in societies and especially when

the society becomes more sophisticated, through technological

changes and advancement of information technology, we tend to

see  some sections of our society left behind. These  sectors

are  usually those who are less prepared, less adaptable, and

many  times,  less skilled.  In a technologically competitive

economy,  it is mainly our older workers who have  difficulty

in  learning new skills and finding new jobs.  Yet we  cannot

leave  this  group to flounder because they will  become  the

tinderbox that can split our society asunder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways, it is the measure of a developed society

that is able to care for its weaker members.  I hope some  of

the  suggestions offered by Members during these two days  of

debate  can  be taken into consideration by our Minister  for

Finance.

<br>3.16 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is strongly encouraging innovation,

creativity  and enterprise.  Over the last few months,  there

has  been  a  general call for Singaporeans to be  less  risk

averse so as to compete in the big league in this globalising

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore no surprise that for this year's budget,

Finance Minister Richard Hu reiterated the Government's clear

intention   of   pursuing  this  change  of  attitude   among

Singaporeans  and  announced specific measures  to  encourage

potential entrepreneurs to hazard more risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are seriously considering venturing into the new e-businesses, principally because of the huge financial rewards

that  await  those  who succeed.  Stories about  millionaires

being  made  every day in Silicon Valley stir our imagination

and  fuel  our  dreams  of creating  the  same  wealth.  With

technology convergence and emergence of a new economy,  there

is  now a better chance of making it big than ever before  in

our history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is required to succeed in the new economy? As

reflected in the front page of the Straits Times today,  many

Members  of this House who spoke before me have asked whether

we  are ready for the new economy.  Sir, at this juncture  of

the  debate,  I would like to touch on the related  issue  of

whether  we,  both  as  a  society and  as  individuals,  are

prepared for entrepreneurship and its consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the recent success stories we hear come from the

United  States.  We cannot deny that our young are very  much

influenced  by  American culture and the  American  style  of

wealth   creation.   Throughout  its  history,  America   has

produced more entrepreneurs than any other society.  This  is

in  part  because no other culture is as dedicated to  making

each   individual's   dream  come  true.   American   culture

encourages  the individual to decide for himself,  chart  his

own  destiny and do his own thing.  It constantly reminds the

individual  to  be  all  he can be  even  to  the  extent  of

rejecting  the  influence of other people  and  opposing  the

external flow of events.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many of us, this idea can be disturbing as it

conjures     images    of    rebellious    anti-establishment

disenfranchised spoilt brats who go around spraying  graffiti

and  vandalising  cars.   That is one  aspect,  the  negative

side.   To  derive  full  benefits from our  entrepreneurship

drive,  we  must manage the negative and tap on the  positive

aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common story line in American movies is about the

individuals  who  cannot quite fit into his  environment,  is

rejected  by his peers but yet comes back to save the  world.

Hence,  in Star Wars Episode I, the individualistic  Obi-Wan-Kenobi goes against the Jedi council to take on Skywalker  as

an  apprentice.   Tom Cruise, the Maverick  in  Top  Gun,  is

defiant  towards authority but comes back to save his  fellow

men.   Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Sylvester Stallone in Rambo,

Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and the list goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are stories of self-determined individuals who

have  the  tenacity to pursue personal dreams  but  who  also

think  of  their fellow men.  Taken together, these are  very

powerful   attributes  of  entrepreneurship.    I   hope   in

parenting, and in our schools, we will not only emphasize the

creative  individual  in  our  young  but  also  the   social

responsibilities that come with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is that for every successful person who

comes  into  the spotlight, there are probably hundreds,   if

not   thousands,  who  did  not  quite  make  it.  For  every

successful  actor  like  Tom Cruise, there  are  hundreds  of

aspiring actors and actresses who sit day in and day  out  in

audition queues and never got selected for a major part.  For

every  great golfer, like Tiger Woods, or tennis  star,  like

Pete  Sampras, there are hundreds of unknowns who grind  away

but never quite make it to the big league.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one strong point of the American system that it

is  able  to  support and sustain a large group  of  aspiring

talents to produce the few truly excellent ones.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small country like Singapore, can we afford

letting  our  scarce human resources choose to do  what  they

want  with the risk that some, if not many, would never quite

make  it?   This would be a major shift from our, I  mean  as

parents, paternalistic approach of directing our children  to

undertake particular fields of study that will stand them  in

good  stead  to be gainfully employed with his or her  skills

used to the fullest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we balance the need to plan, organise and not waste

human  talent, with the need for people to be entrepreneurial

and  hence to choose for themselves?  The danger is that many

may  end up floating around, experimenting and not succeeding

anywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us Asians, the desire to strike it out on our own,

and  be our own bosses, is not new.  And when we fuel it with

words  of  encouragement, financial incentives and especially

the promise of the pot of gold that awaits the successful,  I

am  sure that there would be some who would naively take  the

plunge into the world of technopreneurs even though they  are

ill-equipped and ill-prepared to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee sounded a note of caution at the

recent  NTU forum when he said that one should not go blindly

into  the gold rush of dot.com start-ups.  Risk must go  hand

in  hand with research, with sound thinking.  In other words,

the risk cannot be for risk's sake, but must be calculated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those intending to venture out must consider carefully

their   business  plans,  revenue  models,  and   competitive

advantages in starting their new business in the new economy.

In  this  new and untested world of e-commerce, some ventures

succeed  spectacularly, but many will simply fall  along  the

wayside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we can minimise the waste of human talents not

merely  by  hanging  out  monetary incentives  and  financial

assistance  but,  more importantly, by  proper  guidance  and

assistance.   To develop successful ventures, we  need  sound

innovative ideas, good management, supportive partners, right

timing,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>

and  a certain amount of providence for the many things  that

lie beyond our control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can assist with some of these concerns.

In the world of e-commerce, alliances can be formed to create

a  buzz  among technopreneurs to share their experiences  and

mistakes.   An  Internet association could be  set  up  where

people  can meet and exchange ideas and information.  Through

such a forum, would-be entrepreneurs can find out what is new

in  the market, what has succeeded and what has failed.   For

those who are thinking of taking the plunge, this would be  a

good  place  to  seek  professional advice  and  tap  on  the

finances  of  angels  and  venture capitalists,  and  on  the

experiences of industry gurus.  This can improve the  chances

of success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my fear is that, if left on its own without proper

guidance and assistance, our new economy may go down the same

path as our traditional retail industry.  In the old economy,

I know of some people who left well-paid jobs to start retail

outlets.  It is a business that appears simple enough.   Some

mistakenly thought that all they had to do was to  rent  some

shop  space,  take some goods from the distributors,  display

them on the shelves and hope for the best.  But it is not  so

simple.   Many retailers are hardly able to make  ends  meet.

Others  are  profitable  mainly due to  good  location  which

brings with it good human traffic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, our Ministers have lamented the low

level of productivity in our retail sector.  Likewise, if  we

are  not careful and do not learn from our past mistakes, our

new  economy may be littered with run-of-the-mill  cybershops

floating  on  the  Web suffering from poor Internet  traffic,

where  the  cyber equivalent of a good location is  a  catchy

dot.com name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, even with the best programmes, incentives

and  assistance,  e-commerce and whatever other  enterprises,

always  carry a certain element of risk.  Our Prime  Minister

said at the last

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>

National  Day  Rally  that  we must  "accept  the  inevitable

failures  and  rejoice with winners who collect  the  pot  of

gold".   Both  these  limbs  -  accepting  the  failures  and

rejoicing with the winners - are challenging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first, what does it mean for our technopreneurs

to  accept failure should they choose to take risk  with  the

hope of reaping the potential reward?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope they do not blame the Government for

having  encouraged them to take the risk.  I am  reminded  of

our  drive  some  years ago to go regional  and  develop  our

external  wing.  Many companies heeded the Government's  call

and   expanded  their  businesses  into  countries  like  the

People's  Republic  of China, Vietnam  and  Indonesia.   When

their  investments  did not bear fruit, and  especially  when

things  took a turn for the worse as a result of the economic

crisis,  we heard all sorts of complaints and grumbling  from

business people that the Government was somehow to blame.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, this is not the spirit of a true entrepreneur.

We  have  heard  again  and again the term  "caveat  emptor",

buyers beware, being mentioned in this House.  We must  learn

to  be less reliant on the Government and be more independent

to  watch  out  for ourselves.  I am not saying that  society

should  not  support  those  who  have  failed.   I  am  just

reminding  ourselves  that  we  should  assume  some  healthy

responsibilities  in whatever venture we  embark.   The  true

spirit  of an enterpreneur is to take risks and to bear  them

bravely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Finance Minister Richard Hu said, many talented

people  are  prepared to accept low or even  no  salaries  in

return for equity stakes.  These stakes can be worth a lot of

money  but only if the company is viable, goes for an IPO  or

is  acquired by another company.  What if a risk-taker cannot

support  his family while waiting for his shares to  increase

ten  or  a hundred fold?  What if the company fails  and  his

shares  are  worthless?  In such a situation, we may  end  up

with a group of people who may not have received any income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>

for months or who have lost their life savings and are facing

financial hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, we must support those who do not make it.

Having gone through the last economic crisis, such cases  are

not new to us.  During the crisis, there were some people who

lost  their  jobs and their source of income.  The Government

stepped  in  to help.  The HDB was asked to reschedule  their

housing loan repayments.  The Ministry of Education was asked

to  waive  school fees for their children. We pulled together

as a community to help those who were less fortunate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a difference in that when people lose their

jobs,  we  empathise with them because often it is  something

beyond the worker's control.  On the other hand, for the risk-taker, he is consciously leaving a secure source of income to

take   risks   that  may  pay  off  or  may  not   pay   off.

Nevertheless,  I believe if we are committed  to  encouraging

enterprise  we,  as a society,  should also be  prepared  for

the  consequences  of  failure.  As a  society,  we  must  be

committed to help, nurture, and support these risk-takers  to

sustain them and their families in difficult times.  This  is

the  huge undertaking, the long term benefits of which depend

on the risk-takers themselves.  Why do I say this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question leads to the second limb of what our Prime

Minister  said  at the last National Day Rally.   How  do  we

rejoice  with the winners who collect the pot of  gold?   Or,

put  it  the other way round, for our entrepreneurs who  have

collected their pot of gold, what should their response be?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the support and sustenance that society has given

entrepreneurs to bring about their success, it will  be  very

sad  if, when they have made it, when their company is listed

on  SGX  or NASDAQ, and they are worth a few hundred  million

dollars, that they should pack up and leave Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of the great entrepreneurs of the

industrial revolution.  Men like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>

Carnegie,  Mellon, Ford and Rockefeller.  These entrepreneurs

defied   the   values  of  landed  gentility  and   inherited

privilege,  had the courage and the determination  to  strike

out on their own and transformed the world.  These men became

great  through  massive  corporate  acquisitions  and  empire

building, and great again through massive charity.  We should

follow  the  good example set by these great  individuals  of

capitalism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to go back to the

heroes  of American popular culture whom I mentioned  in  the

beginning  of my speech.  Robert Bellah has pointed  out  the

American myth's hero "again and again saves a society he  can

never completely fit into".  The value of American heroes  to

their  society is that they "stand alone, not needing others,

not  depending on their judgment, and not submitting to their

wishes".  But this brand of individualism is not selfishness.

It  is  to be regarded as a kind of heroic selflessness where

one  accepts the necessity of being alone, of being different

from  the  rest and of going against the system in  order  to

serve the values of the community one comes from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us to succeed as a society in the long run and to

make  sense of all these incentives and assistance  given  by

the  Government, entrepreneurs who made it must feel the need

to,  and  do  in  fact, return something  to  the  community.

Whether   by   serving  the  community,   by   creating   job

opportunities  for  other  Singaporeans,  by  giving  to  the

community  and  charities,  or  by  keeping  some  of   their

businesses in Singapore and paying their taxes, I  hope  they

will continue to contribute in some significant way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

thank  you  for  allowing me to join in the  debate  at  this

juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like many of my colleagues before me, I would like

to  focus  on the Internet only because of the importance  of

the Internet in our lives today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister in his Budget Statement touched on

the significant way in which the Internet has transformed the

global  economy and the nature of the competition in the  new

millennium.  I cannot agree more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are seeing in the world today is a radical and

fundamental  shift  in  the  economic  underpinnings  of  our

society.    Mankind   has  moved  from  its   hunter-gatherer

beginnings to the industrial revolution of the 17th  century,

and  now  for the third time, into the new era of information

technology.  Some analysts call this the "Third Wave".   This

shift  is  most evident in advanced economies where over  the

last   quarter  of  the  century,  services  have   displaced

manufacturing  as the basis of generating  wealth.   What  it

means, Sir, is that instead of working in a factory on a line

production, the new age worker will find himself in a service-oriented line, such as process control, software writing,  or

financial services.  Increasingly, instead of relying on pure

sweat and physical labour, man is turning to mental endeavour

as  a means of sustenance.  Production of goods and services,

therefore,  tends  towards  greater  use  of  automation  and

information technology.  In many ways, one sees this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>

as  a  manifestation of the knowledge-based economy  that  we

spoke about not too long ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shift in the post-industrial society to a computer-driven knowledge-based economy has significant implications

for  us.   At one level, the force of the Internet  has  made

territorial   boundaries  and  local   jurisdictions   almost

meaningless statements in a way.  The ability of the Internet

to  penetrate  and reach, with little or no  difficulty,  any

connected  home  or  office located  anywhere  in  the  world

suggests that any legislation to control or regulate its  use

is  at  best  a  token statement of acceptable conduct.   As,

indeed,  while  we have laws on pornography,  the  ease  with

which any child can have access to such materials on the  Net

is  often  seen as a mockery of what we try to  do.   In  the

cyberspace,  space and time no longer present  themselves  as

barriers  to  communication.  As a result, the intensity  and

frequency  with  which  people are engaged  in  communicating

among themselves give rise to a sense of community founded on

a  global  dimension.  Sir, we have become a global community

characterised by a free flow of information and  exchange  of

ideas.   Out of this exchange, e-commerce emerged.   A  whole

new  dimension and manner of doing business now exists, which

was  never  before  possible.  Suddenly,  the  market  became

larger  and the competition keener.  The Internet has brought

about a greater flow of information, goods and capital across

boundaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a society that is organised around information

technology places greater emphasis on the values of  equality

and  freedom.   At the workplace, a whole new office  culture

has evolved.  People go to work in casual clothes, sport pony

tails,  call each other on a first name basis and also relate

to  each other more casually.  On the Internet, the fact that

one  is  able  to  assume a different  identity  through  the

faceless   e-mail  addresses  means  a  greater  freedom   of

expression.  It is no surprise, therefore, that some  of  the

most  heated and candid expressions take place in cyberspace.

This is a virtue that Net surfers value on the Internet.  Any

attempt

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>

to  regulate the conduct of these chat rooms or even seek  to

pry  behind  the veneer of anonymity will be met with  almost

complete resentment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the Internet is borderless, we are faced

with  the  issue of whether as a country we should go  beyond

our   territorial  boundaries  to  regulate   the   flow   of

information   coming  into  Singapore.   The   challenge   is

pressing,  indeed, if there are bigots out there sending  all

manner of misinformation which is calculated to undermine the

racial and political harmony which exists in our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the age of the Internet, we are confronted, at

another  level,  with  a global economy  that  has  radically

increased  the intensity of competition.  With the free  flow

of  goods and services and even capital, no business  in  any

part  of  the world, whether or not that business enjoys  any

state  given  monopoly rights, can be shielded  from  intense

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent publication of the Economist, it was

reported  that what is truly revolutionary about the Internet

is  its ability to generate different pricing mechanisms and,

in  particular, to allow price and product comparisons to  be

made  and  various  kinds of auctions and exchanges  to  take

place.    The   Internet  provides  a  perfect   medium   for

aggregating buyers and sellers from all over the  world,  and

also  offers  an  excellent  way  of  comparing  prices   and

collecting  information.   Up until  the  revolution  of  the

Internet,  the  process  of  aggregating  product  and  price

information would have been a rather tedious affair indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the technology in this area is moving fast. At the

moment,  there  exists  in  the market  software  that  would

automatically inform the surfer of the best prices  that  are

available elsewhere.  For instance, with the software, if you

are  about to buy a book from Amazon.com, a box would pop  up

in  your  computer  which tells you that  you  could  get  it

cheaper elsewhere.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition that commercial firms face from Internet

would  mean  that adaptation and change in the way  in  which

businesses are carried out must take place if such firms  are

to  stay  relevant or, as some would put it, e-relevant,  and

perhaps even to survive.  One immediate example would be  the

travel  agents.  Traditionally, to book a holiday, one  would

go  down to the travel agent's office to sort out the airline

ticketing, hotel accommodation, tours, and so on.  The travel

agent  gets a middleman commission and that is the nature  of

his business.  Today, it would be possible to do all of these

things  through  the Internet without having  to  go  to  the

travel agent.  Does it mean that the travel agent will go the

way  of  the  dodo bird?  Not necessarily.  If travel  agents

could,  and  for many they have, get around the  business  of

adding  a  dotcom capability to their businesses, they  could

well  stay  relevant  and  even profitable  for  the  future.

Increasingly,  the line taken by many management  consultants

is  that  big  businesses  that  fail  to  grapple  with  the

consequences of e-commerce are putting their company at risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the flip side, e-commerce on the Internet has

tremendous  opportunities to offer to businesses.   In  1999,

global  e-commerce  was worth a little over  US$150  billion.

Around  80%  of the transactions was carried out between  one

form  of business and another.  Indeed, the B2B Web exchanges

are  expanding at a hectic pace.  The Economist reported that

in  America, e-tailing revenues tripled last year; in  Europe

and  Japan,  they  rose even faster.  The  most  obvious  and

immediate   advantage  of  e-commerce   is   that   Singapore

businesses  need  not necessarily confine themselves  to  the

local  market.  With the Internet, the world is their market,

and if astutely thought through, e-commerce as an alternative

business model can radically expand their business horizon in

more ways than they can imagine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to give an example. I recently had a

conversation with an economist in a research and  information

agency.   This is a local firm that provides information  and

analysis principally to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>

financial  institutions.  The economist tells me that  he  is

very excited about e-commerce on the Internet.  It gives  him

a far wider audience than what Singapore has to offer.  Quite

naturally, his company has a dotcom spin.  He tells  me  that

if  he can gather 1,000 subscribers on his Web page, he would

break even, and anything beyond that would be pure profit for

him.   When  the  world  is  your market  place,  Sir,  1,000

subscribers seem like an insignificant figure indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yet another level, we must recognise and accept the

way  in  which  the Internet revolution is  likely  to  cause

social  dislocation.   Throughout  history,  any  revolution,

whether it has been brought about by technology or otherwise,

often  results  in  some form of adjustment  and  changes  to

society.  When industrial revolution took place, people moved

in  a  massive  way  from the farming  communities  to  urban

centres  because  of new techniques of industrial  production

that  had  enabled higher output and thus gave the  people  a

better  quality of life.  New jobs were created and old  jobs

were  made  redundant.  Those who could adapt to the  changes

were able to ride on the new wave of revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if we accept that the Internet represents the

"Third  Wave" of change to human kind, we should be  prepared

for  some form of social dislocation within our society.   As

it  stands, information technology allows for a higher  level

of   automation.   Smarter  machines,  such  as  robots,  are

increasingly able to replace human operators in the  area  of

qualitative  decision-making.  Almost every aspect  of  human

endeavour   is  capable  of  being  replicated  by  machines.

Additionally,  as a country, we are faced with  a  population

where  a substantial number of adults above 40 do not possess

educational  qualification  beyond  Primary  Six.   It  would

appear  that  if  there  is  any fundamental  change  to  the

structure  of our economy, which must invariably come  about,

the  people  who are least qualified to handle  such  changes

would  be at a greater risk of losing their jobs.  Some  call

this  structural unemployment, that is, unemployment  brought

about  when the economy restructures itself into a  different

plane of wealth

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>

creation.   How should the Government take care of the  well-being of these employees?  Looking at the phenomenal rate  at

which  e-commerce expanded in recent years, the  prospect  of

massive structural unemployment hitting us in the near future

is real indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Francis Fukuyama in his book, "The Great

Disruption", said that the social order once disrupted  tends

to  get remade again.  He explains that we can expect this to

happen because human beings are essentially social creatures,

whose  most  basic instinct and drives lead  them  to  create

moral  values  or  rules  that bind  themselves  together  in

communities.  Human beings are also rational creatures  whose

rationality would lead them to find ways of cooperating  with

one another spontaneously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social order, as we know it, comes out of a centralised,

rational, bureaucratic hierarchy that is very much associated

with  industrial revolution.  Max Weber, in fact, has  argued

that the rational bureaucracy, with its structured rules  and

hierarchy, is the very essence of the modern life as we  know

it.   However,  with the revolution that  is  brought  on  by

information  technology,  governments  and  authority  should

reconsider the way in which people are organised.  Some  have

argued   quite   forcefully  that  in  the  new   information

technology  age,  it would be difficult for  governments  and

corporations  to  rely  exclusively on  formal,  bureaucratic

rules  to  organise  people over whom  they  have  authority.

Instead,  governments  and corporations  will  well  have  to

decentralise  and devolve power, and to rely  on  the  people

whom  they have nominal authority to be self-organising.   To

be    effective,   self-regulation   must   depend   on   the

internalising rules of conduct which are consistent with what

the  government or corporation is trying to achieve.   It  is

therefore  on  the basis of such internalised informal  norms

that one expects to form the basis of social control for  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such changes of social order requires a paradigm

shift in the minds of the policymakers.  It did not come as a

surprise to some that when SingNet

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>

recently allowed investigations to be carried out on  account

holders  on the question of vulnerability of their  computers

to  hacking,  there was equally an outcry by members  of  the

public that this was an unethical act by the Internet service

provider.   It  was seen by many as an invasion  of  privacy.

Therefore, any attempt to regulate conduct in a formal way is

bound to be met with a fair measure of resistance on the part

of the users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Minister George Yeo was asked in a press

interview  on  his  views  on censorship.   Implicit  in  the

question  was  how  Government was able to reconcile  between

having  laws  that  ban  pornography and  that  which  allows

pornographic materials to be readily available on the Net, as

a  matter of practice.  The Minister's reply, I thought,  was

practical.   If I may paraphrase the Minister,  the  Minister

said  that  essentially it is not possible for us to  monitor

and  enforce  pornographic laws against  every  incidence  of

breach.   What  the Government should do is to  use  laws  to

proscribe  such  action in the hope that  Singaporeans  would

know that such form of conduct is unacceptable and should not

be  encouraged.  Instinctively, it is hoped that Singaporeans

will  not  engage in such forms of conduct because they  know

that it would be most embarrassing for them if they are found

out.   Such  informal norms may be sufficient  to  exert  its

social control on individuals.  In other words, if I read him

correctly,  Minister Yeo is saying that it may be better  for

such  rules to be internalised rather than to seek to enforce

it in a formal way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken the trouble to delve deeply into this

subject  matter as I feel that an event, such as the Internet

explosion,  which  is  going  to  affect  us  in   the   most

significant way should play a major part in setting the  tone

for  our  debate  in  this budget.  If  we  accept  that  the

Internet in general, and e-commerce in particular, are  going

to revolutionise the society in a fundamental way, the way in

which the society thinks and behaves,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>

fundamental  questions  about the way we  organise  ourselves

today and the way we are going to organise ourselves for  the

future should be asked.  These questions may span across  the

entire spectrum of the subject matter of the Government.  For

instance,  what  kind of rules do we want  to  have  and  how

should  these rules be enforced in the information technology

age?   How do we begin to deal with technology whose  process

cannot  be confined effectively within a territorial boundary

and  thus  be  subject to the jurisdiction  of  the  relevant

authority?   Should Singapore actively promote  international

agencies  to  help  regulate and police  the  conduct  of  e-commerce and the Internet?  With the explosion of e-commerce,

how  can  our  Government  play a more  significant  part  in

helping   Internet  start-up  companies  take  on  businesses

elsewhere with a first mover advantage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the American government has in fact given a big

push  to  e-commerce  in two ways.  If I may  just  highlight

them.   Firstly,  the  government permits  the  patenting  of

business processes.  Presently, e-commerce houses in  the  US

with  sound business models can look forward to some form  of

intellectual property protection.  Such means of  protection,

no   doubt,   would  greatly  lend  comfort  to   the   young

technopreneurs   with   bright  ideas.    Unfortunately,   in

Singapore,  we  have  yet to extend our recognition  to  such

processes as they do in the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US government has helped by imposing a

moratorium on new taxes on anything bought over the Internet.

Web purchases are also generally exempt from sales tax.  I am

not sure whether we have made provisions for such exceptions.

Looking  at our Government's Budget Statement, while we  note

the  potential competition that globalisation  of  the  world

economy  is  going to bring upon us, we have yet to  adopt  a

cohesive and consistent approach to deal with the matter in a

more  comprehensive way.  For instance, if we recognise  that

there is a likelihood of a substantial social dislocation  to

arise  from the greater use of e-commerce, should we  not  do

more to ensure that those at greatest risk are given

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>

more  to  prepare  them  for  the  changes  ahead?   Are  the

exhortations of training and retraining of workers sufficient

to   deal  with  these  concerns?   Or  should  we,  as   the

Government,  do more?  Should we, for instance,  allow  older

workers  double deduction of tax relief if they are  able  to

demonstrate they are taking up additional courses to  prepare

them for the new economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some of the broad issues and I hope

that  the  Minister will be able to take up these queries  in

the course of the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I support the financial policy of the

Government for the new financial year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  I am the last speaker on the row and  during  the

break,  quite a number of Members have expressed to  me  what

their expectations of the last speaker are.  I am not able to

fulfill  all  their  expectations, but I  can  fulfill  their

feelings  and  I  will  try to be brief.   I  would  also  be

speaking on the feelings of a class of our population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will start off by first expressing

the   feeling  of  relief  this  budget  has  given  to  most

Singaporeans  in the sense that it has moved  away  from  the

sombre tone of last year's budget, and this year's budget  is

more  optimistic.  We all like optimistic tones.  This relief

is even greater because the economy had performed better than

expected.  Instead of a budget deficit for the last financial

year,  we  saw  a  surplus of $3.2  billion.   Instead  of  a

negative  growth of 1.4%, we saw a positive growth  of  5.4%.

Our neighbours are also doing well.  All these are good news.

There  were external and internal factors for this turnaround

and  the year ahead looks good.  The Government deserves some

credit  for  it,  and I give it to them for the  better  than

expected performance of the economy and for managing to get a

surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the other factors for this

turnaround had been the contributions and sacrifices  of  our

workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>

The  Minister  had  acknowledged this  group  in  his  Budget

speech.   I  thank  him for doing that.  The workers  rallied

behind  the Government's call for austerity.  I am glad  that

the  Government has, in some way, recognised the contribution

of  the  people sector by returning some of the surpluses  to

the  people through $100 million into Medifund, $200  million

into  ElderCare Fund, $385 million into the CPF  accounts  of

workers.    Then   there   were  other   new   measures   for

strengthening  family  cohesion and  for  meeting  retirement

needs.   The $250 into each worker's CPF account  is  a  good

gesture and is much appreciated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I attend international trade union conferences and

meetings, many of my union friends from overseas tell me that

they  actually envy we Singaporeans in the sense that we  can

get  some  money  back  from  our  Government  surpluses   by

crediting  into our CPF accounts and to the Edusave  accounts

of  our children.  In many countries, these are not possible.

The  taxes  that their workers pay from their  hard  work  is

squandered into mega projects which boost egos of politicians

but  are not economically feasible, or to enrich some people,

or it just disappears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we also have to remember that our workers

are  also unique.  I cannot think of any other place  in  the

world  where  workers will agree to a pay cut without  social

unrest.   In November 1998, when the NTUC passed a resolution

supporting wage cut at its Delegates' conference, it was done

without  much debate.  Union leaders had taken the effort  to

explain  the  problem  to  the rank  and  file.   The  ground

understood  the  situation and there  was  some  trust.   Our

workers must probably be the only workforce in the world that

talks about employers' problems and try to help them in  real

ways.  It is reflected in the economic performance.  In 1999,

our unit labour cost went down by 10%, unit business cost  of

manufacturing went down by 12% and productivity rose by 5.8%.

The  action of workers and their unions must have contributed

to the confidence for investors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>

to invest in this country and for the economic turnaround.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when CPF was cut by 10 percentage points and

unions agreed to wage cuts to maintain the competitiveness of

the economy, the Government also gave a package of reliefs to

help  citizens cope with the reduction in income.   When  the

economy suffers, it is the working people that feel the  pain

first.  Any reduction in demand for goods and services  means

a  reduction in overtime pay and reduction less take-home pay

at  the  very  least, and loss of jobs at the other  extreme.

The  restoration of wage cuts has not fully happened  in  the

private  sector,  although the public sector  had  made  full

restoration.  CPF restoration is expected to take some years.

The   National  Wages  Council  has  not  come  out  with   a

recommendation this year.  Workers are patient  to  wait  for

the  better  performance  of the  economy,  as  well  as  for

Singapore's competitive position to improve before going  for

substantive  pay  rises.   The  Minister  should  have   also

exercised  the  same  patience in  maintaining  the  personal

income tax rebate at 10%, and also the rebates on HDB service

and conservancy and rental charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250 into the CPF accounts of every active account

holder  is a good gesture and has my full support.   However,

workers  would have welcomed more assistance in  helping  the

workforce  overcome  the sense of job  insecurity.   Business

Times of 21st January this year, carried a report of a survey

conducted by a firm of head-hunters that, although wages  are

expected  to  go  up, workers are generally unhappy  and  are

working longer hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, labour flexibility has to be balanced

with  job security through increasing employability.  I thank

the Government for the commitment to make manpower training a

key  priority.   I know about the many schemes  about  worker

training, such as SRP.  I know of the $25 million that  would

be spent to make our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>

workers more IT savvy.  I know there are incentives given  to

employers  for  the  training of the  workforce.   Even  when

employers  train,  they  are  for  firm  specific  functional

training.   It is most useful if workers could continue  with

the same employer, or another employer, in the same industry.

For  workers  to  move  on to better  jobs,  they  also  need

developmental training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the lessons of the last recession is that workers

cannot just depend on employers to provide job security.  The

whole employment relationship has changed.  To illustrate  my

point,  I  would like to quote the Business Environment  Risk

Intelligence (BERI) who said in their 1996 Report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general expectation before the 1990s was that hard

work and respect for the company would result in job security

and  progress  within the organisation.   Ratings  are  being

affected  by  a  radical  change  in  this  viewpoint.    Top

executives seem to be communicating the principle  that  'the

company  is  offering no loyalty to employees, and  employees

are foolish to offer it to the company'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can look after the Singapore worker better than

the  worker  himself or herself.  The core workforce  of  our

companies   is   being  reduced  through   out-sourcing   and

restructuring.  And of the non-core workforce, there are  two

types.   One  is highly skilled, mobile and is able  to  look

after  himself.  At the other end, the worker is not  skilled

enough or he is at risk of losing his or her present job, and

if  he loses it, he has difficulty in getting another job and

even if he gets it, the pay may not be as high as his present

job.   By  the  Minister's  own estimate,  they  number  some

834,000,  or 42%, of our workforce.  A good many of  them  do

not  have  CPF  accounts.  As more and more  jobs  are  being

outsourced, more workers are being employed on a contract for

service,  they  are  employed as part-timers  on  fixed  term

contracts  and  other  atypical work  arrangements.   Workers

without  CPF  accounts do not benefit from CPF top-ups.   And

most of the time, they are the ones who need them most.   The

Government  should  help  workers to  look  after  themselves

better  and give support to the unions to help these workers.

On a previous occasion, I had asked the Minister for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>

Manpower   to   include   workers  in   atypical   employment

relationship under the definition of "workman" in  the  Trade

Unions Act.  And in this way, trade unions can also represent

this group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a Chinese saying about giving

a  man a fish or teaching him to catch fish.  Similarly,  the

advantages of having skills are overwhelming.  It  is  better

than  charity.  Our workers do not want charity.   They  want

dignity and self pride that comes from having a stable,  good

paying  job.  The State will have to step in where  employers

will  not  do enough.  The arguments for giving all  citizens

part of the budget surplus to educate and train are many.  My

union  colleagues had suggested a "Skillsave" account  to  be

part of CPF to be used for training as the worker finds it in

his  or her best interest.  It would have been an appropriate

gesture  of  recognition  if  the  Government  accepted  this

suggestion  and  transferred some of these  budget  surpluses

into  this  account.   I  strongly  urge  the  Government  to

consider  this  proposal seriously.  It will  not  cost  very

much.   Giving every worker $500 for training will only  cost

the  Government  less  than  $800 million,  compared  to  the

billions in our surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's greatest asset is our people.

Developing  human capital had given us the competitive  edge.

I  fully  support  what  has been done  in  the  schools  and

tertiary  institutions. I recognise that a lot is being  done

for  those in employment and out of a job.  Many workers  are

anxious   and   very  concerned  with  the   new   employment

relationship and uncertainties it carries with it.   We  have

to  help them.  Even more can be done for the people who have

contributed to Singapore's success -   the workers and  their

families.

<br>4.32 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,

first,  let  me thank all the Members of the House  who  have

spoken on the Budget yesterday and today.  But in view of the

time constraint, I can only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>

focus  on major issues raised and leave matters of detail  to

the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on tax cuts. Members such as Mr Ang Mong Seng,

Mr  Heng Chiang Meng, Mdm Claire Chiang, Mr Kenneth Chen  and

Mr Chiam See Tong have commented that the Government had been

too  quick  to  scale  down the tax  cuts  given  during  the

economic  crisis.  There  is  disappointment  that  the   10%

corporate  tax  rebate  will be discontinued,  and  that  the

personal   tax  rebate  and  the  property  tax  rebate   for

commercial and industrial properties are cut back from 10% to

5% and from 55% to 25% respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I presented the FY99 Budget last year, the

outlook  for our economy was very uncertain, with GDP  growth

for  the  year  1999 forecasted at between -1  and  1%.   The

Government  had  taken decisive actions  in  introducing  the

$10.5  billion cost-cutting package in November, following  a

$2  billion  off-Budget package in June 1998.  We would  have

been  prepared to do more if this was necessary.   As  events

turned   out,   the   timely   restoration   of   our   cost-competitiveness   had  kept  businesses  intact,   while   an

improvement in external demand paved the way for  a  recovery

which  gained momentum and became broad-based in  the  second

half   of  1999.   Most  sectors,  barring  construction   in

particular,  are out of the woods.  Retrenchments  have  gone

down  drastically.  In 1998, 29,100 workers were  retrenched.

This  year,  this  fell sharply by 50% to  14,600  retrenched

workers  in 1999.  Based on CPF records, the average  monthly

earnings  of  the  workforce in fact grew by  2.7%  in  1999,

reflecting higher wage adjustments and overtime payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recession largely behind us, we have to focus

our attention to repositioning our economy in response to the

challenges of globalisation and technology, while easing  our

way  out  of the special cost-cutting measures. We  must  not

forget  that  the  cost-cutting packages  were  meant  to  be

temporary measures to help companies and individuals during

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>

the economic crisis.  They were not meant to be the norm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax measures should not be seen in isolation. We

have   not   totally  withdrawn  the  cost-cutting   package.

Reductions  in  foreign worker levy have been left  unchanged

for  another year, to the year 2000.  Jurong Town Corporation

and HDB will also maintain the rental concessions for another

year  to  the end of this year.  The property tax concession,

which  was  already extended for one year earlier,  continues

for  another year, though at a lower rate of 25%  instead  of

55%.  Even at 25%, the rebate is still significant, amounting

to  an effective cut in the property tax rate by 3 percentage

points.   The  GST offset for individuals and utilities  rate

revision  offset  for  households  continue.  We  will   also

continue with the assistance schemes under the HDB as well as

the  CPF  bridging  loan scheme and the use  of  CPF  Special

Account  to  help  home  buyers meet shortfalls  in  mortgage

repayments caused by the CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% corporate tax rebate was meant to help companies

during  the  crisis. There is no need to carry on  with  this

crisis  measure.  However, we should position  ourselves  for

strategic international competitiveness in tax. The corporate

tax  cut of 0.5% is a cautious next move to maintain this tax

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% personal income tax rebate last year was given

as   a  measure  of  relief.  The  pressure  for  relief  has

diminished.  The 5% personal tax rebate this year takes  into

account  the  modest FY2000  budget surplus of $2.5  billion,

which  is significantly less than the budget surpluses before

the economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that the Government fully recognises that

our  workers had lived with the difficult years of  1998  and

1999,  when some were retrenched and all have to take  a  CPF

cut  under  the  cost-cutting package.  We  are  particularly

grateful  to  the  trade  unions  for  their  solidarity  and

supporting the CPF tax cut.  The Special CPF top-up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>

announced  in the Budget does not make up for all  that  they

had  forgone  in  CPF  contributions, but  is  a  gesture  of

appreciation and recognition. This top-up will amount to $385

million.  The  unexpected FY99 budget  surplus  has  made  it

possible  for  the  Government  to  make  this  top-up.   The

Government will also make transfers of $100 million and  $200

million into the Medifund and the ElderCare fund respectively

to  help  the poor and the aged with their medical  expenses.

After  taking  into account the top-up and the transfer,  the

FY1999 budget surplus is expected to be $2.5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the economy recovers, we should revert to a

prudent  fiscal  stance. The Asian crisis has  taught  us  an

important lesson.  Other countries can turn to their  assured

large domestic economic hinterland and natural resources  for

livelihood  in  times of hardship.  Singapore  only  has  its

financial reserves to fall back upon. We need to build up our

financial  reserves when we can, to make sure that when  hard

times  hit,  we  have the wherewithal to deal  with  and  get

ourselves out of the economic crisis quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to address the other major issues

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong claimed that the budget surplus was

not  based  on  the total revenue received by Government  and

that the budget balance should include investment income  and

proceeds  from  land sales.   Our budget  surplus  is  indeed

defined  as  operating  revenue  made  up  of  operating  and

development expenditure and excludes specifically  investment

income  and  proceeds from land sales. The budget surplus  is

defined in this manner to ensure that Government lives within

its means and does not live off the past.  Trying to live off

investment  income and proceeds on land sales is both  unwise

and  unsustainable. We have a limited amount of land in  land

scarce  Singapore and investment income is needed to preserve

the  real value of our reserves.  Using up all the investment

income  will, over time, result in a diminution of the  value

of our reserves.  Reliance on land sales as a source of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>

current  revenue  is  a  two-edged  sword,  as  Hong   Kong's

experience  has  shown.   To  ensure  the  sustainability  of

Government's budget, Government's expenditure each year  must

be  supported  by  the operating revenue  collected,  barring

recessionary  conditions.  No amount  of  reserves  would  be

enough to sustain a Government that perpetually lives off the

past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Iswaran, Mr

Noris  Ong and Mr Tay Beng Chuan had all asked why Government

ended  with  a budget surplus in FY99.  The FY99  Budget  was

originally  planned  based  on  the  circumstances   at   the

beginning of 1999.  As I said earlier, the outlook  then  was

quite  pessimistic. The Government projected 1999 growth  was

within  the  range  of  -1 to 1% and we  were  not  alone  in

expecting  a  weak  growth at that time.   The  Asia  Pacific

Consensus  Forecast,  which polls GDP forecast  from  various

private sector sources, had in January 1999 forecast a growth

of  -0.8% for Singapore for the year.  Could we or should  we

have  foreseen  that the economy would register  a  steep  V-shaped  recovery  by the second quarter of 1999?  The  simple

answer  has  to  be  no, and neither did  anybody  else.   If

Members   believe  that  they  have  a  magic   formula   for

forecasting economic recoveries, I hope that they will  share

with us.

Sir,  the  Government  did not set out to  achieve  a  budget

surplus and was prepared to spend much more when necessary to

stimulate   the  economy.   As  I  have  said  earlier,   the

Government introduced two off-Budget support packages in June

and  in  November 1998 as our economy slipped into recession.

The cost of the $2 billion package in June was entirely borne

by  the  Government,  while  the  $10.5  billion  package  in

November  contained substantial cuts in Government taxes  and

levies.    At  the  same  time,  a  contingency  package   of

additional  public  sector expenditure was  put  together  to

provide support for the economy if conditions worsened in the

course  of  1999, and additional jobs had to  be  created  to

provide  employment  for retrenched  workers.   It  was  this

combination of an anticipated low revenue collection in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>

low-growth  economy, coupled with substantial  tax  and  levy

cuts  and increased provisions for contingency spending which

led to the forecast of a budget deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it turned out, our economy grew by a

respectable  5.4%  in  1999  due  to  the  upturn  in  global

electronics  demand and the strong rebound  of  the  regional

economies.   This  was an increase of more  than  5%  in  GDP

growth over our FY99 Budget forecast.  Our operating revenue,

which  is  strongly  correlated to  the  performance  of  the

economy,  turned  out to be much higher  than  we  originally

expected.  This,  coupled with the lower  tender  prices  for

major  development projects and the non-acceleration of  some

lower priority projects, led to the large swing in the budget

position.  No magic is involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget surplus outcome was something we could

not  have foreseen, but neither is it something that we  need

to be ashamed of. The budget surplus is a happy outcome as it

is the result of the strong and speedy V-shaped recovery from

the  crisis.  There was no reason for the Government to spend

frivolously  just to avoid showing this surplus.  This  would

not be in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Government expenditure on Defence, Education and

Training,  Mr  J B Jeyaretnam said that we are spending  more

and  more  on  Defence. As I have explained to Mr  Jeyaretnam

last  year, as Singapore's GDP increases over the  years,  in

absolute  dollars,  we  would then  spend  more  on  national

defence  naturally. The safety of our people and all that  we

have worked for and saved all these years will be at stake if

we do not maintain a strong military defence capability.

Mr  Jeyaretnam  also accused the Government of only  training

the  workers  when  they are old, instead of  when  they  are

young.   In  FY2000, our Budget for the Ministry of Education

and  the  Ministry of Manpower will increase by 70%  and  68%

respectively.  And this is not lip service.  This  Government

has recognised right from the beginning the importance of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>

investing   in   our  children.  We  have   been   advocating

meritocracy from the very beginning since our independence so

that  no child will be deprived of the opportunity to  go  to

school and to develop to his or her very best potential  just

because  they come from poor families.  We have long  sounded

the  clarion  call for our workers to train and retrain,  and

put in place a full range of supporting schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Tay Beng Chuan

have  urged that Government should bring forward construction

projects  to  support the growth of the economy.   Government

had,  at  the  beginning of FY99, set  aside  funds  for  new

projects  that  may be needed to help stimulate  the  economy

during  the  course  of  the  year.   Such  projects  involve

building  infrastructure earlier than they are needed.   They

would  not  have  been considered under normal circumstances.

However, once it became clear in the course of 1999 that  the

economy  was  recovering strongly, it did not make  sense  to

implement  these projects, as doing so will only incur  costs

for  a  marginal  gain in the face of an  economy  which  was

already  turning around.  Members of this House may  wish  to

note  that for our economy, external demand makes up  75%  of

total demand.  So, stimulating the domestic economy has quite

a small effect on our GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen again and Mr Lew Syn Pau have commented

that  the $979 million set aside for new projects in FY  2000

was  unusual.   I  can  assure them  that  there  is  nothing

"unusual"  about a provision for new projects.  There  was  a

similar provision of about $1 billion in the FY99 budget.   I

should  explain what is meant by new projects.  New  projects

are  projects that are already on the drawing board, and  for

which  some details have been drawn up.  However,  they  have

not  yet been approved by the Development Planning  Committee

and are thus classified as new projects.  When these projects

are approved and initiated in the course of the year, funding

has to be provided for them.  Viewed in this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>

perspective, the amount set aside for these new programmes is

not  large,  as  it constitutes less than  8%  of  the  total

development budget for the fiscal year.



<br><br><i>Restoration of CPF cut and the special CPF top-up</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has argued that the Government was

benefiting at the expense of workers with their CPF cut,  and

hence  Government policy had resulted in a win-win  situation

for  the Government and a lose-lose situation for the people.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Low Thia Khiang has got the cause

and effect all mixed up.  The CPF rate was reduced during the

crisis   to   lower   our   business   costs,   improve   our

competitiveness and help to save jobs.  That was its  primary

objective.   Every company that decides to  relocate  out  of

Singapore  because other countries in the region have  become

significantly   cheaper  due  to  the  weakening   of   their

currencies  relative  to  the  Singapore  dollar  during  the

economic crisis, would represent a permanent loss of jobs for

Singapore.  The CPF cut was the single most important measure

necessary  to improve our cost competitiveness and to  retain

jobs.   Without the CPF cut, more workers would have suffered

as  companies  retrenched or closed down.  The  cost  cutting

package  played a critical role in helping to get us  out  of

the  crisis quickly.  The higher tax collection is the direct

result of the strong economic rebound and the timely measures

taken  by  the Government.  The higher income tax  collection

could  only come from higher profits and wages, generated  by

our  people  having  real  jobs,  producing  real  goods  and

services which the world finds worth buying.  It is therefore

contorted and invidious logic to suggest that the CPF cut  is

an  exercise aimed at transferring monies from the people  to

the Government's pocket.  Ultimately, we should remember that

the  accumulated reserves belong to the people  of  Singapore

and not to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng, Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Chiam See Tong

have  urged that the CPF rate cut should be restored  faster.

The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>

10%  CPF  cut, which took effect from 1st January  1999,  was

originally planned to stay for two years.  This period  would

allow  the  economy to regain its cost competitiveness.  Once

the  economy  had  recovered, the cut will  be  progressively

reduced.  Given the faster than expected rebound, restoration

of  the CPF cut was brought forward to April 2000, instead of

after two years.  However, in order not to prematurely derail

our  business competitiveness and the economic recovery,  the

pace  and quantum of the restoration have to be gradual.   It

took us five years and four months to restore the CPF cut  in

the  1985 recession, with the first step taken only after  28

months.   We  are now taking our first step this  time  after

just 15 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Peh Chin Hua have asked why the CPF

top-up  could not have been made bigger.  I should point  out

that  the  special  CPF  top-up is  not  meant  to  fully  or

significantly compensate for the CPF cut, as doing  so  would

defeat  the purpose of the cut in the first place.   Instead,

it  is  given  to recognise the sacrifice of the  workers  in

accepting CPF and wage cuts to help lift the economy  out  of

the recession.  The quantum of the top-up is in line with top-ups given by Government in earlier years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked that retirees and retrenched workers

should  be  given  a  grace period  to  make  their  one  CPF

contribution so as to receive the $250 special CPF top-up.  I

should  point out that the special CPF top-up is targeted  at

those who had been directly affected by the wage and CPF cuts

and  by retrenchments.  It is both reasonable and appropriate

that  the  special  CPF  top-up should  be  extended  to  the

Singaporeans  who  had worked, and therefore  contributed  to

CPF,  any time in the 1998 and 1999 period.  This will  cover

those  who had been retrenched or retired during this period.

Allowing  Singaporeans to top up their CPF accounts in  order

to  qualify for the special CPF top-up will detract from  the

purpose of the exercise.



<br><br><i>Civil service pay</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Low Thia Khiang have expressed

concern over civil service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>

pay.   Mr  Tay asked why, when the CPF cut has not  yet  been

fully  reinstated,  the civil service should  be  reinstating

its full pay cut.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the civil service is only

restoring the pay cut made on 1st January last year, when the

civil  service took the lead in implementing pay  cuts.   The

CPF/pay  cut for civil servants is still in place, just  like

all other Singaporean workers.  I also want to point out that

contrary to what Mr Tay believes, civil service pay  has  not

been  fully  restored.  The cut to the  monthly  salaries  of

civil servants made on 1st January 1999 up to 5% was restored

on  1st January 2000.  The total annual package has yet to be

fully   restored.   This  is  because  the  annual   variable

component (AVC), which was cut from two months to 0.75 months

in  1998,  was  only built up to one month in  1999.   If  we

include  the 0.25 month special bonus that was paid to  civil

servants  last  year, the total annual package (14.25  months

including a one month annual wage supplement, a one month AVC

and  0.25  month special bonus for 1998) is still 0.75  month

less than the 15-month package paid in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to restore civil service pay cuts took into

account the recovery in the economy, the need to attract  and

retain  talent  and  to maintain the high quality  of  public

service  and  Government.  Based on CPF records, the  average

monthly  earnings  of the entire workforce,  including  civil

servants  whose wages fell, grew by 2.7% in 1999,  reflecting

higher  wage adjustments and overtime payments.  In fact,  in

the last quarter of 1999, the average monthly earnings of the

workforce  was 5.9% higher than in the same period  one  year

ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in manpower expenditure for FY2000 appears

large  at 10.8%, because it is compared against a lower  base

of  FY99,  which included the CPF and salary cuts  for  civil

servants and political appointments.  The partial restoration

of  these  cuts  accounted for the bulk of  the  increase  in

manpower expenditure by more than 8 percentage points out  of

the   10.8%  increase.   Discounting  the  restoration,   the

increase in manpower expenditure is only 2%, which is lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>

than  the projected GDP growth.  This is mainly due to normal

salary  increments.  Government is committed to  keeping  the

civil  service lean and trim and, over the years, has  farmed

out   non-essential  services  to  the  private  sector   and

harnessed  IT to bring about added efficiencies.   This  will

continue.



<br><br><i>Corporate tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has asked why was the corporate tax

cut  of  0.5%  not  applied  with effect  from  the  Year  of

Assessment  2000,  rather than from the  Year  of  Assessment

2001.   As  I have explained earlier, the 0.5% corporate  tax

cut  is  not  a replacement for the 10% corporate tax  rebate

granted during the crisis.  The tax cut is intended to ensure

that  our tax rates remain competitive.  A 1/2% tax cut  will

therefore take effect from the next Year of Assessment, which

follows  our normal practice when making adjustments  to  our

tax rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we will be cutting our corporate tax rate

further,  I  had  announced in the FY93  budget  debate  that

Government's  medium term target rate for  corporate  tax  is

25%. We are now very close to this target.  But I cannot  say

how low our corporate tax rates will be in future, as it will

also  depend on what other countries do.  What we do know  is

that  we will have to do whatever is necessary to compete  to

attract  investments  and  talent  to  locate  and  stay   in

Singapore.



<br><br><i>Government's Role in the New Economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have expressed disappointment that the Budget

does not appear to address the transition to the new economy.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think this is a misperception.   While

there  may  not  be  many new initiatives  announced  in  the

Budget,  this is because Government had recognised  the  need

early  and has already launched many initiatives.   We  have,

over  the  past  years, put in place and  are  continuing  to

support   many   programmes  covering  education,   training,

infrastructure and manpower development.  These  include  the

IT Master Plan in the schools,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>

Thinking Schools, Learning Nation Vision, Manpower 21 and the

Technopreneurship 21 initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked how Government intends to

promote growth in the new economy.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  new

economy, as exemplified by the United States, is one in which

productive  investments, deregulation and the  leveraging  of

technology  raises productivity, and allows  higher  economic

growth at low inflation. This is what our Government hopes to

achieve  by  developing Singapore into a globally competitive

knowledge  economy.  To this end, as mentioned in  my  Budget

Statement,  we  will actively pursue the economic  strategies

mapped  out  by  the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness

(CSC).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important key to Singapore's success in the new

economy   is   innovation  and  enterprise,  creativity   and

entrepreneurism. What Government can and should do to promote

innovation   and  enterprise  is  capability-building.   This

explains  our  heavy  investments to educate  and  train  our

children  and workers, and the continuous effort to fine-tune

our  education system and workers' training. This is so  that

they  will have the ability and attitude to constantly  learn

and  adapt in the new economy. We must never forget that  the

majority  of our people will still be employees, and  only  a

minority will strike out on their own as entrepreneurs.  But,

for  Singapore  to prosper, we need every Singaporean  -  not

just entrepreneurs but employees as well - to be enterprising

and innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage entrepreneurship, Government launched the

Technopreneurship 21 or T21 initiative last year. Under  T21,

we  aim  to  create  a  pro-enterprise  environment,  enhance

venture  investment  and financing in  Singapore,  provide  a

conducive environment for talent to congregate, and infuse in

the  population a culture of innovation and enterprise.  Thus

far,  we  have,  among  others,  introduced  a  Technopreneur

Investment  tax  incentive  and  Qualified  Employees   Stock

Options Scheme, allowed technopreneur home offices, set up  a

US$1 billion Technopreneurship Investment Fund (TIF) to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>

draw   more  venture  capital  activities  and  talents  into

Singapore,  and  revised  the  Bankruptcy  law.    NSTB   and

partnering agencies are in the process of working on the next

wave  of  T21 implementation, and a second set of changes  in

rules and regulations will be forthcoming.



<br><br><i>Helping workers adapt to knowledge-based economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, including Dr Tan Boon Wan, Dr Ong Chit Chung,

Mr  Hawazi Daipi, Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Ong Ah Heng,  have

asked  for more measures to help especially the less educated

or older workers cope with the demands of the knowledge-based

economy.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  accords   high

priority and has already put in place many assistance schemes

to  encourage the training and retraining of our workers. For

the  upgrading  of  the  technical  skills  of  workers,  the

Initiative  for New Technology (INTECH) programme  under  the

Economic Development Assistance Scheme (EDAS) has a total  of

$800  million.  As  part of the Manpower 21  initiative,  the

Government   has  also  launched  a  $200  million   Manpower

Development  Assistance  Scheme  (MDAS)  to  promote   skills

upgrading  for the lower-skilled workers. Under the  MDAS,  a

budget  of $110 million is allocated to Workforce Development

Programme,  comprising  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  for

unskilled  and semi-skilled mid-career workers, and Strategic

Manpower Conversion Programme for professionals. A budget  of

$40  million is earmarked for the development of the National

Skills  Recognition System to establish and train workers  in

clear  standards  of  competency.  The  Government  is   also

providing   $50   million  for  MOM   to   develop   learning

infrastructure to assist and facilitate industries  to  build

up their own capabilities to provide training for workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the abundance of schemes to help workers' training

and  retraining, there is no pressing need to give  more  tax

incentives,  such as double tax deduction,  on  training.   A

double  tax  deduction  scheme  will  benefit  primarily  the

profitable and bigger companies, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>

will provide only limited help to the loss-making and smaller

companies. Larger companies, defined as those with more  than

500  employees,  currently spend about  6.3%  of  payroll  on

training, whereas the figure for smaller companies with  less

than  50  employees  is  2.3%. Hence,  the  challenge  is  to

encourage   SMEs  to  intensify  their  workers'   retraining

efforts.  For these companies, tax incentive is not the  most

appropriate remedy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Leong Horn Kee

have  suggested  tax  relief or co-payment  grants  to  every

Singaporean or family to enroll in an IT course or to  buy  a

computer.  The  Government is well  aware  that  as  we  move

towards a knowledge-based economy and an information society,

the  risks of fault-lines developing between the IT-savvy and

the  non-IT  savvy  will increase. It is  important  that  IT

courses and PCs be made accessible to all Singaporeans.  This

is not a problem for the young, who are getting such exposure

and access in schools and tertiary institutions. What we need

is  to  address the needs of those who are not schooling  and

who  have  no access to PCs because they cannot afford  them.

For  these  people, the suggestion of tax  relief  or  a  co-payment scheme will not be the best solution. After all,  65%

of  taxpayers  base  currently do not pay taxes.  A  targeted

effort  will  be  more effective in helping Singaporeans  who

really need such assistance. IDA is setting aside $25 million

over  the  next  3  years to work with self-help  groups  and

grassroots organisations to offer used PCs bundled with  free

Internet  access and basic training to some 30,000 low-income

households.  Free broadband access will be made available  at

community  centres and clubs. Government also  has  in  place

various schemes to provide affordable IT training or to  help

defray part of the cost of IT courses. These include the  ONE

Learning  Place,  the  IT  Coach, the  Critical  IT  Resource

Programme,  the  Skills  Development  Fund  and  the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme.



<br><br><i>Developing SMEs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Kenneth Chen, Mr Gerard Ee and Mr

Noris Ong have asked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>

for  more  assistance, such as tax concessions, for  SMEs  to

participate  in the knowledge-based economy. I  should  point

out there are limitations in using the tax route to help SMEs

develop.   This is because SMEs do not pay much  tax  in  the

first  place.   Based on 1998 tax collection, companies  with

assessed income of $100,000 or below accounted for only  1.7%

of  the  net  corporate  tax  assessed.  The  Government  has

therefore  chosen to assist SMEs comprehensively via  grants,

loans and technical assistance schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board released last year

a  10-year  strategic plan, SME21. Specifically,  SME21  will

groom  innovative  high-growth SMEs so  that,  over  time,  a

steady  stream of SMEs can reach world-class status. The  aim

is  to treble the number of local SMEs with sales turnover of

$10  million  and above, from 2,000 to 6,000  by  year  2010.

Secondly,  SME21  aims  to upgrade the  low-productivity  SME

sectors,  such  as  the  retail and  other  domestic  service

sectors. Thirdly, SME21 aims to create a knowledge-based, pro-enterprise environment. For instance, e-commerce, if embraced

and  harnessed  by SMEs, will open up vast opportunities  and

remove the traditional barriers to SME growth.  The aim is to

quadruple  the  number  of SMEs with e-commerce  transactions

from 8,000 to 32,000 by the year 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are further schemes which can help SMEs enhance

their  competitiveness, the Ministry of Finance will be  open

to  considering  them.  We will continue  to  create  a  pro-business environment for SMEs, and integrate them in  overall

economic development strategies. But, SMEs must want to  help

and upgrade themselves.



<br><br><i>Tax treatment of foreign-sourced income</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has asked for tax incentives to lure back

to  Singapore interest income on the funds parked  abroad  by

high  net  worth Singaporeans. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore,

tax  is  imposed  on a territorial basis. In  practice,  this

means that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>

income  arising from sources within Singapore will be subject

to  tax.  Income arising from sources outside Singapore  will

not  be  taxed  in Singapore, unless it is remitted  back  to

Singapore. In contrast, a number of developed countries apply

the worldwide basis of taxation, taxing both the domestic and

foreign sources of income of its residents as income arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not in favour of exempting or taxing foreign

income  remittance at a lower rate while domestic  income  is

taxed  in  full.  Doing  so will only  create  loopholes  for

residents  to  channel Singapore income offshore  to  low-tax

countries or to tax havens, and to remit it later  at  a  tax

advantage.   Singapore  will risk being  regarded  as  a  tax

haven,  with  the result that our foreign investors  will  be

penalised  with  anti-tax avoidance measures.  In  any  case,

Singapore  enjoys  a  comprehensive  network  of  double  tax

treaties  and also provides generous unilateral  tax  credit.

Coupled  with our low corporate tax rate of 26%,  this  means

that  most  foreign income that had suffered taxes  elsewhere

will  not  have  to  suffer additional tax when  remitted  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also currently already tax incentive schemes

available, such as the Operational Headquarters Incentive and

the Overseas Enterprise Incentive which provide for exemption

for certain types of foreign source income.



<br><br><i>Group relief</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong and Mr Leong Horn Kee have suggested

allowing  group offsetting of losses to help  ease  the  cash

flow  of  companies undertaking new ventures which are  loss-making. There were also suggestions that we allow the  losses

of  foreign subsidiaries to be offset against the profits  of

the parent company in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company sets up a subsidiary as a separate legal

entity to carry out a particular activity because it wants to

limit   its  liabilities  and  exposure  arising  from   that

activity.  Since a subsidiary is a separate entity which  can

sue  or  be  sued  in its own right, there is no  fundamental

reason to treat it differently for tax

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>

purposes.   Thus  it is logically taxed separately  from  its

parent company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing group relief represents a fundamental change to

our  corporate  tax  regime and can have significant  revenue

implications.  If  group  relief  were  allowed,   profitable

companies within a group may end up not having to pay tax  on

their  profits  if losses incurred by other companies  within

the  group were included. This may open up opportunities  for

tax  planning.   It will raise the cost of tax administration

because complex tax rules will need to be drawn up to prevent

abuse,  and  has invariably been the experience of  countries

which allow group relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which Members may not be aware of is that

currently,   we   allow   losses  to   be   carried   forward

indefinitely.  Hence, as long as a company can  turn  around,

the  earlier  losses can be used to offset tax on  the  later

profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign losses incurred by our companies setting

up  operations  abroad, just as their foreign income  is  not

taxed  unless remitted to Singapore, likewise, their  foreign

losses  should  not  be allowed for offset  against  domestic

income. Otherwise, Government will end up subsidising foreign

ventures  from  domestic tax revenue. As  a  concession,  the

Overseas Investment Incentive allows capital losses from  the

sale  of  shares  in,  or liquidation of,  approved  overseas

investments  to  be set off against the company's  Singapore-sourced income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may also wish to note that

generally  for  countries which have group  relief,  overseas

companies in the group are in fact excluded. Losses  incurred

by such companies cannot be consolidated for tax purposes.



<br><br><i>Employee stock options</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, including Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Iswaran, Mr

Ahmad  Magad and Mr Peh Chin Hua, have spoken on facilitating

employee  stock options (ESOPs).  Assoc. Prof. Low Seow  Chay

has  also  said that it is not correct to subject gains  from

ESOP  to  tax. ESOP is a form of remuneration and gains  made

from exercising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>

ESOP are hence a form of employment benefit that ought to  be

liable for tax.  Nonetheless, as I have announced during  the

Budget  Speech, an incentivised tax treatment  of  ESOPs  for

high-tech start-ups will be announced at the end of May  this

year.   The  intention  is  to take  Members'  comments  into

account  in working out the scheme and we will be looking  at

feedback from the industries.



<br><br><i>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members like Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr

Chew Heng Ching, Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Noris Ong for their

various   suggestions  in  relation  to   the   Supplementary

Retirement Scheme (SRS). I mentioned in my Budget Speech that

the  details  of the SRS will take time to work out,  and  we

hope  to  implement the scheme by next year.  There  will  be

extensive  consultation  with  the  private  sector  on   the

implementation details.



<br><br><i>Preparing for Ageing</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay,

Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang,  and Mr Harun  Ghani,  have  spoken  on

preparing for an ageing society.  Government has endorsed  in

principle   the   recommendations  of  the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on  Ageing.   Ministry  of  Finance  is  currently

working with the IMC Secretariat and implementing agencies on

the required budget based on cost effectiveness and financial

sustainability of the recommendations.



<br><br><i>Encouraging Families, Marriage and Procreation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee, Mr Harun Ghani, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm

Claire  Chiang have called on the Government to do  more  for

the  family  and  youths.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Government  views

family  as a crucial institution in our society.  One of  the

five key ideas of the Singapore 21 Vision is "Strong families

- our Foundation and our Future".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help promote and strengthen the family as an

institution,  as well as to fulfill the needs of  the  youths

and the elderly, the Ministry of Community Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>

and  Sports  will get a substantial increase of  38%  in  its

Fiscal  Year  2000  budget.  Despite  this,  Mdm  Chiang  has

commented that Government has not committed enough for  youth

interests  and  dysfunctional families.   These  are  complex

issues  that  have to be addressed through the efforts  of  a

variety of agencies, not all of which fall within the purview

of  MCDS.  The budget for MCDS should therefore not be viewed

in  isolation.  For example, tackling the issues  of  teenage

delinquency is not the responsibility of MCDS alone.  MOE and

MHA  both  have substantial involvement on the preventive  as

well  as  rehabilitative aspects.  Government's  spending  on

social  and community development should be looked  at  as  a

whole.   This  sector  has consistently  been  allocated  the

largest share of the Government's expenditure budget.



<br><br><i>HDB Upgrading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked whether MOF will make available

more money for town councils and CDCs to improve connectivity

within  a  community.  Dr Teo and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have  also

asked  for  more  funds  for the Main and  Interim  Upgrading

Programmes  (MUP  and IUP) this year.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in

Fiscal  Year  2000,  provision for the Community  Improvement

Projects   Committee  to  improve  accessibility   within   a

community  is $45 million, an increase of 25% over FY99.  The

Government has not cut back on the total budget allocated for

the MUP and IUP programmes, and has no intention of doing so.

The  Ministry of National Development has been given a  total

budget  of  $5.5  billion to carry out  the  programmes.   As

construction  costs  have come down significantly,  it  means

that  more can now be undertaken with the same total  budget.

The  question  of how best to structure the budget  allocated

for  the MUP and IUP programmes, and the pace at which  these

programmes are to be carried out is left to MND to decide.



<br><br><i>Improving the Civil Service</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua

have spoken on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>

need to improve our civil service.  This is a fair call.  Our

civil service must continually strive to be among the best in

the  world.   But we must be mindful that Government  is  not

like  businesses and cannot be motivated or driven solely  by

profit  and  loss.   A  lot  of  the  Government's  work   is

monopolistic and is about creating social value, which cannot

be easily measured against commercial benchmarks.  The impact

of what Government does is mostly non-economic in nature.   I

would be most concerned if individual civil servants are paid

according to their financial achievement on their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have adopted the paradigm of requiring the Ministries

to get the most out of their allocated budgets, and to strive

for    organisational   excellence   and   for    sustainable

performance.   From this year, the desired  outcomes  of  the

Ministries are being published in the Budget book.  Over  the

next  couple  of years, various resource management  concepts

and  practices  will be introduced for Ministries  to  better

manage  their  resources to achieve even  greater  value  for

money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for organisational excellence, every Ministry and

department is looking at achieving ISO9000 certification, the

People  Developer  Award  and  the  Singapore  Quality  Class

leading  on, hopefully, to the Singapore Quality  Award.   At

the end of the day, performance of Government is really about

how  well  we are able to achieve the outcomes in areas  like

international competitiveness, universal education,  economic

productivity, high standards of living, political and  social

stability, and national security.  While there are  often  no

direct  measures  for  these, there  are  many  international

rankings, comparisons and assessments made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is right in saying that further

privatisation may be inevitable.  Indeed, Government believes

that  all Government operations that can have bottomline  and

which   provide  services  that  are  measurable   could   be

corporatised, or at least converted to a statutory board.  In

fact,  Government has just last year corporatised the  Public

Works Department.  However, we must recognise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>

that  in  the  end,  there will remain a core  of  Government

relating  to core regulatory functions and policy formulation

which cannot be corporatised.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as my speech demonstrates, we need all

three sectors - the public, private and people sectors  -  to

be vigorous, robust and enterprising for Singapore to survive

and  succeed  in  this  new  age of  global  competition  and

accelerated change.  We must constantly be willing to try out

new  ideas, nimble in exploiting new opportunities and  quick

in  responding to changing demands.  At the same time we must

not  forget certain fundamentals.  We have to live within our

means  -  no  one  owes us our existence or  a  living.   Our

families  are  important and are the backbone of  our  social

fabric.   We must adhere to meritocracy to allow the  talents

of  our  people to be developed and harnessed  the  best  way

possible.  We have to continually look forward and invest  in

our future prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, together, the people and the Government

can  make  tomorrow  a  better one for Singapore  if  we  are

pragmatic  in  our approach and yet bold in our  dreams.   In

this  light,  this  year's Budget after the  economic  crisis

represents  an  important milestone to meet the  demands  and

challenges of the new economy.  It is a budget in transition.

If  we change too slowly, we end up with the world passing us

by.   If we change too fast, we may end up going on the wrong

path.   We need wisdom, courage and a capacity for trial  and

error.   I thank Members for all their contributions in  this

process.  [Applause].

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

seek clarification from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Thank you, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First clarification, Sir. Is it not true that there are

many  workers, especially those who are working in  companies

which have not recovered, who continue to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>

draw  a much lower salary compared to pre-crisis level?   And

yet  is it morally right for the Government to restore  civil

service and Ministers' salary up to that level?  I understand

just  now  that  for the Ministers, it does not  seem  to  be

sufficient.  It is going to increase further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is it not true that while many Singaporeans

suffer,  and some are still suffering because of the economic

downturn,  the Government turns out to be the biggest  winner

in the economic downturn, with its coffers overflowing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification, Sir. The Minister says that the

Budget  was prepared early January 1999, and he did not  know

there  would  be  a  recovery,  and  thereby  there  is  over

provision  on the development expenditure.  I would  like  to

know  when did the Government come to know that it  does  not

need to spend the development expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to know from the Minister whether

he  foresees  any  possible asset inflation as  had  happened

before, just before the financial crisis hit us, and which  I

think  resulted in quite a lot of stress and pressure on  the

cost.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say

that the civil service wages have been fully restored.  I did

point  out  that it was not fully restored.  And I  recognise

that  there  are  sectors  in  the  population  who  must  be

receiving less pay than they had before the recession.   That

is something which is a fact of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was in this whole exercise, the

Government  ended  up  as the biggest  winner.   Who  is  the

Government?  The money in the reserves is yours.  What is the

Government?   The  Government  represents  the  people.   The

Frontbench and the Ministers are just your agents holding the

money safely so that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Distribute the money!

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Distribute the money, that is

quite a different thing altogether.  I think you can do  that

when you take over the Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was on development expenditure. As I

mentioned  in  my response earlier on, a provision  was  made

which  could  be used in case 1999 turned out to  be  a  poor

year.   Maybe  the  year as a whole would be  a  recessionary

year.   So  some of the money was set aside to  be  put  into

civil  works, like they did in Japan, in case you  needed  to

create  jobs  if  the situation got worse.  But  the  economy

recovered from the second quarter onwards.  Second, third and

fourth  quarter growth rates were all very rapid.  It is  the

swing from the first quarter, which was still very weak, to a

rapid improvement in the second, third and fourth quarters  - which  allowed  us  to  see that a  lot  of  the  development

expenditure provisions would not be necessary.  And I did say

that unless they are essential expenditures, we prefer not to

spend them, if you do not need them to create new jobs.   You

will  notice  that in Japan, trillions of Yen have  been  put

into  public  works to no effect in order  to  stimulate  the

economy.  I also mentioned earlier that the structure of  our

economy  is basically export dependent.  Stimulating domestic

economy  through  fiscal pump-priming does not  produce  very

good results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member's question on whether asset inflation

is  a  problem.  It is indeed a problem.  But the high  asset

inflation  has  not taken place here but in other  countries,

although  we  have seen some of it flowing through  into  our

economy.  But I do not think we have reached the point  where

we need to be overly concerned.  My main worry is whether the

US  stock  markets  will continue to hold  for  a  reasonable

length  of  time  and do not retreat to the  point  where  it

affects  US  domestic demand, and therefore  impacts  on  our

exports.   For  the time being, asset inflation is  something

which we keep an eye on.  But I do not think in Singapore, it

has reached a point

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>

where drastic action needs to be taken like, for example,  we

did in 1996.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your

permission  to seek further clarification.  When I questioned

the  deficit budgetary position of the Government at the last

budget debate, I pointed out that we might not end up with  a

deficit  if development expenditure was not that  much.   The

Minister knew then that there was a provision which might  or

might not be needed.  Is it true?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes. When you expect a

recession,  you make a provision to spend money  to  try  and

mitigate the effects of the recession.  This was provided for

in  the  FY1999  budget.  We had quite a large provision  for

additional development expenditure which we thought might  be

needed  in case, instead of a recovery, the economy continued

to  slide  from a low first quarter into the remaining  three

quarters of last year.  But events turned out that we did not

need it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In other words, my suspicion, at

the  last year's Budget debate, that we might not really have

a deficit budget is true.  It is correct.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not know what he means. If

what you say is true is true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year 1st April, 2000 to 31st

March, 2001.
