<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TELEPHONE BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of "ten cents a call" system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether he is aware  of  protests

from  telephone subscribers against the  proposed

"ten-cent-a-call" system, and if he will  give  a

categorical  assurance that the  proposed  system

will not be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been reading press

speculation  to  the  effect that  the  Singapore

Telephone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



Board  would be introducing a "ten cents a  call"

system  for  telephones otherwise  known  as  the

Message rate system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the Addendum to the President's

speech,  operational  surpluses  of  the   S.T.B.

average  only  $12  million a  year  on  existing

rentals.  Not all of the balance of $160  million

for  development can be borrowed, so it  will  be

necessary for the S.T.B, to increase its rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.T.B, has the problem of finding adequate

finance  to  meet its large five-year development

programme for 197l-75 amounting to $212  million.

So  far, the World Bank has agreed to assist with

a loan of $33 million or just over 15 per cent of total development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various alternatives of raising revenue

equitably are under consideration by the SIB.  The

Message rate is one of the methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advanced countries the method of charging is

related  to  frequency of calls  as  well  as  the

length  of each call. It can be made fairer  still

by  charging less for calls during off-peak hours,

as in the case of trunk calls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved that

degree of sophistication in our equipment, nor  do

we  have as yet professional expertise to maintain

such equipment. Within five to 10 years we hope to

achieve  this. Then people will pay in  accordance

with  the  load they put on the telephone network.

This  will  help  to  cut  out  jams  on  Saturday

mornings and race days, besides making the charges

fairer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, it has been decided that the annual

telephone  rentals  of  residential  and  business

Direct  Exchange Lines he increased from  $180  to

$200  and  from  $250  to $300  respectively  with

effect from 1st October, 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  looks like the Message rate system will not be

introduced for some time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few supplementary questions to

ask.  First,  will  the Minister consider  issuing

public  bonds by tile S.T.B, to meet part  of  the

development  cost? Second, will the  Minister  let

the  I-louse know whether tile new rates are final

and   that  there  are  no  grounds  for   further

negotiation, or   will   he   consult   business

organisations   before  finalising   tile   rates?

Lastly, has  his Ministry done any evaluation  on

the new rates and, if so, how do they compare with

the  charges  under  the Message  late  system  as

practised, say, in a country like Malaysia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

attempt   to  reply  to  the  three  supplementary

questions.  First,  whether  there  will  be  more

public telephones to be installed. We already have

no  less than 2,000 public telephones at ten cents

per call, and we have another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



2,000 in hand which will he made available to  the

public  soon, and we intend to increase the  number

of public telephones in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second supplementary question.

whether the increased rentals with effect from 1st

October,  1971 will be final. The answer  is  that

they  are  final  and  there will  be  no  further

negotiation or discussions with interested groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly whether evaluation has been made on the

proposed   increased  rentals  with  effect   from

October  of  this  year, I can say  that  the  new

telephone   rentals,  even  with  the   prevailing

Government  tax  of  15  per  cent, will  compare

favourably  with telephone rentals now charged  in

West  Malaysia.  We have not made any  attempt  to

find  out what goes on in East Malaysia because  a

sea   of   about  800  miles  separates  the   two

countries. So I think we can only talk about  West

Malaysia  where  it is possible  for  us  to  have

subscriber  direct dialling service  available  to

those  in  Singapore. As regards charges  in  West

Malaysia subscribers do pay annual rentals of $204

for  a  residential  telephone  and  $360  for   a

business telephone. They also pay, in addition,  a

surcharge of ten cents a call after the first  one

hundred     calls.    Furthermore,     residential

subscribers are also required to deposit $75 while

the  deposit  required for a  business  subscriber

ranges from $200 to $500.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> I am satisfied with the

answers  to  the  last  two  questions.  Sir,  but

perhaps the Minister has missed my first question.

It  is  whether either his Ministry or the  S.T.B.

will consider issuing public bonds to meet part of

the development cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry if my ears have

failed  to  catch  the  words  "public  bonds".  I

thought I heard "public telephones". Nevertheless.

I  did  say  earlier that various alternatives  of

raising  revenue equitably are under consideration

by  the Singapore Telephone Board. Therefore,  the

issuance of public bonds will be considered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, is the Minister

aware   that   many  telephone  subscribers   are

dissatisfied with the S.T.B, billing system which

has  led  to a temporary disconnection  of  their

lines recently? Also, is the payment of $5.75 for

re-connection justifiable?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister prepared to answer

that  supplementary question which is riot  quite

related to the original question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it does not

appear   to  be  an  extension  of  the  original

question. However considering the fact  that  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan happens to work  in

the  Singapore Telephone Board, he has  therefore

much more inside information than 1 have. To  his

first  supplementary question whether I am  aware

of  any dissatisfaction. I must say that I am not

aware  of that. Now that he has brought it to  my

notice,  I  will  request the management  of  the

S.T.B, to  look  further into  the  question  to

removes the grievances, if any.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

Education   whether  existing  schools   in   the

vicinity of the present Palembang Housing  Estate

will  be demolished as a result of urban renewal.

and  whether there are plans to build new schools

in the area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker.  Sir, my Ministers has not been informed

whether  any school in the vicinity of  Palembang

Road  which  is  in Precinct North  I, has  been

earmarked  for demolition. However, I would  like

to   assure  the  Member  for  Crawford  that  my

Ministry   will  adhere  to  the   principle   of

rebuilding  schools  to  replace  those   to   be

demolished  in areas where the number  of  pupils

does  not  decline as a result of  urban  renewal

projects. The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



Crawford  may like to know also that recently  we

have reserved a site for a primary school in that

locality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, can the

Minister of State for Education assure us that if

the  school to he demolished is an aided  school,

then  an aided school will be rebuilt from  funds

raised from the public? Or will only a Government

school be rebuilt to accommodate the students?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, each case

will  he  considered on its own merits,  even  in

respect  of  aided  schools. It  depends  on  the

demand of that locality.

<div align="center"><b>PROSTITUTES DETAINED AND TRAINED IN WELFARE HOMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj</b> asked the

Minister  for Social Affairs how many prostitutes

were  referred  to and detained in  the  approved

homes  of  the Social Welfare Department  between

1st.  July  1970 and the latest convenient  date:

for  how long are they detained: and what  trades

are they being taught in such homes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Mount Emily Girls'

Home  is tile only Home run by the Social Welfare

Department  for  the reception  and  training  of

juvenile  prostitutes up to the age of 21  years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period from 1st July. 1970 to 30th

June.  1971, a total of 84 girls were rescued  by

the Police during anti-vice raids and referred to

the  Social Welfare Department for inquiry  under

the provisions of Part X of the Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After inquiry 64 of the girls were discharged

for  various reasons and the remaining 20  girls

were committed to the Mount Emily Girls' Home for

protection and rehabilitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, a girl may be detained until she

attains the age of 21 years or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



marries,  whichever is the earlier.  However, the

length   of  detention  depends  largely  on   the

circumstances  of each case. In  the  majority  of

cases,  the  period  of stay in  the  Mount  Emily

Girls' Home is between 1½ and 2½ years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training provided for the girls at the Home

includes  courses in laundry-work, cooking,  cake-making, food-catering, sewing  and  dress-making

hygiene,   civics,   ethics  and   morality.   The

Department  has  also  just  introduced  advanced,

courses  in cooking and dress-making. New  courses

on  ladies' hair-dressing and  beautician  courses

leading  to  the  diploma  level  are  also  being

introduced The sole purpose of these new  advanced

courses is to enable the residents of the Home  to

earn   a  stable  and  decent  living  upon  their

discharge from the Home.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, can the Minister

explain   why  the  64  girls  referred  to   were

discharged?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 64 girls

referred  to  were  discharged for  the  following

reasons:



<br><br>   (1) being  above the age of 21 years, they

are, therefore, not liable for detention;



<br><br>   (2) being  almost 21 years of  age  at  the

time of rescue, their detention in the  Home

would have achieved very little purpose;



<br><br>   (3) being  lawfully  married persons, they  are,

therefore, not liable for detention;



<br><br>   (4) being  Malaysian citizens or  residents.

or   illegal  immigrants  from  Thailand   or

Indonesia:  as far as possible, their  early

repatriation was arranged with  the  help  of

the Immigration Department;



<br><br>   (5) insufficient   or   no   evidence   available

regarding their involvement in immoral

activities.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, call a girl



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



who is detained in the Mount Emily Girls' Home  be

examined  by  a doctor to determine her  state  of

health? Are her parents allowed to visit her?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, this is becoming more

interesting! Immediately after a girl  is  brought

to  the Mount Emily Girls' Home following an anti-vice raid, she is sent to the reception centre  in

the  Home  itself.  She remains there,  away  from

contact  with the other girls in the  Home,  until

she  is  medically cleared of infectious  disease.

Once  cleared, she is either discharged  if  there

are  no grounds for detention, or sent to the main

Home for training and rehabilitation. And during

her  stay  in the Home, every attempt is  made  to

keep  her in frequent contact with members of  her

family.  Weekend visits by members of  the  family

are also allowed in most cases.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj:</b> Sir, if a girl who is

detained  desires  to continue with  her  studies,

will she be given the facilities to do so?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, should a girl during her

stay  in  the  Mount Emily Girls' Home  express  a

desire to continue with her studies, every attempt

is  made  to help her by giving her a transfer  to

the  Mary  mount Vocational Centre where  she  can

resume  her  studies and prepare herself  for  the

School  Certificate. Financial help is also  given

to her if, after obtaining the School Certificate.

she  expresses  a  keen desire to  go  for  higher

studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital, the

care,  which  cannot  be provided  for  at  home.

Children  are  encouraged to have regular  habits

with  regular  exercise, rest  periods  and  meal

times.  Time  for  schoolwork, physiotherapy  and

occupational  therapy has also to be  set  aside.

The  habit of early sleeping hours is encouraged.

In  the  circumstances, it would be difficult  to

achieve  this if parents are allowed to  come  in

outpatient  clinics mentioned by the Minister,  I

suspect  that  at  least  one  of  them  will  be

demolished within the next few years. If so, can

the  Minister consider building a clinic  on  the

centre of this area to cater for the residents of

the housing estate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, am not aware

that one of the clinics will be demolished within

demolished, alternative  arrangements  will,  of

course, be made.

told of the President of Ireland. Eamon de Valera.

that  he  was once arrested in the middle of  what

the authorities considered a subversive speech and

sentenced  to  a  year's  imprisonment.   On   his

release, being  a true Irishman of  American  and

Cuban  extraction, he returned to  the  same  spot

where  he  was arrested and began his speech  with

the   words:   "As  I  was  saying  when   I   was

interrupted...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I can assure you that as a true

Singaporean  of  Malay  extraction.  I  was   not

arrested  and  imprisoned between  4.30  p.m, on

Friday and noon today either for any political or

criminal  offence. [Laughter] Although I  was  at

Changi  during the week-end, it was nowhere  near

what  the  Minister for Home Affairs calls  "Moon

Crescent".  [Laughter] I simply wish to  continue

with the speech I made last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Nixon's move as announced on the 16th

of  July will, I think, lead to the establishment

of  relations  with  the  People's,  Republic  of

China.    This    development   is    historically

inevitable.  The  United  States  can  no  longer

ignore  the  political and  legal  existence,  of

China,  just as China `has to recognise that  she

is  living  in  a big world with two super-powers

and  other  big powers. And although  the  latest

American  move has partly to do with the American

position  in  relation to the war in Vietnam, it

has  in  fact taken place because the policy  the

United  States  formulated for  itself  vis-a-vis

China  22 years ago is becoming less relevant  as

the world has changed much since then. It was the

United  States  which formulated this  policy  of

recognising  the Republic of China  under  Chiang

Kai  Shek  and it is the United States which  now

wants to undo this policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 years ago America was the victor in

the war and she was then the only super-power  in

the world. And she considered the Soviet Union as

her  No.  1  enemy.  The United  States  believed

herself to be lighting the Soviet Union in China.

Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere. But over the years.

the United States has realised, albeit belatedly,

that what, ever policy China is conducting is  on

her own behalf and for her own interest. This has

become  all  the more evident to her since  China

breached  with the Soviet Union, it would  appear

that  the  United  States is  moving  towards  an

accommodation  with  China  as  an   increasingly

strong  independent power, just as she  has  been

seeking accommodation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



with the Soviet Union to reduce conflicts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For China, her policies are also changing. The

United States is no longer regarded as the No.  1

enemy in interstate relations, although what  she

calls  "American  imperialism"  might  still   be

considered  its  ideological adversary.  This  is

indicated clearly in speeches and broadcasts made

by the leaders of the People's Republic of China.

During  the  last  five to six  years  China  has

become  a  nuclear power. This  is  an  important

factor  to  consider  as China  cannot  from  now

onwards conduct diplomacy like when she was  just

a  military power. From now China has to  conduct

power   politics  by  the  normal,  international

channels and the best way for her to do  this  is

to join the United Nations. To this extent, China

could  be'  considered sincere in her  desire  to

join the. U.N, a:; she gradually picks up the old

Leninist  slogan  of  peaceful  co-existence  and

peaceful   competition   between   states    with

different social systems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's entry into the United Nations is

inevitable. China is a big power, as said on 30th

July,   1971, and  Singapore  cannot   influence

international events. There will be no change  in

Singapore's attitude towards what is  called  the

"important question" issue on the entry of  China

in  the  United  Nations.  Singapore  has  always

supported  China's  entry  into  the   U.N.'   WQ

abstained  on the Albanian resolution  previously

because the first part of that resolution, in our

view,  needed  to  be decided  first  before  the

second  part  could be decided upon.  We  believe

that  once  China is admitted, the  possibilities

are that she will take her seat and automatically

become a member of the Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attitude is that as a small power

our  policy is to adjust to big realities created

by  the big powers. Singapore does not want to be

under  the influence of one power. There are,  in

any  case,  many powers around us which  want  to

pursue  their  economic and other interests.  The

competition amongst the big powers is for markets

and   security'  interests  which  are  in   fact

legitimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



objectives to pursue. Essentially, the competition

is  of  an  economic  nature,  Most  countries  in

Southeast   Asia   are  interested   in   economic

development,  and  one more power, in  this  case

China, which could help in this field,  would  be

welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic competition in Southeast Asia is

made  all the more complex by two factors, namely.

China  coming  in  with a market  of  700  million

people  will increase the competition  with  other

big powers. This naturally will increase attention

by  the  United  States to her economic  interests

when  the  Vietnam  war is over. Therefore,  there

will  then be a new situation with new vistas  for

all  to  watch and make the necessary adjustments.

It  would  in  our opinion, be as  if  a  new  and

powerful neighbour has come to do business in  the

old neighbourhood.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion expressing  our

thanks  to  the President's speech. The  President

made a policy speech in this House on the 21st  of

last  month and this has added a new page  in  our

nation-building history. In his policy speech, the

President has painted a beautiful picture  of  our

achievements.  He  has  also  laid  down   correct

directives in regard to our future task of nation-building.   He  has  also  laid  stress   on   the

importance of strengthening our defence capability

in  order  to  ensure our security and  stability.

Undeniably,  this is what we should do  to  ensure

our  independence and sovereignty. When we  gained

our  independences, some six years ago. I remember

there  were people who expressed doubts about  our

ability  to maintain our security and sovereignty.

However, after these six years of independence, we

have   achieved  great  progress  in  our  defence

capability.  This is due to the concerted  efforts

of our people in co-operating with the Government.

As the President has pointed out in his speech, we

must  be  viable  in  our  defence.  Through   the

Commonwealth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



Five-Power  defence  arrangements,  security   and

stability are assured for several, years ahead. We

must  make  use  of this time to  consolidate  our

defence  capability. It is true that in this  task

we   should  exert  great  efforts.  Our  national

service   youths   have  put   up   an   excellent

performance  in  our  National  Day  celebrations.

Everyone of them is well-disciplined. Therefore, I

believe our youth will be able to take up the task

of defending our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the defence of our country, the

maintenance  of stability and the' development  of

our  economy  is also very important.  Only  in  a

stable  environment can we have  more  investment,

thereby creating more opportunities `if employment

and raising the standard of living of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the President's policy speech, mention

has been made of higher rates, of compensation for

those people affected by resettlement. This  is  a

very   correct   measure.   We   know   that   the

Government's urban renewal scheme is in the  long-term  interest of our country. Therefore, it needs

the  full support of all the people. On the  other

hand,  we must also give sympathetic consideration

to  people  affected by resettlement so that  they

may not suffer any great loss. So the Government's

decision to increase the rates of compensation and

ex gratia payments is a measure that we all should

praise and support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go through the various topics in the

addendum  to  the President's speech. Mention  has

been  made  of  the allocation of $5  million  to

resettle  the  hawkers  in various  parts  of  the

island.  The plan involves the building of  market

centres  to  accommodate  the  hawkers.  This   is

undoubtedly  a good plan because it  will  provide

fixed  localities  for  them  to  carry  on  their

business, and also to enable members of the public

to   enjoy   their   food  in  a  more   congenial

environment.  I am sure this plan will  meet  with

the  approval of all the people, particularly  the

hawkers. In fact, the hawker centres around Farrer

Road  Circus and Newton Circus have given  members

of the public a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



good impression because of their modern facilities

and  healthy  surroundings.  Thus  more  customers

patronise them and, in this way, their business is

improved. As a result, more hawker complexes  will

be built by the Government. This will be good news

to the hawkers. We all know that lots of them lead

a  difficult life. They have to hawk under the hot

sun and in heavy rain. In the past, they have been

neglected. However, ever since the People's Action

Party  came to power, they have been better looked

after. In the past few years, many new market  and

hawker  centres  have been built  in  Housing  and

Development Board estates for hawkers to do  their

business.  Now that the Government is allotting  a

sum  of  $5  million to improve the hawker  sites,

more  benefit  and  business will  come  to  them.

Therefore, it is a wise and judicious measure.  It

is also a concrete example that the Government has

done something for the good of the hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the addendum regarding the Ministry of

Law and National Development, it is mentioned that

the  Housing and Development Board plans to  build

100,000 housing units for the period 1971 to 1975.

This will double the target it has achieved in the

past.  In  spite  of  this  rapid  building  plan,

however,   we   are   still   short   of   housing

accommodation.   The   measures   taken   by   the

Government  have solved some of the acute  housing

problems. The hire-purchase ownership plan of  the

Government has solved the problem of housing to  a

great extent. This plan has been well received  by

the  people. However. I would like to ask  whether

the  Government can also extend this sort of hire-purchase terms to renters of H.D.B, shop premises.

I agree fully with what the Member for Thomson has

said in this House the other day about giving  the

occupiers  of Housing and Development  Board  shop

premises certain hire-purchase facilities  to  buy

shop  premises.  To this regard, I  remember  that

when  we  were  debating  the  Finance  Minister's

budget statement in this House some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



four months ago, I put forward some suggestions to

the  Minister for Finance to enable the  occupiers

of  Housing and Development Board shop premises to

buy  their  shop premises on hire-purchase  terms.

The Finance Minister replied that he would have to

look  into  the  matter, before he could  give  an

answer.  Four  months  have now  passed.  Can  the

Minister please give his answer to this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask concerns

the  building construction industry.  Recently  we

have  heard some news about the acute shortage  of

cement.  This shortage will seriously  affect  the

Housing  and  Development Board  and  the  private

developers  who  are engaged in  building  houses.

Therefore. I would ask the Minister to pay special

attention  to  the  problem  of  the  shortage  of

cement,  and to adopt adequate measures to  remedy

the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the addendum relating to the Ministry of Home

Affairs, there is mention of the reorganisation of

the Police Force in order to raise its efficiency,

provide  a  better  service  to  the  public, and

maintain   law  and  order  in  our  complex   and

urbanised   society.  No  doubt,  this   is   very

important  as  a  result of the  increase  in  the

number  of  satellite towns and  our  urbanisation

programme.   The  problems  of  social  stability,

security,  and  the maintenance of law  and  order

will  then  be more complex. In order to  maintain

law  and  order, we have to raise the standard  of

efficiency of the police, but to achieve its  full

effect,  the co-operation of the people  with  the

police  is  needed. The addendum has touched  upon

the improvement of salaries to the Police Force. I

would say this is reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the addendum has also touched upon

Government's policy in regard to a review  of  the

present wage policy which it intends to carry  out

early next year. Undoubtedly this is good news  to

the  workers  who  have contributed  much  to  our

economic development and nation-building.  Because

of  their  cooperation, commerce and industry  has

flourished.  So  it is reasonable that  we  should

give them a better deal and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



higher wages. I fully support the measure. I would

say  that  it  is a very judicious policy  to  re-examine the wage policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to making my general comments

on  the various measures which I have just touched

upon,  I  would like also to deal with  the  other

aspects   outlined   in  the   addendum   to   the

President's   speech  which  relate  to   defence,

economy, education, culture and others. If we  can

follow  these policies, then we will achieve  more

in these fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help in this matter and to benefit

all  the  people,  I  would  like  to  offer  five

suggestions   for   the   consideration   of   the

Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The national service policy should always be

examined, so as to have the welfare of certain

categories of national service personnel in mind.

For instance, consideration should be given to

allow  the  only  sons of  parents  who  are

breadwinners  of the family to do  part-time

national service, or exempt them from national

service  altogether. As regards professional

personnel  who are required by commerce  and

industry, we should give them certain facilities

to enable them to have more time to serve our

society, because in the President's speech mention

has been made of the shortage of such personnel-managers, engineers, and architects. We should

encourage them and allow them to do part-time

national service so that they can contribute more

to nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the addendum to the President's speech,

mention has been made of foreign policy.  It

is  stated that we should pay more attention

to  events  taking place outside  Singapore.

This  is  correct. In addition to  this,  we

should also establish closer and better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



relations  with our neighbouring  countries,

Malaysia   and   Indonesia,  including   the

British  Commonwealth countries, as this  is

mutually  beneficial. To achieve  this,  the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs should work  out

a  programme  whereby Members of Parliament,

or   leaders  of  the  countries  concerned.

could exchange visits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Regarding the control or curbing of prices

of  goods, the Ministry of Finance should do

more   work  in  this  respect,  apart  from

investigating  the prices of certain  goods.

The  Ministry  should also  take  additional

effective   measures   to   safeguard    the

interests  of the tax-payers to ensure  that

opportunities   will   not   be   given   to

speculators to increase the prices of  their

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Ministry of Culture should shoulder

more  responsibilities and  duties.  Culture

and  the arts are an important part  of  the

spiritual  life of Our people. The  concepts

of  virtue  and  national loyalty  are  also

important   factors  to  our   people.   The

Ministry   of   Culture   should   encourage

development   and   promotion   of   healthy

cultural     activities.    The     cultural

programmes   over   Radio   and   Television

Singapore should also be improved,  so  that

decadent  and  bad  culture  will   not   be

further   propagated.   In   addition,   the

Ministry  should  try to  inculcate  in  the

people  a  sense  of national  consciousness

and  the  idea  of harmonious  living  in  a

multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There is no mention in the addendum to the

President's  speech of matters  relating  to

the rural areas. As a Member representing  a

rural constituency,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



I would like, in order to be fair,

to  say  that since the P.A.P, came to power,

much  attention has been given to  the  rural

areas  such as the making of roads,  bridges,

and  canals, and the installation  of  lights

and other facilities. The Government has done

much,  but  because of the size of the  rural

areas, there are still many areas which  need

to  be developed. Therefore, I would urge the

Minister    concerned   to   pay   particular

attention to the rural areas and to  allocate

more money in the new financial year for  the

amenities and facilities of the rural people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, the Government's policy speech

has  brought  about a new mission in our  task  of

nation-building.  It  also presents  us  with  new

challenges--the  strengthening  of   our   defence

capability, the raising of our educational  level,

the    development   of   our   industries,    the

construction and rebuilding of our city area,  and

the  development  of  our  island  to  make  it  a

beautiful  garden  city.  Undoubtedly,  these  are

necessary   for  the  progress  of  the   country,

providing   a   good  future  and  better   living

conditions  for  the people. But these  objectives

must  have  the support of the people. Though  the

tasks are difficult, I think there is nothing that

we cannot achieve with the concerted effort and co-operation of the people, in fact, in the past  six

years,  we  have  in the field of  nation-building

achieved  many  things. Of course, these  are  not

easily  achieved.  With careful  planning  by  the

Government, coupled with the support and hard work

of  the people, particularly the workers, we  have

attained our present position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, in the past years we have

also   been  faced  with  serious  problems.   For

instance,  because  of  the  announcement  of  the

British military withdrawal, we are faced with the

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



of  more unemployment. All these problems  in

the past have been troubling and bothering us. But

through  the  effective planning  of  the  various

government departments, the rapid building  up  of

our  armed  forces,  and  the  implementation   of

industrialisation  and tourist measures,  we  have

already overcome the problems one by one.  We  can

now enjoy a better and more stable environment, In

view of the reasons which I have just mentioned, I

believe  that although we will be faced with  many

new problems, we shall, with the unity and support

of  the masses of the people, and with their close

co-operation  with  the  Government,  be  able  to

implement   the  various  tasks  and   plans   (if

construction and nation building successfully,  so

as  to consolidate our future for the good of  our

future generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this session has given us great tasks and

responsibilities, in fact, a mission. To order  to

live  up  to  the expectations of the  people,  we

should  try our best to help, so that our  country

may  march forward to a better and more prosperous

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the President's speech and the

motion.

address  of  thanks to the President's  speech.  I

think it may be of general interest to Members for

me to make a somewhat more detailed statement than

is  contained in the President's speech about  the

recent take-over of Haw Par Brothers International

Ltd, by  Slater,  Walker  Securities  Ltd.   The

reaction to this take-over indicates that there is

sonic   public  apprehension  in  regard  to   two

matters.  One  is  the  extent  to  which  foreign

interests  should  he allowed  to  take  over  and

control  Singapore companies.  The  other  is  the

desirability  of  certain  practices  followed  or

adopted  on take-overs which, though not  illegal,

would  constitute  unacceptable  behaviour  in  an

international financial centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that discussion on this subject may

proceed intelligently, it may he of advantage if  a

report  which  has  been compiled  by  Ministry  of

Finance  officials is made available to Members.  I

have therefore handed copies of this report* (*Annex, cols. 137-142.) to the

Clerk who will make it available to Members.



<br><br>[Copies of report distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1971/19710802/19710802-HA-0310137.pdf"">Appendix 1 - SLATER, WALKER'S TAKE-OVER OF HAW PAR(Cols 137 - 140)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to any supervision or regulation of

take-overs, my Ministry is faced , with a number of

conflicting considerations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is desirable that inefficient companies

should   be   taken  over  by  more  competent

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There should not be unnecessary interference

in takeovers where companies willingly merge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Consolidation by way of merging into larger

economic units bring economies of scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The fear that there may be a

concentration of economic power in  the  hands

of  one group giving rise to monopoly or  near

monopoly conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present policy is not to discriminate against

foreign  interests buying into Singapore  companies

generally, and in so far as Sterling area residents

are  concerned, there are no exchange  controls  on

such   transactions.  However,  it  might  now   be

opportune  to prepare for an increase in  take-over

activities   and  also  consider  whether   certain

categories  of Singapore companies should  be  kept

under  Singapore  control, for example,  banks  and

insurance  companies.  It  is  not  suggested  that

foreign  interests be totally, excluded in  respect

of   such  companies.  On  the  contrary,  minority

foreign   equity  participation   might   even   be

encouraged  if  it  increases  the  efficiency  and

competitiveness of the local company. Nevertheless,

control   by   some   system  of  vetting   foreign

participation in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



certain designated sectors of commerce and industry

may  be necessary and desirable. Perhaps also  some

equivalent  to  the London Panel on Take-overs  and

Mergers" is required This Panel has drawn up a  set

of  rules and established a code of behaviour which

all parties to a take-over are expected to observe.

Essentially  the Code drawn up by the London  Panel

seeks  to ensure early disclosure of details  of  a

bid so that all shareholders are placed on an equal

footing as far as possible, and to ensure that  the

majority shareholders do not exploit their position

at the expense of the minority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other system of regulation is that

established  by  the  American Securities  Exchange

Commission.   However,  their  approach   is   more

cumbersome  and  a  number  of  countries.  France.

Switzerland  and  Japan, have  been  examining  the

London  Panel's mode of operation in preference  to

the  American system. In Singapore it  is  probable

that  the London Panel type o approach modified  to

take  into  account local conditions  may  be  more

appropriate. This must be examined in  relation  to

the Companies Act and the Securities Industries Act

which are patterned on Australian legislation. I am

advised that the Australian Companies Act has  been

recently  amended  to deal with takeovers  in  much

greater detail, and these amendments might prove of

help in drafting similar regulations for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance and

the  Monetary Authority should, in conjunction with

the   Attorney-General,  examine  whether   further

amendments to the Companies Act to deal with  take-overs  are  necessary or desirable, and  whether  a

London Panel type of institution can play a role in

developing  an  acceptable  code  of  conduct   and

standards of behaviour in take-overs and mergers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, of course, the best

protection    for    Singapore    companies     and

shareholders,  as  for companies  and  shareholders

elsewhere, is to ensure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



efficiency   and   good   management   of   their

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to join my colleagues in  this

House  to  thank  the President  for  his  speech

delivered at the opening of the Second Session of

the  Second  Parliament on Wednesday. 21st  July,

1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure all Members of this House will

fully  support  the Government's policy  that  we

will not allow anyone to work up heat on the  gut

issues over language, culture and religion.  Also

no  one who is working in the mass media has  the

right to play with the emotional reflexes of  our

different communities. Let us make it very  clear

that  those  who deliberately try  to  encourage.

stir up or provoke trouble, under the pretence of

language, culture  or religion,  must  face  the

consequences. It is the duty of everyone and  all

local or foreign press here to assist in creating

a , happy, harmonious, tolerant and understanding

society  among  all the people of all  races,  of

different languages, cultures and religions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also express my full support for the

measures  that this Government will implement  as

outlined  in the President's speech  and  in  the

addendum to the speech by the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers in Singapore have done their

very   best  to  help  achieve  success  in   our

industrialisation  programme and  rapid  economic

growth.  Through  their  co-operation  with   the

employers  and  Government, there  is  industrial

peace  which  helps to attract more investors  to

come to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Employment Act was passed by

Parliament in 1968, the workers have made  a  lot

of  sacrifices, especially as they have  to  work

longer   hours,   with  lesser  public   holidays

limitation of bonus payment wage restraints, etc



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, most of the employers have enjoyed the

present economic boom and they have already  made

substantial  profits as well  as  expanded  their

business.  I sincerely hope they will  appreciate

the workers' sacrifices and their contribution in

helping them to make bigger profits. The time has

come  when  they  must give  the  workers  better

bonuses. By the middle of next year, they  should

give  substantial wage increases to the  workers.

Some  of the employers have already responded  to

the  Government's appeal to give  bigger  bonuses

and  I hope more employers will do the same.  The

present  wage  restraints  and  the  increase  in

prices    of    goods   are   causing   financial

difficulties  and  hardships to  the  workers.  I

would request the Government to relax the present

policy of wage restraints as soon as possible and

also  to  take drastic action against shopkeepers

who    increase    prices   of   goods    without

justification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers are fully aware that prices of

goods  have increased substantially and in  spite

of  the  good profits they are making,  they  are

still  reluctant to consider giving  a  temporary

"high  cost of living allowance" to the  workers.

This  attitude  is  indeed  very  deplorable  and

unfair.  Unless the workers get a  fair  wage  to

meet the present cost of living, they may have to

take drastic action against their employers which

will  eventually  disrupt the present  industrial

peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was mentioned in the President's speech

that the Government will systematically mechanise

laborious and repetitive work. The private sector

will be encouraged to do the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mechanisation is a necessity. I would

request the Government and the private sector  to

carry out mechanisation in gradual stages and not

to  over-do it, so that the workers' job security

will  not  be  affected. If the employers  expect

industrial peace with the workers. I advise  them

to accept this request seriously. Should there be

rapid  mechanisation just purely for the sake  of

saving  labour costs and retrenching the workers,

there  will be serious trouble. The N.T.U.C, and

all its affiliated unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



will fight back by taking industrial action. I

hope this will not happen. I am sure the

Government will not allow such a thing to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the Government's intention to

amend the Workmen's Compensation Act to cover non-manual  workers who earn up to $750 per month,  to

treble   the   quantum  of  workers'  compensation

payable  at  present, to provide a  more  detailed

list  of  injuries which would result in permanent

partial  incapacity, and to include silicosis  and

asbestosis   in   the  schedule  of   occupational

diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on public

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to know that more than 125,000 units

of  public housing have been completed. More  than

700,000 people, that is, about 35 per cent of  the

population,   are   now  occupying   Housing   and

Development  Board flats. I must congratulate  the

Housing  and  Development Board on the  good  work

they  are  doing and I wish them more  success  in

building more flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board are going to

build  100,000 units for the period 1971 to  1975.

May  I  request  the Government  to  increase  its

target to 125,000 units, instead of 100,000 units,

because  most  of  the  working-class  people  can

afford to rent or buy only Housing and Development

Board  flats. The prices of houses and flats built

by  the private sector are so fantastic that  even

the middle-class income group cannot afford to buy

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also request the Government to

reduce  at  least  50  per cent  of  the  building

projects   undertaken  by  the   private   sector,

especially on multi-storey flats, terrace  houses,

semi-detached houses or bungalows. By putting this

limitation  on  them,  construction  workers   and

building  materials  will  be  available  to   the

Government  to build more Housing and  Development

Board fiats. It will eventually eliminate the long

waiting  list  for  Housing and Development  Board

flats.  Perhaps this exercise will help to prevent

the  private sector from increasing the prices  of

houses so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



fantastically. It will also help the Government to

build another 25,000 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the resettlement

of  hawkers. May I request the Government to adopt

a  policy of flexibility in resettling hawkers  at

the market concourse or at hawker centres? I quite

appreciate  the  importance  of  having  a   clean

environment for the hawkers as well as  for  those

who  buy food from them. But to centralise all the

hawkers into the market concourse temporarily  and

then  to  resettle them again finally at a  hawker

centre  is  causing hardship to a good  number  of

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government must realise that hawkers cater for a

certain number of residents in the housing estate.

By  resettling them from a few temporary places in

the  housing estate to only one area in the market

concourse will cause too many hawkers selling  the

same  food. There will be strong competition among

themselves  and  this  will lead  to  much  lesser

profit or even financial loss. Their customers are

from the residents in the housing estate and quite

naturally a resident will not walk a long distance

from  his flat to go to the market just to  buy  a

bowl  of  kway  teow. Therefore, hawkers  will  be

losing their customers and get lesser profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the hawkers selling at Block 27 at

Bukit  Ho  Swee  have been resettled  at  the  Beo

Crescent    Market   Concourse.    The    hawkers'

representatives have requested me to appeal to the

Housing and Development Board authorities to allow

them  to  return  to  Block  27  because  of   the

following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Business is not very good at the Beo

Crescent Market Concourse,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Selling at Block 27, each hawker could make

a  profit  of $5 a day, and now at  the  Beo

Crescent  Market Concourse, the  profit  has

been reduced to $2 or $3 a day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Most of them have families to support

and  with a small profit of $2 or $3  a  day.

they are facing financial difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Strong competition in the market place

because  of too many stalls selling the  same

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Because of the two-shift system, they

cannot earn enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) They cannot cater for the residents around Block 27.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The residents would prefer them to hawk

in  the  area, i.e., Block 27, because  there

are   no  shops  in  that  area  and  it   is

convenient  for  them to send their  children

downstairs to buy food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The space between the blocks in this

area  is  big  enough for a  row  of  stalls,

leaving a broad enough space for the passage-way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) They will give full co-operation to keep

the place clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) They are prepared to erect their own

shelters  with  advice from the  Housing  and

Development    Board   and    the    Hawkers'

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already made my appeal on their behalf to

the Housing and Development Board authorities, but

their request has been rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appeal to the Government to give

sympathetic consideration to allow hawkers  to  do

their  business at certain places in  the  housing

estates  and  they should be under the supervision

of  the Housing and Development Board and Hawkers'

Department. They have been in the hawking business

for  years and it is difficult for them to  change

their profession.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  join  my colleagues in  thanking  the

President for his speech



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



to the House. In his speech, the President has put

in  a nutshell the tremendous progress made by the

country  since independence. He has  also  pointed

out  the  directions in which future  developments

are to take place. For a country with such limited

natural  resources as our own, the  progress  made

can be considered to be impressive by any standard

and,   on  this  occasion,  I  think  it  is  only

appropriate that we should record our appreciation

of  the  excellent manner in which the  people  of

Singapore   have   responded  to   the   political

leadership    in   ensuring   success    in    the

implementation  of  our  policies.  But  for   the

determination and sacrifices on the  part  of  our

people,  all that we have achieved will  not  have

been possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremendous pace at which we have expected

our  people to adapt to changes can be  seen  from

the large number of Bills submitted and passed  by

this  House during the last session of Parliament.

It  may  interest the House to know that some  140

Bills  were passed during the last Parliament  and

have   since   become   laws.   Inevitably,    the

implementation of some, if not all, of these  laws

have  brought  about temporary inconveniences  and

even  hardships to certain sections of the public.

Whilst  every  endeavour has been made  to  lessen

such inconveniences and hardships, there have been

areas  where  we  could  perhaps  have  been  more

considerate  or generous. A case in point  is  the

rate  of compensation paid to farmers affected  by

land acquisition. In this connection, I am pleased

to  note the Government's decision to give  higher

rates  of  compensation to tenants and  ex  gratia

payments to squatters for resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from adequate monetary compensation,

it  is also essential, to my mind, to ensure  that

when  people  are  resettled,  the  facilities  or

amenities  available to them in the new areas  are

at  least  of the same standard as, if not  higher

than,  that enjoyed by them previously. In  saying

so.  I  have  in mind instances in the past  where

people in areas already provided with water and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



electricity were resettled in areas without  such

modern  amenities. I am sure that there  must  be

other    parallel   cases   arising   from    the

implementation of our policies. In our next phase

of development, I feel it is important that we do

not  lose sight of the need to minimise any human

miseries or inconveniences brought about  by  the

implementation of any of our policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech, the President

has  emphasised  the need for our  investors  and

entrepreneurs  to  develop new attitudes  and  to

acquire   the   necessary   sophistication    and

expertise  for  the management of industries  and

other enterprises. Sir,I have no doubt that  our

normally  responsive business leaders  will  take

heed  of  the  advice. However, I feel  that  the

Government   can   help   by   setting   up    an

international business school where our  business

executives, especially the younger ones,  may  go

for  the  necessary orientation  and  develop  an

international outlook. The courses  conducted  at

such  a  school may aim particularly at providing

participants    with   a   good   knowledge    of

international   business   operations   and   the

political, social and economic conditions of  the

world  at  large.  As we become  increasingly  an

international trading and financial centre, it is

essential  that  our businessmen  are  made  more

aware  of  methods, practices and  conditions  of

international business. This will,  in  the  long

run,  help  to improve the sales of our  products

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of export business, I take this

opportunity  of asking the Minister  for  Finance

whether he is satisfied with the progress made by

Intraco to date in assisting local industries  in

the  promotion  of  the sales of  their  products

abroad.  Only  too often Government agencies  are

inclined  or tempted to allow the purely  profit-making  motive to over-ride all other  wider  and

equally  important,  if not  more  so,  long-term

considerations which have originally prompted the

setting  up  of  such agencies. It is  important,

therefore,  that  the  operations  of  all   such

agencies should be brought under constant  review

from time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



to  time  so as to ensure that they do  not  lose

sight of the overall objectives. Whilst we expect

these agencies to be financially viable, we  also

expect  them  in  the  long run  to  provide  the

necessary  leadership to the  private  sector  in

bringing about a higher standard of expertise and

sophistication.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I endorse the motion tabled by  the

Member for Ulu Pandan. The present Government has

had   more   than  10  years  of  experience   in

government. During this period we have  seen  the

policy  statements of the present Government.  We

have also seen with our own eyes the progress and

achievements  made  under the leadership  of  the

P.A.P.  Government. We have also seen  the  rapid

progress made in nation-building. Because of  all

this, I believe that the prospects of development

that lie ahead of us can be seen clearly from the

policy  statement delivered in this House  a  few

days  ago. If we can forecast future developments

from our present achievements, then conversely we

can  also look back at our achievements from  the

prospects that lie ahead. So when we make a study

of  the present policy statement, it is also time

that  we  made  a  review  of  our  efforts   and

achievements so far. If our efforts so  far  have

not  brought about higher achievements, then from

the  present policy statement we can only see the

repetition of old problems. But this is  not  the

case,  because from the policy statement and  the

addendum,  we  can see a lot of new problems  and

new  prospects.  All these new problems  and  new

prospects  have  been brought about  by  progress

made  in the past. We have to know what we intend

to do in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the present moment, we have

more  than  700,000 people living in Housing  and

Development Board flats. According to the  latest

plan  of  the  Government, in 1975  some  half  a

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



people  will be living in Housing and Development

Board flats. So the total number of people living

in  Housing Board accommodation by 1975  will  be

more than half the population of Singapore. This,

Mr Speaker, Sir, will indeed be a new development

which  we  can see from the Presidential Address.

This  is something heartening and gratifying that

could hardly be foreseen in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be unthinkable if this kind of

forecast  were  made in 1959. In  fact,  we  have

already  come  to  a  stage of development  which

could  not  be imagined in 1959. I   have  looked

into  an  early  publication of the  P.A.P..  The

Tasks  Ahead,  and found that the  various  items

listed  and planned in this publication  as  aims

have  come  to pass. The ideals of the past  have

become the achievements of today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 60,000 people in my constituency, Bukit

Merah,  are also enjoying in many ways the fruits

of the progress made. What we can see there is  a

situation  of the city engulfing the countryside,

and  not  the countryside engulfing the  city  as

propounded by the Communists. We can see also the

process  of  urban renewal being carried  out  in

Hong  Lim Constituency which I any assisting, in

an  area  of  1,700 acres, which had  about  one-quarter  of  the population of Singapore  in  the

past,  the pace of urban renewal is being stepped

up.  So very soon we shall be able to sec  a  new

look, a new face lift, not only in this place but

also in Sembawang and all over the island. We are

also  certain that the pragmatic approach of  the

Government is very praiseworthy. Whether it is in

terms of urban renewal or rural resettlement, the

people   affected  are  invariably   faced   with

problems  to  some extent, in this  respect,  the

Govern-merit has already decided to increase  the

rate  of compensation and ex, gratia payments  to

those  people affected by the resettlement scheme

so  that  their  difficulties can be  alleviated.

This   is   another  indication  of  the  present

Government's  pragmatism  and  its  sincerity  in

looking after the interests of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



the people. Mr Speaker. Sir, if over the past few

years   our   national  economy  had   not   been

consolidated  and  there had  not  been  so  much

progress,  we  would not have been  able  now  to

increase  the  rate  of  compensation  for  these

people. If we look around us, we can see that  we

are  now able to do this all because we have been

able  to look after the national interests first.

It is only after the national interests have been

well  taken  care  of that individual  and  group

interests can be better looked after more easily.

This is an example for the present as well as the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress or prosperity may not bring about more

progress or more prosperity as a rule. It may, in

fact, bring about some new problems, for example,

the  case of rising wages, if this problem is not

properly handled, it may result in inflation. The

increase   in   the  rate  of  compensation   for

resettled  people  will in certain  circumstances

give rise to an increase in the price of land. In

spite of all that, we cannot throw away the apple

because  of the core. Therefore, we must look  at

this  problem from various angles.  Where  it  is

possible,  we  will increase wages at  the  right

time,  anc1, also,  if necessary,  the  rate  of

compensation.  By doing the right  thing  at  the

right  time, we can achieve our wishes which  can

only   be  translated  into  reality  under   the

enlightened  leadership of  the  People's  Action

Party.  Without  this enlightened leadership,  we

can only see these things in our dreams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been trying to express my views in

as few words as possible to reflect my confidence

in  the  present Government, and I would like  to

endorse  my support for the motion of the  Member

for Ulu Pandan.

in    the   l960s   to   nation-building    after

independence  and the serious challenges  in  the

face  of  multifarious problems in the 1970s,  we

successful  and  stable country in  this  turbulent

region  of  South-east Asia. The internal political

stability,  the economic development, the  rise  in

our   Gross  National  Product,  the  international

prestige  we  have  built up, the establishment  of

trade  links  with  more and  more  countries,  the

gradual  development of Singapore as the  financial

centre  of  South-east Asia and as  an  example  to

developing countries - all these achievements  have

been brought about by the cohesiveness and unity of

our  people. For a better future, we still have  to

carry  on  working hard for what  we  have  already

achieved. Complacency, no doubt, is a hindrance  to

progress, but to ask for too much without regard to

the   practical  and  objective  circumstances   is

equally  bad. The fortuitous process through  which

our  unique  immigrant society has  developed  from

colonial  rule  to  internal  self-government  and,

finally, independence provides many lessons for  us

and  our  future  generations  to  remember.  These

lessons  make us vigilant and appreciative  of  the

value  of  the harmony and stability  that  we  are

enjoying as a multi-racial country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a Singapore citizen is something to be

proud  of.  This  is because we  have  built  up  a

country  from  the  unity and cohesion  of  several

races,   cultures  and  religions.  Through  mutual

understanding, mutual help and mutual tolerance, we

have  built  a foundation of oneness based  on  the

confluence of many units. We must continue to  work

hard  to consolidate this foundation and to  ensure

that nation-building is above all other objectives.

It  is  important  that we establish  our  national

consciousness   and  unity  of   purpose.   It   is

unfortunate, however, that when we are  engaged  in

the   supreme  task  of  nation-building  and   the

establishment  of unity of purpose, divisive  words

are  being spread in all directions. This  is  very

dangerous.  The people behind this even attempt  to

go through the cultural front in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



advocate  divisive thinking among our people.  They

exploit the various complicated and acute issues in

our country in order to whip up suspicion among our

people  in  the hope that they will cause  communal

conflict, and to undermine and destroy whatever  we

have built. The consequences will be tragic if they

succeed,  because the people will  then  be  living

with one another in a state of hostility or forever

become  the  slaves of others. If we  do  not  take

timely  and  decisive  steps  to  stop  all   these

pervasive  divisive  influences,  all  the   unity,

cohesion and foundation that we have built up  will

be corroded and destroyed. What will then become of

our  society and our country? Of course, the result

will be unthinkable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when we are taking decisive steps to

stop  all  these  pervasive  divisive  forces  from

operating  in our country, there are some  ignorant

people who blindly accuse the Government of killing

the  freedom of the press. Indeed, freedom  of  the

press  is one of the basic principles of democracy.

In  its  turn,  the press also has a responsibility

and obligation towards the nation. But all this  is

relative.  It does not mean that the abuse  of  the

freedom  of  speech beyond the  ambit  of  the  law

should  be permitted. Neither does it mean that  we

should  allow  the exploitation of the  freedom  of

speech against the national interest. No doubt,  it

is  a  privilege  and  a right that  every  citizen

should  be  able to express his views  openly,  but

between the right and the obligation, we must  find

a  proper  balance  so that the  interests  of  the

entire nation will be looked after according to the

social  conscience. Only then will the  freedom  of

speech  and  expression find significance.  At  the

present  stage  of  our  nation-building,  national

consciousness is still in the formative  stage.  We

should not compare ourselves with countries with  a

longer  history, particularly when we are a  multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-religious society.

We  must  not allow the poison of divisive thinking

to spread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



among  our people, if we allow things to go  their

own way, many ignorant people will break away from

the  nation.  Freedom  of  speech  and  expression

should  be  in keeping with our national policies.

We  welcome constructive criticism, criticism made

on  an objective basis, particularly in regard  to

any   deviation  in  the  implementation  of   our

national policies. On the contrary, if the freedom

of  expression is abused and exploited,  then  the

harm  done  to  the country will be  immeasurable,

Only responsible freedom of speech will have value

and relevance to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been stressing the importance of cohesion

among our multi-racial people because as a society

we  are  unique, if  we do not  do  our  best  to

preserve  all the achievements made,  we  will  be

heading  for destruction. Our country  is  like  a

sophisticated  machine.  All  the  parts  must  be

properly  operated and synchronised. If  there  is

any  loose  part,  the whole machinery  will  stop

operating  or  go out of order.  This  is  a  very

simple example. We can learn a lot of lessons  and

see  many examples of what has happened around us.

The facts are cruel, but we must not try to escape

from   reality.  We  must  instead   sharpen   our

vigilance and take preventive measures for what is

to  come,  otherwise we will be very  foolish.  In

order  to ensure that our stability and prosperity

will  continue,  all the people in Singapore  must

unite   together   and  heighten  their   national

consciousness.  They must always  remain  vigilant

and be in a position to know who are their enemies

and who are their friends so that they will not be

exploited.  The  future is unpredictable.  In  the

process  of self-preservation there should  be  no

relaxation on our part. Only then shall we be able

to   stand  forever  and  enjoy  our  freedom   in

international politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore  is  a  country   mainly

dependent  on industry and commerce. In  order  to

keep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



up   with  our  industrial  development,  we   are

entering  the field of technological training.  We

have  done  a  great deal to improve the  teaching

facilities  at the Polytechnic to turn out  enough

competent technical and engineering personnel  for

our  industries. All this is very correct. On  the

other  hand, greater efforts are still needed  for

the  development of managerial and executive staff

and  personnel for our big companies.  The  recent

incidents  involving Eupoc, the Starlight  company

and  a  British financial group show that we  lack

managerial   talent.   The  President   has   also

commented  in  his speech that "it is  a  sad  and

painful example of how poorly we run some  of  our

limited companies listed on the stock exchange. We

have  to  acquire sophistication and expertise  to

run  large  corporate holding companies and  their

subsidiaries." We must do all we can to train such

personnel,   especially  in  the  light   of   our

commercial   development  and   the   process   of

modernisation and professionalism  now under  way.

Our two universities at present conduct courses on

business and industrial management. In view of the

acute  shortage of such personnel, we must make  a

systematic and better use of the facilities in the

two    universities   to   meet    our    national

requirements.  We  could then have  more  of  such

personnel  for  our industries. With  the  courses

jointly  conducted  by  the  two  universities,  I

believe   we  should  be  able  to  get   suitable

personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has rightly said that food alone

is  not enough to bring up a good citizen. We must

have  proper  educational and cultural activities.

We must provide the mental pabulum needed. Because

of  the  present  lack  of  mental  pabulum,  even

undesirable publications are welcomed by many. The

Minister for Culture says that the Government  has

recently  confiscated and destroyed  about  20,000

copies  of  undesirable chain-picture publications

meant  for  children. I do not know the number  of

such publications for children and adults that are

still in circulation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



But   prohibition  and  confiscation  are  passive

measures.   These  undesirable  publications   are

brought into Singapore because there is a cultural

and  spiritual vacuum. The best way to  fill  that

vacuum is to produce our own publications. We have

many  writers  and painters. The Government  could

utilise  their  services and ask them  to  produce

educational, meaningful and desirable articles for

publication. Only then will we be able to  counter

such  undesirable  publications  and  reduce   our

dependence  on  imported ones, and supply  healthy

publications to our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a multi-lingual society

and  the  Ministry of Education must  improve  the

technique  of  teaching the second  and  even  the

first  language. Research has shown that the  best

time  for  children to learn a second language  is

when  they are under 12 years old, i.e., when they

are  in  the primary school. Therefore, we  should

concentrate  on  the teaching of languages  during

this  period to get the maximum effect. There  are

language  laboratories in the various institutions

of  higher learning and the Adult Education Board.

But  there  is  no co-ordination and  co-operation

among  these  institutions  in  the  teaching   of

languages. The Ministry of Education can therefore

set up a unifying body, such as an advisory centre

on   the   teaching   of   languages   among   the

institutions. Then the activities and planning  of

these  institutions would be properly coordinated,

planned  and  directed to function satisfactorily.

That  would  greatly  help in teaching  languages,

both inside and outside the schools.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson) In Tamil:</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President made  a

speech at the Opening of the Second Session of the

Second  Parliament, and I support the  Address  of

thanks  proposed. I wish to give my own views.  We

have to encourage the establishment of a more just

and  equal  society. The speech is  tantamount  to

that.  We  have  to  devise  ways  and  means   to

establish a disciplined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



society. Language, culture and religion should not

be   divisive  factors.  They  should,  in   fact,

contribute  to unity among the various races.  But

there will be unity only when multi-racial, multi-religious  and multi-lingual ties are  steadfastly

knitted together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the prices of commodities are

increasing. The Government is in fact taking steps

to check the price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced, through His

Excellency  the  President,  certain  policies.  I

support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, school children, the Police and

Armed  Forces personnel, workers, and other people

belonging to establishments and institutions, will

be  staging  a mammoth show to celebrate  National

Day. They have to rehearse the show a few times in

order   to  produce  a  good  show.  They   should

therefore be given leave to attend rehearsals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been independent for six years. Within

this  short period we have overcome many  problems

and   have   made   progress.   When   we   became

independent,  the  people  around  us  had  doubts

whether  we could make the grade. But contrary  to

their expectations, we have gone forward. This  is

because  the  Government has worked hard  and  the

public     have    given    their    co-operation.

Nevertheless, there is a hindrance.  This  is  the

British   military  withdrawal.  When   this   was

announced,  we  were afraid that  there  would  be

unemployment.  Due to our leaders'  foresight,  we

have   solved  that  problem.  We  are  not   only

industrialising  quite rapidly, but  we  are  also

employing trained foreigners who come here on work

permits. But in doing this, the Government  should

be  careful not to create unemployment  among  our

own  citizens. Perhaps the holders of work permits

come  here  to work for a lesser salary,  and  the

employers  may  also make use of this  opportunity

permanently. In this respect the Government should

be cautious. Our citizens should not only be given

proper   training,  but  they   should   also   be

safeguarded against unemployment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small nation. Therefore, some may

ask  whether  it  is necessary to  have  a  bigger

defence  force. But I would like to ask  them  one

question. Why are we having gates and doors to our

own houses? It is because we want security. In the

same  way, our country should also be made secure.

So  it does not matter even if we spend more money

on  defence. It would be helpful to our  progress.

We  need  to  buy new equipment for  training  our

armed forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to create a more equal and just

society.  We also have a duty to build houses  for

the  people.  But we need land for other  projects

too.  So when people are affected by resettlement,

I   hope   they   will  be  satisfied   with   the

compensation they get from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would offer two suggestions.

When   the   Government   take   over   land   for

redevelopment,  if for some reason  they  are  not

going  to  develop it immediately, I suggest  they

offer it to the private sector for development. As

far  as  industrial development is concerned,  the

same  privileges offered to foreigners should also

be  offered to local people. When the local people

want  to erect buildings for industries, they have

to  comply  with  certain building regulations.  I

hope  the  Government  will relax  some  of  these

regulations for local people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is necessary for life. Before building

more  houses,  the  Government  should  have  more

reservoirs. The rain water should be channelled to

the  various reservoirs so that at any  time  they

will  be filled. I suggest that farmers use  pumps

to  draw well water. Then they could make  use  of

the  well  water for their needs. In the way,  the

water  shortage could be overcome. Other countries

have well facilities too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I praise the Health Ministry for doing a good

job.  There are less mosquitoes now. This is  very

encouraging.  Measures have  also  been  taken  to

control pollution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope more dispensaries could be built near

housing  estates.  There  are  no  facilities  for

medical  treatment at night except  in  Government

hospitals.   Private  doctors   in   the   various

constituencies  should open their  clinics  during

the  night.  They could take turns to be  on  duty

during  the  night.  I  hope  the  Minister   will

approach them on this suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has given equal treatment to all the

four  languages. It has been successful  in  doing

that.  Moreover,  two languages  are  compulsorily

taught  in  schools  now.  In  future,  when   our

children know two or more languages, they will  be

able  to understand one another better. They  will

then live in a better society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to comment on Tamil education. In

Tamil  primary schools, the second language should

be  taught  in  such a way that  it  benefits  the

pupils.  When  we teach languages in  schools,  we

should  be careful not to create trouble over  the

language   issue,   as  has  happened   in   other

countries. I hope the Minister will take  note  of

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has tremendously improved the

communication  system. I praise the  Minister  who

reorganised  the transport system.  But  there  is

still vehicle congestion at certain places. E hope

this will be overcome soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to praise the Police Force and make a

request  to the Home Affairs Minister.  There  are

many  foreigners who come to Singapore. Once  they

are  here, they are given the opportunity to  stay

here  permanently and get citizenship. At the same

time,  the Minister should pay attention and  give

citizenship to those who have stayed  here  for  a

long  time. Also, when those people who  are  born

and bred in Singapore marry foreigners, I hope the

Minister  will make the necessary arrangements  to

grant  citizenship to foreigners who  marry  local

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the

Member  for  Ulu Pandan for moving the Address  of

thanks to the President for his speech.
