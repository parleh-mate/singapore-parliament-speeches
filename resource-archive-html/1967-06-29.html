<div align="center"><b>DEMONSTRATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  what  actions were  taken  in  the  recent

disturbances and demonstrations in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,    49   lightning   processions/demonstrations

organised  by  the Barisan Sosialis  and  Left-wing

unions were reported between 1st January, 1967, and

25th  June, 1967. The monthly breakdown of  figures

is as follows: -



<pre>

           January        Procession       1

           February           "            1

           March              "            3

           April              "           10

           May                "           14

                        Demonstrations     5.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police made contact in 32 separate incidents,

resulting in the arrest of a total of 505  persons.

A  total  of  432  persons were charged  in  court.

Seventeen persons were served with expulsion orders

as  they  are  non-citizens.  The  police  deployed

strong  foot and mobile patrols in likely areas  in

order  to  prevent processions from  taking  place.

Troops of the Reserve Unit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



supplemented  these  patrols  in  patrolling  these

areas    and   taking   action   against    illegal

processions/demonstrations. The police showed great

restraint  in  carrying out their  responsibilities

with   minimum  force,  despite  physical  violence

inflicted  on them. Stones, bottles, wooden  staves

and  lighted torches were hurled at the  police  by

members  o  the illegal processions,  resulting  in

injury   to  several  police  officers.  Preventive

police  action  is  being  taken  and  patrols  are

constantly on the alert against damage to  property

or acts of vandalism.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what action will he

taken  against those who wilfully damage the  Court

room?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> I believe the Member is

referring  to  the incident which occurred  in  the

Court yesterday. I am sure that the -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wee, if you are referring to

incidents  that occurred in Court as  part  of  the

proceedings, I may have to rule you out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> That is what I thought - that

the Member was asking that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could the Member please repeat his

question slowly?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I would like to ask

what  action  will  be  taken  against  those   who

wilfully damage a court of law?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wee, the question does not relate

to  the  proceedings itself, but relates apparently

to  activities  in  Court  in  the  course  of  the

proceedings. These activities themselves  are  not,

to  my knowledge, the subject of court proceedings,

and so you are at liberty to answer the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> As the Member is aware, the

police have taken the necessary measures to prevent

any  untoward incidents in the Court, and whichever

persons are apprehended for criminal acts committed

at  the  time, they, of course, will be dealt  with

according to the law.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC PROPERTY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Damage by anti-national elements and protective measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Minister of Defence

how  much  public  property was  damaged  by  anti-national  elements between January, 1967, and  20th

June, 1967, and what are the measures taken for the

protection of public property.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, damage to public property caused

by anti-national elements is as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 11 sets of traffic lights:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Hill Street Police Post window panes broken;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Police vehicles -smashed windscreens, flasher lights and dents to vehicles;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Central Fire Station -Door panes broken:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Jalan Haji Karim Community Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other damages include defacing of bus shelters and

road  signs, breaking of glass, damage to  streets,

and the cost to obliterate slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These properties are installed for the benefit of

the   general   public   and,   therefore,   easily

accessible.  As  far as possible, essential  public

properties  are  guarded and the police  constantly

patrol areas which are likely targets of vandalism.

The  police  are  always on the  alert  to  prevent

damage to property or acts of vandalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes a serious view of any act of

vandalism  and offenders will be severely punished.

The  Government  cannot tolerate any  anti-national

elements  who  are  out  to  create  chaos  in  the

Republic  and  undermine the well., being  of  our

nation.

<div align="center"><b>JALAN KAYU</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(House number allotments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teo Hup Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance

how  many house numbers were allotted in the  Jalan

Kayu  Constituency between 1st January,  1965, and

30th April, 1967.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, altogether

there were a total of 444 house numbers allotted in

the Jalan Kayu Constituency during the period under

review. Of these, 187 were for permanent houses and

257 for temporary ones.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LOCAL AND FOREIGN TENDERS FOR SUPPLIES TO GOVERNMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance    whether   the   present   practice    in

international   tenders   for   supplies   to   the

Government, whereby the lowest local tender,  which

does  not overbid the lowest foreign tender by more

than 10 per cent, is accepted by the Government  in

preference to the latter, is sufficiently conducive

to  the  promotion of local industries, and  if  he

will consider increasing such preference margin  to

enable  local industries to compete more favourably

with foreign industries which may be in receipt  of

a generous subsidy from their governments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would

like  to express my appreciation to the Member  for

Telok  Blangah  who  has  shown  concern  for   the

survival  of  local industries in  order  that  our

workers  would not lose their jobs as a  result  of

unfair  foreign competition in public  tenders  and

purchases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify that our preferential

purchase  margin  is  not a straightforward  single

percentage figure. The margin varies from 5 to well

over  10  per  cent, depending  upon  a  number  of

factors,  namely, the size of tender contract,  the

cost of local production, the level of import duty,

and  the  elements of subsidy or dumping  price  in

imported goods. By a careful consideration  of  all

these  factors by those in Government and statutory

bodies   responsible  for  public   purchases,   an

adequate preferential margin is then worked out  to

ensure  that  local  manufacturers'  interests  are

promoted  and, at the same time, public bodies  are

safeguarded against unscrupulous manufacturers  who

may  take  advantage  of our preferential  purchase

policy. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



may,  however, be cases whereby the local  cost  of

production  is genuinely high. In such a  case  the

preferential margin may be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government keeps under

constant review its preferential purchasing policy.

The  Economic Development Board is represented when

tenders  of  the  Government as well  as  statutory

bodies are considered. Administratively, Government

departments  as  well as statutory bodies  have  to

submit  monthly returns showing their purchases  of

local   and   foreign  products  to  the   Economic

Development  Board. Such departments and  statutory

bodies are asked to justify in detail purchases  of

foreign   products  when  local   substitutes   are

available.  In this way, Sir, the Government  gives

every opportunity to local industries to supply the

requirements of Government and statutory bodies.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Non-acquisition of Singapore citizenship)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,   in   the  application  of   the   recent

Modification  of Laws (Constitution  of  Singapore)

(No. 2) Order, 1967, to civil servants, what is the

policy of the Government in respect of those  civil

servants who are eligible for Singapore Citizenship

under  the new proviso to clause (1) of Article  57

of the Constitution but refuse to acquire Singapore

Citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a normal

requirement  that  all  candidates  for   permanent

appointment to the public service must be Singapore

citizens   or   persons  eligible   for   Singapore

citizenship   at   the  time  of  application   for

appointment,   although   Malaysian   citizens   of

outstanding qualities are accepted into the  higher

grades of the public service in Divisions I and II.

With    the    relaxation   of   the    residential

qualification for Singapore citizenship through the

recent   Modification  of  Law   (Constitution   of

Singapore)  (No.  2) Order, the Government  expects

all non-Singapore citizens in the public service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



to  apply for Singapore citizenship as soon as they

become eligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is at present no intention to require those

who  refuse to seek Singapore citizenship to  leave

the  service.  This may, however, jeopardise  their

prospects  of  promotion as they  may  have  to  be

excluded   from  some  jobs  which  are   security-sensitive  and would have to be held  by  Singapore

citizens  who  are  required to  be  loyal  to  the

Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ACTION AGAINST DUMPING OF FOREIGN WHEAT-WASTE IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance what steps he proposes to take or has taken

against the dumping of foreign wheat-waste, such as

bran and pollard, in Singapore to protect the local

flour-milling industry in the disposal of its waste

products.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the present

moment  the  Government does not intend  to  impose

restrictions on the import of wheat-waste like bran

and  pollard, as both the two local producers  have

no difficulty at all in selling their entire output

of  such  products  in the local  market.  Although

there  has been a decline in the price of  imported

wheat  bran and pollard, the local producers cannot

be  said  to be seriously affected since  they  are

already earning very healthy profits from the  sale

of wheat flour, their main product.

<div align="center"><b>(Presentation of first issues to dignitaries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether   the  Currency  Board  has  presented   or

proposes  to present the first issues  of  the  new

currency to dignitaries in Singapore, and if so, at

whose cost or expense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a complete set

of  the  new  Singapore notes is worth $1,166.  The

Currency Board has not presented anyone with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



set  of the new notes, nor does it propose to spend

public money in this way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>"WATCH-DOG COMMITTEE" ON CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  in view of complaints made by the  public

of impoliteness, bureaucratic attitude and slowness

in  carrying out their duties by civil servants  in

various Government departments, if he will set up a

"Watch-dog     Committee"    to    make     instant

investigations whenever complaints are received.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

already in existence a Central Complaints Bureau to

deal  with complaints from the public against civil

servants.  This Bureau was established  in  October

1961  for  the purpose of investigating  complaints

and suggestions from members of the public, and  to

inform   complainants  of  the  outcome  of   their

complaints or suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is staffed by a Director, three

supervisors,   five  investigating  officers,   ten

inspectors, and other ancillary staff, and is  able

to deal with complaints fairly promptly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a "Watch-dog Committee",

therefore,  would  serve  no  purpose   except   to

duplicate the functions of the Bureau.

Finance,  in view of the present acute shortage  of

Republic  which  is  impeding the  development  and

growth of tourism in Singapore, whether he is aware

that  the  incentives offered to private developers

for the projects under urban re-development are not

sufficiently attractive for would-be investors, and

if   he   will  also  consider  income  tax  relief

incentives  similar  to those  granted  to  pioneer

industries  in order to encourage the  building  of

more   good  first-class  tourist  hotels  in   the

Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is still too

early to conclude whether the incentives offered to

private  enterprise  for the projects  under  urban

redevelopment   are   or   are   not   sufficiently

attractive.   First  reports  indicate   that   the

projects  have  generated tremendous interest  from

investors locally and abroad. The question  whether

additional  incentives are necessary  to  encourage

the  development  of first-class  hotels  is  being

studied by my Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Before I answer the hon. Member's question, I

have  to  point out that the National  Registration

Office  does  not  keep  a  record  of  figures  of

migration   between  Singapore  and   Malaysia   by

religious  groups. The figures by  ethnic  and  age

groups  are  available from the  1st  April,  1966,

onwards.  The  statistical table* (* Appendix I, cols. 71-2.)

which  I  submit herewith  for  circulation gives

a distribution  by  race  and  age groups of 12,371

Malaysian  identity card   holders  who  have  reported

a  change   to Singapore  addresses during the period

1st  April, 1966, to 31st May, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Statistical Table handed to Clerk]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19670629/19670629-HA-0260071.pdf"">APPENDIX I(Cols 0071-0072)</a><br>



<br><br>Of  the 12,371 persons who moved from West Malaysia

to   Singapore  during  this  period,  9,827   were

Chinese,   1,243   Malays,   1,137   Indians    and

Pakistanis, and 164 of other races. You  will  see

from the table that the biggest number that came to

Singapore was the age group of 16 to 29 years. This

accounted  for  8,098 persons of  whom  6,491  were

Chinese,  973  Malays, 572 Indians and  Pakistanis,

and  62 of other races. We have no doubt that  they

came to Singapore solely for the purpose of looking

for  jobs and better prospects. In addition to  the

12,371  Malaysian  identity card holders  who  have

changed  to  Singapore addresses, there were  1,182

Malaysian identity card holders who have changed to

Singapore   identity  cards.  All  of   them   were

Singapore  citizens. During the  same  period  only

1,673   persons  have  moved  from   Singapore   to

Malaysia.  This  comprised 838  Singapore  identity

card holders who have changed to Malaysian identity

cards, and 835 Singapore identity card holders  who

have  changed  to  Malaysian addresses.  The  above

figures   showed  that  there  was  an  immigration

surplus  to Singapore during the period April  1966

to May 1967 of 11,880 persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Malaysian identity card holders who have

reported a change of addresses are not issued  with

Singapore  non-citizen identity cards.  Section  24

(f)  of the National Registration Regulation, 1966,

exempts  persons  holding valid Malaysian  identity

cards  from registering for the Singapore  identity

cards. These people are, therefore, not issued with

Singapore  non-citizen identity  cards.  They  are,

however, required to report to the Commissioner  of

National  Registration  their  place  of  residence

within  40  days of their arrival in Singapore  and

for   every  subsequent  change  of  residence   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) During the period of re-registration of the

population  from  5th May, 1966, to  31st  January,

1967, non-citizens who are permanent residents  and

who  are  in  possession of  valid  identity  cards

issued  or deemed to be issued under the provisions

of the Registry of Persons Ordinance, 1955, have to

apply   to   be  reregistered  under  the  National

Registration  Act, 1965. These persons  are  issued

with  the  new  non-citizen plastic laminated  blue

identity cards. Up to the 28th June, 1967,  156,665

non-citizen identity cards have been issued.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr S. Rajoo</b> asked the Minister for Culture

and   Social  Affairs  (a)  whether  there  is  any

what  was  the cost in local currency per rupee  of

the Indian price for purchases made in Singapore of

Tamil  books  published in India before devaluation

of  the  Indian rupee and what is the present  such

cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Sir, there is some difficulty in obtaining Chinese,

Malay  and  Tamil books as not many Chinese,  Malay

and  Tamil  books  are published annually  compared

with  English  books. So selection is  limited  and

some   subjects  are  not  well  represented,   for

example,     science    and     technology.     Few

bibliographies,  book lists, catalogues  and  other

buying  aids  are  available.  Some  Chinese  books

published  in  China do not conform  to  our  local

requirements.  During the Indonesian  confrontation

it   was   not   possible  to   obtain   Indonesian

publications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor physical quality of the books, for example,

paper,  ink, binding and illustrations, means  that

books in these languages do not last very long even

when  rebound  and have to be frequently  replaced.

Such  books  are purchased from local and  overseas

booksellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the rate between the local dollar

and  the rupee before the devaluation of the Indian

rupee, the cost of Tamil books was 80 cents to  one

rupee  and  the  present rate is 70  cents  to  one

rupee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it true that the

Ministry of Culture depends on a certain individual

by the name of Jeyadawat to get Tamil books for the

National Library?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, that is not true. The

Ministry of Culture is not dependent on anybody. In

fact, we have a list of agents and publishers  and,

depending  on  the availability of  catalogues  and

bibliographies, we order the books as we  deem  fit

from whichever source available.

Member  that  consideration is being given  to  the

planting  of shrubs and flowering plants along  our

roads  and at roundabouts to enhance the appearance

boxes  were  placed  on  the  road  dividers  along

planting    of    flowers,    shrubs,    such    as

bougainvillaea, on traffic islands,  road  dividers

and  other  roundabout open  spaces  all  over  the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total cost

$271,000.  The  canal extends from Tampines  Circus

along  Tampines  Road  to the  Bridge  at  the  7th

milestone  and is about 3,165 feet long. Along  the

first  800 feet from Tampines Circus to Jalan  Hock

Chye  junction where the adjacent lands are  highly

developed  and pedestrians numerous, two horizontal

rails  will  be provided as protective barriers  on

both  sides  of the canal. Along the  rest  of  the

canal   down  stream  from  Jalan  Hock  Chye,   no

protective  barriers  will be  provided  since  the

lands  being drained are little developed and there

is  an  existing side table which is  fairly  wide.

year.

<div align="center"><b>FLOODED AREAS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for, and preventive measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development  if  he  can  state  the

reasons  for the recent floods in areas which  were

not  subject  to floods some years back,  and  what

steps will be taken to prevent further flooding  in

such areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The main reason for the widespread

recent flooding in areas which were not subject  to

floods some years back was the exceptionally  heavy

rainfall.  About 8.4 inches of rain  were  recorded

over  a  period of 24 hours on the 11th of  January

this  year. This was followed by 6.4 inches of rain

over  a period of six hours on the next day. Again,

about  7.4 inches of rain fell over a period of  24

hours  on  the  17th of February this  year.  These

figures  exceed the maximum rainfall  of  not  more

than  4  inches per day recorded in Singapore  ever

since   1931.  This  exceptionally  heavy  rainfall

coincided with high tide and caused the floods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons for the flooding were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlet drains at Bukit Timah Canal, Sungei

Whampoa,  Sungei  Kallang, Geylang  Serai  and  New

Bridge  Road/South Bridge Road areas are inadequate

to serve the catchment runoff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously many low-lying areas and vacant lands

served  as  ponding  and storage  areas  for  heavy

rainfall.  But  these areas have  been  filled  and

developed,  and  thus  cause greater  run-off  into

streams and drains which become inadequate to  cope

with this additional discharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the densely populated areas, rubbish and other

waste  materials  are dumped indiscriminately  into

the  drains, thus preventing the free flow of water

especially in covered drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures have already been taken to alleviate the

flooding in Bukit Timah, Sungei Whampoa and  Sungei

Kallang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



catchments by (1) the Bukit Timah flood alleviation

scheme, Phase 1; (2) the Sungei Whampoa improvement

scheme;  and  (3)  the  Sungei Kallang  improvement

scheme.  Work  on all three schemes is  already  in

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New measures to alleviate flooding are being

planned  for  1968  in  the  Boon  Tat  Street  and

Alexandra   Canal  catchments.  The  Public   Works

Department  has had a drainage scheme to  alleviate

flooding in Geylang Serai since 1960, but  has  not

been able to implement it because of squatters. The

Ministry  of Health and the Public Works Department

are  together taking action to remove the  concrete

slabs  covering some drains in the  city  areas  to

prevent   these  drains  from  being  choked   with

rubbish.

officer in the Administrative Service, who has just

left  the  Singapore Civil Service, had  previously

resigned on two occasions. First, in 1961  when  he

was  persuaded to stay in the service, and, second,

in  1962  when he changed his mind after  tendering

his resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1966, he was invited to appear before

the  Public  Service Commission for  promotion.  He

was, however, then holidaying in the United Kingdom

and   did   not   attend  the  interview.   Special

arrangements  were made subsequently  to  interview

him  on  his  return from the United  Kingdom.  The

Commission  found  Mr  Leembruggen  suitable   for

promotion  from Superscale Grade `G'  to  Permanent

Secretary, Superscale Grade `C' -a double promotion.

However, he was willing to accept this promotion on

condition  he  was placed senior to  certain  other

Permanent Secretaries who had been promoted  before

him.  This was an unacceptable condition  as  there

was  no  provision in Establishment rules to  allow

officers  to upset seniority in pursuit of personal

feuds  and  rivalries with fellow  officers.  As  a

result,  Mr Leembruggen turned down the  offer  of

promotion  and asked to be removed from his  acting

transferred as Registrar of Vehicles, a  Grade  `G'

post. He has now resigned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a

Bill  intituled  "An  Act  to  amend  the  Criminal

Procedure   Code  (Chapter  132  of   the   Revised

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill that is now before the House has been

introduced  by Government in order to  bring  about

certain  amendments  to  the  provisions   of   the

Criminal Procedure Code relating to bail. As in all

countries that have inherited their systems of  law

and criminal justice from the English legal system,

an accused person is presumed innocent until he has

been  convicted of the offence with  which  he  has

been  charged. From this fundamental precept, there

follows the equally fundamental rule which  can  be

regarded  as  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  every

administration  that practises  democracy,  namely,

the  right  to  bail  which is  accorded  to  every

accused   person   awaiting  trial.   And   so   in

constitutional laws governing the procedure in  all

criminal  trials, we find rules ensuring the  offer

of  bail to every accused person who stands charged

with  an offence. However, as hon. Members  of  the

House   will   appreciate,  all  these  fundamental

precepts would be made a mockery of if they were to

be   applied   as  absolute  rules  unbending   and

regardless   of   circumstances,   variations,   or

situations that must occur in any given  case.  And

so  even in the Criminal Procedure Code as  it  now

stands,  there are exceptions where  bail  must  be

refused altogether - for example, in cases of  murder

and treason and such like offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again there are cases where the offer of bail is

not as of right but at the discretion of the court,

and,  lastly,  a  third  category  comprising   the

majority of offences in which bail is offered as of

right to accused persons pending trial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



One  could therefore say that as a general rule our

Criminal  Procedure  Code  requires  that  bail  be

offered  as  of right to the alleged criminal.  And

this  is  even  so  in regard to  offences  against

public  tranquillity  which  are  grouped  together

under  Chapter VIII of Schedule A to the Code.  All

such  offences  like rioting and unlawful  assembly

are  bailable  as of right. This, in effect,  means

that  the  accused  person must  be  offered  bail,

irrespective  of  the difficulties  that  might  be

faced by the prosecution in their efforts to get up

their  case by reason of the accused being let  out

free  and  irrespective of the number of times  the

accused person continues to commit the same offence

whilst awaiting trial for the offence with which he

has been charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the last few months of rioting

and  destruction of public and private property  in

the  Republic  has emphasised the  inadequacies  of

certain  of the present provisions in our rules  of

procedure requiring the offer of bail as of  right.

Persons  charged under section 144 for  joining  an

unlawful  assembly armed with deadly weapons  must,

in  accordance with our present rules of procedure,

be offered bail as of right. Again, persons charged

under  section 145 for joining or continuing in  an

unlawful   assembly,  knowing  that  it  has   been

commanded  to disperse, are likewise to be  offered

bail.  The  offer of bail is again  obligatory  and

must  be  made to persons charged with  rioting  or

rioting  armed with deadly weapons or with offences

committed  by one of their number whilst they  form

part of an unlawful assembly, or hiring or engaging

or  employing persons to take part in  an  unlawful

assembly.  Again,  persons who  knowingly  join  or

continue  in  an assembly of five or  more  persons

after  it  has  been  commanded  to  disperse,  are

treated  in exactly the same way as persons charged

with assaulting or obstructing public servants when

suppressing a riot. Such persons under the existing

law  will have to be offered bail even though there

is  the  likelihood  that they  would  continue  to

commit  the  same  offences whilst awaiting  trial.

Persons who wantonly give provocation with intent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



to  cause a riot, are entitled as of right to bail,

even  if a riot ensues, and no amount of objections

on  the  part  of the law enforcement officers  can

confer upon the court the right to refuse bail. All

those  accused  of  such  offences  which  militate

against a well-ordered society are bailable and  to

the extent of denying even the courts who are given

the authority and jurisdiction to decide upon their

guilt  or otherwise, the right to consider  whether

or not in the particular circumstances in any given

case, bail should be refused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever since the Barisan Sosialis decided to

carry out their struggle outside Parliament and  to

abjure the constitutional process, Communist  Front

members have mounted a campaign to disrupt law  and

order   in  our  society  as  evidenced  by   their

demonstrations  in  the streets  and  their  wanton

destruction  of  both public and private  property.

The   Government  cannot  afford  to  ignore   this

organised  threat to the public peace,  and  recent

events have emphasised the need to tighten our laws

in  respect  of bail. The Police have  evidence  to

show  that those who have been charged with rioting

and destruction of property have, after their being

charged in court and let out on bail, gone back  to

commit  the  very same crimes for  which  they  had

already been charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government owes a duty to the people of

Singapore  to  ensure that such  lawless  gangs  of

hooligans,  whatever their ideologies and  whatever

their  political persuasions may be, should not  be

allowed to take advantage of the liberalism of  our

democratic system to undermine democracy itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These present rules which were devised during an

era  of  comparative peace and quiet  must  not  be

allowed  to be abused by those who seek to  destroy

the  very  basis  and fabric of our society  whilst

sheltering under the benefit of the very laws  they

so flagrantly flout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in this Bill have been designed to

correct  these  apparent defects in our  procedural

laws.  The  amendments contained in this Bill  will

therefore make the offences I have mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



earlier non-bailable. And I wish to make  it

clear  that  this  does not mean  that  bail  would

automatically be refused to accused persons charged

with offences against the public tranquillity. This

will  merely mean that the courts will now be given

a  discretion to allow or to refuse bail  according

to  the  circumstances of each case. The result  of

these  amendments  would be,  in  other  words,  to

confer  upon the court jurisdiction to refuse  bail

in  respect  of these offences when heretofore  the

offer  of  bail  was obligatory and  no  amount  of

objections  on  the  part of the prosecution  would

make any difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the terms

"bailable" and "non-bailable" have acquired special

technical   meanings   in  our   laws   and   these

specialised meanings have been derived  from  those

basic  fundamental precepts that I have  enunciated

at  the  beginning  of  my  speech  to  the  House.

Offences that are termed "bailable" are those where

the general rule is that an accused person must  be

offered  bail. And offences that are  termed  "non-bailable" merely mean that those charged with these

offences  are still entitled to apply for bail  but

each   and  every  application  will  have  to   be

considered  according to its merits. In  regard  to

non-bailable offences, if having regard to all  the

circumstances of the case the court arrives at  the

conclusion  that the interests of the community  at

large  must  prevail over those of the  individual,

then   it  may  refuse  bail  in  respect  of  such

offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is always

reluctant  to  take any Bill on  a  Certificate  of

Urgency  through  three Readings in  one  day.  But

yesterday's disgraceful events outside and inside a

Magistrate's Court in Singapore are without a doubt

very  good  reasons  for taking this  Bill  through

three  stages  today. Some of those  who  had  been

given bail and had under the terms of their bail to

appear  before  the Court yesterday misbehaved  not

only  outside but, judging by mere reports  in  the

newspapers, inside the Court as well. They  behaved

in  a  manner  unheard of in  the  history  of  our

Courts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Barker, can I have an assurance

that  their  behaviour  is not  the  subject  of  a

charge?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am just finishing, Sir,I was going

to    say   that   meanwhile   investigations   are

proceeding, and I wish to make no further  comments

at this stage on what transpired except that surely

any Court in such circumstances should be given  at

least the discretion to refuse bail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, touching on the speech made  by  the

Minister for Law and on the Bill introduced by him,

I  would  like to express my full support for  both

his speech and the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our newly independent country there have been

many  incidents which would justify the passing  of

this  kind of law. The original purpose of the  law

is  not  to  ask people to commit any offences  and

then  to bind them by the stipulations of the  law.

The law is meant only to prevent the commission  of

any   offences  by  anyone  who  disregards  common

interests  or  the security of the  nation.  So  in

passing the law, the preventive side should also be

emphasised.  But in the existing law,  namely,  the

Criminal   Procedure  Code,   there   are   certain

loopholes which any intending offender may  use  to

commit   certain  offences,  and  when   they   are

prosecuted in Court they can seek the provisions of

the  law  to get bail, and thus be free  to  commit

further offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this provision of the right of bail would

benefit them by giving them another opportunity  to

commit  further  offences. The  time  allowed  them

outside  the Court before trial is used by them  to

commit  further  offences  and  to  jeopardise  the

interests of the public. From this we can see  that

more  and  more people will be encouraged  to  take

advantage of the loopholes in the existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our country is not a Communist country, we

cannot  see the type of mass open trial  of  people

such as that prevailing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



in  Communist countries. But we  can  see

incidents where people have committed various types

of  offences  And  if such people were  brought  to

Court,  there would be a scene which would  not  be

nice to look at. On such an occasion the law may be

at a loss to deal with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in legislating we must also pay attention to

further aspects relating to the protection  of  the

people.  Some people may think that the  result  of

the  trial may not be of any significance to  them.

As  long as these offenders can be bailed out, they

will  continue to commit offences as before. So  if

we  were  to  retain  the old  provisions  of  the

Criminal  Procedure Code without any amendment,  we

would be encouraging such people and not protecting

the  people  as a whole. And the law would  not  be

able to meet our obligation to protect the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see that most of these offenders are

still  young.  Our present younger  generation  are

growing  up and receiving education, and  they  are

subject to various influences. In introducing  this

amendment  Bill,  we  should  bear  in   mind   the

magnanimity  of the law, because we know  that  the

law  is  meant to protect our people and not really

to  punish the offenders only. If we do not direct

our  law  to a specific field, then we may allow  a

situation to develop when we may have to deal  with

one  case  on  one  day and on  another  day  those

convicted may want to create more disturbances  and

commit  more  serious crimes, if these  people  are

emotional,  they may want to burn down a  community

centre  without any regard to whether or not  there

are  any  parents or children inside the  building.

Furthermore, these people have no regard  for  such

inanimate  objects as traffic lights and  community

centres which are made from materials. So if  these

inanimate  objects  can  be  destroyed,  then,   of

course,  living  objects can also be  destroyed  by

them.  If we do not promptly take action to correct

the  present situation which is worsening, then  in

future  we may be at a loss to deal with even  more

serious  offences. We should be alert to all  such

possibilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Criminal Procedure Code needs some

amendment,  such  as  what our  Minister  has  just

proposed.  This  amendment  is  directed   at   the

interests  of  the people of Singapore  and  should

receive  their full support. They should understand

the  motives  and  purpose of this amendment  Bill.

Maybe  it  would cause unhappiness to some  people,

because their potential activities might be  curbed

thereby.  But  I believe that all patriotic  people

should sincerely accept this amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support it.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we all know that the  anti-national

elements in our Republic are abusing the democratic

system  and  that they have been discarded  by  the

people in general. Mr Speaker, these anti-national

elements are committing political suicide. They are

on  the  brink of bankruptcy and are without proper

leadership. They are now in despair and have almost

become  desperadoes. So they resort to violence  in

order  to achieve their aims. They behave like  mad

dogs  barking at and biting people in the  streets.

Their behaviour causes great distress to the people

who think that they are really pathetic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, admittedly in a country which

practises parliamentary democracy, personal liberty

is  of  great  value. The rights of the  individual

must  be respected. We all concede this point.  But

we  must  also  realise that personal  liberty  and

personal rights must not go against the interest of

the  social  order and the national  security.  Our

people have the right of freedom, freedom of speech

and  freedom  of thought without interference.  But

all  these  freedoms do not mean that we can  allow

the  anti-national elements to create chaos.  These

are   not   absolute  freedoms,  but  are  freedoms

relative  to the national interest. So we must  not

allow  these ill-behaved anti-national elements  to

create  collective  violence  and  commit  acts  of

hooliganism in the Republic of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past few months various

incidents have shown beyond all doubt that a  small

minority of anti-national elements have some  plans

which  they intend to carry out stage by  stage  in

order  to  cause  damage and create  chaos  in  our

society.  They are causing great damage  to  public

property  which is paid for at the expense  of  the

rate-payers  and the general public. They  have  no

regard for public property. They carry on their so-called struggle outside Parliament. Mr Speaker, we

also  know  that  in  many  constituencies  in  our

Republic  there are certain remote areas which  are

quite  favourable  for  anti-national  elements  to

carry  out  their nefarious activities.  It  is  in

these areas that their activities are rife. They go

on   a  rampage  in  these  places,  resorting   to

violence, hooliganism and even sometimes committing

acts  of  robbery.  Mr  Speaker,  under  cover  of

darkness, these people cause great damage  to  public property by using axes and other weapons. These

happen  in out-of-the-way places and away from  the

arm  of  the  law. We know that the people  in  the

rural areas are quite appreciative of the value  of

the   recreational  opportunities  given  to   them

through the community centres. They all make use of

the   services  provided  by  these  centres.  But,

unfortunately,  it is often these areas  where  the

anti-national  elements  are  active.  They  damage

telephone posts, television sets, tables and chairs

and  other property in the community centres. Their

irrational  and  barbarous acts  have  aroused  the

indignation of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, Mr Speaker, the people by

themselves are quite helpless and so action must be

taken to curb the activities of these anti-national

elements.  Their  violence must he  restricted  and

confined and, if possible, prevented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the law in Singapore is inadequate

to  deal  with them, if no preventive measures  are

available  under the existing law, then  I  believe

the  situation will be further exploited  by  these

anti-national  elements.  Their  violence  will  be

further intensified because of the loopholes in our

laws.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are aware that recently there have

been  frequent occurrences involving  young  people

who  have  been misguided and misled by  the  anti-national  elements and they have somewhat  imitated

the  cultural revolution that is going  on  in  Red

China  now.  Carrying red flags, they rampaged  all

over the streets of Singapore, shouting slogans and

causing damage everywhere. In addition, they caused

traffic  jams  and great damage to traffic  lights.

They  have  also damaged the property of people  by

burning vehicles in the streets. All this disregard

for  the rule of law and the interest of the public

should  never  be condoned or connived  at.  Strict

action must be taken to deal with such misbehaviour

and  violence. Otherwise Singapore will  become  an

anarchic  State and representative government  will

have   failed  in  its  duty  towards  the  people.

Therefore,  as  a representative Government  having

the   mandate   of   the  people,   we   have   the

responsibility - a great responsibility, indeed, Mr

Speaker  - to ensure that there is social order  and

happiness among our people. In other words, we must

take  all  possible action to protect  the  people,

their  property  and their lives from  these  anti-national  elements.  This is our  solemn  duty.  In

order  that  there is peace in our country  and  to

ensure  that  the people of Singapore are  able  to

continue their normal way of life, I fully  support

this  amendment Bill. I believe it will go  a  long

way  towards preventing further damage and violence

by  the  anti-national elements. They will  not  be

able to stay at large under the protective cover of

bail  to  carry out further damage and create  more

chaos in our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of this small island Republic of

Singapore  is only 225 square miles. It  is  not  a

place   for  those  who  know  only  how  to  shout

Communist  slogans. Our new Republic  wants  to  go

forward  and  become  viable.  We  are  taking  all

possible  action  to develop our country  - building

multi-storey  flats  and  schools,  improving   the

traffic system and erecting more traffic lights - so

as to enhance our standard of living. So we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



cannot  allow  these  hooligans  and  anti-national

elements to put a spoke in our wheel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, let me reiterate my full

support for this amendment Bill.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on those of us who  have  made  the

Republic  of Singapore their Republic and who  have

no cause to come to any headlong collision with the

law,  this Bill, which seeks to amend the  Criminal

Procedure  Code, will have no effect. To those  who

are  responsible  for the maintenance  of  law  and

order,  and  the  Government in  particular,  these

changes  appear to be necessary, if only to  ensure

that all of us who claim the protection of the  law

may  not he deprived of this right. The law  as  it

now  stands  has not been amended for a  very  long

time.  But  what  has  been  provided  for  in  the

Criminal  Procedure Code has during the  course  of

the   last  few  weeks  been  found  to  be   quite

inadequate.  It  would  appear  that  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code,  as it is, lays down  the  general

rule  that  there must be an offer of bail  to  all

persons  charged with any criminal offence for  the

period  that  such  person is awaiting  trial.  The

right of bail always exists, provided the court  is

satisfied   that  sufficient  guarantees   can   be

provided  to  ensure the appearance of the  accused

person in court on the day of his trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, any person charged with a criminal

offence is given bail. In this respect, not all the

provisions in the law are altered. The only changes

contemplated  lie in regard to the courts  who  can

now refuse bail if they are satisfied, for example,

that  the  accused  is  likely  to  interfere  with

evidence or with witnesses for the prosecution,  or

that  he  is  likely to commit the  same  or  other

criminal offences during the period he is on  bail.

The  need to amend the provisions relating to  bail

in respect of these offences, which after all have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



been  devised to ensure that public peace and order

is  maintained,  cannot  be  overemphasised.  These

changes  in the law, as far as I can see,  make  no

radical  departure  from the  generally  recognised

principles of fair trial and equal protection under

the  law.  A man charged is still presumed innocent

if  he  is allowed bail. There are people who  have

been charged and who, during the period they are on

bail  and before their trial, are likely to  commit

the  same  offence which will disturb public  peace

and  destroy public property. As an example, I read

in today's Straits Times an incident which occurred

yesterday. Persons who were on bail damaged  public

property to the extent that the magistrate, who was

trying  them, was unable `to do anything  good  for

the Republic so that law and order may prevail.  If

I  were  the  magistrate yesterday,  I  would  have

pressed the button and called for the Reserve  Unit

to   arrest  them  and  charge  them  again.   But,

unfortunately, I was not the magistrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the judicial authority must he satisfied that

if  bail is granted, the accused will not interfere

with  evidence  nor  with  the  witnesses  for  the

prosecution, and that he will not commit a  further

criminal  offence.  The results achieved  by  these

amendments should not in any way prejudice  any  of

the  democratic principles of the rule of law  that

one  finds in all the declarations on human  rights

and   criminal  procedure  codes.  The  fundamental

rights  of  the individual under the law should  be

safeguarded as always. So we must not think only of

those who offend the law and forget about the  rest

of  our  people who are law-abiding and who have  a

right  to  claim the protection of  the  law.  This

aspect  of  the matter will no doubt be taken  into

consideration by the court in deciding  whether  to

grant  bail or not. The court is merely  given  the

discretion  to  allow  or to refuse  bail.  As  one

concerned  with  the liberty of the  individual  as

well  as the security of the Republic, and  as  one

who  is desirous of seeing that the rule of law  is

not defeated by its very provisions on procedure, I

would  not hesitate to give my wholehearted support

for  these  changes in the law. In my  view,  these

changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



are  necessary and appear to be a fair  and  proper

manner of achieving what must be the desired object

of   a   well  administered  country,  namely,   an

effective  means  of ensuring that  law  and  order

prevails and that the well-being of its citizens is

in no way impaired.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  I  fully support the Criminal Procedure  Code

(Amendment) Bill. In the present circumstances  and

for  the  sake of respecting our national  dignity,

public   interest,  political  security,   economic

prosperity and social order, and in order to  allow

our two million people to live in peace, I feel  it

is necessary to amend the present law. We know that

the  purpose of the amendment Bill is not to  allow

those who carry out anti-national, destructive  and

sabotage activities to avail themselves of the bail

provided in the law and come out free and  be  able

to  carry  out such activities again. The  Minister

has said that some people on bail have continued to

commit   the  same  offence  for  which  they   are

prosecuted.  From  this  we  can  see  that  it  is

necessary  to  amend the present law  relating  to

bail  granted  to  a person who  is  accused  of  a

certain offence. So this is a pressing problem  for

us.  Ours  is a responsible government which  looks

after  the  interests of the people.  We  have  the

trust  laid  upon us by the general masses  and  we

should  try our best to rule the country and  serve

the people well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the anti-national Barisan Sosialis have

carried  out  a series of riots and demonstrations,

causing  social disorder with a view to  disrupting

the  peace  and  good  order  of  our  society  and

hindering  our economic and industrial development.

They  hope  by such acts to destroy our  democratic

system  and create a situation in which our economy

will  become  bankrupt  and  the  people  will   be

dissatisfied, so that the time may be ripe for them

to engage in their so-called revolution. Sir, their

actions are obviously very sinister. They hope that

there  would be disorder and general chaos  in  the

Republic, and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



want  to put a stop to the national security, peace

and  prosperity which we are now enjoying. In fact,

the  peace, prosperity and happiness of our country

has been the result of the arduous work and efforts

of  our  Government, with the co-operation  of  the

people.  We  can  say that Singapore  is  the  most

peaceful and prosperous country in South-East Asia.

In  order  to preserve the national prosperity  and

peace   and  interests  of  the  people,  we,   the

Government, have a responsibility to see that  such

anti-national elements cannot carry on  with  their

activities,  such  as  damaging  public   property,

breaking  of street lights, upsetting rubbish  bins

and   various   other  acts.  Such   barbaric   and

uncultured acts have caused great indignation among

the  people.  Therefore, today  before  this  House

there  is  this Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)

Bill  under a Certificate of Urgency. I  feel  that

all  the  people  expect this  Bill  to  be  passed

quickly in order to deal with the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the families of those who have been

prosecuted for their recent offences, I  feel  that

they   would  also  welcome  this  amendment   Bill

because, as parents or as relatives of such people,

their  children  may become useful and  law-abiding

citizens  and  live  in the  proper  way  with  the

passing of this Bill into law.

<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill because it will enable such

offenders  to repent and turn over a new  leaf.  In

fact,  those  people who are misled by the  Barisan

Sosialis   into  participating  in  various   anti-national  activities are young  people.  They  have

been  excited and fooled by the Barisan's high tune

and  revolutionary slogans. They go  out  into  the

streets   to   carry  out  revolutionary   actions,

chanting slogans and yelling abusive language.  But

when  the  police patrol cars arrive,  these  brave

revolutionaries  do  not carry out  their  struggle

constitutionally but they throw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



stones  at the police and disperse. From all  this,

we  can  see that most of the members of  this  so-called  voluntary  vanguard have been  fooled  into

taking  part in such illegal activities.  But  when

they  meet the police, they take to their heels  as

quickly as possible!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have announced that they will

carry  on  with the struggle outside Parliament  by

instituting  what they call the "Anti  Three  Harms

Campaign"  in  order to overthrow  the  P.A.P, and

establish  their own regime. But what is surprising

is that their engineered demonstrations and parades

have  never  been  successful. In fact,  they  have

roused  the  indignation  of  the  masses  because,

firstly,  they  destroy  community  centres   which

render  good  services  to the  people,  especially

those  in the rural areas; secondly, they  beat  up

teachers,  and this is a very great moral  offence;

thirdly, they smash up traffic lights, and this  is

detrimental to public interest; and, fourthly, they

overturn  rubbish  bins,  and  this  is  a   health

offence.  So when they say that they are committing

rebellious acts against the Government,  they  are,

in  fact, carrying out ridiculous activities  which

are detrimental to the people. All activities which

are  against law and order are activities which are

detrimental to the interest and well-being  of  the

people.  The Barisan Sosialis will only succeed  in

isolating themselves from the people. I, therefore,

hope  that  the  policy  planners  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  will  think  twice  about  their  present

policies   and  check  themselves  in   time   from

committing suicide by such actions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to give my full support to this amendment Bill

moved   by   the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that this Bill should have been

tabled  today.  It  should have  been  tabled  much

earlier when anti-national elements went on a  wild

rampage to destroy public property and caused  fear

and insecurity to the people of the Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the agitators behind such wild mobs are

cowards.  They remain behind plotting and  prodding

young  innocent school children to agitate  against

all  sorts  of amendments introduced in Parliament.

Actually,  it  is a disguise. Some  time  ago,  the

Barisan  Sosialis decided to take up the  political

struggle  outside Parliament when  they  called  on

their  Members to resign. To me, this  is  an  evil

design.  They  hope to build up  an  atmosphere  on

which  the  pro-Communists and Communists  hope  to

capitalise  and  ultimately  seize  power   on   an

unconstitutional basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the riots that have taken place over the

last  few  months, one can easily  see  that  young

innocent  school children are being used  - children

who have too low a mentality to distinguish between

right  and wrong and between what can be  done  and

what cannot be done. One can also see that the real

persons  behind such acts of vandalism should  come

forward  and  not  stay behind and  merely  act  as

operators. I brand these persons as sheer  cowards.

They try to provoke our police. I was told that  in

the  incident yesterday outside the premises of the

Fourth Magistrate's Court our police officers  were

not  only  jeered at but were also kicked with  the

aim  of provoking them into stronger action against

innocent  children who were being made  use  of  by

sinister people behind the scenes. These people had

hoped  that our law enforcement officers  would  be

provoked into losing their patience and turning  on

the  children. But far from it, I am glad  to  note

that   these   officers,  in   spite   of   extreme

provocation, acted with great restraint and did not

lose  their  nerve. If the agitators had  succeeded

and  a  good number of young innocent students  had

been  injured in yesterday's incident - and this  is

what  they had wanted to see - they would have  said

to foreign correspondents and cameramen, "There you

are,  the P.A.P. Government is bad and dictatorial.

It  uses  strong-armed tactics  on  these  innocent

children  who are fighting for a good cause."  Such

techniques  are  not uncommon, and  if  I  remember

well, there were similar incidents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



a couple of years ago when the Chinese system

of  education  was  slightly modified.  Our  former

Minister for Education, who is now the Minister for

Health,  was besieged in his own office by students

who had prevented him from coming to this Assembly.

But  we  were  cool and patient in the handling  of

such students and in the end justice prevailed  and

we were proved to be right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, students have been used by the pro-Communists and Communists to further their ends.

Their  main  objective is to cause incidents  which

they   hope   will  culminate  in  a  revolutionary

atmosphere so that they can achieve their  ends.  I

do  not think that the people of Singapore are with

them,  Far from it - many have come to me and asked,

"What  are  these  chaps doing?  They  behave  like

hooligans. Why does the Government not deal  firmly

with them? They are giving us a bad name. Ours is a

democratic country where the practice of  democracy

is  still sustained." I think the agitators will do

well  to  get  it into their thick heads  that  the

P.A.P.   Government  will  never  wilt  under   any

provocation whatsoever. There must be law and order

in  our society. Lawlessness will not be tolerated,

and  until  these people get this into  them,  they

should  think twice. For that reason, I would  urge

that further amendments should be introduced so  as

to  empower the Government to deal more firmly with

such agitators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the  Criminal Procedure  Code  (Amendment)

Bill  which  seeks  to deprive offenders  of  their

automatic right to bail when arrested for  unlawful

gathering and for offences of rioting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House today is not discussing the theory of

liberty  or  the abstract rights of the individual.

We  are facing a situation in which a small band of

political  bankrupts has openly  declared  that  it

will  take  to  street  violence  as  its  form  of

struggle, the irony of which is that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



supposed  to  be struggling for democracy.  In  the

name  of democracy, are we supposed to allow social

wreckers to stage lightning attacks on lamp  posts,

traffic  lights, bus stands and community  centres?

And  then  when  the police comes they  immediately

seek the shelter of anonymity in the innocent pasar

malam  crowd  of  shoppers. Are we  to  allow  such

social perverts the right to automatic bail, in the

legal  term, "bailable as of right", so  that  they

can  be  released for further hit-and-hide ventures

or to terrorise witnesses from giving evidence? Our

clear  duty today is to see that our people can  go

about without fear, that our facilities erected  at

public  expense are not damaged, and that  our  law

enforcing officers are not handcuffed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past month, owing to the prevailing

uncertain  conditions existing in certain countries

in  this region, substantial investment funds  have

flown from there. Some of the funds landed here. In

my role as a businessman and a manufacturer, I have

come  across  many instances where  these  overseas

funds  are  seeking investments  here.  This  House

knows  only  too well that we need  every  cent  of

those funds for investment, if we are to solve  our

unemployment problem. Unfortunately,  this  is  not

sufficiently realised by those misguided  few  who,

by  committing such acts, destroy their own chances

of  employment.  To  these misguided  few,  I  say,

please  think carefully; our country,  our  people,

and our Government are doing everything possible to

industrialise   in  order  to   create   more   job

opportunities.  By taking to street  violence,  you

are scaring away foreign investors as well as local

entrepreneurs. This means that there will  be  less

factories which, in turn, means that you may remain

jobless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the present technological

age,  we need anything between $20,000 and $100,000

to  create one job. Massive investments are needed.

Hooliganism  must  stop if we  are  to  retain  and

attract investments. Our duty today is not only  to

preserve law and order but also at the same time to

increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



job  opportunities. The surest way to do so  is  to

diminish the rights of those who violate the rights

of  others. There can be no question of right  when

rights  are  abused by a minority  to  destroy  the

rights  of the majority. I sincerely hope that  the

day  will  not come when we may have to  take  away

completely  the possibility of bail for  those  who

are  bent  on wrecking our society. At the  moment,

the  least  we  can do is to deprive  these  social

wreckers of the automatic right of bail.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  whilst I generally am, not in favour of Bills

being  introduced on a Certificate  of  Urgency,  I

must  support  the  Minister for Law  and  National

Development  in this case. In view of  the  recent

increasing  demonstrations and unlawful  activities

by  anti-nationalist elements, I readily appreciate

that  urgent provisions are required to  deal  with

these agitators and demonstrators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just this morning we read in the newspapers of the

disturbances both outside and inside a Magistrate's

Court.  We:  have  heard in this  House  this  very

afternoon the statement of the Minister of State of

Defence  that  since  January  this  year  unlawful

assemblies and demonstrations have increased  month

by  month.  We  have also heard from  the  Minister

introducing  the Bill that there was evidence  that

some  of the demonstrators charged under the  Penal

Code  while on bail were again committing the  same

offences. And, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my constituency

of  Choa  Chua  Kang, a brand-new community  centre

built by the people in my constituency out of their

own money was tarred and painted on with slogans by

anti-nationalist elements. This lack of respect for

public  property  and for law  and  order  requires

urgent measures to deal with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed in the Bill are nothing

unusual,  Mr Speaker, Sir. In what little  time  I

had,  I  did  a  little  research  and  found  that

originally   under  the  Criminal  Procedure   Code

offences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



under  section  143 of the Penal Code  and  cognate

offences  were  bailable. In 1957,  however,  these

offences   were  made  non-bailable   by   amending

Ordinance  29  of  1957. But in  1960,  these  same

offences  were again made bailable by Ordinance  18

of  1960. Therefore, there is nothing new  in  this

amending  Bill  at all. It is just  a  question  of

making   provisions  to  deal  with   the   special

circumstances  that are obtaining in  Singapore  at

this particular moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also explained to us the legal meaning of "non-bailable". It does not mean that a person so charged under this particular section of the Penal Code cannot get bail at all. It only means that instead of the automatic right to bail the person charged would have to make out a case

for bail. This does not infringe on the fundamental

liberty of the subject and in no way detracts  from

the subject's fundamental right to a fair trial and

equality  before  the  law.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

support the Bill.



<br><br>4.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I stand up

to  support the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)

Bill.  During the past few months there  have  been

incidents    of   rioting,   unlawful   assemblies,

vandalism,    processions,    and    demonstrations

organised  and instigated by the Barisan  Sosialis.

Such  open  defiance  of the  law  by  these  anti-national elements should be stopped at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, the prosperity and survival of

the  nation  depend  very  much  on  the  political

stability and preservation of peace and good order.

Any  good citizen will detest such despicable  acts

of  open  defiance of the law. As is known to  all,

Sir,  the tactics of Communists everywhere  are  to

create  confusion and chaos in a country  and  then

topple  and  take  over the administration  if  the

situation  gets out of hand, The incidents  in  the

Magistrate's Court yesterday will suffice to  prove

their  evil  design,  which was  to  challenge  the

authority  of the magistrate. We should  not  allow

this to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



happen.  We  should  stand firm and  safeguard  the

interest  of our law-abiding citizens by tightening

up  our  existing laws against those  anti-national

elements  who  are up to no good and  who  wish  to

wreck  the  security  of  the  country.  Since  the

boycott   by   the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members   of

Parliament  and their subsequent resignations  from

Parliament,   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have   openly

declared their determination to carry out their so-called struggle in the streets outside Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are Red Guards in the

People's Republic of China, Here in our Republic we

have what I would like to call them in Mandarin Hon

liu  man,  which literally means Red hooligans,  as

they  deserve  to  be  called. These  anti-national

elements  are  now out in the streets  defying  not

only  police orders and obstructing the  duties  of

the   law   officers,  but  also  damaging   public

property.  They  have gone even further  now  -they

damage  even private properties belonging  to  law-abiding  citizens. This is indeed most contemptible

and despicable. Mr Speaker, Sir, this House should

ask  the  Government to take drastic action against

these  anti-national elements and  stamp  them  out

once and for all. Sir, Government action alone will

not  be sufficient. There must be co-operation from

the  public.  There  is much that  the  law-abiding

citizens  can do in helping to put an end  to  this

open  defiance  of the law. The public  should  not

regard this as a matter for the Government to solve

when, in fact, their daily livelihood and interests

are directly involved and their future jeopardised.

Civic  organisations or registered societies should

come out and openly condemn such acts. At least  it

will  have  a deterrent effect in that these  anti-national elements will not think that their lawless

acts have the support of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that our

laws must be respected and not challenged, and that

law and order must be maintained at all costs. Sir,

I give my support to this Bill.

only  voice of protest loud enough to be  heard  in

this  island comes from Members of this House, What

has  happened to our community leaders and the rest

of our good citizens? Are they going to stay silent

and stay in the background in matters of such civic

importance and let a handful of citizens speak  for

them?  Do they not have as much right to this  land

of  ours as the hon. Members of this House? Are our

worthy citizens going to stand on the pavement  and

watch whenever such acts of public misbehaviour and

violence  are  being  carried  out?  Are  they  not

worried  that  these acts of violence might  easily

jeopardise  the  future of our young  Republic?  We

know,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that almost a hundred  per

cent  of  our population disapprove of and  condemn

such  acts  of civic disruption, and I feel  it  is

time that the leaders of our community came out and

joined  with  this House in openly denouncing  such

acts   against  the  public  peace.  I,  therefore,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend section 7 of the Criminal

Justice (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance to  ensure

that there may not be any confusion as to what  the

true intent and purport of that section is. Section

7, as it now stands, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where any application made to any criminal court

by  or  on  behalf  of any person  charged  with  a

scheduled offence in respect of the release on bail

of  such person is opposed by the Public Prosecutor

or  a  Deputy Public Prosecutor the court to  which

such  application is made shall, unless it  is  the

High Court, refer such application for the decision

of  the  High  Court  or a Judge  and,  until  such

decision  has  been  obtained,  shall  remand  such

person in custody.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to amend this section has been brought

about  by a case decided in the High Court in 1955.

The court then held that the words in section 7, as

it  now stands, are not sufficiently clear and that

the Legislature could not have intended to abrogate

the  substantive  right to bail  which  has  to  be

offered where the offence is bailable as of  right,

and that this was so despite the fact that such  an

offence  has  been listed in the  Schedule  to  the

Ordinance. Accordingly, to remove any doubts as  to

the  actual intent of its application and to  allow

the  Prosecutor to remove issues relating  to  bail

from the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts  to

the  High Court in regard to both bailable and non-bailable   offences,  the  amendments   have   been

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this new amendment, section 7 will

apply  notwithstanding the provisions  relating  to

bail that are to be found in the Criminal Procedure

Code.  In  other words, the procedure will prevail,

whatever  the substantive rights may  be.  So  that

whether an offence with which an accused person  is

charged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



is   bailable  or  non-bailable,  once  the  Public

Prosecutor or the Deputy Public Prosecutor  opposes

an  application for bail, the matter will be  taken

up  to the High Court for its decision. Substantive

rights to bail are in no way jeopardised - only  the

forum is changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize that only those offences

that  are  listed in the Schedule to the Ordinance,

and  these  include only certain  offences  in  the

Penal  Code  that have been listed some years  ago,

would  be affected. In short, it does no more  than

seek to amplify the wording of section 7 which  the

High  Court  in 1955 had regarded as insufficiently

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

appointment  of a Deputy Chairman will,  therefore,

increase  the number of Trustees to at least  eight

members  in all. The Deputy Chairman is to  act  as

Chairman  of  the  Trust  in  the  absence  of  the

Chairman. This will facilitate the business of  the

Trust  to  be  conducted when, for  one  reason  or

another, the Chairman is absent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the reduction of the

period of tenure of office of Trustees appointed to

the  National Theatre Trust from six years to three

years, or for such lesser time as the Minister  may

think fit. The reduction of the period of tenure of

Trustees  is  considered  opportune  now  that  the

National  Theatre has been set up. It  is  also  in

line  with the tenure of office of members of other

statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses of the Bill are merely

consequential, amending the term "Malayan"  culture

to  "National"  culture and substituting  the  term

"Parliament" for "Legislative Assembly".

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Ad Hoc Scientific Committee was formed in

February  last  year to advise  the  Government  on

problems of science and technology. During the  one

year  of  its  existence, the Committee  has  given

valuable  advice in different fields. Subcommittees

were  formed to study problems of water utilisation

and  water  pollution,  to  make  an  appraisal  of

available  literature on the  desalination  of  sea

water   in  conjunction  with  the  generation   of

electric  power, and to survey available scientific

and  technical manpower in the State. The Committee

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

made recommendations on the teaching of science  at

pre-University   level,   studied   the   equipment

requirements   of  the  Nutrition  Laboratory   and

Veterinary  Diagnostic Laboratory of the Department

of  Primary  Production,  and  collected  data  for

U.N.E.S.C.O. on research facilities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the Committee during the past

year has revealed that, because of its non-official

status, it was handicapped in carrying out its work

through  lack  of budgetary support and  could  not

have  access  to  confidential official  data.  The

purpose   of   this   Bill  is  to   remedy   these

deficiencies and to give such a scientific advisory

body   official  status.  The  functions   of   the

Scientific Council will be to investigate  problems

of  a technical nature which are of interest to the

Government,   to   report  on   matters   involving

scientific    and   technological   research    and

development,  to  study how industrial  development

can  be  promoted  by  the effective  training  and

utilisation   of   scientific   and   technological

manpower, and to establish official relations  with

other scientific organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern societies it is not cultural values

alone  that  are  the attributes  of  civilisation.

Civilisation  is  now  also  associated  with   the

presence  or absence of those utilities which  make

living  more comfortable and which have  been  made

possible  by technical inventions such as  a  ready

supply  of  electric  power,  a  working  telephone

system, modern sanitation and so on. But all  these

utilities would not be possible if we do  not  have

the  technical  manpower to  organise  or  maintain

them.  We  are fortunate that we have in  Singapore

well   over   2,000   scientists,   engineers   and

technologists.  Of  these,  about  two-thirds   are

practising  their professions in either the  public

or  private sector and the remaining one-third  are

teaching in the schools. In the past this wealth of

talent  has not been as fully utilised as it should

be   nor   has  it  taken  a  leadership  role   in

Singapore's  social  development  because  of   the

absence  of  an organisation which can  co-ordinate

their  activities  or stimulate  them  to  creative

endeavour  in different fields. It is my hope  that

the Science



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Council  and the Singapore Academy of Science  will

be able to fill this vacuum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular image of the scientist is that of an

absent-minded and impractical person lost among his

test-tubes  and other laboratory paraphernalia  and

equally   lost   when  confronted  with   real-life

problems of this work-a-day world. This is an image

which  our  scientists should discard and  take  on

instead the role of a man of action, No doubt there

will be problems of a purely technical nature which

will  require the attention of the back-room  boys,

but  scientists and engineers can be more effective

if   they  can  also  comprehend  the  relationship

between technological innovation and economics  and

develop  a flair for administration. Scientists  by

virtue   of   their  training  in  analytical   and

deductive   processes   can   quickly   grasp   the

essentials  of a problem and understand  its  nexus

with  other problems. Our local scientists can take

heart  that it is this endowment which qualified  a

well-known British professor of anatomy, an  expert

on  monkeys  and  apes, to act as chief  scientific

adviser  to  the  British Secretary  of  State  for

Defence.  Singapore  will not  need  scientists  or

engineers  to  build atom bombs, but we  will  need

them for the many practical problems which face  us

in  our  task  to make this island a viable  State.

With  the concentration of talent that we  have  in

Singapore, we can be assured that our economic  and

social  development can take place in a  purposeful

direction and that we will not arrive at  our  goal

by  a  painful  process of trial and  error  or  by

expensive rule-of-thumb methods.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend section 4 of the Judicial

Committee   Act,   1966,   which   provides    that

applications  for leave to appeal to  the  Judicial

Committee of the Privy Council shall be made to the

Appellate Court within six weeks from the  date  on

which  the decision appealed against was  given  or

within  such further time as may be allowed by  the

Appellate Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rules Committee set up under the provisions of

the Courts of Judicature Act, 1964, considered that

these  provisions under section 4 of  the  Judicial

Committee  Act, 1966, should be amended to  provide

the  normal  period  for leave  to  appeal  to  the

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to be  more

than  six  weeks, as at present provided, which  is

too  short  a  time for practitioners  to  consider

whether to take the matter further on appeal to the

Judicial   Committee,  a  step  which   would   not

ordinarily    be    taken   without    considerable

deliberation. The Committee therefore  recommended,

and  the  Government accepted, that this subsection

be  amended to provide for the period within  which

to  apply  for  leave  to appeal  to  the  Judicial

Committee  of the Privy Council to be three  months

instead. And in cases where complicated issues have

to  be  considered, the parties should not he  tied

down  even to this extended period of three  months

provided  always  they  are  able  to  satisfy  the

Appellate Court to exercise its discretion  in  the

appellant's  favour.  Such an extension  of  period

would,   however,   be  given   only   in   special

circumstances, as has been made clear in the  Bill,

and that above all the Appellate Court considers it

reasonable to do so after taking into consideration

all the circumstances in the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is, in substance, a return to the

position  we  were  in before Malaysia  when  under

section 36, subsection (2)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



of the Courts Ordinance, which  is  now

repealed, leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee

could  be made within six months from the  date  of

the   decision  appealed  against.  It  must,  most

obviously,  have  been felt  when  the  period  was

reduced  to six weeks that the required  period  of

six  months  was  too long and had  the  effect  of

delaying the final prosecution of an appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the United Kingdom Government have been

consulted  on  this  amendment and  they  have  not

expressed  any views to the contrary. Practitioners

in  Singapore who are behind this move to amend the

provisions  of section 4 of the Act have  expressed

their support for this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make two amendments to the

Legal  Profession Act, 1966. These  amendments  are

considered necessary both by the Government and  by

those  most  concerned  with  the  functioning  and

operation   of  this  Act,  namely,  the  Singapore

Advocates and Solicitors Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although subsection (1) of section 82 of the Legal

Profession   Act,  1966,  as  it  now  stands,   is

reasonably  clear in regard to its intent,  it  has

given   rise   to  a  possible  interpretation   of

permitting two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



solicitors  in the same firm acting  for  both  the

vendor  and  the  purchaser  of  property.  It  is,

therefore, considered desirable that the subsection

be  amended in order to remove all possible  doubts

therein. The effect of this new amendment  will  be

to prohibit solicitors in the same firm from acting

separately for both the vendor and the purchaser in

any  one  transaction for the sale and purchase  of

property.  As an interim measure, and in  order  to

enable solicitors who had uncompleted contracts  on

their  hands  at  the  date  of  the  coming   into

operation of the Act to complete the contracts, and

to   save  purchasers  from  having  to  incur  the

additional  cost of employing another solicitor,  a

new  subsection (5) to section 82 of  the  Act  has

been introduced. This provision would take care  of

those  transactions where the contract of sale  was

entered  into  prior to the 11th day  of  February,

1967,  the  day when the provisions to  be  amended

came into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as with most Bills which are

tabled in this House, this Bill was sent in advance

to  the  Singapore Advocates and Solicitors Society

for  their  comments, it is a great pity  that  the

members  of  the Committee of the Society  did  not

take  more  pains to point out the defects  in  the

Act. I am very reluctant to move amendments to  any

Bill  which  has become law only a few months  ago,

and  I hope that in future when we send draft Bills

to  the Society for their comments, they will  take

more pains when looking into the provisions of  the

Bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the present

Bill  seeks to amend only section 82 of  the  Legal

Profession Act on the question of solicitors in the

same firm doing work for both the purchaser and the

vendor in a sale of immovable property developed by

a housing developer under a housing development. If

we  accept the premise - and I do accept the premise - that both vendor and purchaser in a sale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



of   immovable   property  should  be   represented

separately,  I  think  that  this  is  a logical

amendment  to  section 82 of the  Legal  Profession

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Law and National

Development is quite right in saying that  had  the

Bar  Committee, as it was then called,  taken  more

pains over the Legal Profession Bill which was sent

to it for consideration before that Bill was passed

in  December  last year, this amending  Bill  would

probably  not have been necessary. Possibly  as  an

afterthought,  the present Singapore Advocates  and

Solicitors Society had appointed a sub-committee to

review the Legal Profession Act. This sub-committee

reported  some  time  ago and made  suggestions  on

amendments to a great many sections of this Act.  I

am  not too sure whether the present amending  Bill

is  the result of the recommendations of this  sub-committee,  but in its report to the Advocates  and

Solicitors  Society, section 82 was recommended  to

be amended in exactly the same terms. It is a great

pity that other amendments recommended by this sub-committee  had not been taken into account  by  the

Government. The explanation may be that  there  was

no time. The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill was,

in fact, read the First time on the 24th May, 1967,

whereas  the  sub-committee did not report  to  the

Advocates   and  Solicitors  Society  until   quite

recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this sub-committee recommended

various amendments and I wish particularly to  draw

attention  to  sections 54  and  55  of  the  Legal

Profession  Act.  Section  54  provides   for   the

election  of eight members of seven years' standing

and  two members of less than seven years' standing

to the Advocates and Solicitors Society. Section 55

provides   that   members  of  the  Advocates   and

Solicitors  Society  of seven years'  standing  can

only  vote for candidates of similar standing,  and

that  members  of under seven years'  standing  are

similarly  restricted to voting only for candidates

of  under  seven  years' standing.  Section  55  is

particularly unfortunate. It injects an element  of

inequality into an otherwise ancient and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



honourable society where all members are equal  and

are considered as brothers in the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-committee of the Advocates and Solicitors

Society  recommended  that  this  section  be   now

repealed   and  that  there  should  be  only   one

electoral   roll,   and   I   am   glad   of   this

recommendation.   It   is  unfortunate   that   the

Government  has  not seen fit to  incorporate  this

amendment into the present amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54, as I have said, provides for eight

members of seven years' standing as against two  of

less  than seven years' standing. The sub-committee

of   the  Advocates  and  Solicitors  Society   now

recommends that the number of seniors, as  we  call

them, should be reduced to six. This section is not

particularly  a  democratic  section,  seeing  that

members  of  the  Society of seven years'  standing

form  a minority of the legal profession. But apart

from  the fact that it is not quite democratic,  it

gives  the  impression that lawyers  of  less  than

seven  years' standing are not capable of  handling

their own affairs. This does not speak well for the

profession and does not inspire confidence -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, in view of my own

connection  with this piece of legislation  in  its

very early days, I have been very reluctant to call

you  to order. But I am beginning to have a feeling

that  your present speech should have been made  on

the  Bill debated last December. The provisions  to

which  you are now referring are not part  of  this

Bill,  and your comments are irrelevant and out  of

order. You are at liberty now to speak only on  the

clauses in the present Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir. My point is that it is rather unfortunate that

the  Government  does not take this opportunity  to

incorporate   other  amendments  into   the   Legal

Profession  Act  -amendments which have,  in  fact,

been recommended by the sub-committee appointed  by

the  Advocates and Solicitors Society  to  consider

and  make  recommendations on the Legal  Profession

Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept the

premise  that  purchasers  and  vendors  should  be

separately  represented. It is, therefore,  logical

that  this  amendment  should  come  about,  and  I

support it.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me tell

the   hon.  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  that  the

amendments which he proposes and which he says were

recommended by a sub-committee of the Advocates and

Solicitors Society have not reached me. Sir,  if  I

may  speak  briefly in reply to him, this  Act  was

first  read  in this House in December  last  year.

Prior to its introduction, the Bar Committee, as it

then  was, was consulted and, in fact, it  approved

of  all the provisions in this Bill. But apparently

the  Bar  Committee did not, as I had  expected  it

should have, consult its own members. But even  so,

if  any  member of the Bar had any complaint  about

this  Bill,  he  could have raised  his  objections

through  the  hon.  Member for  Choa  Chu  Kang  in

between the First Reading and the Second and  Third

Readings  of the Bill which took place, I  believe,

about  12 to 14 days later. If only members of  the

Bar  read  the  newspapers  to  ascertain  what  is

happening in this House, then their suggestions and

recommendations  will certainly  be  given  careful

consideration in this House. But after the Bill has

been  tabled and taken through its Second and Third

Readings and then enacted as law, it is a  bit  too

late to grumble about the unfairness of the Bill in

respect  of certain provisions. The younger lawyers

are  apparently going against the older lawyers.  I

state  my  position here quite clearly. On  a  Bill

which  deals  with any profession, we must  consult

the   profession,  and  naturally  we  consult  the

committee  in  charge, and it is the duty  of  that

committee  to consult its members. If it does  not,

it  is  time  to change the committee.  But  having

consulted  them  and having got their  support  and

approval  and  having passed the Bill,  I  am  most

reluctant to come to this House again and make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



amendment  after amendment. I agreed to  these  two

amendments  because they are essential.  Any  other

amendment  which is not essential  must  wait.  The

Bill  having been passed, we propose to let it  run

for  a year or maybe more to see how it works.  And

it  is  only  thereafter that we  will  pass  other

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will have the effect of amending section

5  of  the Official Secrets Ordinance (Chapter 84).

Section 5 of the Ordinance makes it an offence  for

any  person  wrongfully to communicate  information

set   out   in  the  section  or  to  retain   such

information in the circumstances mentioned therein.

The amendment brought about by the Bill make it  an

offence  under  this section for  any  person  who,

having  signed  an  undertaking not  to  serve  any

foreign  power  or government on  his  leaving  the

service  of  the Government of Singapore,  acts  in

breach of such undertaking. Any such person who has

signed  an undertaking shall be presumed to  be  in

possession or in control of such information as has

been set out in subsection (1) of section 5 of  the

Ordinance, and to have unlawfully communicated such

information  to a foreign power, thus  contravening

the  provisions of section 5 of the Ordinance  when

he  acts  in breach of the undertaking. It  is  not

only public officers in the Government service who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



may  be required to sign this undertaking; but  any

person  who  has  acquired any such information  or

thing  as is described in subsection (1) of section

5  of  the Official Secrets Ordinance in the course

of  his  work  with  the  Government,  or  for  the

Government,  may  thus  be required  to  give  this

undertaking.  If  anyone is in possession  of  such

information  or  thing and acts in breach  of  this

undertaking not to be employed or to enter into the

service of any foreign power or government, he will

be  presumed  to have communicated such information

or  thing wrongfully and to have acted contrary  to

section 5 of the Ordinance the moment he breaks the

undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is clear. It is to ensure

that  information  or  knowledge  obtained  in  the

course  of  one's  employment  or  service  in  the

Government of Singapore shall not be made use of by

the person who has gained such information or thing

in  the  course of his official functions after  he

has  left  the  Government or its service,  Unusual

though  this provision may appear to be, I am  sure

the  House will agree with me when I say  that  the

necessity  for this law to be in our statute  books

cannot  be  more  emphasised than at  this  present

stage  of our development as an independent nation.

The  Bill does nothing more than provide a  further

means  of ensuring that public security should  not

be  jeopardised by such persons parting  with  such

information or allowing themselves to be  made  use

of by foreign powers or their agencies for purposes

that  may  prove  inimical to the interest  of  our

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Secrets Act is an Act designed to

ensure that the official secrets of the nation  are

not  parted  with for the benefit  of  any  foreign

power.  One  of the ways in which such  information

may  be  passed over to a foreign power is  through

this  avenue  of  disclosure by the State's  former

employees, especially those who have held sensitive

positions  of  trust.  This new  provision,  it  is

hoped,   will  be  effective  in  preventing   such

information  from  getting into the  hands  of  any

foreign power. It is, however, to be noted that not

everyone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



who has served the Government in positions of trust

will   thus  be  affected,  but  only  those  whose

positions  in the Government or in the  service  of

the  Government are such as would allow them access

to   information   or  who  would   have   acquired

information which, in the interest of the  security

of  the  nation, must be protected and kept  within

the State. The undertaking will be in terms as fair

as  the Government can be expected to agree to,  in

that  the period of the inability to work  will  be

confined to foreign powers or governments or  their

agencies, and will be varied according to the  sort

of  appointment the person affected last  held  and

will,  in  all instances, be only for a  reasonable

period of time after he has left the service of the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the case where an undertaking is

signed  and the required permission to work with  a

foreign  government  or  its  agency  refused,  the

Government will on its part offer to the person who

is  thus  prevented from working  for  the  foreign

government or its agency alternative employment  of

a   kind   that  will  not  be  to  that   person's

disadvantage   in   so  far  as   it   relates   to

remuneration   when   compared   with   his    last

appointment with the Singapore Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law relating to trusts and trustees at present

enforced  in Singapore is contained in the  Trustee

Ordinance,  1949,  as  amended,  and  the   Trustee

Investment   Act,  1965,  both  of  Malaysia.   The

interpretation  of  the  aforesaid  enactments  has

caused   a  certain  amount  of  difficulty   since

Singapore  separated from Malaysia in August  1965,

It  is, therefore, considered desirable to have new

legislation on those matters relating to trusts and

trustees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to consolidate and reenact the

statutory law dealing with trusts and trustees with

certain  amendments and additions. In the main,  it

follows  closely  the  provisions  of  the   former

Trustees  Ordinance (Cap. 34) of Singapore repealed

by  the  Trustee Investment Act, 1965, of  Malaysia

which   extended  the  provisions  of  the  Federal

Trustee   Ordinance,   1949,   to   Singapore.   No

substantive change has been made to the  provisions

of  the  former  Ordinance. The  Malaysian  Trustee

Investment  Act,  1965, also gives  new  powers  of

investment  to trustees and imposes certain  duties

on  them  in  choosing  investments.  Most  of  the

provisions contained therein have been incorporated

into  this  Bill.  As  it is  proposed  to  empower

trustees   to  invest  in  authorised  unit   trust

schemes,  the  expressions "authorised  unit  trust

scheme" and "unit trust scheme" are defined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill defines the authorised

investments  for trust funds, and this  follows  in

general the investments appearing in section  4  of

the Malaysian Trustee Ordinance, 1949, as amended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill seeks to introduce statutory

provisions relating to charitable trusts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 66 empowers the Public Trustee to

administer the property of charitable trusts  which

are for the time being without trustees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 67 contains provisions to prevent the

invalidation  of a trust by reason that  the  trust

funds are directed to be applied for non-charitable

and invalid purposes as well as for some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



charitable  purposes.  This clause  follows  recent

legislation in the United Kingdom and Australia  to

validate certain imperfect charitable trusts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of Part VI of the Bill incorporates in

the   main   the   provisions   of   the   Trustees

(Incorporation) Ordinance. 1952, of Malaysia  which

provides  for the incorporation of the trustees  of

bodies  or  associations established for charitable

or   public  purposes.  The  trustees  incorporated

pursuant  to this Part shall file with  the  Public

Trustee their accounts annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Schedule empowers the Minister by order

to  declare a unit trust scheme to be an authorised

trust  scheme  and  also to appoint  inspectors  to

investigate and report on the administration of any

unit  trust scheme. Such controls are necessary  if

unit  trust  schemes  are  to  be  allowed  to   be

authorised investments. The provisions contained in

the First Schedule follow in general the provisions

contained  in  sections 12 and  17  and  the  First

Schedule  of  the Prevention of Fraud  (Investment)

Act, 1958, of the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill has been referred and agreed to by

the then Singapore Bar Committee, now the Singapore

Advocates and Solicitors Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>MARKETS FOR LOCAL PRODUCTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, during the past few months,  I  have

noted with gratification that various Ministers  of

our  Government have gone on record to  the  effect

that Singapore is in favour of regional economic co-operation.  The distinct impression given  is  that

the greater the scope for such a common market, the

more Singapore is in favour of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trade unionists' viewpoint, this makes a

welcome change from the headlines in the newspapers

about warnings given by the Government to the trade

unionists  and workers of Singapore that they  must

first  learn  the A B C of economics and  must  not

endanger   the  economy  of  Singapore  by   making

exorbitant  demands  on  the  employers.  From   my

experience as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



Executive   Secretary  of  the  Pioneer  Industries

Employees'  Union,  I can assure  Members  of  this

House  that the average wage-level prevailing among

the  pioneer industries is the lowest in Singapore.

This  is  only  an incidental point, but  it  lends

emphasis to my contention that the workers  in  the

pioneer  industries recognise the  gravity  of  the

economic   dilemma  of  Singapore  by   restraining

themselves in order that the pioneer industries may

remain  viable and competitive in the international

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that the Singapore Government has made

references to the desirability of regional economic

co-operation.  The success of our industrialisation

project does not depend only on the workers in  the

pioneer industries being reasonable in relation  to

their   demands  for  better  wages   and   working

conditions, but also on the industrialists' ability

to find outlets for their products. It is high time

that  Members of this House were told that, if  the

industries   in   Singapore  find   difficulty   in

disposing of their products, it is not because  the

high  cost  of  labour in Singapore has  helped  to

price  the industrial products of Singapore out  of

the  international  market, but  because  of  other

factors.  One  is  the  trade barriers  erected  by

foreign  countries  out  of political  or  economic

consideration.  Another is the  psychology  of  the

consumer who prefers to stick to well-known  brands

of  goods.  Even in Singapore, our local  consumers

prefer   the   imported  brands  to   the   locally

manufactured  brands when the goods  concerned  are

identical in every respect except the brand name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not seek to minimise the fact that the cost

of  labour has a direct bearing on the cost of  the

final  product,  or  that the  cost  of  labour  in

Singapore  may  be higher than that  prevailing  in

countries such as Malaysia, Taiwan and South  Korea

which have the same ambition to industrialise their

economy just as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



we  do  in Singapore. But the real reason, I think,

why  our industries are not able to expand as  fast

as  was  expected is the smallness of the  domestic

market in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, an island Republic of 220 square miles

with   barely  two  million  population,  generally

speaking,  does  not have a domestic  market  large

enough  to work any modern industry at its  optimum

level.  The  wage  level of labour  has  no  direct

bearing on the optimum size of any industry. On the

contrary,  the higher the wage-level  may  be,  the

more conducive it may be to an industry reaching an

optimum  level of production because of the greater

purchasing  power of the workers. This  is  by  the

way;  but  my  point is that in the  absence  of  a

sizable  domestic market, it is vital that we  find

an international market to serve as an extension to

our local market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which we can develop such an

international  market to offset the sheer  physical

limitations  of our domestic market is  to  have  a

common  market  arrangement with  our  neighbouring

countries.  I  appreciate  that  there   are   many

difficulties   in   the   way   of   concluding   a

satisfactory  common  market  arrangement,  as  the

participating  countries may have widely  different

interests. Even during the two years when Singapore

was  in  Malaysia, we could not arrive at a  common

market  arrangement which was provided for  in  the

Malaysia Agreement. When the machinery was  finally

set  up for a common market. Singapore was expelled

from   Malaysia  and  that  was  the  end  of   the

expectation  of  a common market between  Singapore

and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the many difficulties that are in the

way of the formation of a common market, I envisage

that the problem of having a broader market than is

provided for by our domestic market may be resolved

by  a  series  of  bilateral  trade  pacts  between

Singapore  and  other interested countries.  It  is

encouraging to note that fruitful efforts are being

made by Singapore in this direction. I have in mind

the  bilateral trade agreements made  by  Singapore

with Russia, Rumania, Bulgaria and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



other  Eastern European countries. I am sure it  is

also  the fervent wish of all Members of this House

that  the  Singapore Government should continue  to

succeed  in  its  efforts to reach bilateral  trade

agreements with as many countries as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I must express my considerable

surprise  that  there has been no  trade  agreement

with  one country in particular with which we  have

considerable  trade. I refer  to  the  Republic  of

China  which, as you know, Sir, last year  supplied

to  us  $217  million  worth of  various  forms  of

manufactured goods, while taking from us in  return

not more than a few million dollars worth of rubber

and  other commodities. This is a most unfavourable

flow   of   trade   between  the   two   countries,

particularly  in view of the fact  that  the  goods

supplied  by China are similar to those  which  are

being  manufactured  by our pioneer  industries  in

Singapore.  This  trade  with  China  is  a  double

tragedy  in  the sense that we are losing  valuable

foreign  exchange to China and that  these  Chinese

goods  are undercutting the products that are being

made in Singapore. The reason why China is able  to

sell  its goods at fantastically low prices,  which

may have no relation to the cost of production,  is

perhaps that it wants to obtain foreign exchange -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of

order. Sir. Can the Member for Telok Blangah  speak

a  little  slower, as I think the Interpreters  are

finding it difficult to follow him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Will the Member speak a little

slower so that the Interpreters can translate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> For the benefit of the Member for

Delta, I will repeat what I have just said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why China is able to sell its goods at

fantastically  low  prices,  which  may   have   no

relation to the cost of production, is perhaps that

it  wants  to obtain foreign exchange at any  cost.

While  we sympathise with China's efforts to obtain

scarce  foreign exchange, the survival of Singapore

must take precedence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



I hope the Government will take firm steps

to  have  bilateral trade agreements with countries

such   as   China  with  which  we  are  having   a

disadvantageous balance of trade. If we cannot make

countries such as China buy more from us,  then  we

must  impose trade quotas and tariffs to discourage

such countries from selling more to us. I am of the

opinion that a severe curtailment of the import  of

Chinese  goods  will not prejudice the  welfare  of

Singapore,  as  our  own industries  can  supply  a

similar range of products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for Singapore to put its

relationship with our neighbouring countries  on  a

business-like basis. In saying so, I have  in  mind

that  the  attitude of certain foreign  governments

toward  Singapore  is  not founded  on  a  rational

policy   of  mutual  co-existence  but  on   purely

emotional   reaction  towards  the   existence   of

Singapore as an independent socialist Republic.  In

such  circumstances,  I repeat,  pending  a  common

market  arrangement  between  Singapore  and  other

interested foreign countries, some attempts must be

made   to   equalise  the  flow  of  trade  between

Singapore  and  other countries,  especially  those

countries who are selling more than buying from us.

Otherwise,   we  will  have  the  most  undesirable

situation in Singapore where we have sacrificed our

scant  capital  in  creating  and  developing   our

capacity for industrial production which will grind

to  a  halt through our having insufficient outlets

for our industrial products.



<br><br>7.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I welcome the constructive

attitude of the hon. Member for Telok Blangah and I

am  glad  to be given an opportunity to explain  in

more   detail  the  efforts  being  made   by   the

Government to increase our market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before proceeding, I would like to take

up  one  point which the hon. Member has mentioned.

It  is not the high cost of labour alone that  will

price   an   industrial   product   out   of    the

international market. There are also other factors.

No  one  will dispute the contention that  cost  of

labour is not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



only  factor influencing the competitiveness  of  a

country's products. However, the cost of labour  is

one of the more important factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages are never too high "per se". They may only

be  too  high in comparison with what  is  paid  in

other competing countries. As has been very rightly

pointed  out by the hon. Member for Telok  Blangah,

we have to compete with products from Korea, Taiwan

and  Japan, where the wages may be lower than those

prevailing  in  Singapore. It could be  argued,  of

course, that in other countries, for instance,  the

United  States  of  America, wages  paid  are  much

higher  than those in Singapore. It has never  been

disputed that a large market is the primary  factor

for the success of our industrialisation programme,

and  steps have been taken and will continue to  be

taken to enlarge the market for Singapore goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for Singapore goods can be divided into

two parts - (1) the local market, and (2) the export

market.  Our local market is small, with less  than

two  million  consumers.  This  market  is  further

restricted,  as has been pointed out  by  the  hon.

Member,  by  brand consciousness of our  consumers.

Local  consumers have been repeatedly asked to  buy

more Singapore goods, and whilst it is difficult to

wipe away such brand consciousness overnight, it is

my  belief  that  our consumers are taking  greater

pride  in  Singapore's  products  and  buying  more

Singapore-made goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is allowing double tax deduction on

market     development    expenditure,    including

advertising,  in  respect  of  locally-manufactured

goods.  The  Trade  Division,  together  with   the

Economic    Development   Board,   is    sponsoring

exhibitions, trade expositions, and fairs  to  make

local   products   better   known   to   consumers.

Government  departments and  statutory  bodies  are

increasingly buying more local products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways to increase our international

market  is  by  participation in free trade  areas,

regional agreements, common markets, and the  like.

Unfortunately, Sir, we must have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



partners  with whom to conclude such agreements  or

arrangements. As the hon. Member has  pointed  out,

there  are  many  difficulties in the  way  of  the

formation of these arrangements and agreements.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some dangers, too, such as the danger of

being included in a region which would not offer us

what we hope to find as a market and may damage our

relations  with  other  parts  of  the  world,   or

endanger  our entrepot trade. We have  to  be  very

careful  in  this field, perhaps more careful  than

countries  which do not have such a large  entrepot

trade   as  Singapore  has.  However,  the   Export

Promotion  Centre,  which was  formed  specifically

with  the objective of finding an expanding  market

for  Singapore goods, and the Ministry  of  Finance

are   continuously  and  carefully   studying   all

possibilities  which may materialise  and  to  take

advantage of such opportunities and situations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already concluded trade agreements with

the U.S.S.R., Rumania, Poland, and other countries.

We are sending trade missions to these countries in

August  this  year. This mission will  comprise  30

persons, including businessmen and officials,  They

will  go  to  seven Eastern European  countries  to

consolidate  the  results  obtained  by  the  first

negotiations   held  in  Singapore.  To   publicise

Singapore products in the international market, the

Export  Promotion  Centre  has  started  an  active

campaign  in the foreign Press. Singapore has  been

widely   advertised  in  at  least  two   important

magazines  circulating  in  the  European   market.

Singapore is also participating actively in foreign

exhibitions  and fairs where it is considered  that

there are possibilities of expanding its market  by

such participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one or two months' time, our Export Promotion

Centre  will  be sending industrialists  to  Zambia

where   opportunities   of  finding   markets   for

Singapore   products  are  good.  Our  efforts   in

promoting exports of domestic products are  showing

results. In 1963



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



$277 million worth of domestic goods were exported.

This  increased to $345 million in  1965  and  $400

million  in  1966,  To encourage  export-orientated

industries,  I  have  in  my  last  Budget   speech

announced  fiscal  incentives for such  industries.

Results should show in 1968. I have also set  up  a

working  party  to study schemes for export  credit

insurance  which will be an important tool  at  the

disposal of our exporters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the hon. Member's comments on trade

with  China,  Members should bear in mind  that  we

cannot always work solely on the principle that  we

will  only  trade  with  countries  which  buy   an

equivalent amount of goods from us. A trade deficit

with  one  country is often counter-balanced  by  a

trade surplus with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



another. That is how international trade works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure

the  hon.  Member that we are quite  aware  of  the

dangers  of  dumping, and where  goods  similar  to

those  that are manufactured in Singapore are being

dumped here, active steps will be taken to see that

our local industries are not endangered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>
