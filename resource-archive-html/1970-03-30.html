has  been  conducted into the circumstances  which

caused  the collapse of the concrete beams  for  a

<div align="center"><b>(Control measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  what measures he proposes to take for  the

control  of  hawkers  at work  sites  of  building

projects



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the current policy with

regard  to hawkers at construction sites  is  that

cooked  food  and  hot/cold  drinks  hawkers   are

permitted  to  ply  at  large  construction  sites

provided that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) there are no facilities nearby where the

construction workers can buy food or drinks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) such hawker does not cause obstruction or

inconvenience to the general public:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) such hawker keeps his stall and the immediate

vicinity clean and free of litter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the hawker dismantles his stall and moves

away   as   soon   as  the  construction   is

completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials of the Hawkers Branch have been

instructed  to control these hawkers in accordance

with the policy I have described.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any construction site cannot be prescribed for

hawkers,  the  hawkers who are  permitted  to  ply

thereat are not licensed. This permits prosecution

of  the hawker for remaining at the site after the

construction is completed. Authority to  prosecute

the  hawker  for  failing to keep  his  stall  and

vicinity  clean  or  for  causing  obstruction  is

contained  in  the  Hawkers  Regulations  and  the

Public   Cleansing  Regulations  made  under   the

Environmental Public Health Act, 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can the Parliamentary Secretary explain why

licences are not issued to hawkers doing business

at construction sites?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I said

that if there are no stalls selling food or drinks

near the construction sites, we will allow hawkers

to ply there. This is because these hawkers are

only temporary there. When the work at the

construction site is completed, they will be asked

to go away. At present, there are many

construction sites we have to take care of, but

the number of such hawkers plying there is very

few. Therefore, we do not intend to issue licences

to them.

"An Act to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed copies of the Bill distributed to

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will Members please note that the

copies of the Bill which have just been handed out

differ  from the copies which have been previously

circulated, in that subsection (2) of new  section

6 in clause 2 of the Bill has been redrafted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Chinese New Year festive season,

particularly on Chap Goh Meh, considerable  damage

to  both  persons and property was caused  by  the

indiscriminate firing of crackers. A total  of  29

incidents  were  officially reported;  25  persons

were  injured out of whom six died, one  is  still

warded  in hospital, while the remaining  18  have

been  discharged. Nine houses were damaged by fire

and  the  total estimated value of the  damage  is

assessed  at $560,390. The loss of lives  and  the

extent  of  damage have thus rendered it expedient

and necessary to amend existing legislation on the

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although cracker firing has been totally banned

in  countries  like Hong Kong, West  Malaysia  and

Indonesia,  it  is not our intention  to  place  a

total ban



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



on  the discharge of fireworks. We intend instead,

to  enforce  very strict control  over  those  who

indiscriminately   indulge  in   such   activities

without   due  regard  to  persons  or   property.

Patterns  of  social behaviour must  of  necessity

keep  step  with changes in standards  and  living

conditions if grievous consequences to all are  to

be avoided. Where civic-responsibility and social-consciousness are lacking, human behaviour has  to

be  regulated by means of social legislation. Much

as  we  dislike to inhibit the enjoyment of  some,

the   present  amendment  to  the  Minor  Offences

Ordinance  has to be made if we are to  prevent  a

repetition  of the disastrous events on  Chap  Goh

Meh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, section 6 of the Minor Offences

Ordinance, which came into force in 1966, does not

prohibit  the letting off of fire crackers  unless

specifically prohibited by the Deputy Commissioner

of  Police  in the Gazette. It is now proposed  to

amend section 6 of the Ordinance to revert to  the

position  before  1966,  and  to  resuscitate  the

original regulations relating to the control, and

firing  of  fire crackers. That is to  say,  there

would  not  be  a  total ban on the  discharge  of

fireworks  but  a  general  prohibition  will   be

introduced which may be lifted by way of a Gazette

Notification from time to time or by the  issuance

of  licences  for  personal or  other  reasons  to

individuals  or  public  bodies  by   the   Deputy

Commissioner   of   Police   or   his   authorised

representative. Such orders or licences may relate

not  only  to  specified dates, times  and  places

wherein  fireworks may be discharged, but also  to

particular  types  of  fireworks  that  could   be

discharged  or  other conditions that  the  Deputy

Commissioner  of Police may deem it  necessary  to

impose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively, for the purposes of

implementation  of  the law,  private  persons  or

public   bodies  granted  licences  to   let   off

fireworks under the Act will be identified by  the

use  of special flags, pendants or other means  to

be   displayed  in  those  areas   which   are

designated. The Police will charge a fee  for  the

issue of such licences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also expressly provided that no order

published or licence issued under the Act shall be

held  to relieve any person or body from liability

in  the  event that any damage, loss or injury  to

persons or property is occasioned by the discharge

of fireworks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for an offence under section 6 of the

Act  has  been enhanced from a fine not  exceeding

$100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding  one

month   to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $500  or   to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding  six  months

or to both such fine and imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Bill,  tabled on a Certificate of Urgency, is  the

direct  result of several deaths and  considerable

damage  to  property caused by cracker  explosions

and  fires  which broke out in some parts  of  the

Republic   during   the  recent   Chap   Goh   Meh

celebrations.  We  all  agree  that   on   festive

occasions, one has a right to rejoice. To  express

joy  and  happiness, several forms of celebrations

are  planned and held, one of which is to let  off

crackers  galore.  This  is  especially  true   on

Chinese  New  Year,  Hari  Raya  Puasa  and  other

festive  occasions. But more so on  Chap  Goh  Meh

when  long strings of crackers, strung up  several

storeys  high, are let off in many  parts  of  the

city. So-called "cracker wars" are held and, as  a

result,  thousands of dollars are literally  burnt

away. Whoever wins a war of this nature gains,  in

fact,  nothing. On the contrary, I believe  he  is

poorer  by several hundreds or maybe thousands  of

dollars,  though he may believe that  he  will  be

prosperous as a result of firing crackers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly there was some form of carelessness

or  indiscriminate throwing of crackers, resulting

in  outbreaks  of  fire and  bringing  misery  and

untold hardship to others. I felt deeply disgusted

and aghast when I read in the papers of the deaths

and  of  those who suffered burns in the Chap  Goh

Meh



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



disaster. That was senseless and, therefore, the

timely    appearance   of   the   Minor   Offences

(Amendment)  Bill will, I hope,  bring  home  some

sense to those who are responsible for such deaths

and suffering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has my full support. But I wish to seek

clarification on two points. Firstly,  the  Deputy

Commissioner  of  Police  is  empowered  to  issue

orders  by a Gazette notification authorising  the

discharge  of  fireworks  on  certain  fixed  days

during  certain  fixed hours  and  within  certain

defined  areas.  Sir, I do not  know  whether  the

defined  areas  are going to be  workable  in  the

light  of the Minister's explanation. I feel  that

it  will  not work in the city as there is  hardly

any  open  space  except in the parks.  Therefore,

those  who wish to let off crackers must forgather

there "to fight it out", so to say. And will  they

or  will  they  not agree that such defined  areas

will eventually be littered with cracker paper?  I

feel that they will. If so, who is to clear up the

mess,  especially if the fireworks are let off  in

the parks or fields? Sir, will it not be better to

have  the  firing  of crackers carried  out  under

controlled  conditions?  For  example,   I   would

suggest  that the Government consider a total  ban

on the firing of long strings of crackers and only

approve the firing of smaller packets of crackers.

But  even  so, this also poses attendant problems,

especially   for  those  living  in  Housing   and

Development   Board  flats  and  other   high-rise

buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the Minister not consider the

setting  up  of a committee or committees  with  a

view  to  calling  on those who wish  to  let  off

crackers during the festive seasons to donate  the

money    instead   to   charitable   and   welfare

organisations?  I  am sure this  will  bring  real

happiness all round. After all, occasions like Han

Raya  Puasa,  Chinese New Year and  Deepavali,  to

name  a  few, mean joy and happiness to the people

in  general. Therefore, by contributing generously

on  such occasions to charity, those in receipt of

it will be all the happier for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the firing of crackers to celebrate

certain festivals and on certain auspicious

occasions is a habit as well as a custom of the

Chinese. In recent years, the people of Singapore,

irrespective of their race, creed, faith and

language, have been living in close contact and

harmony with one another. So under this influence

not only do the Chinese celebrate their festivals

and auspicious occasions by firing crackers but

other races also resort to this means to

celebrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Defence has introduced this

amendment   Bill  which  will  inconvenience   and

embarrass  those people who want to fire crackers,

and put them in some sort of difficulty. When this

Bill  is  passed into law, the firing of  crackers

will   be  prohibited  and  there  will   not   be

liveliness and merry-making during festivals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time that the firing of

crackers has caused deaths and loss of property in

Singapore. I think this Bill may lead to abuse and

to other unpleasant consequences. For instance, at

the meet-the-people sessions, there will be crowds

of  people  complaining to Members  of  Parliament

about  the  banning of the firing of crackers  and

about  matters regarding the issue of licences.  I

think  the  Minister himself will also  meet  with

this kind of situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the recent incidents, what we should

do  is  to look into the causes of these incidents

and study whether the manufacture and the contents

of  fire crackers have been against our laws. This

is  the  first  time  such incidents  happened  in

Singapore.  This is also the first time  that  the

people  of  Singapore resorted to the purchase  of

locally-produced    fire    crackers    and    the

manufacturers had been working round the clock  to

meet  the local demand. In this respect,  I  would

like  to  ask the Minister whether the  department

concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



has  analysed the contents of the  various

brands of fire crackers. I feel that imported fire

crackers  should not be banned, but investigations

should be made into the causes of the incidents.



<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  this  amendment  Bill  has   been

introduced at a very opportune moment. I have been

living  in  Singapore for the last  42  years.  On

every festive occasion, fire crackers are let off.

But   only   this   year  were  there   disastrous

consequences  of cracker firing, and the  Minister

should  investigate into the incidents. We  should

look  into  the  cause of the  trouble.  It  seems

somebody  burned a house down because it was  bug-infested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws are made for the welfare of the people. But

the   penalty  imposed  by  this  Bill  is  rather

excessive.  The  maximum  penalty  is  $500.   All

festive   occasions  are  celebrated  by   cracker

firing. Therefore, there should be a provision  in

the  law  that  crackers may  be  let  off  during

festive  occasions. We must find out  the  reasons

why  crackers  are let off. In the past,  crackers

were let off without harmful consequences. Why  is

it  that  crackers  are  let off  indiscriminately

nowadays   with  loss  of  lives  and  damage   to

property? We must look into the manufacture of the

crackers and see what substances are used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this piece of legislation. But I must

repeat   that  the  penalty  is  excessive.   Some

children  may  let  off crackers indiscriminately,

and  where  are their parents going  to  find  the

money  to  pay  for their offences? Therefore,  I

would  say that the provisions in the Bill  should

be  re-examined.  It  should  be  sent  to  Select

Committee.



<br><br>2.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have been firing  crackers  ever

since  I  was a boy. I am now 66 years old  and  I

still fire crackers. However, I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



never injured myself and I have never heard of any

deaths   caused   by  the  firing   of   crackers.

Therefore, we must look into the reasons  why  the

firing  of crackers can cause deaths and injuries.

We  should  not  impose  a total  ban  on  cracker

firing. It is not right to do so. For example, the

Minister for Science and Technology will be  going

to  Ulu Pandan very soon to officiate at a certain

ceremony,  and  crackers will be let  off  in  his

honour. We will have to fix a place for the firing

of   crackers.   This  is  not  very   convenient.

Therefore, I am totally against this provision  in

the  Bill. We should allow people to choose  their

own  places to fire crackers. It is not right  for

Government  to  fix  a place for  people  to  fire

crackers. We must allow them the freedom  to  fire

crackers whenever and wherever they like. We  must

not be like children and do whatever we like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now

several  Back-benchers have made some comments  on

the Bill and I hope the Minister will reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will do so now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of the four

speakers, two of them fully support the Bill,  one

is  against  it,  and one, not  understanding  the

purpose of the Bill, is probably neither for nor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



against  it.  I  do not know what  his  stand  is.

Anyway, I will take the two points raised  by  the

Member for Punggol. He seeks clarification on what

is  meant  by "defined areas". In this respect,  I

wish  to  seek  the assistance of all  Members  of

Parliament,  the  management  committees  of   the

respective  community centres, and  the  Citizens'

Consultative  Committees,  in  helping   to   find

suitable  areas  for the letting off  of  crackers

during  festive occasions. The Deputy Commissioner

of  Police will then be directed to specify  those

areas for the firing of crackers which Members  of

Parliament,    with   members   of    their    own

constituencies, have decided upon.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister prepared to give

way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, people

celebrate  their  New Year or other  festivals  in

their  respective  homes. How can  they  celebrate

them in the community centre or other open places?

Can the Minister answer that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I believe the Member for Anson

supports  the  Bill  and he wants  the  firing  of

crackers to be controlled. That is the only way we

know  of  controlling it. If we allow everyone  to

fire crackers freely and indiscriminately in their

own  homes, we will have a repetition of what  has

happened.  I  hope that clarifies  the  point  the

Member has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it would be preferable if, out of

their  own  feeling for the community and  out  of

civic  consciousness,  those  who  participate  in

firing crackers in the specified areas will do the

cleaning up of the areas themselves. I am sure  my

colleague, the Minister for Health, will have  his

burden relieved, especially during the Chinese New

Year, if those who indulge in firing crackers help

to clear up the area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I hope there will be a large

proportion of the public who will heed the call of

the  Member for Punggol, and, instead of  spending

their money on the futility of firing crackers  or

engaging in a fire-cracker war, donate their money

to charity or to the Defence Fund.



Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the Second Reading  of

the Bill, I did mention that if there is no social

consciousness in the habits of the people, we have

to regulate their behaviour by social legislation.

This is exactly what has happened here. Those  who

indulged  in firing crackers during the  Chap  Goh

Meh  festival showed a lack of responsibility  and

social  consciousness and, as a result, six people

lost  their lives. One person is still  warded  in

hospital. I do not know whether the Member for Ulu

Pandan is very happy when people are able to  fire

crackers whilst others die. If that is his idea of

celebrating an occasion, then I think we have  got

to change his idea, before it is too late-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me make

my  points clear. The Minister for Defence said he

did  not understand what I said just now. He  said

it  was  futile to fire crackers. However, in  the

past  whenever  the  Prime  Minister  toured   the

constituencies and the Ministers went to the rural

areas,  they were welcomed by the people there  by

the  firing of crackers. I would like the Minister

to withdraw what he has said just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

Member  for  Ulu Pandan is not aware  that,  as  a

result  of  one  of the many welcoming  receptions

that Ministers had in which a lot of crackers were

fired,  some  of  us have suffered  from  deafness

because  of the noise. I for one find it difficult

to  hear  with  my left ear just  because  on  one

occasion the welcome was most uproarious indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to make is this. Do we want to

allow  a few irresponsible persons to celebrate  a

festive  occasion in such a way that it can  cause

damage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



and  endanger  the lives of the  majority  of  the

people? I think, by and large, the feeling is that

we  should not allow such a dangerous practice  to

continue.  It  may  be  that  the  incidents  that

happened  during Chap Goh Meh may  have  been  the

result of faulty manufacture of the fire crackers.

On  that score, we are taking legal action to  see

that  those who manufacture fire crackers  and  do

not conform to the safety regulations required for

their     manufacture    will    be    prosecuted.

Incidentally, Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude,

I  would like to draw the attention of Members  to

page 3 of the Bill in which it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(7) For the purposes of subsections (1) to (5)

of  this  section,  the expression  "firework"  or

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (lA) of section 10 of the Income Tax

Ordinance  provides relief for owner-occupiers  of

residential   premises  by  exempting   from   the

computation of income the net annual value of  the

property up to $3,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual values of properties have risen in

recent  years, and the Property Tax Department  is

doing  a revaluation exercise on properties  whose

values  are  outdated. It has revised  the  values

upwards in a number of cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the benefit of relief to owner-occupiers is not restricted by the limit of

$3,000,   the  amendment  seeks  to  empower   the

Minister  to  determine, by an Order, the  maximum

amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



which will not be subject to tax in respect of the

net   annual   value  of  any  one  owner-occupied

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the House was informed

on  the 17th of this month, in reply to a question

by the Member for Thomson, that it was intended to

increase  the  exemption  limit  from  $3,000   to

$6,000. The amendment as proposed will permit this

to  be done and also any subsequent variations  of

the maximum amount as and when required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst

supporting this Bill, I wish to seek clarification

and  an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Finance. Sir, this Bill in  a

way  will benefit owner-occupied properties  which

carry an annual value of not more than $6,000. But

in  my view it will not help those owners who have

to  pay property tax on owner-occupied property of

an  annual  value  of  $6,000;  let  it  be  at  a

concessionary rate of 18 per cent, 23 per cent  or

27  per cent. In other words, if an owner-occupied

property  is today assessed at an annual value  of

$3,000,  it can be reviewed annually, and in  most

cases  it  is  revalued upwards.  Therefore,  more

property  tax will be paid as the annual value  is

reviewed each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is this: whilst one benefits from

exemption  of  income  tax in  respect  of  owner-occupied property valued at not more than  $6,000,

such a property, if revalued upwards, will carry a

higher  property tax. Under such circumstances,  I

would  be  grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for Finance could  assure  this

House   that   properties  which  are   considered

sufficiently assessed or valued today will not  be

revalued next year or the following year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give

such  an  assurance to the Member for Punggol.  In

fact,  "annual value" is defined by  the  Property

Tax Ordinance as the value that a house can be let

out   unfurnished,  the  owner  paying   for   its

maintenance  and  repairs. In  order  to  get  the

correct  annual  value,  the  property  should  be

revalued  every  year so that  it  will  correctly

reflect  its current market value. The Member  for

Punggol is asking us not to do that very thing, an

annual revaluation, so that the annual value of  a

property can reflect its market value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill comes into operation, any property

having  an  annual value of more than $6,000  will

attract income tax. In my reply to the Member  for

Thomson on the question of property tax a few days

ago,  I did say that any property having an annual

value  of  $6,000  is,  in  fact,  very  luxurious

property.  And  there is no reason  why  a  person

living in such luxurious splendour should not  pay

income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary

Secretary completely missed my point. It  is  that

if  the  annual value of a property  is  over  and

above the $6,000 limit, there is the imposition of

income  tax. And at the same time, Sir,  there  is

also the question of property tax. In other words,

there are two taxes coming under one income. I  am

not  saying that properties should not  be  valued

annually,  but surely the officers in  the  Inland

Revenue  Department,  in which  the  Property  Tax

Division is, should look into this aspect of owner-occupied properties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

I  do  not  know  what assurance  the  Member  for

Punggol  wants me to give. I thought he wanted  me

to  give an assurance that properties would not be

revalued year by year, and I said that I could not

give  that assurance. In fact, our very aim is  to

revalue  properties annually so that their  annual

values  could reflect their current market values.

I  am  not  too sure, Mr Speaker, Sir,  what  the

Member for Punggol wants, but perhaps if he could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



simplify  his  question, I might be  able  to  say

whether  or  not I can give him the  assurance  he

wants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, perhaps there is a

confusion between property tax and income tax.  My

question is simply this. What I said just now  was

that  those  owner-occupied properties which  have

already  been  reasonably assessed should  not  be

reassessed every year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  said that the very purpose of revaluation

is  to ensure that the property correctly reflects

its  market  value,  and that it  should  be  done

annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just do not understand what the Member wants.

If he says that any annual value above $6,000 will

attract income tax, that is not correct because it

is only if the net annual value of the property is

above $6,000 then it will attract income tax.  The

"net  annual value" is defined as the gross annual

value  minus the property tax you pay,  minus  the

premium  you pay on insuring your property,  minus

maintenance, and also minus any interest that  you

may have to pay on mortgaging the property. But  I

suppose  anybody who lives in a house that  has  a

net  annual  value of $6,000 or above  would  have

bought  it  outright  and  not  have  to  pay  any

mortgage interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still not quite sure what the Member wants,

Sir. I  think  what he objects  to  is  that  any

property having a net annual value of above $6,000

attracts  income  tax  as well  as  property  tax.

Therefore,  he says it is two taxes. That  is  not

correct  because any income is supposed to attract

income  tax, and a piece of property gives  you  a

notional   income.  However,  the  Government   is

generous  enough and now provides in the law  that

any  property  having a net annual value  of  less

than  $6,000 will not attract income  tax  on  its

annual value.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, may I just

seek clarification? Will this relief on income tax

on  a net annual value of less than $6,000 be made

retrospective to the time when this  annual  value

was raised?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, consideration will be

back-dated  to the 1st January of this year.  Sir,

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ngee Ann College was established in April

1963,   it  was  registered  under  the  Education

Ordinance  as  a  private  institution   and   was

financed and administered by the Ngee Ann  Kongsi.

It  functioned then as a College of liberal  arts,

offering degree courses in Chinese Studies,  Malay

Studies, Home Economics and Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, following acceptance by the Ngee Ann

Kongsi  of  the recommendations contained  in  the

Thong  Saw  Pak  Report  to  reorganise  Ngee  Ann

College   into   a  Community  College,   it   was

reconstituted by Statute (No. 28 of 1967) with its

management vested in a Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1968, a sum of $469,820 comprising

$363,000  as  capital expenditure and $106,820  as

recurrent expenditure for the first year was given

by Government to assist Ngee Ann



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



College  to  provide courses geared  to  meet  the

growing  demands  for technical  manpower  in  our

Republic. A further grant of $987,750 was given by

the  Government to the College in 1969  to  enable

further   expansion  of  the   College   in   this

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first course conducted by the College in

August 1968, as a result of its reorganisation was

the   three-year  Mechanical  Engineering  Course,

leading to a Technician Diploma. This was followed

by  the introduction of the Industrial Electronics

Course  in April 1969. All the old degree  courses

in  Chinese Studies, Malay Studies, Home Economics

and  Commerce have been phased out, and  only  the

Technician   Diploma  Course  in   Technical   and

Business Administration subjects will be conducted

from now on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a further move to support Ngee Ann College in

its  effort at reorganisation, the Government  has

recommended a reduction of tuition fees payable by

Ngee  Ann College students from $540 per annum  to

$300  per annum. To enable Ngee Ann College to  do

this,   the  Government  has  approved  a  further

subsidy amounting to $100,000 per annum. The total

subsidy by the Government for the coming financial

year will amount to more than $1.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the reorganisation of Ngee Ann College

into   a   College   providing  mainly   technical

education  facilities, the name  of  the  College,

known  as Ngee Ann College under section 3 of  the

Ngee  Ann  College Act, 1967, was administratively

changed  to that of Ngee Ann Technical College  on

22nd August, 1968, by the Ngee Ann Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is introduced to regularise the

position,  that is, to enable Ngee Ann College  to

assume the name of Ngee Ann Technical College with

retrospective effect from 22nd August, 1968.

the  Republic, namely, the University of Singapore

and Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I notice that the Government subsidy to

Ngee  Ann College stands at $1.1 million. In  this

respect, I should be grateful if the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Education  would

enlighten this House on what role the Ministry  of

Education plays apart from subvention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I understand that there was a Principal

of   Ngee   Ann  College.  Recently,  there   were

advertisements for the post of Principal  of  Ngee

Ann   College  in  the  local  press.  Could   the

Parliamentary  Secretary enlighten  the  House  on

this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, other than

the   three-year  Technician  Diploma  Course   in

Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Electronics,

the  College also runs a three-year course at  the

same    level    in    Commerce    and    Business

Administration.  The College is also  planning  to

enlarge  the enrolment of these three courses.  At

the  same  time, it is planning to run a  two-year

course  at  the ordinary Technician Diploma  level

which is equivalent to the General Certificate  of

Industrial  Technology offered  by  the  Singapore

Polytechnic in Engineering subjects,  and  also  a

course in Private Secretaryship. These courses run

by  Ngee Ann College will not duplicate, but  Will

supplement the courses conducted in other tertiary

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the very substantial grant the Government

has  given  to  Ngee Ann College, the Government's

role with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



respect to Ngee Ann College is similar to that with

respect to Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supreme governing body of the College is

vested  in  a  Council of which three  members  are

appointed  by  the  Minister  for  Education.   The

Ministry  of  Education does quite frequently  give

general  guidance  and advice  to  the  College  in

administrative and financial matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Principal at Ngee Ann College. She is

on  leave as from the 15th of March, 1970, prior to

resignation.   The  administrative   and   academic

management  of  the College is  now  vested  in  an

Executive  Committee  until  a  suitably  qualified

candidate  for the principalship is found.  In  the

past,   the  Council  has,  on  various  occasions,

invited  applications, both overseas  and  locally,

for  the  post of principal. Unfortunately,  up  to

this  date the College has not been able to find  a

suitable candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of the Asian Seamen's Club dates back

to  1948.  However, it was not until 1955 that  the

Singapore   Asian   Seamen's   Club   Incorporation

Ordinance  was passed which created a  corporation

entrusted with the task of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



establishing  a Club for Asian seafarers.  Work  on

the  Club  began in that year and the building  was

completed and declared open in February 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Asian Seamen's Club Incorporation

Ordinance  has  remained  unchanged  since  it  was

enacted in 1955 - 15 years ago. Certain provisions are

obsolete  and  others require amendments  for  more

effective   administration.  One   example   of   a

provision   in  the  Ordinance  which  has   become

obsolete  is  section 4 (d) which states  that  the

Club  should provide lectures in nautical and other

subjects. This may have been necessary in  the  old

days   when   there  were  no  teaching  facilities

available,  but  the  School of  Nautical  Studies,

which was founded in our Polytechnic in 1960, makes

this   objective  superfluous.  This  section   has

accordingly been deleted from the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (2) of the existing Ordinance provides

that  all  members  of  the  Committee  except  the

Chairman would retire on expiration of their  terms

of   office.  It's  considered  for  administrative

reasons  that this provision should also  apply  to

the  Chairman,  and  the Bill accordingly  provides

that  the Chairman should also retire on expiration

of his period of appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (3) of the existing Ordinance states

that  a  vacancy shall arise if a member is  absent

from Singapore for more than three months. The  new

section 7 (3) in the Bill amends this period to six

months.   This   longer  period  is  desirable   on

practical grounds, as some members do normally take

long leave exceeding three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the existing name "Asian Seamen's Club"

is  somewhat  of an anachronism and the opportunity

is  therefore  taken to rename  the  Club  as  "The

Singapore Mariners' Club".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House has been

introduced as a result of requests made from  time

to  time by the Singapore Advocates and Solicitors

Society  and  from the experience  gained  in  the

administration  thereof  since  its  coming   into

operation  in 1967. After due consideration,  the

Government   has   decided  to   introduce   these

amendments  in order to remove such doubts  as  to

the practical applicability of the sections of the

Act  that are now being amended or because, as the

law  now  stands, these sections in the  Act  have

been found to be too restrictive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will find in this Bill provisions

amending not only such technical portions  of  the

Bill   relating   to   annual   certificates   and

provisions  regulating the  admission  of  Queen's

Counsel   from  England  and  elsewhere   in   the

Commonwealth,   but   also  such   important   and

substantive provisions defining the scope or  type

of  work for which advocates and solicitors  would

have  almost  exclusive rights. The proposals  for

amendment  to  sections 37 and  38  of  the  Legal

Profession  Act, 1966, that define the  limits  of

such  exclusive rights have come from  accountants

and  trade mark agents as well as from the General

Council of the Bar itself. These amendments, it is

hoped, will now resolve the doubts the professions

might  have  had  regarding  the  extent  of  such

exclusive   rights   given   to   advocates    and

solicitors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further new provisions in the Bill

which   have  been  designed  to  facilitate   the

supervision   of  bills  of  costs  submitted   by

advocates and solicitors. Up till now an order  of

court  would  be necessary before a  bill  can  be

taxed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  When

this  Bill becomes law, this requirement would  be

dispensed with where the taxation of the  bill  is

agreed to by the parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to provide

in   this  Bill  certain  amendments  that   would

incorporate recent developments in the  rules  and

practice   governing   the  relationship   between

solicitors  and clients in England. Thus  we  have

adapted  to suit local conditions here certain  of

the rules relating to moneys in clients' accounts.

The   provisions  in  the  Bill  effecting   these

amendments will permit a solicitor to place moneys

belonging to a client in a deposit account with  a

bank  so  as to earn interest. Such interest  will

then  be  apportioned  to the  solicitor's  client

except,  of  course, where the task of  allocating

such  interest  earned is rendered impractical  or

well-nigh  impossible  on account  of  either  the

smallness  of  the  sums  involved  or  where  the

portions  of such moneys cannot easily be  defined

or traced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are other provisions in clauses 28

and  31  which  would enlarge the  powers  of  the

Disciplinary  Committee of the Bar Council.  These

enlarged powers would enable the Council  to  take

whatever  steps they think proper against  members

of  the  profession who have been  found  to  have

committed breaches of professional conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the main changes that will be

brought  about by this Bill. They have  in  common

one  main  object, and that is, a  more  efficient

administration of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is being moved in accordance

with  the  wishes of accountants in Singapore.  It

sets  out more clearly what an accountant  can  do

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is being moved on the

suggestion  of  a  trade mark  agent.  Trade  mark

agents,  when applying for registration  of  trade

marks,  prepare quite a few documents. The purpose

of this amendment is to make it clear that, whilst

doing this kind of work, they can prepare any type

of  documents, including statutory declarations or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Bill is to amend a number of

provisions   in   the  Criminal   Procedure   Code

regulating  Coroners' proceedings  and  concerning

appeals in criminal matters to the Privy Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in Chapter XXX of the Code require

a  Coroner to investigate the cause of death where

a  person dies or a dead body is found in  certain

circumstances, and ascertain whether any person is

criminally  concerned in the cause of  death.  The

Code   regulates   the   manner   in   which    an

investigation is to be carried out. In the  formal

part  of his investigation, a Coroner sits  either

alone or with a jury of three to five persons. The

proceeding  is  called an inquest or  an  inquiry,

according  to  whether the Coroner  sits  with  or

without a jury. If the death occurs in a prison or

under  suspicious circumstances in an institution,

the  Coroner investigating it has until  now  been

required to sit with a jury, but in most cases  he

has  a  discretion and sits alone. Where he  finds

that  a  crime has been committed, he may issue  a

warrant  for  the  arrest of the  person  whom  he

thinks   should  be  charged,  but  he  makes   no

determination of that person's guilt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will recall that the recent Criminal

Procedure  Code  (Amendment) Act,  1969,  repealed

those  parts  of the Code requiring  that  persons

charged   before  the  High  Court  with   certain

offences be tried by jury. The present Bill  seeks

likewise   to   remove   juries   from   Coroners'

proceedings.  In  doing so, it  will  bring  these

proceedings into line with trials in the  criminal

courts. The repeal of those provisions of the Code

requiring or referring to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



Coroners'  juries and the necessary  consequential

and  formal amendments are contained in clauses  2

and 5 to 25 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill are concerned with

sections  285  and  286 of the  Code.  Originally,

those  sections  ensured that the Privy  Council's

jurisdiction  to  hear criminal  appeals  was  not

affected  by provisions such as section  284,  and

that  the Privy Council's decisions would be given

effect  in  Singapore. Since becoming independent,

Singapore  has made arrangements with  the  United

Kingdom  and  passed the necessary legislation  to

secure  the  continuance of appeals to  the  Privy

Council,   to  regulate  them  and  to  make   the

determination of appeals effective. Those laws are

the   Constitution  (Amendment)  Act,  1966,   the

Judicial  Committee Act, 1966,  and  the  Judicial

Committee (Amendment) Act, 1967. The present terms

of   sections  285  and  286  refer  to  the   law

concerning appeals as it was before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



the  passing  of those Acts, and  the  effect  of

this Bill is to make them conform with those Acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and
