<div align="center"><b>(Figures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Financial Secretary to give figures of the number of

persons  who  have  left the Colony  without  paying

their Income Tax, and the total amount of Income Tax

due  by  them,  giving the breakdown for  each  year

since  the  coming  into force  of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, since the Income Tax

Ordinance  came into force, 1,827 persons have  left

Singapore without paying their income tax. The total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



amounts due from these persons are as follows:

<pre>

   Year of            Tax unpaid

                     ---------

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say, Sir, that since the

introduction  of  income  tax  in  the  colony,  tax

amounting  to  $129 million has been collected  from

resident individuals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX DEFAULTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Action)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Financial

Secretary  whether he has taken any  action  against

these defaulters; in how many cases has action  been

taken; and for what amount.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, in every case all possible

action is taken to recover the tax due. Efforts  are

made  to establish contact with the taxpayer and  to

persuade him to pay what is due. Legal action is not

practicable  as  the  taxpayer  passes  out  of  the

jurisdiction  of the colony courts  as  soon  as  he

leaves the colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regretted that information as to the number

of  cases  in  which action has been taken  and  the

amounts  recovered is not available and can only  be

obtained with great difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, surely the Financial Secretary is conscious of the fact

that  there is a reciprocity of judgments  agreement

between us and the United Kingdom, and most of these

defaulters return to the United Kingdom. Why -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the hon. Member

is coming to a supplementary question?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I would ask

whether  he  would  consider taking  action  in  the

courts of England against these defaulters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am sure the hon. Member has been

aware, Sir, although he has perhaps forgotten,  that

there  is  a well established convention of  private

international  law  that,  as  a  matter  of  public

policy, the courts of one State will not enforce the

judgments of a revenue nature of another State.  For

that  reason, it has not been possible to take legal

action in the courts of the United Kingom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other

countries  a  person  has  to  show  an  income  tax

clearance before -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RESIDENT INCOME TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Collection)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Financial Secretary

whether  he  will take measures analogous  to  those

prevailing  in  almost  all  other  territories   to

prevent  the  departure  of  residents  until  their

Income  Tax has been paid or a sufficient  guarantee

obtained for payment thereof.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> It is not clear, Sir, what

measures  the hon. Member has in mind. In  Australia

and New Zealand, where geographical position confers

a  distinct  advantage, there is  a  system  of  tax

clearances  whereby shipping and aircraft  operators

are   prohibited  from  issuing  passenger   tickets

without   the  production  of  a  certificate   that

outstanding income tax has been paid. Limited  forms

of  this  system  exist in India, Pakistan  and  the

United  States, but Ceylon relies on the same powers

as  exist  in the Malayan Income Tax Ordinance.  The

possibility of introducing a system similar to  that

existing  in Australia and New Zealand has been  considered  on a number of occasions. On each occasion,

however, it has been decided not to proceed with the

proposal for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the ease with which a really determined tax

evader can leave the territory without

purchasing a passenger ticket;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the large number of transit passengers visiting

Singapore for varying periods and the

very  large number of residents who leave  Singapore

for varying periods;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the difficulty of providing the comparatively

large staff which would be required to

enforce  such a system at a time when the Department

is still having the greatest difficulty in obtaining

staff for the assessment and collection of tax  from

resident individuals and companies;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the cost of enforcing the system in terms of

cash   and   diverted   effort   which   would    be

disproportionate to the amount of tax recovered;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the great inconvenience which would be caused

to   a  great  number  of  law-abiding  citizens  of

Singapore  who  have  to  leave  the  territory   on

business from time to time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I would ask

whether  the Financial Secretary would consider,  in

view of the grave position disclosed by the figures,

the   immediate  introduction  of  provisions  which

prevent a person, who has been in Singapore for more

than three months, leaving Malaya - this must be a pan-Malayan measure - without a clearance from the Malayan

income tax authorities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> First of all, Sir, the position is not

grave.  The figures which I quoted in answer to  the

first  question  indicate  quite  clearly  that  the

Income Tax Department is very rapidly getting on top

of  this  particular problem. We are at the  present

moment considering amending the Income Tax Ordinance

to  give  power  to  the Comptroller  to  call  upon

employers to make returns of employees joining their

organisations    and   employees    leaving    their

organisations  and to give warning of the  impending

departure of employees. Any system whereby  shipping

and  aircraft  operators who are  required  to  have

income tax clearance certificates before they  issue

passenger tickets would require joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



action on the part of the Federation. Whether the

Federation would be prepared to join hands with us

in this matter, I cannot say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, would the Financial Secretary

seek  an  agreement  with  the  Federation  on  this

matter?  Leaving it as it is is a direct incentive  and

encouragement  to  the  non-domiciled  residents  to

cheat income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I will certainly discuss with the

Federation the possibility of introducing such a

system as the hon. Member wishes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you.

<div align="center"><b>LUXURY TAX BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for second reading read.



<br><br>10.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have  His  Excellency  the Governor's  authority  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is a complicated Bill. As hon. Members

will see from the Comparative Table which appears on

page   25,  the  Law  Officers,  in  drafting,  have

referred extensively to United Kingdom Finance Acts,

thus taking advantage of the long experience of  the

United  Kingdom in the matter of luxury and purchase

taxes.  The explanatory note at page 23 of the  Bill

serves  as  a  useful  guide  to  these  provisions.

Perhaps  I may be allowed to outline some  of  them,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I contains definitions which require careful

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II calls for no comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III is most important. It deals with the

nature  and  scope  and method of  imposition  of  a

luxury  tax.  Clause 8 (1)  prescribes that  the  tax

should  be  charged on the wholesale  value  of  all

chargeable  goods bought under chargeable purchases.

The Governor in Council is vested with the power  of

deciding what goods shall be subject to tax  and  at

what  rates. Any order in this connection,  however,

must  be ratified by the Assembly within seven days.

Clause  8 (4)  defines a chargeable purchase as  "any

purchase   made   from  a  wholesale   merchant   or

manufacturer  selling by wholesale". Purchases  made

by  a  registered wholesale merchant or a registered

manufacturer  of goods as stock for business  or  as

materials  are  exempt  from  tax.  Clause   8   (5)

specifies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



that  the  tax  will become due on delivery  of  the

goods  under  the purchase and the seller  shall  be

accountable  for tax. Clause 8 (6)  states  that  tax

will  be  charged  on  the wholesale  value  of  all

chargeable  goods  imported into the  colony  except

goods imported by registered wholesale merchants  or

manufacturers. Clause 8 (7)  states the circumstances

and conditions under which goods may be imported tax

free   by   registered   wholesale   merchants   and

manufacturers. Clause 8 (9)  exempts from  tax  goods

imported for re-export or transhipment under certain

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 defines "wholesale value" as the price

which, in the opinion of the Comptroller, the  goods

would  fetch  on  a sale by wholesale  in  the  open

market in the Colony to a retail trader carrying  on

business  in the Colony and if it were made  in  the

circumstances specified in the First Schedule to the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 deals with the registration of wholesale

merchants and manufacturers whose business  includes

the  selling of any chargeable goods. Clause 10  (2)

provides that a manufacturer who is not required  to

be  registered  under  the  Ordinance  shall  be  so

registered if he satisfies the Comptroller  that  he

uses  chargeable goods in substantial quantities  as

materials.  Clause 10 (3)  provides that persons  who

should  be registered must make application  to  the

Comptroller.  Clause  10  (4)   provides   that   any

wholesale  merchant or manufacturer who  finds  that

the  proviso to clause 10 (1)  no longer  applies  to

him,   shall  immediately  apply  for  registration.

Clause   10  (6)   provides  for  the  issue   of   a

certificate of registration, and the Comptroller may

in  certain circumstances call for security for  the

payment of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 contains provisions whereby the

Comptroller  shall exempt a person from registration

when the tax on his purchases shall be not less than

the  tax on his sales; in other words, where the tax

payable on his purchases and importations in respect

of  stock or materials would be more than the tax he

would be accountable for on his sales.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 prescribes when a purchase shall be

deemed   a  purchase  by  a  registered  wholesale

merchant  as stock or by a registered manufacturer

as materials, and therefore exempt from tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 provides for relief against a double

charge of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 states that, where a registered

wholesale merchant or manufacturer appropriates or

applies  any chargeable goods in his ownership  to

the purposes of any business carried on by him  of

selling  chargeable goods by retail or of  letting

out  chargeable  goods on hire  or  to  any  other

purpose  not  being  a  sale  of  the  goods,  the

appropriation or application shall be  treated  as

if it were a chargeable purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (1) prescribes that, when any person

required  to  be registered applies  a  chargeable

process,  tax shall be chargeable on the wholesale

value of the resulting goods and shall become  due

on  the completion of the process. The person  who

applies  the process shall be accountable for  the

tax.  Clause  15 (2)  exempts persons who  apply  a

chargeable  process  from accountability  for  tax

when the goods are his property at the time of the

completion of the process, subject, of course,  to

the provisions of clause 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 provides that any person who carries

out  a  chargeable process shall be treated  as  a

manufacturer whose business includes  the  selling

of chargeable goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 states that any retail trader

purchasing  on a wholesale scale shall be  treated

as a wholesale merchant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 states that the seller of chargeable

goods  under a chargeable purchase shall  add  the

amount due in tax to any invoice issued by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides relief for exported goods.

Under  subclause  (1)  the Comptroller  may  exempt

from tax goods which would otherwise be chargeable

if  they  were  exported from  the  colony.  Under

subclause  (2)   the Financial Secretary  may  give

directions for the payment of an allowance for tax

paid  or payable in respect of goods exported when

the  Comptroller is satisfied that the  conditions

specified in the subclause exist.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, Sir, that the Bill gives wide

powers  to  the administration. Any goods  can  be

deemed luxury goods and any rate of tax imposed on

them  by  the  Governor  in Council,  subject,  of

course, to the approval of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Comptroller of Customs, who is

responsible  for  the care and management  of  the

tax,  is  given  wide powers  under  a  number  of

clauses.   The  wide  discretion  given   to   the

Comptroller has apparently been a cause of anxiety

to   the  Bar  Council  which  has  addressed  the

Attorney-General and other Members of the Assembly

on  the  subject. In particular, the  Bar  Council

takes  objection to the Comptroller's powers under

clauses 9, 17 and 26. Note has been taken of these

objections   and  they  will  be   given   careful

consideration  in due course, and  doubtless  when

this Bill is sent to Select Committee, the Members

of  the  Committee will consider their  objections

too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also given consideration to the

question of local industries and has decided, as a

measure  of encouragement, to exempt from tax  all

goods entirely manufactured locally and also goods

in  respect of which a certain percentage of their

wholesale  value  has been expended  locally.  The

necessary amendments to the text of the Bill  will

be moved in Committee in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justification for this Bill is that Government

will  have  to tap all sources of revenue  in  the

future,   and  luxury  goods  appear   to   be   a

justifiable source of revenue. As I said  earlier,

very  considerable sums of money  are  spent  each

year on goods which cannot, by any stretch of  the

imagination,   be   deemed   essential   or   even

desirable.  If confirmation of this  statement  is

required, one has only to look about one,  in  the

shop  windows, in the homes of people in Singapore

and   at  people  proceeding  about  their  lawful

occasions. That being so, it is only proper that

Government  should have some small  share  of  the

sums  spent  on luxury goods. A great majority  of

countries in the world today impose taxes on goods

which are outside the "essential" category. In the

great majority of cases, the tax is imposed on the

wholesale price.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be possible to give any estimate of

the possible yield from this tax until it is decided

what commodities should be taxed. In selecting goods

to  be taxed, careful consideration will be given to

the  nature and needs of the entrepot trade.  In  so

far as it is possible, having regard to the needs of

the  revenue, goods which enter largely  into  trade

with  neighbouring countries will be avoided.  Where

entrepot  trade  goods have to be included,  efforts

will be made to reduce inconvenience to traders to a

minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to be expected that this Bill would be a

controversial  measure. It is novel and  involves  a

radical  departure from previous taxation principles

in  Singapore. For these reasons, it was decided  to

allow  a period of time to elapse between the  First

and  Second  Readings and subsequently to  send  the

Bill  to  Select  Committee. This  will  allow  full

ventilation of views and discussion as to the merits

and  principles underlying the Bill, both in and out

of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with discussion outside the

Assembly, it has been suggested that the Bill  means

the  death  of  free trade in Singapore,  and,  that

being  so,  that  it  would  be  simpler  and   more

straightforward to impose import duties right  away.

It  certainly  would be simpler,  but  it  would  be

contrary    to   the   intentions   of   Government.

Singapore's prosperity has been built on trade  and,

no  matter what industrial expansion takes place  in

the  future,  will continue to depend on  trade,  on

free  trade  and on freedom to trade. Government  is

fully  aware  of the need not only to  maintain  but

also to increase trade. As I have said earlier,  all

Government's  development planning starts  from  the

premise  that  Singapore must  be  maintained  as  a

centre of world trade. In the circumstances,  it  is

extremely  unlikely that this Government, or  indeed

any government except one bent on the destruction of

Singapore,   would  introduce  any   law   or   make

regulations  under such a law which would  undermine

the prosperity of the port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that hon. Members will speak frankly on

this  measure so that their views can be  considered

by  the  Select Committee and by Government  in  due

course. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  before us a Bill to tax luxury goods. Whatever

its  name,  it is a fundamental departure  from  the

free  trade policy of Singapore which has  continued

for  over  a  century.  Sir, I hope  the  Government

Members  will  forgive me if I am harsh  with  them.

They  have  just come into power and that  power  of

minority  has  been exercised with three  ex-officio

Members and four nominated Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already said that there will be

new  elections in August. If that is so, is it  wise

on  their part to push through such a Bill which  is

just  like committing a crime on Singapore? It is  a

departure from principles and that is why I  say  it

is a crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I might also say that the present Coalition

Government  cannot  claim that  they  represent  the

trading interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> We do not.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> They will say, "Why? We do not

care."  But I will say this: as Singapore exists  on

entrepot  trade,  it  is trade that  brings  in  the

money,  and  the workers, the wage-earners  and  the

farmers  can only flourish by working together  hand

in   hand.  We  have  no  natural  resources,   none

whatsoever.  How  far  and to  what  extent  is  the

Government  going to tax? There is a  limit  and  we

have  reached  this  limit - that  the  Government  is

forced,  by  their extravagance, to  kill  the  free

trade policy of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is luxury? The term "luxury goods" has

not  been defined. If the Government wants to  bring

in  a  few  items  under this category,  as  it  has

already  done with motor-cars, by all means  describe

what  are  luxury goods and place an  imposition  on

them. But to pass this Bill and give such powers  to

the Government or any future government, there is  a

danger  that  it  might  mishandle  the  powers  and

everything  might be included under the category  of

luxury goods, because money is necessary to run  the

government.  It  is  said that  safeguards  will  be

provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



which  will ensure that the Government will  not  do

this  or  that  in  order to preserve  our  entrepot

trade. What is the guarantee that another government

will  not do this or that since the Ordinance is  in

force?  We on the Opposition Benches are not willing

to give such powers to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to produce money you have to spend first on

starting  a  department. You have  to  have  a  vast

establishment.  You have to have  bonded  warehouses

ultimately if not immediately. This is necessary  if

money  is  to  come in. We must have inspectors  and

clerks,  etc. for these warehouses. Then,  Sir,  we

have to guard against corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been in business here since 1916. I

have  been  President  of  the  Indian  Chamber   of

Commerce   for  several  years.  I  have   been   to

E.C.A.F.E. conferences and I have heard  about  the

trading  conditions of other countries  and  I  have

compared   ours  with  theirs.  With   what   little

experience  that I have, I would urge the Government

not  to  proceed with this Bill. I am glad that  the

Financial  Secretary has said that  some  time  will

elapse  before  this measure will be brought  before

the  Assembly  and that a Select Committee  will  be

appointed  to consider it. All this is good,  but  I

would  ask,  "Why is all this necessary?"  How  much

more  money is wanted during the next 8 months while

this  Government remains in power? It can raise  the

money by income tax or any other tax but not by this

Luxury Tax Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, who will suffer as a result of the imposition

of  this  luxury tax on goods? The majority  of  the

population on this small island are the workers  and

wage-earners. Sir, I have never been personal in  my

remarks,  but I would like to quote the  remarks  of

the  Minister for Communications and Works  which  I

read  yesterday in the Press. I was not present when

he  was speaking. Sir, I have great respect for  the

school-master's knowledge in theory -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Whose side?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Government side. It was very interesting to hear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



his arguments on socialism and so on, but let  me

remind   him.   He   said  yesterday,   subject   to

correction,  that  there  was  no  need   for   gold

ornaments or something like that which I read in the

Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Thomas)</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member giving way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> What I said yesterday was that it was

desirable  to  mobilise all hoardings of  unfruitful

capital used up in gold ornaments or in dollar notes

tucked  away in cupboards and not put to  productive

use.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you; I would say that the

Europeans  can  never understand the  Asian  way  of

life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Exactly!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It is a necessity for a poor man

to  save  some money and because he has insufficient

money to open a bank account, he invests his savings

in  gold  ornaments. The Minister also  spoke  about

remittances to India and China, but he forgot to say

that  billions of dollars have been drained away  to

the United Kingdom for 135 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have asked, "What are luxury goods?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Ask yourself!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Everyone in Singapore uses scent,

soaps, cosmetics, radios and refrigerators. They are

necessities  to  the  wage-earner,  the  clerk,  the

merchant or the rich man. By introducing this  Bill,

the  Labour Front Coalition Government, which claims

to   be  representative  of  the  workers,  will  be

imposing  hardship on them. It would be a fine  idea

if  the  Government,  after bringing  in  this  Bill

before  the Assembly, were not to proceed  with  it.

Orders  must  have been placed or  goods  have  been

hoarded  by  profiteers, and  if  the  Bill  is  not

proceeded  with, the benefit will go to  the  public

because  these  profiteers will have to  sell  their

goods at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



a  cheaper price. In any case, during the next eight

months  while  the Government remains in  power,  it

will not do any good and it is not necessary for  it

to introduce this Bill. But if the necessity arises,

then  let  a fully elected government by the  people

and  for  the people take the necessary measures  to

introduce  a  similar kind of Bill if  it  finds  it

necessary.  Sir, in conclusion, I would request  the

Government  not to proceed with this Bill  which  is

not in the interests of the colony or the masses  or

anyone else.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I support

this measure unreservedly. The Member for Telok Ayer

says - and  he speaks rightly - that there is no  person

on this side of the House who represents trade. That

is true, Sir, but I would also add that though we do

not  represent trade, we are and have  always  shown

ourselves  to  be very conscious of  the  fact  that

Singapore  survives  by virtue of  the  activity  of

capital through trade and commerce in this territory

and  that our record does indicate that we have been

conscious of this, and we are anxious that  no  harm

shall be done to this aspect of our economic life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the Member for Telok Ayer's

fears  are grounded on the fact that Government  has

not  shown  its  hand as to what it believes  or  it

considers  to  be  luxuries; but I  would  draw  his

attention  to this, Sir: this Bill is in the  nature

of  the  overall law which will control the  tax  on

luxuries,  but in fact the luxuries will be  defined

when the tax is applied; and seven days after it  is

applied,  this  House  will  have  to  confirm   the

decision. That is necessary, Sir, so that this  step

should, first of all, be progressive, and, secondly,

we  cannot  now disclose what is in mind before  the

Bill  is  passed and thereby gives the  importer  an

opportunity to pile up goods which may or may not be

taxed afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that the question of

taxation on individual objects, subject to this  tax

proposed by Government, is still in the hands of the

House; and supposing we bring in a tax on radios  in

two or three months' time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



then  within  seven  days this House  will  have  to

decide  whether or not radios are a luxury,  and  if

they  are,  whether they are appropriate objects  in

the  existing  circumstances for the application  of

this tax. The House, in giving these overall powers,

is  in fact not giving power for application of this

tax  to  individual articles. It is  retaining  that

power  and can exercise it when the Government comes

before  the House seeking confirmation of its desire

to tax any particular type of object.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to learn that this Bill will go

before a Select Committee. It is a good measure  and

it  should,  as soon as possible, be on our  statute

book. But it is a difficult measure, a measure  full

of      acute     technical     subtleties,      and

representations - some of which seem  very  valid - have

been  made  by  the Bar Committee with reference  to

various aspects. I think that a Select Committee  is

certainly  appropriate to consider  each  and  every

individual  phrase in the Bill, and  I  welcome  the

suggestion made by the Financial Secretary that this

Bill will, in fact, if it passes its Second Reading,

be submitted to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one other remark to make on this

measure,  Sir. I  welcome  the  statement  of   the

Financial Secretary that local industry will receive

direct  encouragement by the exemption, in part,  of

those   taxable  luxury  goods  which  are  produced

locally.  I would like to go further. Our industrial-set up is in an extremely poor condition and I would

like a large measure of assistance where possible to

be given to it, and in this instance it is possible.

I  would like to see all luxury products, which  are

subject  to  this  tax, exempted  from  taxation  if

produced  locally.  I  also welcome  the  indication

given by the Financial Secretary that products which

are even partially produced in this colony, that is,

in  respect of which part of the cost is incurred in

this   colony,  will  be  considered   for   partial

exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a good measure, a necessary measure,

a  well-thought out measure, and I say with  respect

to  the  Member for Telok Ayer that I really do  not

see  how it can affect our entrepot trade. The basis

of our entrepot trade is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



produce  from the East and the essentials  from  the

West in which we deal. Luxury goods as such form but

a  very  small proportion of our trade and  we  have

been  promised special arrangements for the entrepot

trade in these luxury goods so that it would not  in

any way be impeded.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

objections  to  this Bill are three-fold.  Firstly,

any tax measure which endangers the free port status

and the entrepot trade of Singapore is a bad measure

and I am not convinced by the assurances of the hon.

Gentlemen  opposite  that this will  not  have  this

effect. Secondly, the tax on certain luxuries, while

intending to tax the rich, may, by a chain reaction,

result  in raising the cost of living for  the  poor

man  as well. Thirdly, such a tax reduces the buying

and selling of goods and the contraction in trade in

an  island  which  lives or dies  by  trade  can  be

suicidal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that of all the definitions or

interpretations  which are made under  clause  3  of

this  Bill,  there  is  no definition  of  the  most

important term of all, the term "luxury". This makes

us  extremely suspicious of Government's intentions.

Only  yesterday  I pointed out that  small  cars  in

certain  circumstances  are  necessities.   As   the

pressure  of  population increases, people  have  to

live  further  from their offices and  from  schools

while  the  public transport system lags  inevitably

further   and   further  behind  this   development.

Therefore   it  is  essential  that  the   Financial

Secretary  should  give us a list  of  the  articles

which  he has in mind to tax and a list beyond which

he  will in no circumstances go. Who knows otherwise

whether textiles and clothing will not be counted as

luxuries  in  time  to come? In his  speech  on  the

Second   Reading  of  the  Appropriation  Bill   the

Financial Secretary stated as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the imposition of luxury taxes were to

limit  consumption  of luxury  goods,  I  should  be

perfectly  happy  since  it  would  mean  that   the

population saved more and had more to invest in  the

Government loans...".



<br><br>This is a dangerously over-simplified argument and I

am inclined to think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



that  the savings would go, according to taste, into

company  shares, gold and jewellery or into  lottery

tickets.  It  is as dangerous as the other  argument

that  if you tax luxuries, you are necessarily  only

taxing  the  rich, an error into which the  Minister

for Commerce and Industry fell yesterday. Very often

you will find that from such taxation it is the poor

man  who  in  the end is to suffer. Let me  give  an

example.  The Financial Secretary has  given,  as  I

have said, no indication what the Government regards

as  luxuries,  but  a  little  intelligent  guessing

suggests  that  refrigerators  and  air-conditioning

sets might be on a short list of possibilities. Now,

raising  the  price on these articles will  restrict

sales  and, as a result of this, the consumption  of

electricity will drop; and it will drop  during  the

20  hours outside the peak period from 6 to 10 p.m.,

or,  precisely,  during those 20 hours  when  it  is

essential  to sell as much electricity as  possible.

Let it not be forgotten that it is the purchasers of

refrigerators  and air-conditioning sets  who  spend

more  on  electricity, and are therefore helping  to

keep down the price per unit of consumption. To make

a   complete  generalisation -  abolish  all   luxury

electrical  appliances and the price  the  poor  man

pays  for  his electric light will go up.  Encourage

the sale of these appliances by enabling more people

to  buy them and to use electricity, and it will  be

possible  to  lower the unit rate for  lighting  and

lower the cost of living for the working man. May  I

quote  a  sentence  from  the  1955  Report  of  the

Electricity Department of the City Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As usual, emphasis must he placed upon the fact

that  only  by increased revenue from  the  sale  of

electrical   energy   can  this  Department   safely

extinguish the various loans to which we  have  been

committed  through  the  necessary  construction  of

Pasir Panjang Power Station."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give this example as a warning to

Government  to  study  very  carefully  what   chain

reaction can be set up by an ill-considered tax.  It

is  part and parcel of what I already said yesterday

regarding  the  dangers of the inflationary  spiral.

The luxury tax, while on the face of it means taxing

the  rich without affecting the poor, can upset  the

economy  of the country to its foundations.  It  can

raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



the  cost  and  lower the standard of living,  which

would  be  fatal.  Just  when  the  wage-earner  has

obtained  better living conditions to  which  he  is

entitled  and  brings  within his  reach  the  extra

comforts  of  life,  it  appears  that  the  present

Government will put a tax on them to take  them  out

of  his  reach.  It  reminds  me  of  the  story  of

Sisyphus, the Greek legendary king who was condemned

in  Hades  to  roll a stone up to  the  top  of  the

mountain,  and  when he laboured to  the  peak,  the

stone rolled down again and he had to start all over

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seems to me to be the thin end of a

wedge. Once it is approved in principle on the basis

of  certain  types  of luxury  goods,  there  is  no

knowing  what  will  come within the  definition  of

"luxuries" in the future.



<br><br>10.48 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather surprised

that   a  Party  which  claims  to  have  the   word

"Socialist" as part of its name would be opposed  to

a  measure which any socialist-thinking person would

welcome,  a  measure  that is  intended  to  extract

painlessly - I  can  say  it  because   it   is   slow

extraction - a  little  bit  of  money - not  very  much

because   the   burden  does   not   fall   on   one

individual - to  pay  for the social  services  to  be

provided for the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main argument, Sir, that has been advocated

against this Bill has been one of departure from our

free  trade policy. Sir, I have emphasised  in  this

House in the past this obsession with the free trade

policy  of  Singapore can be carried too  far.  Sir,

there  is no doubt that we survive on trade, and  it

is  the duty of every government that is in power in

this  country to see that nothing is done that  will

hamper  or discourage our entrepot trade. But,  Sir,

there  is a limit to which this principle should  be

carried,  and I say that with some people this  free

trade  principle  has become an obsession.  Economic

conditions have changed and are changing every  day.

We  are  not in the position as we were before.  The

world   has  changed.  Asia  has  changed.  Economic

policies have changed. Politics have come into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



picture now. In order to survive, therefore, we must

see  that we shape our policy in accordance with the

times.  It  is  all very well to  say  that  we  are

killing  the free trade principle. We are not  doing

that.  In  fact,  we  want to preserve  as  much  as

possible our entrepot trade and to expand it as much

as  possible;  but it is dangerous to generalise  on

it.  We must know in which sphere our entrepot trade

lies  and what we can do outside this sphere without

harming our entrepot trade. We should be free to  do

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer said that the

Government  does  not  claim  to  represent  trading

interests.  Sir,  that  is  in  keeping   with   the

principle  of democracy that representation  in  the

House  of the people should be on a democratic basis

and  that there should be no reserved seats for  the

representatives  of  any  particular  interests.  In

fact,  the hon. Member has many times remarked  that

this  Government is not fully elected and that there

are  four nominated Members in this House and so  on

and  so  forth. Therefore, Sir, I do not see how  he

can  be moan the fact that trade is not represented.

But  I  can say this, Sir: that although I have  not

had  the  vast  amount of experience that  the  hon.

Member  has  in  trading spheres - I  am  younger  and

obviously,  therefore,  I have  not  had  that  much

experience as he has - I can claim that I do have some

experience  of trade and entrepot trade and  I  will

not  do anything that is going to harm our trade.  I

think  Members  on the Opposition side  should  rest

assured on that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One remark that the Member for Telok Ayer made, I

think,  calls for some consideration,  and  that  is

that  a future government might mishandle this power

which  we  are  seeking now. That is  a  possibility

which  we have to think over very carefully.  But  I

may  answer  that  point by  saying  that  a  future

government,  even  though  it  has  not   got   this

particular  power, can always ask for and  get  this

power  in a future House of the people. So there  is

nothing  to prevent any government bringing  in  any

measure which it likes provided it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



a  majority,  and therefore whether or not  we  give

this power to posterity is immaterial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin raised the point of what

are luxury goods and why we have not defined "luxury

goods".  Sir, it is a matter of opinion as  to  what

are luxury goods. It is a matter of the standard  of

living  of  the  people.  It  is  a  matter  of  the

environment and the upbringing and the residence  of

the  people. To us, what appears to be a luxury  may

be  a necessity to people who have a better standard

of  living,  for instance, to people in  the  United

States. Yet to us what appears to be a necessity may

be  a luxury to people living in Africa who probably

may not have seen it at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin has also stated that

there  may  be  a  chain reaction which  may  affect

electrical consumption if a luxury tax is imposed on

certain electrical appliances. That is a far-fetched

argument. There is always a chain reaction ending up

somewhere or other if you do anything in this world.

Something  is going to be affected by it.  So  I  am

sure  that  whether  this or  any  future  Socialist

government  brings in a measure for  raising  income

tax on the higher limits of income, say, from 40 per

cent  to  50  per  cent or even 60  per  cent,  that

particular  hon.  Member is going to  say  that  the

result  of  the  chain  reaction  will  be  to  kill

incentive,  and  therefore the activity  of  capital

will  be  dampened, and the man with money will  sit

tight  and  not invest his money, and therefore  the

labourer will not be able to get a job and so on and

so forth. That argument can be carried to any limit.

Then,   Sir,  the  Member  for  Tanglin  said   that

electrical consumption may be reduced as a result of

this  luxury tax. And yet what do we hear today?  We

hear that the City Council is going to spend another

$65  million on extensions or on the building  of  a

new power-station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the crux of the matter is: what items

are  going  to be included in the Luxury  Tax  Bill.

That  is  where hon. Members can debate bitterly  if

they feel that any item which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



Government  puts in the Schedule to this Bill  later

on  is not appropriate to be included there. But  to

denounce  the  general  principle  of  this  measure

because  they do not know what item is going  to  be

included  at  this stage is wrong.  I  commend  this

Bill,  Sir,  to hon. Members on both  sides  of  the

House.



<br><br>10.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in   spite   of  the  assurances  by  the  Financial

Secretary, the Member for Cairnhill and the Minister

for  Commerce and Industry, I am not convinced  that

this Bill will not affect the status of Singapore as

a free port. We all agree that we live by trade, and

now that our entrepot trade is diminishing in volume

due  to the producing countries exporting direct  to

Europe  and  America, and the Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry  has spoken about his  fears  for  the

expansion  of  our  industry in Singapore,  we  must

think twice before we do anything that may hurt  our

trade. The Minister for Commerce and Industry  seems

to  get  hot and bothered and has turned this debate

into a political issue, but we on our side want  to

put  before  the  House the views  of  the  traders,

particularly the small traders who do  most  of  the

entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has left the items intended to be taxed.

If  it  is confined to goods which are real luxuries

such as refrigerators and air-conditioning sets, the

tax  it  will bring in will not be worth the expense

of  setting  up a department to collect it  and  the

expense and trouble it will cost the wholesaler.  If

it  is intended to apply to many more items, then it

cannot  be a luxury tax and the fears of the  public

that  the list of taxable goods will be the same  as

that  of  the Federation will be justified, and  the

poor  man will suffer as much as those who can  best

bear  the  burden and upon whom it is intended  that

this  tax  should fall. This tax will hit the  small

traders  most.  Their business lies in  sending  out

various  kinds of goods to the small islands  around

us  in  exchange for produce. They cannot  afford  a

large staff to keep the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



records and fill the forms required by this  Bill.

It  is  a most complicated piece of machinery  and

even the Financial Secretary has admitted it,  and

members  of  the  Bar are greatly concerned  about

some of the anomalies already noticed. We are very

glad  indeed,  therefore, that this Bill  will  be

sent  to  Select Committee. Even many large  firms

have  expressed  their  opinion  to  me  that  the

working  out  of  this  tax  will  impose   almost

impossible conditions on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this luxury tax is to be imposed at all, it

should  be  at  the retail level and  not  at  the

wholesale  level,  which  is  the  medium  of  our

entrepot  trade. A measure like this,  imperilling

Singapore as a free port, can only be justified in

extremis,  that is, if there is no  other  way  in

which  finance can be found by the Government  for

the  running  of Singapore, and I am  not  at  all

satisfied that we are in that position yet, unless

we choose to kill the goose that lays the eggs.  I

have advisedly left out the word "golden".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the criticisms already expressed in

this  House yesterday, and I do not wish to repeat

them, we have many items of expenditure which  can

be  pruned and I shall attack these items  in  the

Committee  stage;  but I do solemnly  repeat  that

this  Bill, if passed, will do more harm than good

to Singapore.



<br><br>11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the speech on the Luxury Tax Bill delivered by the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary gave us  a  curious

feeling in the pit of our stomach! He was at great

pains  to emphasise that the people have the money

to spend on things other than the bare necessities

of life and they undoubtedly had, so he claimed it

was  therefore,  only  right that  the  Government

should  have a fair share of it. This argument  is

not  only  unconvincing but dangerous.  In  simple

Queen's English, it means that "what is your's  is

mine".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Singapore fully appreciate the

fact  that  Government needs all  the  revenue  it

could  get,  but they do feel that  the  intricate

matter of luxury tax must be debated, talked about

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



challenged lest they would suffer the consequences

of    the    Hon. the   Financial   Secretary's

indiscretion.  In  the  words  of  the  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary, the Luxury tax demanded  and

expected is to be partly determined by a mere look

at the shop windows rather than by a careful study

of  the  "earning  and  paying  abilities  of  the

people". The income of the majority of the  people

of  Singapore ranges between $2,500 and $4,000 per

annum,  and  I would draw the urgent attention  of

Government  that  these wage-earners  are  at  all

times  so  poor that they cannot afford  to  spend

money on one thing without depriving themselves of

something  else. It is not hard for Government  to

understand also that the purchase of even  a  tiny

gold  locket does add zest to a wage-earner's life

and   that   the  possession  of  a  wrist   watch

constitutes a social distinction, being the  first

step  upward  in  the  economic  progress  of  the

country. Our business houses are doing an enormous

entrepot trade in Singapore with a wide variety of

merchandise and the result of a luxury tax will be

to  destroy  our entrepot trade, thus killing  the

goose  that  lays the golden eggs,  if  Government

insists on collecting this tax at wholesale  level

based   on  wholesale  prices.  Let  us  be   more

realistic  and  look at some of the  major  snags.

Local  wholesale prices will undoubtedly rise  and

the   immediate  effect  is  to  drive  away   our

customers  from  the  neighbouring  countries   to

Hongkong  or  elsewhere where  they  could  obtain

their  requirements at very much  cheaper  prices.

Business  in Singapore will eventually be  reduced

to  a  "retailer-to-consumer" basis only  and  the

entrepot  trade will virtually be at a standstill.

In  a country which thrives solely on its entrepot

trade  and  where  a  negligible  portion  of  the

imported  goods  are  actually  consumed  by   its

people,  the  proposed luxury tax  will  serve  no

useful  purpose  except  to  bring  chaos  to  the

country. Singapore import houses will, as a result

of the introduction of the luxury tax, arrange for

shipments of their agency lines of goods direct to

the   buyers   outside  Singapore,  and   thus   a

considerable  portion of the trade will  bypass

Singapore.  In  due course, Government  will  have

very much less revenues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



from  taxes on profits and personal income.  Heavier

taxes  will eventually fall on the shoulders of  the

average   man-in-the-street,  which  must  ultimately

cause  widespread  demands for higher  wages. I would

draw  the attention of the hon. Member of this House

that  another round of wage increases, unaccompanied

by  corresponding increases in entrepot trade or the

local  industries, is pound to seriously  upset  our

economy,  Thus crippling our prospects for  merdeka.

This Luxury Tax Bill is a hara kiri or suicide Bill.



<br><br>11.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

a  believer  in  socialism, I rise  to  support  the

principles of this Bill, but at the same time I wish

to  remind  hon. Members on both sides of the  house

that  there  are at least two points which  we  must

bear  in  mind. We have been hearing all  this  time

about  the  argument on the entrepot trade  and  the

free  port  status of this island. I wonder  whether

the  Members of this House will admit that it  is  a

fact  that  experience  has shown  that  Singapore's

entrepot  trade  and its status as a  free  port  is

quickly  passing.  We  expect  to  produce  our  own

products   and  export  them  to  other   countries,

including,  of  course,  our  brother  country,  the

Federation  of  Malaya. But whether  this  state  of

affairs  will  continue  is  a  question  that  hon.

Members will have to answer for themselves.  For  my

part, I believe it will not continue. Sir, I find it

rather  hard to understand why, especially  when  we

are  faced  with difficulties of expansion  and  the

encouragement   of   our   local   industries,   the

Federation  of Malaya should impose so many  tariffs

upon  our  products. Further, we now have Indonesia,

Thailand  and Burma, which for many years have  been

our chief customers, closing their doors upon us one

by  one. Therefore, we should not rely too much  and

always on our entrepot trade or the free port status

of Singapore, especially since all political Parties

in  this House now believe in socialism. It is  high

time  for us to tell the people the truth,  that  we

must now work hard, spend less and try to save more.

Therefore this Bill is, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



think,  most timely. The people of Singapore  should

realise  the critical situation that lies ahead  and

work hard and save more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to know is what items

will be classified as luxury goods. The question  of

small cars was argued yesterday and today. Sir, last

night  I  happened to attend a high society marriage

dinner  party. A friend of mine was telling me  that

his  wife had been grumbling, that she loved the new

model  of the Singer sports car very much, and  that

she insisted on her husband booking one immediately.

Sir,  I  understand the Singer sports car is in  the

category  of a small saloon car. I know this  family

very  well. The husband has a big Custom-build  Ford

car  which sends him to and from office and his wife

has a small Fiat car which she uses for shopping and

marketing.  And  now this beautiful and  lucky  lady

insists that they must have another car, a beautiful

Singer sports car, for night driving!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I rise to support the principles of this

Bill  and  welcome  the statement of  the  Financial

Secretary  that  it  will  be  sent  to   a   Select

Committee. I wish to point out that not only must  a

Select  Committee  be  appointed  to  consider  this

Luxury  Tax Bill but it must go to work on  it  very

quickly. It should not let the deliberations drag on

so  that  the  operation of  this  measure  will  be

delayed.  The  present  caretaker  Government,  even

though  it  will remain in office for the  next  few

months only, should pass this measure quickly. Since

all  political Parties believe in socialism, let  us

be  honest and admit that a tax on luxury  goods  is

very essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister rising on a point

made by the hon. Member in his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. The Member for

Changi  just now touched on the tariffs  imposed  by

the Federation on Singapore products. I did indicate

to this House yesterday that I was greatly disturbed

by  this development, but I said the solution was  a

political one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  term  "luxury  tax" is a  very  beautiful  one

indeed.  In fact, when they talk about the  tax  on

luxury  goods, the people of Singapore  will  think

that  they  are  not going to be  affected  by  it.

However,  because there is no naming  of  goods  in

the  Schedule  to  the Bill, nobody  knows  exactly

what  type of goods will come under the definitions

of  this  Bill. The Hon. the Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry said that it is a matter of  opinion,

and,  of  course, that matter of opinion  will  lie

with  the  Comptroller of Customs, or  probably  it

will  be  decided after some of the  Ministers  get

together  and  say, "We will define this  and  that

and the other."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Clause 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> All right, we have clause 3,

but  even  with  this  clause, it  is  possible  the

Government may change its mind every now  and  then.

Today it says it is having a deficit of $34 million.

Next year it will put in the Estimates a deficit  of

$50  million and then, in order to raise that money,

it  says  it must add on to the Schedule  of  luxury

goods  other items. That is why, Sir, when  we  talk

about luxury goods, it is important to know where we

will  stop. Yesterday I said that if you confine  it

to  such  items as air-conditioning sets and radios,

that  seems to be quite acceptable to the people  of

Singapore  at  large. As a matter of fact,  when  we

talk  about  radios, there are big  ones  and  small

ones.  There are radios that are purchased by people

who  have plenty of money to spare and to throw away

too;  but  there  are  also small  radios  that  are

usually purchased by the ordinary wage-earners. When

I  came to jewellery yesterday, Sir, and there again

I say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member give way?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Serangoon has

been  placing  so  much emphasis  on  the  expression

"ordinary  wage-earner". What is an  ordinary  wage-earner, Sir? Can he define him in terms of dollars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. By "ordinary wage-earner", I must exclude, first and foremost, all

Ministers because, although they draw salaries, they

draw  very high salaries, and, of course, I  exclude

managerial   staff;  but  I  include  the   ordinary

clerical  staffs  working in most  firms,  the  City

Council  and  the government offices,  whose  salary

range  will be somewhere between $150 and  $400  per

month. People drawing these salaries will be, in  my

opinion,  ordinary wage-earners. I also include,  of

course, workmen who earn about $4 to $5 a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking just now about jewellery, and

mention  of  it  brings to mind  diamonds  and  very

expensive  brooches and so on - that I think everybody

will agree - but when you come down to other items  of

jewellery which must necessarily be included if  the

word "jewellery" is added to the Schedule, then  you

will  have  such  things as  small  gold  rings  and

bangles.  Sir,  the Minister for Communications  and

Works  said that people should not keep their  money

in gold but should put their money to better use - put

it  into circulation, invest in government loans.  I

put it to you, Sir, that we must not always look  at

a problem from our own point of view, but we must be

able to look at it from the point of view of the man

in the street. Of course, to us it would be silly to

lock  up $50 in the form of a gold bangle or a  gold

ring; but to these people, if they put this money in

the  Post  Office Savings Bank and if they  want  to

make  use of it at one time or other, they will find

that  they have to take a bit of time and some form-

filling before they can get the money back, and they

do  not  like  this.  It is a  difficulty  that  any

illiterate will try to avoid. You can say that  they

should,  of course, keep it in a bank, but  we  know

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



bankers  do not work free for people with less  than

$500 in the bank. The banks impose a surcharge of, I

think,  $5  per half-year and so these  people  find

that   their   money,  instead  of  increasing,   is

dwindling  on  account of having to  pay  a  tax  on

cheques  and again they have to contend  with  other

difficulties.  Therefore, Sir, the small  man  saves

his  money and invests it in gold - it is his  savings

bank - and if he ever wants money, he just goes to the

pawnshop  and  pawns it. So if the item  "jewellery"

should come within the Schedule, it will affect  the

poor workers indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at the problem from another

angle.  Today it is the intention of every political

Party to raise the standard of living of the average

man  in  Singapore.  It is now accepted,  Sir,  that

ordinary   things  such  as  small   radios,   small

refrigerators  and some transport facilities  should

become  essential to everybody, and if we  can  give

the  workers  all these things, we will  be  raising

their standard of living. This Bill, in effect, Sir,

would  be  to  try  and exclude  these  people  from

getting what we want them to get in order to improve

their standard of living. In this connection, Sir, I

would say that there are many clerks and workers who

strive very bravely to improve their condition. They

strive  to  get a house. They strive to get  a  car.

They  strive to get a radio. They strive  to  get  a

refrigerator.  I  say "strive", Sir,  because  these

people  cannot  really afford to  pay  outright  for

these items. So what do they do? They go along to  a

company  and  ask for a loan and they  pay  back  in

installments - I say "installments" - so that even  such

goods cannot be purchased on the basis of what  they

can pay. They have to save and stint in order to buy

them,  and probably out of money loaned to  them  at

interest. If we are to put more difficulties in  the

way  of  people in this category, Sir, then  we  are

putting difficulties in the way of those who  strive

to  raise their own standard of living, which I hope

is our aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now come to the principle of the Bill.

My  friends and colleagues have said that  Singapore

is a free port and up to today we have enjoyed that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



status.  In fact, we have been patting ourselves  on

the  back  all this time, saying that the Federation

is putting a tax on cloth, a tax on cosmetics, a tax

on  this and that, and we are still free from it. If

this  Bill is passed by the present Government, then

I  think the people will know that the loss of  such

facilities  and  the  loss of  the  ability  to  pat

themselves  on  the back again is the  work  of  the

present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that we must try and extract

money  painlessly for our social services. That  was

said  by  the  Hon. the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry.  With all that I have described before,  I

say  that the largest amount of money will be coming

from the people who are working, and I maintain that

stand,  Sir. A rich man will buy one radio.  A  poor

man  will buy one radio. There may be 19,000  people

who pay income tax and could be regarded as well-to-do,  but  the  remainder of  the  1,200,000  of  our

population, Sir, who do not pay income tax - and many

of  them  come under the category of people who  are

not  well-to-do - strive to buy radios.  Look  up  the

radio  licences and if you can tell me that most  of

those  people  who buy radios are the  rich  people,

then  I  am ready to agree with the Government  that

the  tax on luxuries will be on the rich and not the

poor.  In effect, Sir, this goes back to the Chinese

axiom  that if you want wool, it must come from  the

body  of the sheep. If you want any social services,

you  must pay for them. If the people, according  to

the  aims  of  the Labour Front, are to  get  higher

social services, then the payment for them must  not

come  from  the rich people. It must come  from  the

working  people. This is the essence  of  the  Bill,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Only poor people buy luxuries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> They strive to buy, Sir, as I

have  told the House, with money loaned to them  and

on  an  installment basis. Tell me,  Sir,  if  I  am

wrong,  that these people who buy goods on loan  and

pay installments are rich people, and if that is so,

then I am sure the Oxford Dictionary is wrong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Liberal-Socialists are wrong!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> They are absolutely right.

Then  we  have another remark that many  people  are

obsessed  by  the term "free trade".  In  fact,  the

Minister  said  that we have changed,  and  we  have

changed  because of politics, and because  of  these

changes, we must have more taxation. The position of

Singapore today is, he said, different from that  in

1951. I agree with him, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, we have changed, but we

have  changed from a position where we  were  strong

and   where   we  had  the  Federation  asking   us,

"Singapore,  would you join us? Could  we  be  equal

partners?",  to a position today where  we  ask  the

Federation,  "Could we be allowed to  come  in?"  We

have  now come to the position whereby when we knock

at the door, it is not opened to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You slammed it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We are now, Sir, licking the

hands of the Federation.



<br><br>[Interruption.].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I come to this point, Sir,

because  if anybody ever dares to say that  we  have

changed  and that we must have all that, I will  pin

the  fault down to the present Government.  We  were

strong in 1954. We were strong early in April  1955.

Our  position has deteriorated only after April 1955

and has not improved to this day.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Alas!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> There is another point which I

regret  I must point out. In considering this  Bill,

the Minister for Commerce and Industry said that any

government can bring in any measure. If  we  do  not

bring   in   the  Luxury  Tax  Bill,  then   another

government  can  bring it in. It  can  bring  it  in

anytime  whatsoever. But I would like to point  out,

Sir, that we are living in a democratic country  and

when we live in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



a  democratic  country, we must not  say  that  just

because we are the Government, we hold the reins  of

government,  we go wherever we like, we  direct  the

traffic  as  we please, whether it is going  against

anybody  at  all. In a democratic set-up,  Sir,  the

views  of  all sections of the population, even  the

minority, must be considered. We must try to take in

all views and see that every Bill that is passed  in

this  House  will  not affect  any  section  of  the

population  adversely. We say that this  Luxury  Tax

Bill  is  going  to  affect  many  sections  of  the

population. Of course, the biggest section that will

be  affected will be the ones doing business, and  I

must  declare, Sir, that I am not a businessman and.

I am not speaking from a businessman's point of view

but from the average wage-earner's point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, we have a very incomplete

understanding  of how electricity is being  produced

and  how  it is consumed. I happen to know a  little

bit  about  electricity. I  have  visited  a  power-station,  so  I am in a position to be able  to  say

with  some  certainty  how it works.  In  the  Pasir

Panjang power-station it would be economical if  the

load  were to be kept at a constant level,  so  that

the burning of fuel and the gyrations of its various

machines would carry on at about the same rate.  The

amount  of energy consumed is not a criterion,  Sir,

but if we have a good average -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, Mr Financial Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Is this relevant to the measure, Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering how the hon.

Member is going to lead up to luxuries. He is

talking about electricity!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just

trying to be helpful to the Member for Stamford

(Mr J. M. Jumabhoy) on the problem of electrical consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of Order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Point of order, Sir. Will I

have the right to explain to this House my theory on

electrical consumption, especially since I served on

the  Committee  that was charged with  the  task  of

building the Pasir Panjang power-station?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled on the point of order already.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, on this question of

electricity, I was just pointing out to the Minister

for  Commerce and Industry how electricity is  being

charged and how the chain reaction as stated  by  my

colleague affects the whole problem and I  was  just

about  to  say that it is the average  and  not  the

total  amount  of  electrical energy  consumed  that

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I will come to the point on how it

will affect trade. Singapore is a trading centre and

whenever  people are being made to do more work,  we

find  that  invariably  they  avoid  it.  There  are

business  houses that do import and export  business

on an agency basis, and such being the case, Sir, it

will mean that if we have a luxury tax and the goods

cannot be bonded in the Harbour Board or there is no

government  godown to bond them, or  there  is  any

difficulty  about anything, they will try  to  avoid

making  things difficult for themselves. So it  will

mean  direct  shipment  of  goods  to  the  consumer

countries,  or  transhipment,  and  this  will  make

Singapore a less important city.



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Financial Secretary, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Yes, Sir. After this rather lengthy

debate,  Sir,  two  points  of  criticism   of   the

Government measure emerged from the speeches made by

the   Opposition.  The  first  point  is  that   the

introduction of this Bill will definitely  harm  the

entrepot trade. The other point is that the tax will

not be a tax on luxury goods but on a wide range  of

goods which will affect the cost of living generally

in   Singapore  and  affect  the  working   man   in

particular. Both these criticisms, Sir, are entirely

baseless. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



cannot  say  more  than I have  already  said  about

Government's desire not to harm the entrepot  trade,

about  Government's realisation that the  prosperity

of  Singapore depends upon the entrepot  trade,  and

about Government's conviction that nothing should be

done to harm that trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point, I can only give an

assurance that the articles chosen to be subject  to

this  tax will be chosen with great care. They  will

be  chosen so that they will have the minimum effect

upon the entrepot trade of Singapore and the cost of

living in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should say that, whatever articles

are  chosen by Government for the imposition of this

tax,  the  Assembly will, within seven days  of  the

order  being  published,  have  the  opportunity  to

criticise  or  express any views it  wishes  on  the

articles which have been chosen. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.38 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1953 at the Asian Maritime Conference

held  at  Nuwara  Eliya in Ceylon, a resolution  was

adopted calling upon all Asian governments, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



consultation with shipowners and seafarers,  to  set

up  welfare boards for their seamen. In Singapore up

to the present moment, Sir, there is no Port Welfare

Committee  as  such  and  the  Singapore  Mercantile

Marine  Fund  Committee, which has been  established

under  the  Merchant  Shipping Ordinance,  has  been

trying  to  perform that function as best it  could.

There are, Sir, about 8,000 inhabitants of Singapore

who work on board ships and it was therefore clearly

desirable  that  a body be constituted  which  would

look  after  the  welfare of seamen  in  a  positive

manner  and on which the seamen themselves would  be

represented.  My predecessor, Sir,  the  Member  for

Cairnhill,   therefore,  having   regard   to   this

desirability and also the resolution passed  at  the

Nuwara  Eliya  Conference, appointed a committee  in

September  1955  to consider the setting  up  of  an

organisation for port welfare work in Singapore, and

the  Bill  that is now before hon. Members  embodies

the  recommendations  made in  the  Report  of  that

Committee.  I  wish  to convey  my  thanks  to  that

Committee, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed that this Board should

administer the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund, but

the   Government  has  also  seen  to  it  that  the

proposals  would not interfere with the considerable

autonomy  of existing organisations which,  in  most

cases, are supported by voluntary contributions. One

aspect,  however, Sir, which I wish to emphasise  in

this   legislation  is  that  the  Board  is   being

empowered  to  assist  in  activities  directed   at

providing  training  facilities  for  seafarers   or

persons  intending to become seafarers.  I  am  sure

this will be welcomed by hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund

Committee  has up to a certain extent been  able  to

perform  the function of co-ordinating the activities

of various bodies engaged in welfare work, yet there

are  certain  shortcomings which it  is  desired  to

remedy   through   this  Bill.   In   brief,   these

shortcomings  are  that the title of  the  Singapore

Mercantile  Marine Fund Committee  does  not  convey

much  to the ordinary seafarer and, as such,  it  is

something which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



is remote to him. The constitution of the Mercantile

Marine   Fund   Committee  does  not   provide   for

representation  of seafarers whose welfare  was  the

concern  of the Committee. This is a glaring  defect

and  not  in  accordance with democratic principles.

Also  the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund Committee

would  not  of its own accord go out of its  way  to

cover  the  exploration of new fields of  seafarers'

welfare  and the creation of means to meet such  new

requirements.  Thus  this  Committee  performs   its

functions  in  a  negative way. The  proposed  Board

would  be  able to perform its functions in  a  more

positive manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a relatively simple Bill and

therefore  it  does not call for comment  clause  by

clause;  but  I would like to draw the attention  of

hon. Members particularly to two clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, the title of "the Seafarers' Welfare

Board"  is an apt one in that it establishes  beyond

doubt that the work of the Board will be confined to

seafarers and not to port workers generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (1) provides for the membership of the

Board. It provides for four Government members, four

representatives  of  shipowners'  associations,  and

four  seafarers' representatives. It  also  provides

for  four  members  of religious  organisations,  as

opposed  to  one in the present Singapore Mercantile

Marine Fund Committee, and it is hoped that by  this

provision  various religious groups may be  able  to

appoint  representatives on the Board, so  that  the

religious  requirements of seafarers may be  catered

for   more   efficiently.  An   unofficial   ladies'

organisation   called   the   Singapore    Seafarers

Entertainment   Committee  has  up   to   now   been

performing valuable work among seafarers, and it  is

felt  that  it would be advantageous to include  two

ladies with experience of this type of welfare  work

amongst  the  members  of the Board,  and  therefore

there  is provision for the inclusion of two  ladies

to be members of this Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the House will welcome this Bill

which  sets up the proper machinery for the  welfare

of seafarers in Singapore. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.44 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in welcoming this

Bill,  which  seems  to  me  to  be  realistic   and

practical, I only want to make one point. In  clause

4 (1)  (d)  is stated "the Board shall consist of four

persons  representing seafarers." The definition  of

"seafarer"  at  the top of page 2 means  "a  master,

officer,  seaman  or apprentice  who  is  ordinarily

employed on board local trade, home trade or foreign

trade ships...". May I suggest to the Minister that it

might  be  reasonable that, of  those  four  persons

representing seafarers, two should be selected  from

the master/ officer group and two from the seaman or

apprentice  group,  so  that all  interests  can  be

represented on the Board?



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  happy to support this measure which seeks  to

co-ordinate  the somewhat sectional approach  to  the

welfare   of  seafarers  in  the  past.   There   is

considerable room, Sir, for assisting our  seafarers

and  I  am particularly happy to note clause  6  (a)

(ii)   which  gives the Board powers to  provide  for

training  facilities  for those  who  desire  to  be

seafarers and for seafarers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note the provision for four

persons representing seafarers on this Board. I have

no doubt whatsoever that the Minister, in making the

appointments,   will  consult  the  relevant   trade

unions,  both of masters and officers and of seamen,

before making the appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure is late, Sir, but I am glad to see

that it has finally arrived before this House. I  do

hope  and I do believe that an organisation of  this

nature  will  not  only be able  to  coordinate  the

activities now in existence, but will also  be  able

to  infuse  a  new  spirit in the  approach  to  the

seafarers'  problem and that we will  have  in  that

field  that necessary element of anxious search  for

opportunities to raise their educational  and  their

economic level. I do congratulate the Government  on

bringing this Bill before the House.

promise  that I will have the ratio of  two  in  the

officer category and two in the seaman category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to reciprocate the

that  he  was primarily responsible for  setting  up

that committee, and I think he should get a share of

the  credit  which Government will get out  of  this

measure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that the tenure of office of

City  Councillors, who were due to  retire  in  July

1956,  was  extended to 1st December,  1956.  It  is

again necessary to provide for the extension of  the

tenure  of  office  of City Councillors  beyond  1st

December, 1956. This Bill seeks to extend  the  life

of  the  City  Council until December 1957,  but  if

elections  can be held earlier under the  new  Local

Government  Elections Bill when it is enacted,  this

temporary Bill will be repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, as it stands, follows much the same

pattern  as  the previous legislation extending  the

tenure  of office of City Councillors. Hon. Members,

however,  have  been  given  prior  notice  of   the

amendments which I propose to move in the  Committee

stage  the  effect of which is to omit the provision

for  extending  the  tenure of office  of  appointed

Councillors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (d) is also an additional provision and

seeks  to  dispense with the necessity  for  holding

elections to fill casual vacancies without prejudice

to  the  requirement  to hold elections  should  the

number of unfilled vacancies exceed one-third of the

total  number of elected Councillors. Sir, I beg  to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.53 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the continued amendment

to  this Bill is becoming something of a farce.  The

City  Council elections should have taken  place  in

December  1954. These were postponed. The  City  and

Island  Council elections should have been  held  in

about June 1955. The present Government scrapped the

local  government scheme recommended by  the  Rendel

Constitution,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



and they are taking more than two years to put a new

scheme into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As no City Council elections have been held since

December  1953 - or three years ago - it means that  the

last  third  of elected City Councillors  will  have

completed their term of office of three years  under

this  Ordinance at the end of this month,  and  that

henceforth they will join the other two-thirds in an

extended  life. This therefore means that  the  City

Council   becomes  a  wholly  nominated  body   from

December  this  year, and I am therefore  unable  to

understand   the  amendment  which   the   Assistant

Minister  is  putting forward as an afterthought  to

differentiate  between those  members  of  the  City

Council  nominated by the Governor  in  Council  and

those  members of the City Council who,  in  effect,

have  been  nominated by this Assembly, by extending

the  life  of the latter and not of the  former.  In

view of the fact that there are some members of  the

City Council who were elected in the dim distant era

of December 1951, whereas others have been nominated

by  the  Governor in Council within the life of  the

present Government, there seems no justification for

this differentiation. If the City Council's life  is

to  be  less  than  a year, what  is  the  point  of

bringing  in new inexperienced Councillors  to  work

for  a  few  months under an expiring  constitution?

Sir, while I agree that the life of the City Council

must be prolonged in the circumstances facing us,  I

do disapprove of the amendment to terminate the life

of   those  members  nominated  by  the  Council  of

Ministers   as  appearing  to  be  unnecessary   and

pointless.



<br><br>11.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I am glad to

note the moderate tone of approach of the Member for

Tanglin to this matter and I think the bona tides of

this  Government must be recognised when we remember

that,  because of necessity, we seek to  extend  the

life  of  elected  Members of the Council  who  were

elected at a time when the Progressive Party - a fire-eating dragon - was in the ascendant; that we are,  in

fact, extending the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>

life  of  Progressive Party Members who, it  is  our

genuine belief, are no longer representative of  the

people of Singapore. The Labour Front has approached

this  problem  with  considerable  thought  and   an

anxious desire for justice for the people. We  would

have preferred so much more to have a clean slate, a

completely clean slate, and an opportunity  for  the

people of Singapore to have representatives who,  in

the  circumstances of today and with the  experience

which  they  have of the conduct and the  misconduct

that has taken place in the City Council, they would

have perhaps not chosen the same representatives and

would  choose  others more worthy of the  honour  of

speaking  on  behalf of their fellow  citizens.  But

this we cannot do and therefore the question is what

can we do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have a City Council. It is essential for

the  life of this territory and we thought  it  fair

that  those who have actually been endorsed  by  the

public,  even  though they are in  a  majority -  the

Progressive Party representatives - because the public

have  endorsed  them, they should  continue,  though

they  have  sought  to make of the  City  Council  a

battleground for shady political maneuverings.  But,

Sir, though the technical aspect put forward by  the

Member   for   Tanglin   is   accurate   and   their

continuation in office is, in fact, a nomination  by

this  Assembly, this Assembly is not nominating them

as  individuals;  it  is  not  giving  the  seal  of

approval  to  those persons who are elected  Members

now  in the City Council. It is saying no more  than

this - we  are in a quandary how to continue the  City

Council  since we cannot hold elections;  therefore,

since  those gentlemen have been approved by members

of  the  public in the past and since they  want  to

continue in office without resignation, by all means

continue  for yet one more year, and then, pray  God

we will have a clean slate of it all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no such considerations, Sir, can apply to

those  who  have  been nominated under  pressure  of

political influence in a totally different political

atmosphere   and  who  have,  in  the  main,   shown

themselves unworthy of the position which they  hold

in the unpleasant,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



blatant manoeuverings, utterly cynical of the welfare

of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that the Labour Front will be charged

with nepotism. We of the Labour Front, Sir, for more

than  18 months have kept our hands clean. No  Party

that  I  know that has been in power in any  country

has  kept  its hands as clean as we have.  Not  only

have  we  been  honest in the appointments  we  have

made;  not only have we never tried to give jobs  to

members of the Labour Front, but our record is clean

as well as our policy is clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that in the debate that will follow,

those who represent Progressive Party interests, not

the  people's  interests, will say,  "Ah,  yes,  the

Labour  Front  now  is in office  and  is  going  to

steamroller  the position and will seek  to  appoint

its own members in order to gain control of the City

Council." Sir, we know our sincerity of purpose  and

we  know  that we will be laying ourselves  open  to

this  unscrupulous charge by refusing the  extension

of life of the nominated Members. But the people are

crying  out  against the machinations  of  the  City

Council  Members of today. There must be some  fresh

blood, some honest people who will not try and  take

advantage of their position in the City Council  for

horrible  political selfish motives. It is not  with

pleasure,  Sir,  and it is due to  no  Machiavellian

desire  to dominate the City Council that the Labour

Front has taken the decision in association with its

colleagues of the Alliance to say, "No,  an  end  to

these  nominated Members. Let us have some who  will

be    truly   representative,   responsible   people

representing interests -"



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. May I

ask the hon. Gentleman if he is expressing the views

of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I am expressing the views of the

Labour Front. If I may continue, Sir? I say it is in

no  spirit  of seeking to steamroller a measure  for

party political motives but with a genuine desire to

help the people of Singapore that we are approaching

this  problem, and we say to this House: the  people

of  Singapore  have had a bellyful  of  the  present

nominated and some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



the  elected Members of the City Council. They  will

not  tolerate even a further year's extension. There

has  been  enough damage done. I say to  this  House

that it is entirely in the spirit of service for the

people  that  the Labour Front now lays itself  open

for  the first time to a charge of nepotism. We have

taken  criticism  before and with our  sincerity  of

purpose  and knowledge of our own integrity we  will

take  criticism  again. We know  it  might  well  be

flung,  but we know our honesty of purpose  and  are

prepared  to  carry it through. I say,  Sir,  it  is

essential  for the welfare of this country  and  the

administration of its municipal services that  there

should  be an end, an immediate end, to the  present

nominated Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of explanation, Sir. Arising out of

what  the  hon. Member has just said,  he  made  the

statement that I was charging the Labour Front  with

nepotism. I made no such statement in my speech.



<br><br>12.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

wish  to take up too much of the time of the  House.

The matter has been amply clarified by my friend the

Member for Cairnhill. I only just wish to say  this,

Sir - that  we too on our side are not happy  at  this

extension  of the life of the present City  Council,

but  it  is  a  necessary evil arising  out  of  the

constitutional changes that have been set  in  force

as a result of the Rendel Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin raised one point, and that

was  why  it  was  necessary  to  get  inexperienced

Councillors  in  place  of the  present  experienced

nominated  Councillors. Sir, it is not  possible  to

hold  elections  and replace those  Councillors  who

were  elected, but we can surely bring in new  blood

which  is very necessary in this City Council, which

is  now like a stagnant pool of dirty water, and try

to  freshen  it  up  a  bit through  appointing  new

nominated  members; and that, I think, Sir,  is  why

the life of only the elected Members is going to  be

lengthened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

frankly,  as  a  City Councillor myself,  I  had  no

intention  of  speaking  on this  subject,  but  the

question  of  elected or nominated  Councillors  has

cropped  up  and  I  feel that I should  explain  my

stand. As a City Councillor who has served for  five

years,  I  certainly feel unhappy at this extension.

It  is  time  that the City Council  should  have  a

change  because  the  members on  the  Council  have

served their term of not only five years but  up  to

six  years even without fresh elections being  held.

This  being a democratic country, I feel that  fresh

elections should come immediately, but the  fact  is

this:  the machinery of government election is  such

that we are compelled to serve a year longer if this

House  adopts  this Bill. But if this House  or  the

public  call  upon me to serve as a City  Councillor

for one more year, I feel it is my duty to do so.  I

am not reluctant to serve anybody.



<br><br>12.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not

intended  to  speak at length on this  subject,  but

after hearing what the Member for Cairnhill said,  I

felt  that I cannot help but stand up and  reply  to

what   he  said.  It  gives  me  a  real  sense   of

unhappiness,  Sir,  to  see  a  responsible   Member

standing up in this Assembly and speaking against  a

very  responsible institution like the City Council.

I  am not defending anybody, but I have this to say,

Sir.  The City Councillors are not here to give  the

Member for Cairnhill a direct reply, and it would, I

think,  be better if the hon. Member would  deem  it

fit  to  publish his remarks in the Press under  his

own  name so that they can answer him direct and not

for him to hide in this Assembly -

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir. The suggestion is that I

am  hiding  in this Assembly. That is an attempt  to

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is, of course, a difficult point

of  order.  Hon.  Members,  when  they  speak  about

what  they  say because they are, in fact, protected

by  privilege. In this particular case, I think  the

hon.  Member  merely  indicated  that  there  is   a

privilege which does protect Members of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you, Sir. I certainly

think  there  is a privilege protecting this  House.

Previous  to  this, Sir, whenever an  accusation  is

thrown by Members of the Opposition, they are  asked

to  give  facts  and  figures.  They  are  asked  to

substantiate  their cases. I would  very  much  like

such   accusations   to   be   substantiated,    and

substantiated in the newspapers and not just in this

House, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that Members on the Government

Benches are honest, very worthy, and they have shown

their clean hands. I do not doubt for a moment  that

they are clean and good and worthy, but I think  the

more  important  thing is that  we  must  not  judge

ourselves. The judgment must be left to the  people.

In the same way, Sir, the City Councillors have done

what  they  think  is in the best interests  of  the

people  of Singapore. It is not for Members  of  the

Assembly  to judge their conduct. It is  up  to  the

people of Singapore to pass judgment on them, and  I

say  that  if  this House is really  keen  that  the

people of Singapore should pass judgment on the City

Councillors, then let there be fresh elections,  and

fresh  elections at the earliest possible moment.  I

am  for  it. If the Government will scrap this  Bill

and  have elections next month, I will support their

move.  The only thing is that they cannot, and  they

cannot do it, not because anybody is preventing them

from doing it, but because they have delayed matters

themselves.  Do  not tell this House  that  you  are

unhappy to allow this state of affairs to go on. You

want fresh elections. You want a clean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



slate.  You have Councillors who are not  worthy  of

being in the City Council and who are still sticking

there now. The powers are in the Government's hands.

It  is up to them to do it. The Government have  not

done it. The fault lies with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, when another hon. Member stated that

the  City  Council is just like a stagnant  pool  of

dirty water, I sometimes feel that I must agree with

him, because it includes the hon. Member himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, it does not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Wake up, wake up!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am certain, Sir, that it

does because the period referred to covers the

tenure of office -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I will say this - fresh

elections  are; due. In fact, they are  overdue.  We

want  the people to cast their verdict. We want City

Councillors who really represent the people,  and  I

will support any Bill which will make the holding of

elections as early as possible.



<br><br>12.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  indeed  very unhappy about the whole  affair.  I

have  reluctantly  to  support  this  Bill.  I   am,

however, happy that the Member for Serangoon and the

Member  for  Cairnhill and many other  hon.  Members

agree  that it is high time for us to have a glimpse

into  this  "dirty  water". Sir, I  agree  with  the

sentiments  of the Member for Serangoon that  it  is

only   the  people  of  Singapore  who  should  pass

judgment on the efficiency and integrity of the City

Council.  As far as I am concerned, judging  by  the

complaints  that  I have received from  the  general

public, it is, I think, high time for us to clean up

the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at one City Council problem - the

hawkers' problem. What have our City Fathers done to

settle this problem? My memory is rather weak,  Sir,

but  I  think  I  can remember one  City  Councillor

proposing that hawkers should have to pay income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



tax! There is also another Councillor who said, long

ago,   that  hawkers  are  capitalists!  These   two

examples alone, I believe, will illustrate how  many

of   those  sitting  on  the  City  Council   really

understand the problems of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I support the abolition of these

nominated City Councillors, I wonder whether  it  is

Government's intention to nominate new members - "new

blood"  is the expression used - who may turn out  to

be  "yes" men-one hon. Member referred to this  move

as  "political  manoeuvering". I wish the  Government

will   bear   in   mind,  when  they  nominate   new

Councillors, not to have any more "yes" men but true

civic leaders.



<br><br>12.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Assistant Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> Yes, Sir. As hon. Members

are aware, there have been no City Council elections

since  December  1953, and the life of  the  present

City  Council has been extended since that  year  by

similar   Bills  as  the  present  one.  The   Local

Government  Bill,  1956, and  the  Local  Government

Elections  Bill, 1956, Sir, are now  in  the  Select

Committee  stage.  It  is  considered  that  elected

Councillors could continue to hold office as  it  is

preferable that new City Council elections should be

held   under  the  provisions  of  the   new   Local

Government  Elections Ordinance. In  any  case,  the

previous    City   Council   Elections    (Temporary

Provisions)  Bill  dispensed with the  necessity  of

revising the electoral register, and so they are out

of date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard, however, to the appointed

Councillors,  some of whom have been holding  office

as  far  back  as 1951 and all of whom  are  due  to

retire  on  1st December, 1956, the reason  why  the

present  Bill  seeks to end their tenure  of  office

while elected members continue for another year,  is

to  enable  fresh  nominations to be  submitted  for

consideration. Members will appreciate that there is

a   distinction   between  elected   and   appointed

Councillors, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



this measure will relieve appointed members of their

responsibilities  after  many  years   of   valuable

service  and  also  allow some  fresh  blood  to  be

introduced into the Council.

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion seeks to amend the Second

Schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment to the existing Schedule is

that  the  rate  of tax on the first  two  slabs  of

chargeable  income, which are at present  three  and

four per cent respectively, are changed to five  per

cent.  The  effect of this change is illustrated  by

the following figures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $200)

will pay $10 in tax instead of $6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $500

will pay $25 instead of $15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $700

will pay $35 instead of $23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $1,000

will pay $50 instead of 35



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, individuals will pay $15 more than

they at present pay right up the scale.



<br><br>It  has been said that these increases are likely to

cause  hardship.  This, Sir, I cannot  believe.  The

maximum increase in which these new rates result  is

$15 and this is due in respect of chargeable incomes

of  $1,000  or  over. An increase of this  order  is

within the means of all taxpayers to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to existing rates of tax is

the insertion of a new rate of 25 per cent which  is

applicable to the $10,000 slab of chargeable  income

immediately above the $35,000 point. The next $5,000

is chargeable at 30 per cent and the next succeeding

$5,000  at 35 per cent. This takes us up to  $55,000

worth  of  chargeable income above which  point  the

rate  of tax will be 40 per cent. The effect of this

increase in tax on chargeable incomes in the  higher

ranges will be as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of single individuals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $50,000, the old rate of

tax was $4,030.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $4,045.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $75,000, the old rate of

tax was $15,230.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $18,195.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $100,000, the old rate

of tax was $22,730.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $28,195.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of resident individuals who are

married and have no children:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $75,000, the old rate of

tax was $14,630.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $17,395.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a charge income of $l00,000, the old rate of

tax was 22,130.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $27,395.



<br><br>And so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases, Sir, are fairly substantial but I

do  not  think that they will cause hardship to  any

taxpayers. It can be argued that taxpayers in  these

higher groups of income could pay more tax. That  is

probably  true  and  I have no doubt  that  the  two

Governments will come round to this way of  thinking

in due course. At the same time, however, I doubt if

it is generally realised to what extent taxpayers in

these  income groups contribute in the way of income

tax.  In this connection, I invite attention to  the 1955 Annual  Report of the Income  Tax  Department.

From  that Report, it will be seen that some  19,000

individuals  contribute some $22  million  worth  of

tax.   Of   these  individuals,  some  1,200   whose

chargeable incomes exceed $30,000, on six  per  cent

of  the total contribute $16 million in tax which is

68  per cent of the total. While it can no doubt  be

argued  that these individuals could pay more,  even

the  most biased critic must admit that they already

make a not unsubstantial contribution to the general

welfare  of  the people of Singapore. The  yield  of

these  proposals is now estimated at  slightly  over

$3� million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is one of the devices to raise more

money, as I understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>

it   from  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary:  by

changing  the  percentages  of  tax  chargeable   on

incomes.  Sir, this morning we opposed the principle

of  taxation  generally and I can show hon.  Members

one  or two ways by which to avoid this increase and

even other increases in tax. One easy way is to  get

control  of our hard currency earnings-U.S, dollars.

For  years  and years, the United Kingdom  has  been

utilising  oar dollars and taking full advantage  by

saying that the money was to be used for the good of

the Commonwealth whenever we raised this question in

the Legislative Council. Now, Commonwealth countries

are   independent  countries.  They  remain  in  the

Commonwealth  for  their mutual good.  Our  earnings

should be given to us. I quote one example of how we

are   being  fleeced  indirectly.  We  are   getting

consumer goods from America via Hongkong and you can

find  them  anywhere in the market,  Sir.  Singapore

pays  the black-market price for them. How  is  this

done?  Non-business  people  may  not  be  able   to

understand  how unless they take the pains  to  find

out. We ask the Government for part or whole of  our

hard  currency  earnings to import goods  from  hard

currency countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is now

embarking  on a debate on something quite extraneous

to the motion before the House, which is an increase

in  the  percentages of income tax. He is  quite  in

order,  of course, in mentioning it but I would  ask

him not to enter into a debate on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Sir, for pointing that

out. I am not debating as dollars -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> - but I am debating on the point

that if you save



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



money  through our hard currency earnings it is  not

necessary  to have these changes in the income  tax.

So  if  you,  Sir, can bear with me for another  two

minutes, I can explain that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America ships goods to Singapore via Hongkong

which  means only transshipment. The steamers  touch

at  Hongkong and black-market money, or free rate is

paid  there.  The bills of lading  are  given  to  a

merchant  and we have to pay black-market  money  to

the Hongkong merchants. In other words, we agree  to

pay more Malayan dollars -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that the hon.

Member  has  taken my point and that is:  he  is  in

order  if  he  just  mentions the fact  of  American

dollars but if he goes into detail, I must hold that

he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Sir, for pointing out

again that I should not go into details but then  it

will  be  difficult  for  the  Government  side   to

understand.  In other words, in short, if  our  hard

currency earnings are kept with us to be utilised by

us,  no  tax or any changes in tax are necessary  at

all   and   the  United  Kingdom  has  no   business

whatsoever to utilise our hard currency earnings.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> R. Jumabhoy & Co.!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> There is no need for you to be

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do I understand from that amendment

that the hon. Member is endeavouring to restore  the

status  quo in so far as the lower income  group  is

concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> That is right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, in proposing this

amendment, as you have said, I am trying to  restore

the  old  percentages before the proposal to  reduce

the personal relief. It appears to me, Sir, that the

Government  is  not consistent in  its  policies.  I

presume  that  the  withdrawal  of  the  Income  Tax

(Amendment No. 2) Bill was due to the heavy pressure

from  the  public and it appears to  me  that  since

there  is no heavy pressure from the public  on  the

question  of  the rates of percentage on  the  lower

income  group,  the Government is not  proposing  to

restore  the old rates of income tax for  the  lower

income  group. This is wrong, Sir. It is not because

the  public  is  not  protesting against  these  new

increased rates but it is because the public is  not

aware  of these new rates. The concentration of  the

public  was on the reduction of the personal  relief

and  this was just a sideline which may have  missed

the eye of the common man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will accept my proposal to

go  back to the old rates. If the original motion is

accepted,  Sir,  I am sure that it will  cause  much

more  hardship  to  the lower income  group.  It  is

surprising  that the Hon. Financial Secretary  said,

"It  will not necessarily cause much hardship to the

workers."  I am afraid that he is not aware  of  the

conditions of living of the lower income  group,  as

he  is a Minister and he lives on a far higher plane

than the lower income group or the common people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say, Sir, why it will affect the workers if

this  motion  is  adopted.  Take,  for  instance,  a

bachelor who earns $3,500 a year. The $3,000 is free

of  tax  and  the balance of $500 is  to  be  taxed.

According to the new rates, Sir, the tax on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



the $500 will be $25, but on the old rate he will be

taxed  $15  which, in the opinion of the Government,

is a very small amount. The increase is only $10 and

it does not matter. If the total income of a married

person  is  $6,000 a year, $5,000 is  free  of  tax.

Based  on the new rate, the tax on the extra  $1,000

will  be  $50 and on the old rate, the tax  will  be

$40 - a difference of $10. Now, this $10 may appear to

the  Government to be a very small sum  but  I  must

point  out, Sir, that this $10 is a very big sum  to

the ordinary worker. A worker who is a bachelor with

a very small income of, say, a few hundred dollars a

month may have to support his parents or his younger

sisters  and brothers, and in the case of a  married

man,  he has to support his wife and children.  Now,

this  $10, as far as I know, may be enough for three

or  four  days' marketing. I have known of cases  of

the  poorer class of people who spend a dollar a day

on  marketing and this $10 will allow them and their

family,  I should say, to exist for ten days.  I  am

afraid that the Government is wrong in thinking that

it would not affect the workers at all when they say

that $10 is just a small figure. A drop in the ocean

will  not  matter much but that "drop of  water"  in

terms of dollars and cents will matter very much  to

the poor worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Members on both sides of the House

will  realise the hardship on the lower income group

and will accept my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to second the amendment and reserve my right

to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words and figures

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) seems

to have misunderstood the position as indicated both

in  the  opening  speech by the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary and in the debate on the Second Reading of

the Appropriation Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understood, Sir, it was not a question of the

desire of this Government for increased taxation  in

these  lower  groups that brought about  either  the

attempt to reduce the personal allowance or the very

mild - what they call - tidying increase in these  lower

incomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been made abundantly clear, Sir, that

income  tax is a pan-Malayan subject and that  there

is  need  for co-ordination of our efforts  with  the

Federation  and  it must surely be obvious  to  hon.

Members in this Assembly that in matters of this and

any  other nature where there is co-operation between

the   two   territories,  there  must  be   ultimate

compromise  proposals  which  are  perhaps   neither

completely   satisfactory  to  the  Federation   nor

completely satisfactory to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it can but embarrass the Government

gravely  if  we  seek to upset unduly  an  agreement

reached  by  it  after full consideration  with  the

Federation and this, in fact, is what this amendment

seeks  to  do.  There has been a complete  agreement

achieved by way of compromise with the Federation on

income  tax  proposals for next year. Despite  that,

Sir, in view of matters that transpired both in this

territory and the Federation and as a result of  the

friendship existing between our two Chief Ministers,

there  was  a concession of a considerable character

by  the Federation to our wishes. For this, I  think

we  ought  to  express both our appreciation  and  a

sense of relief that they so conceded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek, Sir, now to overthrow the agreement

arrived   at  in  such  friendly  spirit  with   the

Federation for so minor a matter is not to seek  the

welfare of this territory or even the poorer  people

therein  but  to  seek to embarrass  the  Government

purely and simply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that every time we approach

taxation proposals, they are a pan-Malayan subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown said that $10 could

mean  ten  marketing days. I would remind  him  that

according  to his own figures, before any  man  pays

any  tax  at  all, he must earn $3,500 if  he  is  a

bachelor,  that is, he earns $10 a day and  for  the

whole year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



he  pays $25 - $2 a month - which means that the  Member

for  Queenstown  is trying to save him  $10  or  one

day's pay. Sir, if this bachelor is really living on

$1  a day, he is making an extraordinary saving  out

of   which   he  can  well  afford  a   far   larger

contribution to the country. As for the married man,

Sir,  he  is paying this extra $10 only if he  earns

$6,000  a year - $500 a month - and out of that  $500  a

month,  he  is being asked to pay 5/6th  of  $1  per

month. I do not know exactly how much 5/6th is, Sir.

I  should say it is about 80 cents a month.  Now  to

call a man earning $600 a month poor and to seek  to

embarrass  the Government because he has to  pay  80

cents a month extra is to exaggerate and bring  into

disrepute  the  whole democratic procedure  and  the

purpose of a debate on the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> They do not understand the -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I ask hon. Members to take seriously

into  consideration not only the obligations of  the

Government towards its counterpart in the Federation

but  the  obligations of the Opposition to act  with

responsibility  and  to  maintain  the  dignity   of

Singapore  in  its  relations with  the  territories

across  the  Straits.  I  cannot  believe  that  the

Opposition - the gentlemen who face me - would want the

Government  to  dishonour its arrangement  with  the

Federation  on  so small a point.  I  do  ask  them,

though the amendment looks attractive as a political

catch  motion, it is, in essence, a grave reflection

upon  the  sense  of  integrity  of  the  people  of

Singapore  and  the  sense of co-operation  with  the

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Have I got a right to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have no comments to

make on this - most of them are obvious - but I have one

question  to  ask  of  the leader  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party who seconded the amendment, and that

is: Does his Party stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



for the breaking up of the pan-Malayan structure  of

income tax on this small point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not so small.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Comparatively.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  at  the conclusion of yesterday's debate,  the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary made some very  happy

remarks  on the new income tax rates. He was,  if  I

remember rightly, replying to some questions made by

the  Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede). He  quoted  some

relevant  figures to show the amount of tax  payable

under  the  new rate as compared with the old  rate.

The  Hon. the Financial Secretary contended that the

new  structure would be well received  by  everybody

primarily   because   the   increase   in   tax   is

insignificantly small.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want to make it quite

clear that we are on an amendment which affects  the

first  line of the Schedule. If the hon.  Member  is

speaking on the amendment, of course, he is quite in

order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Thank you, Sir. In fact, I am supporting the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least to his mind, Sir, it is small enough and

the  taxpayer will not be bothered about it. Sir,  I

do not deny the fact that the increase under the new

rate  may  be  small - only  a  few  dollars - but  then

whether  the  taxpayer will mind  it  or  not  is  a

different matter. I believe, in all sincerity,  that

he  will mind for whether the differential is $5  or

$15,  it still means that the taxpayer will have  to

forego  that sum of money for ever and that he  will

have to curtail his expenditure by that amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the point I wish to make is something

more  fundamental and it is this. Is the new rate  a

just  one? Let us examine the position before us.  I

have  prepared here a short but comprehensive  table

showing only the differential increase under the new

rate as compared with the old rate but in greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



detail  than the Hon. the Financial Secretary  cared

to tell the House yesterday. The table here, Sir,  I

hope  can be easily followed by hon. Members without

going  into  complicated statistics.  The  point  of

justice  or  injustice which  I  said  just  now  is

clearly  indicated not in the differential  increase

but in the percentage increase. Looking at column 5,

hon.  Members will see that the percentage  increase

in  income  tax plunges downwards as the  chargeable

income  rises  upwards. On a  chargeable  income  of

$500, Sir, the percentage increase on the old tax is

67 per cent -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir. What

is the fifth column? I mean I have heard -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member giving way?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I have heard of fifth columnists but

I  have  not heard of the fifth column, Sir. Is  the

hon. Member referring to any particular document?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I did not say,

"fifth  column" but I said, "column 5" - if I  am  not

mistaken.  According to my table, I have "column  5"

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the amount of chargeable income increases

gradually  to  $1,000 and $2,000,  Sir,  and  up  to

$7,000, the percentage increase in tax payable drops

to  three  per cent. The position is even better  or

worse depending on how you look at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chargeable income is $10,000, Sir, the

percentage  increase in income tax is .35  per  cent

and at $35,000, the increase is .03 per cent. I hope

that hon. Members are able to follow the line of  my

argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: No.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> It is only above $35,000

that  the percentage increase begins to rise  again.

Sir,   I   do  not  wish  to  appear  malicious   or

insinuating  but I would like to ask  the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary or the Hon. the Financial Secretary

or even the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



<!-- Deliberately left here -->Mr Sutherland this question: Under which chargeable income  group do they come? We note from the  Budget

Estimates,  Sir,  that the Hon. the Chief  Secretary

draws an annual income of $28,500 while the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  draws $24,900.  Assuming  that

they   enjoy  the  benefit  of  all  their  personal

allowances  and relief, I venture to say  that  they

are  within the $7,000 to $15,000 bracket. They  are

within   the   privileged  group  whose   percentage

increase of tax is even less than one per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Sir, that the new rates, contrary

to    some   opinion,   are   totally   unjust   and

undemocratic. They are designed to benefit those  in

the  higher  income  group, in  particular,  in  the

senior    ranks    of    the   bureaucracy - Permanent

Secretaries,  Police  Commissioners,  directors  and

controllers or heads of departments and  such  like.

It   is  not  at  all  surprising,  Sir,  that   Mr

Sutherland appeared to be very jubilant in welcoming

the  new  rate yesterday. Having drawn attention  to

this fact, I am sure that hon. Members will find  it

fit to oppose the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the hon. Member does

not  say,  "oppose  the  motion"  but  "support  the

amendment".  The  hon.  Member  is  talking  on  the

amendment, is he not?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Thank you very much, Sir.

In fact, I am supporting the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

should   like  just  to  express  a  word  of   high

appreciation for the ability of the Member  who  has

just sat down. I understand that he has succeeded in

doing what I have still been unable to do under  the

expenditure of a large amount of time and that is to

work  out  my  income  tax. I always  have  to  have

considerable assistance in it and I am delighted  to

hear that he seems to have been able to work it  out

and I am even more delighted to hear that I think he

tells me that my income tax is going down while  the

rates are being put up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me  first answer the question by the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Commerce and  Industry.  He  asks  us

whether our Party stands for breaking away from  the

pan-Malayan  structure  as  this  measure  was   put

forward  by  the  Government of  the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaya cannot put forth such a

suggestion  unless  it consults  the  Government  of

Singapore. In effect, it can as well come  from  the

Government of Singapore. On a question like this, it

is  not  possible  to  ask a Party  to  support  any

measure when, in the first instance, they have never

been  consulted and nothing of this  sort  has  even

been whispered to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Member of the Labour Front to ask my Party

(the  Liberal-Socialist Party) here to  support  any

measure  because  it has been fixed  up  by  another

Party  with their own Party, I think this is  asking

too much.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> With another Government and not with another Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> If any Government wants the

support of an Opposition Party, it is only fair that

the   Government  consults  that   Party.   If   the

Government  wants  merdeka,  the  Government  should

realise,  first of all, that if it wants a unanimous

approach,  it  must get hold of all  the  Opposition

Parties  for a national conference. It should  adopt

this  attitude  and not ask for support  after  they

have committed themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, speaking in support of the

amendment, I will just draw attention to one or  two

facts. Without the $500-flooring being removed  now,

the  maximum tax collection envisaged will be in the

region  of  $1,500,000. Taking off that $500  relief

now,  and restoring it to the $3,000 level, it  will

work  out to roughly a quarter of a million dollars.

This sum I suggest, Sir, is small and negligible and

should not be implemented. Looking at the table



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



and   remembering  what  the  Hon. the   Financial

Secretary has informed us, the taxation levied  will

affect  roughly  12,000 people  out  of  the  19,000

people  who  are  being taxed. Here  again,  Sir,  I

suggest  that  the  Labour Front deviates  from  its

principle  of trying to collect tax where  it  hurts

least.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday, I

said  that  the  administration of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance was on a pan-Malayan basis and this  point

has  been  brought up again by my friend the  Member

for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the amendment, if I gather it

rightly,  is that my hon. friends on the other  side

are  very concerned for the lower income group. Now,

who   belongs  to  the  lower  income  group,   Sir?

According to the Central Provident Fund Ordinance, a

person  drawing  $200 should not be called  upon  to

make  any contribution to the Central Provident Fund

because it was felt and it is still felt that a  man

drawing  $200  belongs to the  lower  income  group.

Coming now to the illustration given by the mover of

the  amendment, the Member for Cairnhill has already

replied and pointed out that a person who is  called

upon to make an extra payment of $10 will be one who

is  drawing,  if  a bachelor, $300  a  month;  if  a

married man at least more than $500 a month and if a

married  man  with children, he would have  to  draw

about $700 a month before he could be called upon to

make  this sacrifice - if one can call it - of an  extra

$10  a  year  which works out at about  80  cents  a

month.  Is this such a great sacrifice to call  upon

people within those income groups to contribute  for

the good of the community?



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment. I find that a

flat  rate of an increase of $15 a year is  enforced

on  all  annual incomes from $1,000 to  $35,000.  Is

this  fair? I should have expected a graduated scale

of increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



in  income  tax  to  have been produced.  Surely,  a

person  who  receives an annual  salary  of  $35,000

should pay a greater part of that than $15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministers and their Assistant Ministers

receive  annual  salaries ranging  from  $20,000  to

$30,000.  Was this flat rate of an increase  of  $15

produced  so that they can escape paying more?  Sir,

is  this  the  Labour  Front's  idea  of  Socialism?

Surely, this method of increase in income tax cannot

be  said to be in accord with the Government's often

proclaimed  intention  of  placing  the  burden   of

taxation on the shoulders of those who would be able

to pay.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that this

Assembly has degraded from a very reputable  one  to

that of a classroom and the schoolboys playing cheap

politics.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must rule out the whole

sentence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I withdraw

that.  Some  hon.  Members of this House  have  been

trying very hard to mislead the public. The proposed

increased  rate of tax does not affect the labouring

class. From the figures shown here, for every dollar

of  the  first  $1,500,  that means  the  chargeable

income   and   the  chargeable  income   means   the

assessable  income  which is your  salary  less  any

allowances  that you are entitled to. On  the  first

$500, a rate of tax of five per cent is charged.  In

other  words, a bachelor who earns at least  $300  a

month  pays  $25  a year - about $2 a month.  If  this

person  is classified as one of the labouring class,

I fail to understand it.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, speaking on the amendment, I

was very happy to hear the full explanation given by

the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pan-Malayan measures or measures with other

countries when the Government is in the minority, it

will  be  very  wise  to consult the  Opposition  to

achieve harmony.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have the highest respect for the

Hon. the Chief Minister of the Federation  and  his

Party.  I always express this. There is no intention

whatsoever  of doing any harm to the good  relations

existing  with the Federation but had this  position

been  explained to the Opposition, the matter  would

have been quite different.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  I  rise  to my feet, the Minister  for  Health

looks disgusted but I wish to remind him that  I  am

not  playing at party politics and I will  speak  as

the man in the street is entitled to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the amendment proposed by the Member for

Queenstown,  I am afraid that I have to  remind  him

that he tends to exaggerate the question of the $10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the time you will find that we argue

and  do  not see eye to eye with the Government.  We

ask for more schools and more hospitals and I wonder

whether they understand the plea for free education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, a certain Party went to the extent

of proposing free compulsory education. I would like

to  ask this question: Where are we going to get the

money?  Therefore,  I  said this  morning - if  I  can

recollect  rightly - that it is right and proper  for

us, who call ourselves the leaders of the people, to

speak  the  truth to them. We should work  hard  and

save more towards the goal of a Socialist State or a

Welfare State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point on which I cannot agree

with  the Member for Cairnhill and the Minister  for

Commerce and Industry. We impose this tax because we

must compromise with the Federation of Malaya, as we

have  a  pan-Malayan taxation structure.  Sir,  this

hurts  me  very much. Although we have a pan-Malayan

structure  on  income tax and on many other  things,

you  will  find that the picture is very gloomy  and

disappointing. I have pointed out this morning  that

the  boom days of Singapore as a free port are gone.

Therefore, I say that we should let the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



people know exactly the position we are in today. We

want to impose income tax on a pan-Malayan basis but

I would like to ask whether the elected Labour Front

Coalition  Government  did  try  hard  to  stop  the

Federation of Malaya from imposing certain duties on

our  Singapore products. Why did they  not  have  an

approach to industry and commerce on a friendly pan-Malayan basis?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Because we are afraid of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Therefore, I think this is now

the  right  time  for  us  to  realise  the  serious

situation  facing  us. I think very  soon,  or  even

right  now, we will have to face the fact that  many

factories and shops have to close down.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Quite so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Therefore, I think that the

proposal to impose only income tax based on  a  pan-Malayan structure is quite wrong. Everything  should

be  done on a pan-Malayan basis - not only in  regard

to  income  tax  but  also with regard  to  economy,

industry and commerce.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I speak to the amendment, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid that the Government cannot

accept the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate of tax on the lower slabs

of  chargeable income was agreed with the Federation

of  Malaya as part of the compromise about which the

Hon. the Chief Minister spoke yesterday. It has been

stressed  in  the  course of this  debate  and  past

debates that a pan-Malayan approach to income tax is

essential. This increase in the rate of tax  on  the

lower slabs of chargeable income has been agreed and

must stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of hardship, I refuse to believe

that   these   increases  can  cause  any   hardship

whatsoever. As has already been said in  the  course

of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



debate,  no member of the working class is  affected

by income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a certain amount of information - of which I

hoped  to  spare  Members of the Assembly - about  the

rates of tax which were paid in other countries  and

perhaps hon. Members might like to hear them. I will

start  by  quoting from a comparative table  of  the

rates  of  tax and the rates of allowances in  other

countries  besides Singapore. For  example,  in  the

matter  of  Personal Allowances, in  Singapore,  the

individual  taxpayer  has a  Personal  Allowance  of

$3,000.   In   the  United  Kingdom,  his   Personal

Allowance  is  $1,020.  In  Australia,  he  has   no

Personal  Allowance. In India, he  has  no  Personal

Allowance.  In  Ceylon, it  is  $1,285.  As  far  as

Married Allowances are concerned, in Singapore,  the

Married  Allowance is $5,000. In the United Kingdom,

the Married Allowance is $1,800. In Australia, it is

$891.   In  Ceylon,  it  is  $2,250.  In  Singapore,

allowances  are  paid  on  a  descending  scale   on

children  up to nine in number. The total  allowance

in  respect  of children in Singapore is $3,150.  In

the United Kingdom, it is rather higher - $6,000.  In

Ceylon, it is $2,893.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the debate last year, mention

was  made  of a table of rates of tax applicable  to

other  territories  in  the colonial  empire.  Forty

territories  were  arranged in descending  order  of

incidence  of  taxation. In  this  table,  Singapore

stands   at   the  thirty-third  place.   The   only

territories  below her are Sierra  Leone,  the  Gold

Coast,  Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Gibraltar  and

Hongkong. The difference between Singapore  and  the

territories  above  her is very marked  indeed.  The

lowest  income  group quoted in the table  is �500,

that  is,  $4,285. In Singapore, a married man  with

two children would pay nothing. In the Carribean  he

would  pay  as  much  as $80. Even  in  the  Solomon

Islands, he would pay $8. In short, the rate of  tax

in  Singapore is probably amongst the lowest in  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some other interesting information, Sir,

which I should like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



give  to  hon. Members. They will be interested  to

know  that in Singapore, some $15 million a year  is

sent  to  China as family remittances. At least  $16

million  is sent to India. Lumping these two figures

together,  it  works  out  at  $25  a  head  of  the

population.  Again, the population on the  basis  of

1954 figures, spent $18 million on entertainment tax

or $15 a head of the total population. Contributions

to totalisators and sweepstakes amounted to over $20

million  a  year  or $16 a head of  the  population.

Again,  one in every four gainfully employed persons

in  Singapore  has  an account in  the  Post  Office

Savings Bank with an average holding of $375. Now, I

take it, Sir, that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> On a point of information, Sir. The

Hon.  Member said that $15 million is sent to  China

and  $16 million to India yearly but he has not said

anything about how much money is sent to the  United

Kingdom. Can he please inform me on that point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I regret, Sir, that I have no

information  about the amount of family  remittances

to the United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Very convenient!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> They probably are considerable. Most

Britons in Malaya make contributions to the cost  of

the   upkeep  of  their  parents.  It  is  not   the

prerogative of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the figures which I have quoted

go  a  considerable way to destroy the argument that

this  incidence of taxation will cause  hardship  at

any level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point made by the Member for Serangoon (Mr

Lim  Choon  Mong)  was that only  the  lower  income

groups were affected by these increases in the rates

of tax. Of course, that is not correct. The rates of

tax affect everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Can I ask for some information

from the Hon. the Financial Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Hon. the Financial Secretary

said  that our taxation rates are amongst the lowest

in the world. What about Hongkong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think I said, Sir, that Hongkong was

one  of the territories which appeared below  us  in

the colonial schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words and figures proposed to

be left out, be left out," put, and negatived.

<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, the revision of these

rates,  I  take it, was the result of  a  compromise

between the two Chief Ministers of Singapore and the

Federation.  We were told yesterday and  today  that

Members  of the Opposition should not embarrass  the

Government on such a minor affair.

not,  he  is out of order. He has already spoken  on

<div align="center"><b>CUSTOMS (DUTIES) (NO. 2) ORDER, 1956</b></div>

<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section   11  of  the  Custom  Ordinance  (Cap. 160),

resolves  that the Customs (Duties) (No.  2)  Order,

1956,  published  as  Notification  No. S 307  in  the

Gazette Supplement No. 80 of 7th November, 1956,  as

contained  in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 33  of  1956,

and  the Customs (Duties) (No. 2) (Amendment) Order,

1956,  published as Notification No. S  321  in  the

Gazette Supplement No. 84 of 15th November, 1956, as

contained in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 36 of 1956, be

confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the original Gazette Notification S 307 had

as  its  object  considerable modifications  to  the

tobacco  tariff and amendments to the liquor  tariff

in  so  far  as it refers to gin, rum and  rectified

spirit, and to the duty on petroleum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



The main change in the tobacco tariff is, of course,

in  respect of cigarettes, from which 97 per cent of

the   tobacco  tariff  is  derived.  The   duty   on

cigarettes  has been raised half way  to  Federation

levels  and  has resulted in the price of cigarettes

being increased by five cents per packet of ten with

corresponding  increases  in  the  price  of  larger

packets. It was also intended to raise the  duty  on

what  is called Rhodesian-type tobacco which is used

for the manufacture of the better quality of machine

made  local cigarettes from $2.50 a lb, to  $4.50  a

lb.  It was considered desirable in the interest  of

the  important tobacco revenue that there should not

be too great a differential between the duty on this

type of tobacco and the duty on imported cigarettes.

In  fixing  the new rate of duty, the  previous  tax

differential was maintained. It was thought that the

fact  that  the  duties on cigarettes generally  had

been  raised would probably lead to a greater demand

for   the   better  type  of  locally   manufactured

cigarettes.   The  industry  employs   52   persons.

However, representations were made to the Government

that   the  increase  in  price  of  these   locally

manufactured cigarettes would cause hardship to  the

labouring classes who are the main consumers of this

type  of  cigarette.  After consideration  of  these

representations, it was decided to restore the  duty

to its previous level at $2.50 a lb. This action was

taken  on  the  understanding,  however,  that   the

manufacturers of the local cigarettes would maintain

the  price  of the product at pre-Budget levels  and

that  any increase in price would immediately result

in an increase in duty. This restoration of duty was

affected by Gazette Notification No. S 321 of  which

mention is made in the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, representations were made by the

local manufacturers of cigars to the effect that the

increase  in  duty  on imported leaf  tobacco  would

necessitate   an  increase  in  price  which   would

injuriously affect their sales and, consequently,  a

local    industry.    As   a   result    of    these

representations,  the  Government  has  decided   to

restore the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



duty  on  imported leaf tobacco to pre-Budget  levels

and  a  Gazette  Notification to  this  effect  will

shortly be published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in duty on imported cigarettes has

resulted  in a slight increase in price.  I  do  not

think,  however,  that  this  increase  will   cause

hardship.  If  it does in any particular  case,  the

remedy  lies  in the hands of the consumer.  He  can

reduce  his consumption or switch to cheaper  brands

or  he  can  give up smoking altogether  which  will

probably  be to his benefit, if not to that  of  the

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate of tax on liquor calls

for no comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards petrol, the taxpayer can perhaps regard

himself  as  fortunate in so  far  as  he  lives  in

Singapore and not in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked to draw attention to a printing

error which appeared in Sessional Paper No. S.L.  33

of  1956.  "Northern Island" is quoted in the  Paper

instead   of  "Northern  Ireland".  That  has   been

corrected in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section  11  of  the Customs Ordinance  (Cap.  160),

resolves  that the Customs (Duties) (No.  2)  Order,

1956, published as Notification No. S  307  in  the

<div align="center"><b>LIQUIDATION OF SPECIAL RESERVE FUND</b></div>



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the Special

Reserve Fund of one hundred million dollars, created

by Resolution of the Legislative Council on the 15th

December, 1953, be liquidated with effect  from  the

1st of January, 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a meeting on 15th December, 1953, the

Legislative Council resolved firstly,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That a sum of $50 millions be appropriated from

the General Revenue Balances of the Colony to form a

Development  Reserve Fund to meet expenditure  which

may  arise  in  the  future in connection  with  the

development  programme of the Colony,  this  Reserve

Fund  and  the  interest  derived  therefrom  to  be

invested  by  the Crown Agents for the  Colonies  on

behalf  of  the  Government of the  Colony  in  such

securities  as may from time to time be approved  by

the Secretary of State."



<br><br>And secondly,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That a Special Reserve Fund of $100 millions be

created to meet extraordinary expenditure which  may

arise  in  the future and that for this purpose  the

amount  standing to the credit of the Opium  Revenue

Replacement  Reserve  Fund at 31st  December,  1953,

shall  be  transferred to the said  Special  Reserve

Fund,  together  with  the difference  between  that

amount and $100 millions to be appropriated from the

General Reserve Balances of the Colony, this Reserve

Fund  and  the  interest  derived  therefrom  to  be

invested  by  the Crown Agents for the  Colonies  on

behalf  of  the  Government of the  Colony  in  such

securities  as may from time to time be approved  by

the Secretary of State."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing this motion, Sir, the Financial

Secretary said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that it was intended to create a Development

Reserve  Fund  amounting to  $50  million  from  the

General   Revenue   Balance  to  ensure   that   the

Development  Plans can be financed  on  the  capital

side;  and  also  a  Special Reserve  Fund  of  $100

million  to provide a cushion to enable us to  carry

on our various services should there be a heavy drop

in revenue."



<br><br>Later, he said that appropriations would not be made

from either of these Funds except by resolutions  of

the  Council.  That,  Sir, is  the  history  of  the

Special  Reserve Fund and of the Development Reserve

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved the Second Reading of the

Appropriation  Bill, I drew attention  to  the  fact

that  our Development commitments were such that  it

was  going to be extremely difficult to find all the

funds  required  to  meet  them  and  that  it   was

necessary to make all funds surplus to basic reserve

requirements  available  for  Development.  I   also

invited  attention  to  the fact  that  our  Reserve

position  was reasonably strong and considerably  in

excess  of  the accepted minimum requirements  of  a

territory like Singapore. I therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



suggested   that   the  Special  Reserve   Fund   be

liquidated,  the  sum  of  $70  million,  that   is,

approximately   four  months  revenue,   should   be

retained  as  a liquid General Revenue  Balance  and

that   the   balance  of  our  Reserves  should   be

transferred  to  the Development Reserve  Fund.  The

liquid  General Revenue Balance will be  the  sheet-anchor  of the Colony's finances. It will act  as  a

Revenue and Expenditure Equalisation Fund from which

unforeseen  shortfalls  in  revenue  and  unexpected

increases in expenditure can be met until such  time

as   the  original  position  can  be  restored   by

increased taxation or by saving on expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion aims at giving effect to this proposal

and  I  hope that it will have the support  of  hon.

Members.  The position before and after the approval

of  this motion is shown in the Draft Estimates.  On

pages  6  and 7 of the Draft Estimates, hon. Members

will see the Statement of Assets and Liabilities  in

the old form. On page 8 will be seen a Statement  of

Assets and Liabilities drawn up with Special Reserve

Fund  liquidated,  Singapore Improvement  Trust  and

other   long-term  loans  charged  to  Expenditure - a

matter    which   was   touched   on   yesterday - the

Development  Fund increased by $58 million  and  the

General  Revenue Balance reduced to $70 million.  On

page  367  of the Draft Estimates will be  seen  the

reconstituted  Development  Reserve  Account.   This

account  shows  on  one  side  the  balance  in  the

Development  Reserve  Fund, contributions  from  the

Colonial    Development    and    Welfare     Funds,

Contributions   from  Revenue  to  Development   and

Repayment   of   capital   on   existing   Singapore

Improvement Trust long-term loans. On the other side

are  shown  the  sums estimated to be  required  for

General  Development  and loans to  quasi-Government

bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of this method of presentation is

that it shows, on one side, the funds available  for

Development,  and,  on  the  other,  all  our  known

commitments  in  any particular year.  The  previous

Development  account  showed  only  commitments   in

respect of General Development.

<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I could

gather from the Hon. the Financial Secretary is that

the  last  Legislature  wanted  to  put  aside  $150

million  for a rainy day and that it should  now  be

liquidated.  May I ask why in the 18 months  working

of  this new Government, we have come to such a  sad

position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Yes, Sir. I fear that my friend the

Member for Telok Ayer does not quite appreciate  the

position,  Sir. The Legislative Council established,

first of all, the Development Reserve Fund which was

to  be  used for Development until it was  exhausted

and  a  Special  Reserve Fund of $100 million  which

indeed  was, as he said, for a rainy day. But  if  I

may say so, Sir, the rainy day is now upon us and we

have  to  make  a  certain portion of  that  Special

Reserve   Fund   available   for   Development    if

Development  is  to continue. I think  that  we  are

perfectly safe in reducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



our  liquid  reserve to $70 million. It  is  a  very

substantial  sum  and  I  think  that  it  will   be

sufficient  to protect us against any  shower  which

may occur in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Development Fund, we estimate

that  by  the  end  of this year, the  original  $50

million will have been reduced to something  of  the

order of $11.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the Special

Reserve Fund of one hundred million dollars, created

by Resolution of the Legislative Council on the 15th

December, 1953, be liquidated with effect  from  the

1st of January, 1957.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Education whether he will supply

details of the total cost of construction and equipping of each Government

technical, secondary and primary school completed in the year 1956 to date,

including figures showing cost of (a) purchase of land,

(b) clearance of site, (c) construction of building, (d) provision of roads,

playing grounds, drainage and fencing and (e) furniture and equipment; and whether he will give information

reagarding the economies made in construction of these schools compared with the schools completed in 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In 1955 the primary schools were completed; in 1956

twenty-one primary schools and two secondary technical schools. The details

of their cost are shown in the following tables:-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All but two of the primary schools built in 1955-6 were planned in 1953-4.

They contain 16 classrooms in a standard three-storey block. 14 class-rooms were

then used to accommodate the two streams of a 7-year primary course. With 40

pupils in each class and the schools used for morning and afternoon

sessions the schools thus provided accommodation for 1,120 pupils.

The other two classrooms were used for the teaching of music and vernacular languages.

and, when the folding partition was drawn back, as a school hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, the 7-year primary course was condensed to 6 years, and the schools accommodated

2� streams in 15 classrooms. This means that there are three streams and two streams in alternate

classes, so that accommodation is provided for 1,200 pupils in hte two sessions. This economy

has meant the sacrifice of accommodation previously used for language teaching, so that

classes have had to be held in hte bicycle shed, the tiffin shed, and even in the open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary schools now being planned will be of 3 storeys and will have 18 classrooms

with accommodation for 1,440 pupils. The size of each classroom has been

reduced from 30' by 22' by 11' 4" to 27' by 20' by 10' 6".

Accommodation for music will be provided in an annexe off the tiffin shed. By these and other

economies it has been possible to accommodate 320 more pupils in each

school without any increase in the cost of building, assuming that the cost of labour and

materials remains constant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As each school will accommodate more pupils, fewer schools need be build, so that there is a further saving on the cost of sites

and the salaries of principals, clerks and servants. any further increase in

size, however, would have educational disadvantages to offset against the saving in cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two secondary technical schools were completed in 1956. They were originally

designed as trade schols and have insufficient classrooms and laboratory accommodation.

The school to  be built in 1957 will accommodate more pupils and appreciably reduce

the cost per pupil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No academic secondary school was completed in 1955-6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for the greatest possible economy in school building is kept

continually in mide by a Working Party on whcih the Tresury, The P.W.D. and

Ministry of Education are represented.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTAL PRAWN PONDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will supply details of  the

total  catch  of fish, prawns and crabs obtained  in

the  two Government experimental prawn ponds for the

period  January - October 1956 and  the  sum  realised

therefrom;  and whether it is anticipated  that  the

catch for the year 1956 will exceed that for 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The total catch was 6,638

katis made up as follows:

<pre>

             Fish      946 Katis

            Crabs      100 Katis

            Prawns   5,592 Katis

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum realised therefrom was $7,802.08.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 the ponds were operated at the maximum

level  of  production in order  to  determine  basic

data.  It  is not expected that the catch  for  that

year  will  be exceeded in 1956 because  experiments

during  the  current year are being conducted  on  a

basis  of  fewer  operations  with  the  object   of

reducing   labour   costs  and  obtaining   a   more

economical yield.
