this would be the most convenient time, Mr Speaker,

Sir, It is nothing of public import. It concerns the

inaccuracy  of the statement which I made  yesterday

when  I  quoted  the  Member  for  Anson  from   the

transcript  of Radio Singapore. He is reported  from

the transcript to have said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And I want to put this to you which you have

forgotten: that they say to you that they  will  put

the alternative. Do you want the P.A.P. proposals or

do  you want complete merger. I say to you that I am

prepared,  since  the journalists  are  present,  to

donate  $1,000 to the National Union of  Journalists

if  in fact the alternatives are put in that way and

not in an alleged complete merger in accordance with

Penang  and  Malacca. And let me show you  what  the

P.A.P....'.



<br><br>In   a   subsequent  statement  he  made  - something

different,  Mr Speaker, Sir - he made an alteration.

This is subsequent to what he said. However, for the

delectation of those Members who are interested, the

tape  recorder will be in the Library at  5  o'clock

for their entertainment during the tea break.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the main interest in this sitting of the Assembly has been on the passage of the National

Referendum Bill and the questions which  are  to  be

posed  at  the referendum itself. Both  these  items

have  been disposed of. They have taken the  greater

part of two weeks' debate and the remaining items on

the  Order  Paper are of little significance.  So  I

would  suggest, Mr Speaker, that since I have given

notice  that the Government intends to adjourn  this

Assembly sine die tomorrow night, it is fitting that

I  should here move this motion that the proceedings

on  all  items  should come to a  conclusion  at  12

o'clock midnight tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Complaint by Member for Anson)</b></div>



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

the motion* standing in my name.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their

Third Report as contained in Paper L.A. 12 of 1962.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Report of the Committee of

Privileges  arises out of a complaint by the  Member

for  Anson that the Minister for Finance was  guilty

of abuse and breach of privilege in that he made the

following statements :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) 'Sir, we saw during those days how the Member

for  Anson,  when  he was Chief  Minister,  was

chased   from  pillar  to  post,  allowed   the

administration to collapse, allowed  the  whole

apparatus of State to be regarded with contempt

by people who should have been taught a lesson.

The  result  of  his feeble, weak,  vacillating

policies   was   that   ultimately   when   the

Communists mounted the effort against  him,  he

was  reduced to a quivering, whimpering,  half-demented...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 'It is quite unnecessary for me to conjure up

imaginative  events when they are  recorded  in

newspaper  accounts, when  everyone  knew  that

when  the major effort was mounted against him,

he fell sick.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 'And in Singapore, one degree North of

Equator, where the temperature is always  above

80  degrees,  the Member for Anson  had  to  go

around in woollen suits, and eventually...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) 'Quite unlike the Member for Anson, Sir, who

tries  to avoid unpleasant decisions, we  stand

up  to  the challenge, Mr Speaker, Sir. We  do

not  scoot  like cowards, like the  Member  for

Anson'".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint of breach of privilege by the Member

for Anson could not be sustained by the Committee as

it  is  accepted  that there should  be  freedom  of

speech  and  debate in the Assembly so long  as  the

rules  of debate and order contained in the Standing

Orders  are  observed. And indeed this privilege  of

speech  is  empowered  in the  Legislative  Assembly

(Privileges,  Immunities and  Powers)  Ordinance  of

1962.  In fact, in the evidence given by the  Member

for Anson himself on the 26th June, he admitted that

there could be no breach of privilege. I quote  from

page C24 of the Report, col. 23, questions 52 to 54:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'52. Mr Rajah: Now, may I deal with the breach of

privilege first, Mr Marshall?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: No. If I might answer that, Mr

Rajah. I am not well aware of, how shall I say  it,

the  law  with reference to this but I  have  since

then looked at it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



and it seems to me that it is an abuse of privilege

rather than a breach of ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Mr Rajah: That is what I was trying to get at.

If anything is to arise out of this, it is under the

head  of  abuse  of privilege and not  a  breach  of

privilege?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: I think that is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. Mr Rajah: You will accept that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: I think so, yes. Because he has a

privilege  to  speak,  so  there  is  no  breach  of

privilege there in standing up to speak.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having dismissed the complaint of

breach  of  privilege,  the  Committee  went  on  to

consider  whether  the  Minister  for  Finance,  had

committed  an  abuse of privilege. The  position  of

Members  during  a debate in the Assembly  has  been

very  succinctly and aptly described by  the  Member

for  Farrer  Park in the Minutes of  Evidence  - page

C32,  col. 40, question 120. This is what the Member

for Farrer Park said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'120. Mr Rajah: There is this one aspect that is

worrying  me.  It  seems to  me,  listening  to  Mr

Marshall,  that it is a question of strong  language

bordering on whatever he feels it is. Now,  on  that

aspect,  Mr David Marshall, if I enter a boxing  ring,  I

expect  to be hit and hit hard with the gloves;  and

if  I enter the political arena, I expect to be  hit

hard,  I  must not be over squeamish. Now I am  just

wondering,  Mr David Marshall,  whether,  we  all  being

politicians,  we hit hard sometimes and  if  someone

hits us equally hard, should we object?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real complaint by the Member for Anson can be

seen in his reply. He had this to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The answer to that, Sir,...'---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Leader of

the  House that his duty now is just to present this

Report  and  not  to justify it.  He  presents  this

Report.  This  is  the Report of  the  Committee  of

Privileges.  If it is challenged, then,  of  course,

the Leader of the House comes forward to justify it.

He is now reopening the whole matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am precisely

doing that, presenting the Report to this House. The

conclusions have been drawn here, that the Committee

has  not  considered this a breach of privilege  and

that the Committee has not considered it an abuse of

privilege.  So I am just seeking to explain  to  the

House  why it is not an abuse of privilege  and  how

this Committee arrived at those conclusions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader of the House

will  find all the reasons given in the Report.  All

these things were considered by the Committee and it

has  come to certain conclusions. The Leader of  the

House  just presents those conclusions to the House.

If  the conclusions are challenged, then, of course,

it is the duty of the Leader of the House to justify

those conclusions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the motion moved by

the  Member for Anson referred to a possibility that

the  Minister  for Finance was guilty  of  abuse  of

privilege.  This Report shows that the Minister  for

Finance  had  in  fact  not committed  a  breach  of

privilege. As you wish it, Mr Speaker, I will  just

read  out  from the Report the conclusions that  the

Committee has arrived at. It is at page 3, paragraph

18 onwards:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'18. The statements complained of were uttered in

the heat of debate in answer to points raised by Mr

David  Marshall,  as  can be  clearly  seen  in  the

official  report,  an  extract  whereof  is  annexed

hereto. Your Committee are therefore satisfied  that

there  is no evidence that the statements were  made

deliberately or maliciously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. Your Committee are further satisfied that the

statements  complained  of  contain  no  more   than

assessments  made  by  Dr  Goh  Keng  Swee  of  the

political and administrative situation at  the  time

Mr   David   Marshall  was  Chief   Minister.   The

statements also contain comments which are  critical

of  and  express opinions in regard to the political

conduct and activities of Mr David Marshall at that

time. The denials made by Mr David Marshall do not,

in  the view of your Committee, take the matter  any

further.  They  merely served to and did  excite  an

exchange  of  political arguments, a great  deal  of

which  was  irrelevant  to  the  issue  before  your

Committee.  As the contending arguments put  forward

can  be  honestly  maintained on either  side,  your

Committee consider that it cannot be said  that  the

statements complained of are false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Your Committee, therefore, find that the claim

by  Mr David Marshall that in making the statements

complained  of, Dr Goh Keng Swee was guilty  of  an

abuse of privilege cannot be sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. Your Committee note that the language used by

Dr  Goh Keng Swee was couched in intemperate terms,

but,  having  regard to the heat of the moment,  and

the  undoubted provocation accorded to Dr Goh  Keng

Swee  as  a Member of the Government when Mr  David

Marshall  criticised the Government for the  use  of

military forces



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



"in a highly provocative manner", your Committee

make no recommendation in the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. In the light of the above, your Committee

recommend that no action be taken on the complaint

of Mr David Marshall.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No division?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is a serious matter which

affects the Assembly. It does not affect any

individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee of

Privileges in their Third Report as contained in

Paper L.A. 12 of 1962.

<div align="center"><b>AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>2.48 p.m.





<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the following

amendments,  as recommended in paragraph  8  of  the

First  Report  of the Standing Orders Committee  and

contained in Paper L.A. 8 of 1962, be and are hereby

made to the Standing Orders of this Assembly:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) Standing Order No. 31:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (2): In line 3, leave out "shall" and

insert "may".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(b) Standing Order No. 35:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) After "35", insert---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) No private Member's motion shall be

proceeded with unless, upon the notice of such

motion  being  read,  support  thereof  or  in

principle  shall be signified to the  Assembly

by  at  least one Member then present  in  the

Chamber  or  unless the notice of such  motion

have  been signed by a supporter or supporters

under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (2)   of

Standing  Order  No.  31  (Manner  of   giving

Notices)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Re-number paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) as

(2), (3) and (4), respectively.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the position today

is  that  a  Member who seeks to raise a  matter  of

national importance on a motion requires to have the

signature  of  at  least one  other  Member  of  the

Assembly  supporting the motion  before  it  can  be

entertained. That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



to  say,  there  must be at least two signatures  to

that motion before it can be tabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have, Sir, in a very painstaking memorandum,

if  I may say so, pointed out that in Australia, the

Federation   of   Malaya,  Ceylon,   Canada,   South

Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Nigeria, a  motion

does  not  require  two  signatures  before  it   is

entertained. But after it is moved in the House,  it

must  be  seconded  in the House before  it  can  be

proceeded  with  after  the opening  speech  of  the

mover.  The procedure in India, however, and in  the

House  of  Commons, is that no seconder is  required

and  any Member may table a motion in his own  name,

no  supporter is required in the House  itself,  and

once it is moved, it becomes a matter for debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member, of course, is a

Member  of the Standing Orders Committee and  was  a

Member when this Report was agreed to. I do not know

what he is aiming at, whether he wishes to send this

Report  back  or  just  draw  attention  to  salient

points,  because  if he tries to  send  this  Report

back,  then I must inform him that that is not  good

parliamentary  practice. If he  wished  that  to  be

done,  he  should  have  asked  another  Member   to

interest himself in this.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, your anticipation in

this  case  is unfounded because you must  be  aware

that  I  did,  in  fact,  support  this  Report   in

Committee. I am merely seeking to draw attention and

to  give thanks to those who saw the point and  gave

assistance  in a matter of some importance  to  this

House. If you will bear with me, I will not be long,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that in Singapore the requirement for

a  supporter  to  sign the motion  paper  means,  in

effect,   that  an  independent  Member  or   single

representative  of his Party in the Assembly  is  in

the acutely difficult position of having to hawk his

motion  around to other Opposition Parties, pleading

for  a  supporter, and very often, Sir - I mean, there

is no secret about this - I found that though a motion

has  the  goodwill, support, and sympathy  of  other

Members  of  the Opposition side, nevertheless,  for

party reasons or for other reasons,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



support  has not been forthcoming in actual fact  in

the   concrete   form  of  a  signatures,   I   must

nevertheless express my indebtedness to the  Barisan

Sosialis  as well as to the independent  Member  for

Joo  Chiat  for  having come to my  assistance  very

often  in  the  past in order to  bring  matters  of

national moment before this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indebted to the Member for Hong Lim who,

becoming conscious of the unfairness of the existing

provisions, was good enough to bring the  matter  to

the  attention  of this House in  his  motion  and

thereby started the machinery in the Standing Orders

Committee.  Sir, the Report of the  Committee  is  a

compromise between the suggestion of the Member for

Hong  Lim and the existing position. If adopted,  it

means  that  in future an independent Member,  or  a

single  representative  of his  Party,  may  have  a

motion tabled, and may in this Assembly rise to move

it,  and  it is only at that stage that the  Speaker

will  require that the Member signified  support  in

principle. This is a considerable improvement to the

existing  position, and I would like  to  take  this

opportunity. Mr Speaker, of expressing appreciation

for a very helpful provision, not only to the Member

for  Hong  Lim  who initiated it, but  also  to  the

constructive efforts of the Member for Cairnhill who

showed   considerable  conciliatory  abilities   and

contributed to a solution at a stage when it  seemed

that  the  adamant P.A.P. intransigence would  prove

overwhelming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I say, with respect, that

I  am  indebted for the very considerable assistance

and guidance given by you in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Anson   is   very  profuse  with  his  thanks   this

afternoon.  But  he reserves his position  vis-a-vis

the  other Members of the Committee who probably  do

not see eye to eye with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just remind the House that in, the Report,

page  A3,  it  has  been  stated  very  clearly  the

practice that is followed in other legislatures.  In

Australia, the Federation of Malaya, Ceylon, Canada,

South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Nigeria,  no

motion can be proceeded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



with  unless it be seconded by somebody else in  the

House. We should as far as possible try to keep  our

Standing Orders as close as possible to those of the

Federation  of Malaya, particularly in view  of  the

fact that everyone in this House has agreed upon the

principle  of  merger  between  Singapore  and   the

Federation.  It  would indeed  be  invidious  if  we

follow one set of rules and the Federation of Malaya

follows another set of rules. But perhaps the Member

for Anson would make a particular note that even  in

Australia,  South Australia, Tasmania and  Victoria,

no  motion  can  be  proceeded  with  unless  it  is

seconded on the floor of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the following

amendments,  as recommended in paragraph  8  of  the

First  Report  of the Standing Orders Committee  and

contained in Paper L.A. 8 of 1962, be and are hereby

made to the Standing Orders of this Assembly:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) Standing Order No. 31:

Paragraph  (2): In line 3, leave out "shall"  and

insert "may".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) After "35", insert ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) No private Member's motion shall be

proceeded with unless, upon the notice of such

motion  being  read,  support  thereof  or  in

principle  shall be signified to the  Assembly

by  at  least one Member then present  in  the

Chamber  or  unless the notice of such  motion

has  been  signed by a supporter or supporters

under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (2)  of

Standing  Order  No.  31  (Manner  of  giving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



exercising their civic rights in discussing  matters

of  national importance affecting all of  them,  and

condemns  the Government for using its Police  Force

on  9th  and  16th  June, 1962,  to  intimidate  and

prevent  meetings  that  were  to  be  held  at  the

premises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees'

Union to discuss the Referendum Bill; and calls upon

the  Government  to immediately stop its  repressive

actions   in   denying   the   people   and    their

organisations  their fundamental  democratic  rights

and civil liberties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure all of us in this House vividly

recall the banning of these two meetings referred to

in this motion and the circumstances under which the

meetings were banned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason given by the Government in its

Press   statement   on  9th  of  June,   which   was

subsequently  published in the  Sunday  Times  dated

10th  of  June, meant that because there were  riots

following   the  formation  of  the   Civil   Rights

Convention in 1956, therefore, there would be  riots

this  year. To refresh the minds of Members of  this

House. Sir, perhaps - I do not have with me a copy  of

the  Government statement - but I will read  out  what

the Straits Times reported in its Sunday edition  on

the 10th of June, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government has information also that these

persons  will  at this meeting form an  organisation

similar   to   the  1956  civil  rights  convention

committee  in  order to promote further  agitation,"

the statement said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it added: "Their move is in fact a repetition

of  the  history leading up to the riots of  October

1956."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, in the statement, the Government went

to  the  absurd extent of suggesting that the  Civil

Rights  Convention  in  1956  was  organised  by   a

Committee  of  11 members and that the Trade  Unions

Working Committee which called these meetings at the

Singapore  Motor Workshop Employees Union  was  also

composed of 11 men and that, therefore, riots  would

follow. Sir, this is utter stupidity and shows  that

even  logic has departed from Government propaganda.

However,  Sir,  this suggestion, that because  there

was  rioting in 1956 there will be rioting in  1962,

must  be examined and answered at the outset. And  I

propose  to do this before I recount all the  events

that  led  up  to the meetings and the circumstances

under which the meetings were banned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government suggestion meant that the

purpose of the Trade Unions Working Committee was to

incite rioting. Firstly, Sir, one cannot assume that

the  riots  in  1956 were the result  of  the  Civil

Rights  Convention, and one cannot assume  that  the

1956  riots  were  caused by the organisers  of  the

convention. As a matter of fact, the Prime  Minister

himself  made  suggestions to this  effect  in  this

House  in  1956  when he sought  to  move  a  motion

condemning the Government for its arrest of  people

who  were closely associated with the Prime Minister

in  his  political life. Secondly. Sir, it would  be

wrong  to  assume that there will be riots if  these

meetings of the trade unions and civic organisations

are  permitted. I fail to understand how the  P.A.P.

leadership could be so absurd in their reasoning. To

say  that there were riots in 1956 because there was

the  Civil  Rights Convention and, therefore,  there

will  be  riots in 1962 if the Trade Unions  Working

Committee  were allowed to organise a convention  is

as  absurd as to say that because Mr Harry Lee  was

in  Fraser's Hill playing golf in 1956 and there was

a  riot in Singapore, there will be another riot  in

1962  should Mr Harry Lee run to Fraser's  Hill  to

play golf ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wonder who Mr Harry Lee is. He is a

stranger in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Harry Lee, prior to 1959, Sir, was the

Secretary-General of the People's Action  Party.  He

happens  to  be the Prime Minister of the Government

and,  to keep in line. Sir, I should substitute "the

Prime Minister" for "Mr Harry Lee".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the P.A.P. so desperate that they have

lost all sense of logic? It is not necessary for  me

to   illustrate  further  their  muddled   thinking.

However, it is interesting to draw the attention  of

this  House to one aspect in the comparison  of  the

Civil Rights Convention and the present Trade Unions

Working Committee. It is that the Prime Minister  is

now  not the legal adviser to this Committee  or  to

the unions which attended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



the  meeting  called  by  this  Committee.  Sir,  if

nothing else, this fact may yet show that there will

be no rioting in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me stress that a study of the

events in the past has shown that whenever there was

rioting,  it was preceded by police provocation.  If

there  were  no  provocation,  there  would  be   no

rioting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government banned these two meetings which

were  called in the premises of the Singapore  Motor

Workshop  Employees Union to discuss  matters  of

national  importance. The first meeting, Sir,  which

had  been scheduled for 9th June, 1962, was to  have

been  attended  by representatives of trade  unions,

rural  dwellers,  University students,  professional

organisations  and  other civic  organisations.  The

second  meeting, Sir, which had been  scheduled  for

16th  June,  1962,  was  to have  been  attended  by

representatives  of  trade unions  only.  Sir,  both

these  meetings were convened by the Singapore Trade

Unions  Working  Committee, a Committee  of  liaison

officers  of  about 40 trade unions  representing  a

total membership of more than 100,000 workers.  Sir,

this  Committee  was appointed  on  5th  June  at  a

meeting  held  by representatives of over  40  trade

unions.  This Committee was appointed in the context

of  a  situation wherein the civil rights of workers

and  of our people as a whole were being shamelessly

threatened by a discredited Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5th of June meeting was called to discuss the

Government's   attitude   to   the   National    Day

celebrations  organised by these trade unions.  This

meeting,  Sir, also discussed briefly the Referendum

Bill.  It is interesting, Mr Speaker, to note  that

the Government took no action whatsoever to ban this

meeting  nor did any riots result from  it,  and  it

also  took  no  action  whatsoever  against  similar

meetings in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that sometime in May these

very    unions    had   enthusiastically    accepted

invitations  from the Government to  participate  in

the  Government-sponsored National Day celebrations.

However, a few days later,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



the  unions  announced  their  withdrawal  from  the

celebrations  at  the Padang. This was  because  the

unions  became  aware  of  the  P.A.P.  Government's

intention   to   make  use  of  the   National   Day

celebrations as political propaganda in  support  of

their infamous merger proposals. The Government  was

planning  to interpret the turn-up at the Padang  as

indicative of mass popular approval of the  P.A.P.'s

plan  to shackle the people of Singapore with  their

merger   plot.   Sir,  this  is  the  characteristic

behaviour of the P.A.P., dishonestly distorting  the

people's     wishes    and    expressions.     These

characteristics of the P.A.P. leaders, Sir, have now

successfully invaded and entrenched themselves among

the  laws  of  the country. And, Sir,  we  have  the

Referendum Bill as an outstanding example which  has

managed to pass through this House in spite  of  the

overwhelming opposition to it amongst our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to frustrate this dishonest scheme of

the  P.A.P., the trade unions decided to observe the

National Day with separate celebrations. A rally  of

workers was organised to be held on 3rd June at  the

Happy  World Stadium. An application was made for  a

permit; a permit was given subject to ten conditions

which  included  a  ban on the display  of  national

emblems.  Sir,I do not `want to read  out  the  ten

conditions,  but I do want to draw the attention  of

Members of this House to a few of these conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition that prohibited the display of

national emblems was condition No. 6, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Persons attending must not display national

emblems.'



<br><br>Sorry, Sir, this is not from the Straits Times. This

happens   to  be  from  the  only  English  language

newspaper which contains the truth, and that is  the

Plebeian. And I must recommend it to this  House  to

read. This is the Plebeian, a fortnightly paper  for

the  common man. And it happens to be the  organ  of

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the condition which I read out just now is

interesting  because  this was  supposed  to  be  in

connection   with  the  National  Day  celebrations.

National  Day  celebrations are  celebrations  which

trade  unions want to observe, and yet  one  of  the

conditions was that they should not display national

emblems. One other condition that I want to draw the

attention of this House to is condition No. 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No processions are formed either proceeding to

join  the  assembly or leaving the assembly  on  the

termination of the meeting.'



<br><br>Sir,  here "procession" does not necessarily mean  a

procession  where  banners  are  carried  and  where

hundreds of people march. A procession can  mean,  I

am told, five people walking together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the conditions were difficult

conditions to be strictly observed, the trade unions

were  prepared to go on with the rally. But  at  the

very  last moment, the Government issued a statement

saying  that  if  any  of  the  ten  conditions  was

breached - any  of the ten conditions was breached - the

registration of the trade union concerned  would  be

cancelled.  As  I said, it is almost  impossible  to

ensure that none of the conditions is breached,  for

instance, the two conditions that I read out. It is difficult -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have followed the hon.

Member  carefully. This is in relation to  something

that  happened on 3rd June. It does not seem  to  be

touched upon by the motion which deplores the action

of  the Government in preventing workers, etc., from

exercising their civic rights in discussing  matters

of  national importance affecting all of  them,  and

condemns the Government for using its. Police  Force

on  9th  and  16th  June - preventing representatives

from  exercising  their civic rights  in  discussing

matters  of national importance. I do not  know  how

this ties up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, I appear to be dwelling on

this,  but what I, in fact, seek to do is to briefly

set out the circumstances under which the Committee

which convened the meetings on the 9th and 16th was

formed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did anticipate that. But I

think  the Member is going into too much detail.  If

he  is  just leading up to that point, then  he  can

touch on these incidents very briefly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, I will not go into further

details.  It was clear from the conditions and  from

the  Press  statement that the  Government  in  its

desperation  would use any excuse to deregister  the

unions. In the face of this threat, the unions  were

not able to celebrate National Day and the rally was

cancelled. Following this, on 5th June, the 40 trade

unions   met  and  discussed  the  whole  situation,

including  the  threat posed to the people  and  the

workers by the Referendum Bill. At this meeting  the

Trade  Unions  Working Committee  was  appointed  to

convene a delegates' meeting of various trade unions

and  civic  organisations. As  I  have  pointed  out

earlier on, the Government took no action whatsoever

to ban the meeting held on the 5th of June as it had

taken  no  action whatsoever to ban similar meetings

in  the past. Accordingly, the Committee convened  a

meeting  of  about 100 organisations to  consider  a

declaration on the Referendum Bill. Here I must  say

briefly  that we must not lose sight of  the  threat

posed by the Referendum Bill which naturally aroused

apprehension among the workers who were  represented

by these organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P., burdened with the guilt of its

treachery  to  the people, was bent on checking  the

expression  of all popular views of the  people  and

the  organisations. Burdened with this guilt, it was

also looking for any excuse to remove from the scene

any  organisation that opposed and exposed its  evil

designs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 9th June, in the 7 p.m. news of Radio

Singapore,  a  special announcement of a  Government

statement   was   made.  In  this   statement,   the

Government threatened these organisations. And if  I

may  briefly read what the Sunday Times of 10th June

has to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An hour before the meeting was to be held [you

will  note, Sir, just one hour - in fact, it was  less

than  one  hour; they could have very well  informed

the  Committee  very much earlier] in the  Singapore

Motor Workshop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



Employees'  Union  in Bukit Timah Road,  the  Police

issued  this  warning to the organisers,  "Call  off

this illegal assembly or face immediate action.'



<br><br>Sir,  this  Government statement was  put  over  the

radio  as  a special announcement and, at  the  same

time,  scores of police and Special Branch  officers

were  sent  to  the premises of the  Motor  Workshop

Employees'  Union where the meeting was to  be  held

and  the  members of the Committee were each  served

with  a  letter  which said that the meeting  was  a

public assembly and, as such, illegal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an account of what happened from here onwards

is  given in the Memorandum of Appeal to all Members

of  this House sent by the Working Committee of  the

40 trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the members of the Committee were

advised  and  were fully aware that the meeting  was

not  a  public assembly and that it was well  within

their  rights  to  proceed with  the  meeting,  they

called it off because they knew the intention of the

Government.  Sir, the Government have  been  looking

for  some  excuse to provoke violence  and  step  up

their  repressive  measures. In  the  face  of  open

provocation  by  an  unreasonable  Government,   the

unions  on their part showed extreme reasonableness.

They  showed  the same restraint and  reasonableness

they    had   exercised   on   previous   occasions,

particularly in the case of calling off the National

Day celebrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following this disgraceful Government attitude

of  denying free discussion on the unfair Referendum

Bill,  of  denying the democratic  rights  of,  free

association and free communication, the Trade Unions

Working Committee proceeded to convene a meeting  of

the  40  odd unions in order to report on the  grave

situation  that  had arisen. In  other  words,  they

merely convened a meeting of the same people who had

appointed them to report back. This was the meeting,

Sir,  which was convened for Saturday, 16th June.  A

meeting of union representatives of this nature  was

not  unusual in Singapore. There are precedents. The

Government  had never interfered with such  meetings

in  the  past. It is needless to say that the P.A.P.

leaders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



themselves,   including  people  like   the   Prime

Minister,   the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister for Culture, the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Health, etc., had convened similar

meetings  in  the past. In fact, the Prime  Minister

used  to  be a regular speaker in these meetings  in

the   years  prior  to  1959.  However,   Sir,   the

Government  once again was determined to deny  these

organisations  the  right to  discuss  matters  that

affected all of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of 16th June, the Committee's

Chairman  and the Secretary were informed  that  the

meeting  would be unlawful - only this  time  by  the

Registrar of Societies and not by the Acting  Deputy

Commissioner of Police. Sir, once again, the  unions

cancelled the meeting. The primary consideration for

the  cancellation of the meeting was to prevent  the

Government  from  having an  opportunity  to  incite

violence.  I must say that at the second meeting  on

the  16th, there were more policemen than there were

in  fact  at the first meeting. Sir, in calling  off

this  meeting, once again the unions showed  extreme

restraint  and reasonableness in the face of  direct

provocation. Sir, one could not truthfully say  that

the  unions wanted to create trouble. Had the unions

wanted  to create trouble, had the unions wanted  to

incite  violence  - as  the  Government  suggest  the

obvious  thing  to  do  was to  carry  on  with  the

meetings. Sir, if the objective of the unions was to

create  tension and violence, obviously they  should

have continued with their plans for the National Day

celebrations   for   example.   They   should   have

deliberately  defied the Government conditions,  for

example,  the  one banning the display  of  national

emblems, and invited Police action. Sir, even though

the  unions and their leaders had repeatedly  shown

their  reasonableness, the Government accusation  is

that they are subversive elements and that they want

to provoke violence. The facts clearly show that the

act of provocation was on the part of the Government

even  to  the  extent of sending police officers  to

challenge the Secretary of the Trade Unions Working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



Committee to go on with the meeting. Sir, if Members

of this House will read the memorandum that has been

sent,  they  will find the exact words used  in  the

challenge  to  the  Secretary of  the  Trade  Unions

Working Committee. The facts show beyond doubt  that

the  unions have been tolerant. The leaders of these

unions   who   are   accused  of   being   dangerous

adventurers have shown restraint and they have  been

extremely  responsible, The repeated  cancelling  of

legitimate  meetings - meetings that conform  to  the

rules  and regulations of the unions, meetings  that

were  legally  constituted, meetings that  were  not

uncommon in the history of the Singapore trade union

movement   - cannot   be   said   to   be   acts   of

unreasonableness. Sir, these are not actions of  men

who  want  trouble  or  want  to  be  provoked  into

trouble.  As  I have said, there are precedents  for

similar meetings. These are known to some Members of

the  House.  As  I  have said,  the  Prime  Minister

himself  has  been associated with such meetings  in

the  past  and, Sir, only recently after  his  world

tour,  in early June this year - I believe it was  on

the  1st  of  June  this year  - the  Prime  Minister

addressed   a   meeting   of   some   trade    union

representatives  on Malaysia at the Headquarters  of

the  St.  John Ambulance Brigade. Sir, the convenors

of  these meetings had no doubt whatsoever that  the

unions   were   acting  within  the   constitutional

authority    of    their    respective    registered

organisations. The Government, in disallowing  these

meetings,  merely  said that they  would  constitute

public  assembly. Sir, in a letter dated  9th  June,

1962,  the  Acting  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Police

stated  that  the  Singapore  Trade  Unions  Working

Committee was organising a public assembly, I should

like to read this letter which is, in fact, attached

to  the Memorandum of Appeal to all Members of  this

House.  It is dated 9th June and the first paragraph

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It has come to my notice that you and certain

other persons calling yourselves the Singapore Trade

Unions  Working  Committee have organised  a  public

assembly to be held in the premises of the Singapore

Motor Workshop Employees' Union.'

<br><br>Sir,  he  also  suggested in this  letter  that  the

promotion of that meeting would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



be an offence, but he did not quote any relevant law

to substantiate this suggestion. Paragraph 2 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have ascertained that you have not applied for

and  obtained a permit or licence to hold or conduct

such  assembly; and I am therefore to warn you  that

you and your colleagues on the Working Committee and

any  other persons responsible for the promotion  of

such  assembly will be committing an offence if  you

hold such assembly as planned by you.'



<br><br>Sir,  when  pressed  for  further  explanation,  the

Acting  Deputy Commissioner of Police stated in  his

letter of 14th June, 1962, that these meetings would

be  public  meetings in that they  came  within  the

definition  of "public entertainment" in the  Public

Entertainments Ordinance, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to the letter dated 14th June

addressed  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Trade  Unions

Working  Committee. The second paragraph, after  the

first line, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am advised that addresses, debates and

discussions at any place to which the public or  any

class of the public has access would come within the

definition  of "public entertainment" in the  Public

Entertainments Ordinance, 1958.'



<br><br>Sir,  he further stated - though very vaguely  in  his

letter - that  there  were  provisions  in  the  Minor

Offences Ordinance which could also be applied.  But

he  did  not  quote any particular sections  of  the

Ordinance. This was on the 14th. Subsequently,  Sir,

on  the  16th June, 1962, the Registrar of Societies

stated in his letter that these meetings would be in

contravention of the Societies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say quite categorically that the issue

involved  is  essentially  a  political  issue.  The

denial  of free association and free expression  is,

in fact, a denial of a fundamental democratic right.

It  is  not  an  issue which involves  merely  legal

technicalities.   Sir,  we  are   aware   that   the

Government  is  seeking to hide  behind  some  silly

legal technicalities. This, Sir, is the tragedy of a

shameless Government which does not have the decency

to  allow  the  people their basic  rights.  Sir,  a

Government  which  makes unfair laws  has  no  moral

right  and  no  justification to use those  laws  to

deprive our people and their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



legitimate  organisations freedom of expression.  In

short,  a Government which is capable of shamelessly

making  a law like the National Referendum Bill  has

no   moral  right  to  justify  its  act  by  unfair

interpretation of unjust laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, on the legal aspect of the

issue, the position is quite clear as far as we  are

concerned. The Government has sought deliberately to

give an unfair interpretation to the laws concerned.

The Government's interpretation, Sir, is ridiculous.

The  legal  opinion  given  by  a  leading  firm  of

advocates and solicitors has been attached -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

T. T. Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - has been attached to the memorandum to

Members  of  this House. I can assure  the  Minister

for Health and Law that the opinion is not got from

Mr T. T. Rajah, who happens to be the legal adviser

to  the  Barisan Sosialis. Sir, I am told that,  for

purposes  of  etiquette,  it  is  not  desirable  to

advertise the name of the legal firm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Advertise T. T. Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I have said that Mr T. T. Rajah is not

the  person  who is responsible for giving  us  this

view. But if -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is right for

the  hon.  Member to quote a legal opinion  from  an

anonymous  person. He can adopt those  arguments  as

his  own. But I cannot allow something to be  quoted

which is by an anonymous person. I take it that  the

Member  understands the position. He can adopt  - the

arguments as his own.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, I have authority to quote

the name of the firm, if it is necessary; but what I

do want to do is to quote from the opinion itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. But I have indicated to the

hon. Member how he can do it. He can adopt it as his

own  argument.  Although he is not a lawyer,  he  is

entitled to put forward legal arguments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to get this clear, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as a point of guidance. I want to know whether

it  is -  possible  to quote at least  parts  of  the

opinion itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That the Member cannot do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I know that, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the Member does not

think  that  he  is  being  hamstrung.  I  am   only

indicating what the proper procedure is. Any  Member

may  quote  any opinion as his own. He  adopts  that

opinion  as his own. He can just say, "I am  advised

that this is the law" and that is the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is exactly what I am going to do,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I was saying just now  that  the

interpretation the Government has given to  the  law

is,  in  my view, ridiculous. Sir, I wish  to  quote

here  what  I am advised to be the legal opinion  of

the  interpretation of the relevant Ordinances. Sir,

for our purposes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An unlawful society is any club, company-,

partnership  or association of ten or  more  persons

that is not registered.'



<br><br>I  am  reading from page 2 - somewhere in the middle

of the page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The hundred persons together with the nine do not

constitute   a   society  because  they   have   not

constituted themselves in any way.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundred persons referred to the persons who

attended  the  meeting and the  nine  to  the  Trade

Unions  Working  Committee. Sir,  the  Trade  Unions

Working Committee originally had 11 members. When it

was  pointed out by the Registrar that  it  was  not

possible  to  have eleven members, two were  knocked

off and the Committee was composed of nine members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They do not have any organisational attributes of

a  club,  company,  partnership or  association  but

remain  merely  delegates attending a  meeting.  Any

other construction of section 12 will again lead  to

the  most absurd result. Every person attending  the

forum  organised  by  the  University  of  Singapore

Students' Union on 19th June would have committed an

offence.   When   Radio  Singapore  invited   eleven

newspapers  or news agencies to send representatives

to  attend  a  meeting  and submit  questions  to  a

political  figure, and they did attend,  they  would

constitute an unlawful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



society.  So  would  a  Press  conference  similarly

attended.  Occasions such as these occur  frequently

without anyone being prosecuted under the Ordinance.

This  leads me to believe that the proposed  meeting

would  not  be an unlawful society whether  of  nine

persons or of 109 persons.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to add here that it is common

knowledge  that there are hundreds and  hundreds  of

social gatherings every day in Singapore where  more

than  nine people attend. The Prime Minister himself

calls   Press   conferences  of  more  than   eleven

reporters. Sir, a strict application of the law will

simply  mean that all these gatherings are  unlawful

assemblies and that before they could meet they must

get a police permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1956, the Prime Minister was the legal

adviser  to many trade unions in Singapore.  He  was

associated  with  meetings of a  similar  nature  in

those days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I warned them often that it

was illegal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Prime Minister

would like to rise on a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The legal adviser does not

undertake the responsibilities of the criminal. What

he  does is to tell an intending criminal that  what

he  is  doing  is running the risk of violating  the

law. If the criminal wants to carry on with it,  the

legal adviser does not thereby become a criminal. He

has advised against it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If the Prime Minister is a little

patient,  I will come in due course to what  he  has

just  said. I was saying that he was associated with

meetings  of a similar nature in those  days.  As  a

legal adviser -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member aware that every

one  of  those meetings that I attended  had  police

permits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



granted - at Bukit Timah, Jurong, Woodlands?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am sure the Prime Minister can

say what he has to say after I have finished what  I

have  to  say  first. Sir, as a  legal  adviser,  he

admits  that it was his responsibility to  see  that

these organisations that he advised conformed to the

laws  of  the  country. The fact that he  associated

himself with such meetings and the fact that he  did

not tell the unions - this we have ascertained, and  I

shall, Mr Speaker, Sir, in due course, refer  to  a

particular  meeting, and then find out  whether  the

Prime   Minister  advised  against   that   meeting.

However,  even  if  the  Prime  Minister - even   for

purposes of argument - advised the unions to take  out

a  permit,  and,  in  fact, the unions  took  out  a

permit - the police gave the permit - surely now that he

is the Prime Minister of the State of Singapore, why

does he not want to give the unions a permit to hold

this  meeting?  Sir, I am not saying for  a  moment,

neither  are  the unions of Singapore saying  for  a

moment,  that  we want to carry on holding  meetings

without police permits. Sir, never mind about  trade

unions.  Political parties which are represented  in

this  House  were denied police permits  to  hold  a

meeting  only last week. I shall deal with it  in  a

short while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Prime Minister is not

going  to  suggest that he participated in  unlawful

meetings and advised on their promotion knowing  the

meetings to have been unlawful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 the Prime Minister was the legal adviser

to  many unions which took part in the Civil  Rights

Convention. Sir, my understanding is that  he  never

warned them that it was against the law to hold such

a convention. He never warned that trade unions were

contravening   the   Trade   Unions   Ordinance   in

participating  at the convention, as the  Government

statement  suggested, when banning the two  meetings

called  by  the Trade Unions Working Committee  last

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my simple mind, the Prime Minister's

conduct  in 1956 must have been necessarily  due  to

one of the following three reasons: (1) He did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



know  the law; (2) he knew the law and he knew  that

the  meetings were perfectly legal; and (3) that  he

knew the law and he knew that it was not lawful  but

in  fact  he - wanted the Unions to get into  trouble

and thus he did not advise against it. Sir, I cannot

think  that  the  Prime Minister,  who  was  then  a

prominent  lawyer, would have acted on the  grounds

of  the  last  reason because that would  have  been

unethical.  It cannot be suggested that he  did  not

know the law - that is reason No. (1) - for that would

be  an  insult  to his intelligence. Therefore,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the logical conclusion that I can come

to  is  that the Prime Minister knew the law and  he

knew  that it was perfectly lawful for trade  unions

to participate in such conventions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House rightly condemns

the Government for using its police force on the 9th

and  16th of June to intimidate and prevent meetings

that  were  to be held in the premises of the  Motor

Shop  Employees Union. The Government objective  was

clearly  to  prevent  the unions  from  holding  any

discussion  on the Referendum Bill, no  matter  what

the  consequences were. The Government, in using the

police  force,  was  consciously trying  to  provoke

trouble.  Sir, an atmosphere of tension was  created

by  the  deliberate presence of uniformed  policemen

and  Special  Branch officers. Sir, riot  vans  were

kept  waiting.  The scene was set by the  Government

itself  to create an explosive situation.  Sir,  the

Government's intention to provoke trouble is clearly

seen  by the fact that it was only at the very  last

moment  that  they sought to inform  the  organisers

that  the  meeting  of  the 9th  of  June  would  be

unlawful.  It was only in the words of  the  Straits

Times, one hour before the meeting was scheduled  to

start  that  the  Government  announcement  of   the

banning of the meeting was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we have a Government that is prepared

to  go  to any limit to continue its political life.

The  Government  is  prepared  to  pass  unfair  and

undemocratic  laws  which are in conflict  with  the

fundamentals  of democracy. The P.A.P. leaders  who

call themselves democrats,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



who profess to be champions of  democracy,

are today by their very actions, destroying the very

foundations of a democratic society. Sir, the P.A.P.

seeks  to  use  this  Assembly  and  the  Government

machinery  to ensure the continuity of its political

life.  Today, to the Government, the value  of  this

legislature  is  only  to the extent  that  it  will

enable  them  to make unfair laws. Today,  Sir,  the

Government is seeking to bring about a police  State

where the people will be denied the right to express

their  legitimate grievances, where the people  will

be  denied  their basic right to organise themselves

against  traitors.  Sir, this  is  not  the  way  of

democracy.  We are at the moment seeing a systematic

suppression of popular expression of discontent. The

people  must  be  given peaceful and  constitutional

avenues of expression. This is being denied today by

an  unfair  Government even to Opposition  political

Parties.  As  I  briefly mentioned earlier  on,  the

Council of Joint Action was denied the right to hold

a  convention.  The parliamentary democratic  system

which the P.A.P. leaders profess to defend is at the

cross-roads  today.  The  people  have  watched  the

system  being abused, and the P.A.P. leaders are  to

blame themselves for this exposure of the system. It

is  not  the people they call Communists.  Sir,  the

damage  done  already  is  considerable.  From   now

onwards,  the people will be more vigilant  and  any

further abuse will necessarily result in our  people

losing  all  faith  in  this  system,  and  in   all

constitutional means of expressing their  grievances

and  by  necessity, they may turn to  other  perhaps

more painful means of expressing themselves. If such

a  development takes place, the P.A.P. will have  to

be  responsible. Today, Sir, there is no fundamental

difference  between the S.P.A., which also  help  to

show  the  abuse  that can be use  made  of  of  the

parliamentary  democratic  system,  and  the  P.A.P.

There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the

previous  Government  and the P.A.P.  Government  of

today.  Sir, it is very clear now to everybody  that

they  both  say the same things, they  do  the  same

things and they vote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



the  same way. The Prime Minister, Sir, at one  time

denounced  the  undemocratic acts  of  the  previous

Government. But today, he indulges in the  same  act

of denying our people civil liberties -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And much worse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And much worse, and this time he gets the

active support of the people that he denounced prior

to  1959,  the S.P.A., and he gets this  support  in

this  very  House. The very political  life  of  the

P.A.P.  Government  depends on the  support  of  the

S.P.A., the people who were denounced by the  P.A.P.

then  as  a reactionary anti-democratic force.  Sir,

the   P.A.P.  Government  today  survives  with  the

support of the S.P.A. which was already rejected  by

the people in 1959 for its anti-democratic acts, and

it  is only a matter of time before the people  give

their  verdict on the P.A.P. Today, Sir,  the  Prime

Minister's difference with the Member for  Cairnhill

is  not  in  the  principle of  arresting  political

opponents without trial. But the difference is  only

in  the  timing  of the arrest and the circumstances

under  which  the arrest should be made.  Sir,  only

recently the position was different in that he  used

to  tell  us that the Tunku would know how  to  deal

with naughty boys -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is true, you know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But today he further shifted and

indicated his stand along different lines -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. Do not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not have the quotes with me.

But  if the Prime Minister likes them, I shall  look

them up -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Please do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and bring them to the attention of this

House.  But  I remember, Sir, during the  series  of

radio  forums  he did say at one time, indicated  at

least,  that he would do the arrest himself provided

those  who  were  arrested were not looked  upon  as

martyrs  by  the  people. There  is  no  fundamental

difference.  The difference is in the circumstances.

Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



must  tell the Prime Minister that this is  not  the

way  of democracy. This does not mean, as the  Prime

Minister  is  in the habit of saying,  that  we  are

afraid.  On democracy there is only one authority  I

can quote, and that is the Prime Minister himself. I

just want to quote two very brief passages. It is in

col.  726, Hansard, Vol. 1, of 21st September, 1955.

Sir, today  we are told that all these undemocratic

acts  are necessary to fight the Communists  and  to

fight   his   political  opponents  who  are   anti-democratic. Sir, I quote from col. 726:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we

must  be prepared, in principle, to concede  to  our

enemies - even  those  who do  not  subscribe  to  our

views - as  much constitutional right as  you  concede

yourself.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of this motion, they hold

meetings of trade union representatives at which the

Prime Minister propagates Malaysia. But trade unions

which  do not subscribe to that, which refuse to  be

tools  of  the  P.A.P.,  are  not  allowed  to  hold

meetings  to  discuss  matters  that  affect   their

membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other short quotation of the Prime

Minister  in  col. 831 of 12th October, 1955.  These

were   the   days  when  he  was  a  different   man

altogether:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we believe in freedom, then we must concede

that same freedom even to those who do not honour it

in  the  way  we do. Further, if we want freedom  to

survive in this part of the world, then we must live

it  and not just talk it. If you want the people  of

Singapore to fight for democracy and freedom, it  is

no  use telling them. "Ah but one day we shall  have

this freedom, when we have destroyed Communism, when

we  have  destroyed the P.A.P.,  and  when  we  have

destroyed any force which threatens to bring about a

social revolution."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here the P.A.P. means the P.A.P. of 1955 and

not the P.A.P. of the present day. Those are the two

quotations  of our Prime Minister who claims  to  be

the only man who can save democracy -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b>- and parliamentary democracy in this

part  of the world. I am glad he says he never  did,

and if he never did, and he does not believe that he

is  the  only champion, then let him at  least  help

others  who believe that democracy can only tick  if

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



people are given participation in the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has forgotten his earlier

pronouncements. This clearly indicates that  he  has

changed  his views and his beliefs. I must say  that

all  traitors  will sooner or later settle  accounts

with the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal aspects under the Minor Offences

Ordinance,  the Societies Ordinance and  the  Public

Entertainment  Ordinance are clear. But  the  P.A.P.

has also threatened the unions with the Trade Unions

Ordinance.  The unions have been told  that  holding

discussions  on the Referendum Bill is  inconsistent

with  the objects of a trade union. We are asked  to

believe  that civil rights are matters  of  interest

only  to  organisations like the United  Nations.  I

shall  quote again the Government statement on this.

This is a statement of the Government issued on  the

9th of June and published on the 10th of June in the

Sunday Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It is the view of the Government that the

protection of civil rights is within the province of

organisations    such   as   the   United    Nations

Associations  and not of trade unions and  societies

constituted  and  recognised for entirely  different

purposes,".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seriously asked to believe by the

Government  that  civil liberties are  matters  that

only  concern organisations like the United  Nations

Associations. The trade unions have been  threatened

that  their registrations will be cancelled if  they

carry  on activities of this nature. The P.A.P.,  in

fact,   now   says  that  protesting   against   the

Referendum  Bill  is politics. We believe  that  the

Referendum Bill affects every aspect of our people's

life.  We maintain that the Fascist features of  the

Bill are matters infringing the civic rights of  our

citizens and workers. More than 90 per cent  of  our

population  are  composed  of  workers   and   their

dependants.  It  is the business of the  unions  who

represent the workers to safeguard the interests  of

the workers in every respect. In the constitution of

almost  all  the  trade unions, the object  is  very

widely  stated as generally to promote the material,

social and educational welfare of the members in any

lawful manner as the union may deem necessary. I  am

advised that the legal opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



on  the  definition of this object is such  that  it

includes  a  variety of things; it includes  matters

that affect the workers, whether in their industrial

relations or in their intercourse in society. I must

say here that not only trade unions that are branded

as  Communist  front organisations, but  also  other

organisations  like  the  University  of   Singapore

Students'  Union,  the University Law  Society,  the

Medical  and  Dental  Surgeons Union,  the  National

Journalists Union, have all expressed their contempt

for  the  undemocratic features  of  the  Referendum

Bill.  Sir,  the Government's reply to the  students

was   to   publicly  ridicule  them.  This  is   the

reflection  of the respect the P.A.P. has  for  the

views  of  our people, be they students or  workers.

The  P.A.P. has, in fact, stirred up a hornet's nest

and  is  now trying desperately to cover it up  with

repressive  measures. People are not  going  to  let

them get away with it so easily. It is silly for the

Government to chide the University students. Let  us

give  them more credit for their intelligence.  They

are  not children. They are grown-ups. Let us remind

the  Prime Minister who, in fact, himself at a  talk

given to the Polytechnic students sometime back said

that  in  Asia  it  is the young  that  decides  the

destiny of a country. Perhaps he has also forgotten -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He has forgotten this also. But, Sir,

even  if  we  were  to  assume that  discussing  the

Fascist undemocratic aspects of the Referendum  Bill

is  taking  part in politics, even  if  we  were  to

concede  this  point, let me quote what  the  P.A.P.

leaders said about trade unions and politics. Let me

quote  the Prime Minister first. I refer to col.  60

of Vol. 1, of Hansard, 27th April, 1955:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Next, may I, after being somewhat uncomplimentary

on   the   Emergency  Regulations, compliment   his

Minister  for  Labour for the prompt  assertion  and

categorical  statement that trade unions  should  be

allowed  to  take  part  in  politics?  Some   other

gentleman who thought trade unions should  not  take

part  in  politics but should form organizations  as

they  do  in America has now been put into premature

retirement and I think that is just as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



for  himself  and  for the public  which  he  never

served.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the Prime Minister. Let me quote a few

more examples of the P.A.P. thinking on trade unions

and   politics.   Let  me  quote  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture in col. 450 of

Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 7 of 13th August, 1959:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, previously it was a popular thing for trade

union  leaders to say that trade unions should  keep

away  from  polities. But the workers never  at  any

time  believed that unions could be kept  away  from

politics.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote the Member for River Valley in col.

465, of Vol. 11 again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the past, trade union leaders have always been

warned to keep away from politics. But genuine trade

union leaders,-'



<br><br>mark the words, Sir, "genuine trade union leaders" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`from their own experience, know that sometime or

other  they  have to seek the support of politicians

to achieve results. Those leaders who do not believe

that  politics  is  part of trade  unionism  usually

perish.'.



<br><br>That came from the Member for River Valley. And  let

me  quote,  Sir, the Prime Minister's  Parliamentary

Secretary - in col. 467:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for the Southern Islands has advised

the Minister for Labour and Law to exercise care  so

that  the  labour movement will not be  involved  in

polities.  I  wonder, because, if  one  follows  the

labour movement or political developments closely, I

think the one cannot be separated from the other.  I

think the labour movement must be closely related to

political developments because, if any action by the

labour  movement  fails,  then  they  will  have  no

alternative   but   to   fight   through   political

channels.'



<br><br>And,  Sir, if one were to have the time to sit  down

and  read  the  Hansard, he can  find  more  quotes.

Therefore, Sir, all this talk of trade unions  being

told  that  civil liberties are matters of  interest

only  to  the United Nations is nothing but a  bluff

deliberately made to try and mislead the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the P.A.P. has conceded that the

Referendum Bill is not democratic, but has tried  to

justify  this  by  saying  that  these  undemocratic

features  of  the Bill are necessary  to  fight  the

Communists.  Sir,  I have already  quoted  what  the

Prime  Minister's  views were on  theories  of  this

nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders are probably aware

themselves  that many of their acts are contrary  to

democratic  practice. But they try to justify  their

actions  by saying that this is how one should  deal

with  the Communists. Sir, the Minister for  Finance

has  expressed his theory that one must on  occasion

depart  from  democracy in order to  deal  with  the

Communists. Sir, I must remind the House  that  this

is  exactly  what  Hitler did. As we  know,  Germany

ended up with a Fascist regime under the Nazis  with

so-called National Socialism led by Hitler  himself.

This  is  a curious thing - National Socialist.  Sir,

the  National  Socialists  in  Great  Britain  today

openly  preach Fascism. I am grateful to the  Sunday

Mail   for   having  published  a  very  interesting

article,  and  if you have noted it  carefully,  the

Sunday  Mail also carried a picture of the  National

Socialist  symbol which very closely  resembles  the

P.A.P. symbol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Which you were proud of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I must say, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not

one of them who decided whether we wanted the symbol

or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. leadership in Singapore claim

to  be  national  Socialists and  practise  Fascism.

Perhaps  it  would not be out of place,  as  I  have

already  stated  that  even the  national  socialist

movement in other parts of the world, one way or the

other,   preaches  Fascism.  Sir,   today   we   are

witnessing   in  Singapore  McCarthyism.   This   is

precisely  the  bankrupt  philosophy  of  the  anti-Communists.  We  saw it once before being  put  into

practice by the Lim Yew Hock Government and  we  all

know what has become of the Member for Cairnhill and

his very close colleague, Mr Chew Swee Kee. Sir, if

the past is any indication of the future, then it is

safe  to assume that the Prime Minister perhaps will

end  up as a tin miner in some remote corner of  the

Federation  of  Malaya  provided,  of  course,   the

Federation Government will accommodate him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anti-Communism is a negative philosophy and

our  Prime  Minister himself has said this  in  this

House many times. The P.A.P. has been forced by  the

personal ambitions of some of its leaders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



to  become a reactionary force. As the  Member

for   Bras  Basah  said  recently,  the  P.A.P. has

departed  from  its  original  aim  of  building   a

socialist  Malaya. Now the P.A.P. leaders know  that

their  actions are undemocratic. But they still  try

to stifle public opinion. Because the P.A.P. leaders

are  afraid,  they  are taking repressive  measures.

This is the tragedy of renegades. When bogus working

class  leaders  realise  that  they  have  lost  the

support of the people through their own folly,  they

indulge in repression. As the days go by they become

more  desperate because they feel the anger  of  the

people  mounting and so they have a number of police

escorts day and night to protect themselves from the

people.  Sir,  the more desperate they  become,  the

more  repressive  they  are in  their  actions.  The

degree  of  desperation  is  an  indication  of  the

measure  of their weakness. It is also, Mr Speaker.

Sir,   an   indication  of  the  strength   of   the

opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders are politically bankrupt.

After  the  life of this Assembly, with  or  without

merger, the P.A.P. will disintegrate. There will be

no  more spoils. Some of the leaders may attempt  to

set  up iron or tin mines, if with nothing else,  at

least  with P.A.P. funds which have been accumulated

from  contributes  from P.A.P. Assemblymen  for  the

last three years. I am told, Sir, that they have  in

the kitty something like half a million dollars.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how all this has

got  anything  to do with the motion.  If  the  hon.

Member  is  trying to insinuate or import innuendoes

into  those  statements, he  is  completely  out  of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was merely trying to

tell  the  Members  of this House  who  sit  on  the

Government  Benches  of  the consequences  of  their

undemocratic  actions - whether  it  is  banning  two

meetings  of  the  Singapore  Trade  Unions  Working

Committee  or  refusing the Council of Joint  Action

the right to hold a convention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing more to say, Mr Speaker, Sir,

except  to repeat: the people are watching  the  way

the  democratic system - works. If the government  of

the  day  cannot  give the people  their  basic  and

fundamental  rights  for free  expression  and  free

association, then the consequences will be that  the

people will lose faith in the democratic system. And

this will not be brought about by acts of the people

called   Communists   but  by  acts   of   desperate

politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Thomson has attempted to paint a picture  which

often  they wish were true, for then the battle,  as

far  as  they are concerned, would be so much easier

if  only  the Government would intimidate  and  take

repressive  measures,  woud  be  corrupt,  would  be

ineffective,  would be stooges like  the  last  one,

then we could be disposed of, then we would wind  up

with Tun-ships and iron mines and tin mines. He  has

even  suggested - and I was cheered to see you thought

our  reputation  should not be so  unfairly  imputed

- that  we  have amassed a fortune of half a  million

dollars.  He does know, Sir, how that sum  has  been

accumulated - not the way Mr Chew Swee Kee did it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But those are contributions from

Assemblymen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so - the honest way. An

honest  Party  building  up funds  for  a  long-term

fight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> May I explain. Sir, that I wanted to say

that this half a million dollars in the P.A.P. kitty

was  got  as  contributions from P.A.P. Assemblymen,

and I have my own contributions there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For a good cause, and we shall

ensure -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That they will be used for tin mines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We shall ensure that that

money will be spent on a good cause. Sir, this is  a

different  situation. He has quoted  me  in  extenso

what  I  have said before. But it is a pity that  he

did  not quote what I have so often preached to him.

I  have  had occasion to say in this House that  the

democratic  system  is open to competition  only  to

those  who  compete  to run it,  not  to  those  who

compete to destroy it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basis for the condemnation is the result

of   undemocratic  action  of  the   Government   in

preventing  representatives  of  workers,  students,

rural  dwellers and professional organisations  from

meeting  as a convention on two occasions,  the  9th

and 16th of June, because we intimidated them. Those

are  the words of the motion - "undemocratic action",

"intimidate  and prevent meetings" and  "calls  upon

the Government to stop repressive actions".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a very strange phase we

are going through at this moment. I do not think  we

shall see again for a very long time the events that

are  taking place. I was only commenting  the  other

day   to  the  Member  for  Thomson:  how  different

everybody  wants  to appear from  his  normal  role.

Everybody  wants  to look something  different  from

what he actually is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Thought projection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. Physical evidence.

Only the other day his Secretary-General, who was  a

great    representative   of   the   workers,    the

proletariat, came to the C.P.A. Room with  a  polka-dotted  silken  scarf and a coat, looking  something

quite  different. No longer the ragged  proletariat.

Now, Sir, in the old days they would have said,  not

becoming   of  a  representative  of  the   workers,

students,    rural    dwellers   and    professional

organisations.  What are they?  Rural  dwellers  are

peasants.  It is the combination of the workers  and

the  peasants  that brought about the revolution  in

China.  And the professional organisation  is  their

national bourgeoisie.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are anti-peasant, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. I am all for them. But I am

all  against  their being exploited and  their  name

being  used for purposes that they do not  subscribe

to.  The S.R.R.A. and the men who run it are no more

peasants than Karl Marx was a peasant. However,  let

us  get  down to the facts. Because it is  on  these

facts  that  this  whole tirade of  abuse  has  been

poured  out.  Traitors. To whom?  To  the  Communist

cause? We never subscribed to the Communist cause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The people's.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have always said what we

believe   in:   An  independent,  democratic,   non-Communist, socialist Malaya. We never believed in  a

Communist  Malaya  and  we have  not  the  slightest

intention  of  helping to bring  about  a  Communist

Malaya. We do not mind if they do not like it.  That

does not make us traitors to the people. Nor are  we

intimidated. Sir - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, neither are we intimidated

by  our  being reminded of the anger of the  people.

Anger, Mr Speaker, Sir, settling of accounts. These

are  some of the phrases, words of combat - systematic

suppression, Council of Joint Action, turn to  other

matters.  They  always think  of  turning  to  other

matters. Well, I hope they do not. If they want  any

piece of advice, for old times' sake, I give this to

them:  just be peaceful, act peaceful, and maybe  it

will be less painful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Let us play according to the rules.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Fascists, Hitler; now, Sir,

repression, desperate men, desperation -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Desperadoes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Desperadoes. True, Sir, these

are  words  of extravagance. What are the facts?  On

the  9th June a meeting was planned at the Shop  and

Factory  Workers Union, 4th branch, Bukit  Timah.  I

know the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



premises well and so does the Member for Thomson. In

fact, I used to look after those premises since  the

owner  went back to China, one Mr Lim Chin Kok.  He

was  the nominal owner. Now the unions are not  even

paying  rent. One of these days the Public  Trustee,

on behalf of the owner, will have to enforce payment

of  rent.  These are things which will  have  to  be

settled.   These  are  proper  accounts,   financial

accounts, and will have to be settled. That was  the

scene  where  the actual combat took place.  I  went

into  those  premises immediately after  the  combat

took  place  to  try and salvage the  property  that

belonged to the members of the union. There was real

combat - broken glass, broken windows, 300-odd  chaps

staged  a last-ditch stand against tear gas,  broken

bricks,  glass,  mortar, cupboards, tables.  200-odd

people  were  sent  to  gaol for  that  incident  in

October.  That was real combat. That took  place  in

1956,  six years ago. The Member for Thomson is  not

unaware. He once entered the premises with me  while

the tear gas was still strong in the premises. Maybe

he has forgotten it. That place has history. That is

why they went back to the 4th branch at Bukit Timah.

To revive old memories. Commemorate old events.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You had your meetings there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Five-one-three: what the

Chinese  call "Wu I-san". The Chinese, Mr  Speaker,

have  got a good mnemonic system to help the memory.

Five-one-three,  and it evokes Five  for  May,  one-three  for 13. There were innocent students at  King

George  V  Park being beaten up by brutal policemen.

This incident that took place in the 4th Branch  was

following on 9:1:8. 9:1:8 was the 18th of September,

1956,   when  the  purge  started.  That   was   the

consequence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what happened this time? They were going

to  reform  a front organisation. I knew  the  Human

Rights  Convention  well. I watched  it  with  great

interest   and   I  saw  it  being  perverted   with

considerable effectiveness. The same group of  chaps

appeared  under different guises each time  -  Jamit

Singh, Harbour Board Staff Association, turns



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



up  as  Chairman or Committee member of Human Rights

Convention.  The  same  group  of  chaps,  the  same

handful  of  people running around  under  different

names  and  aliases,  and giving  an  impression  of

massive solidarity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we decided that history is not only

unlikely  to repeat itself as in 1955-1956,  but  we

will ensure that it does not repeat itself, and that

there  will  be none of this formation  of  Peasants

Workers  National Bourgeoisie Alliance, all  in  the

name of the Communist Party. Let each union carry on

its  work;  let  each  society discuss  whatever  it

wants,  even if it is Communist-dominated,  for  the

time  being.  So be it. But let them not  seek  more

trouble  for  the  community by ganging  up.  So  we

pointed  out  to  them what the law  was  in  polite

language, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will read out  to  you

the  letter of the 9th of June: The Ministry of Home

Affairs  was informed on the 8th of June that  there

was  going  to be a meeting on the 9th  of  June.  A

decision  had to be taken whether or not  a  meeting

which was known to be illegal was allowed to go  on.

This is not just a meeting to have a cup of tea,  to

celebrate  a  wedding  or  to  enjoy  music  - Johann

Strauss  or  Bach.  This was  the  beginning  of  an

adventure, of a campaign, a convention. You  do  not

come   together  to  celebrate  a   wedding   at   a

convention.   Conventions  are  meant  for   certain

specific  purposes over a period of  time,  and  the

same  men - I will read the details which are better

known to my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs - first   formed   this  convention   and   collected

themselves  together  as a Committee  of  Eleven  to

celebrate  May Day. Then they reformed, changed  the

name,   carried  on  the  Association  to  celebrate

National  Day. Then they carried on.  Now  they  say

"Campaign   against  Referendum".  Campaign   merely

against merger - that is what it is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, this was the letter written by what the

Member  for Thomson calls a "Fascist Police  Force".

"Dear   Sir,"   it  begins,  and  ends   up   "Yours

faithfully,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has come to my notice that you and certain

other person calling ourselves the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

Singapore   Trade  Unions  Working  Committee   have

organised  a  public assembly  to  be  held  in  the

premises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees'

Union. 87 Bukit Timah Road, at 7.30 p.m. on the  9th

of  June, 1962. I have ascertained that you have not

applied  by  and  obtained a permit  or  licence  to

conduct  such assembly, and I am therefore  to  warn

you  that  you  and your colleagues on  the  Working

Committee and any other persons responsible for  the

promotion  of  such assembly will be  committing  an

offence if you hold such assembly as planned by you.

The  police  will be obliged to take  immediate  and

appropriate  action against the persons  responsible

or promoting the assembly if you and your colleagues

insist on holding the assembly tonight at 87,  Bukit

Timah  Road, despite this warning which I am  giving

you.



                              Yours faithfully,'.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out, Sir, that the police officers

politely  appeared at the premises  of  the  S.T.U.,

which was the former Shop and Factory Workers Union,

Middle  Road, with polite letters in despatch  books

to be signed to ensure that everybody was adequately

informed and apprised of their position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they met. There were no riot squads, no riot

vans, no beating of heads. That is not the way  this

Government governs. We do not believe in a  show  of

force.  We do not think it is necessary. We  believe

it  is  easier  to  play the game according  to  the

rules. If they by-pass the rules, so be it. But  let

us  inform  them of the rules. They need  a  permit.

They  have  not  a  permit.  We  inform  them.  They

disperse. Then they issue truculent statements.  Let

me   just  quote  you  passages  of  this  truculent

statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fascist hand of the Singapore Government

showed  itself more clearly once mote when it barred

the holding of a meeting to discuss the grave threat

to  democracy  that  is embodied in  the  Referendum

Bill.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A threat to democracy, Sir? What are we talking

about?  A  Bill for which we allowed from its  first

introduction in January - seven months of  gestation.

Amendments   we   moved   to   counter   their   own

unprecedented,  evil-intended amendments.  We  never

did anything undemocratic in that Bill, contrary  to

the   Constitution.   Nobody   is   prevented   from

expressing what he wishes in any referendum, but  we

are  making  it unprofitable for them to do  foolish

things.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they dispersed. Meanwhile, they issued

provocative  statements:  "We  want   to   see   the

Commissioner  of Police. We demand an  explanation."

Well,  Sir,  authority is always open  to  challenge

- and  in  a  democratic society with an  independent

judiciary, which even the Member for Anson  has  not

dared  allege to be otherwise than independent - there

are  ways  and  means of challenging authority.  But

truculent statements demanding interviews  with  the

Commissioner  of Police. Is that the  constitutional

way out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Commissioner, on the instructions of

the  Minister, was told to be polite.  So  he  wrote

them  a  letter. On the 14th of June he  said  in  a

letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would assure you that I have obtained legal

advice  on this matter. I am advised that addresses,

debates  and discussions at any place in  which  the

public  or any class of the public has access  would

come within the definition of "public entertainment"

in  the  Public Entertainments Ordinance, 1958.  The

exception  in  respect  of  meetings  of  registered

societies  and registered trade unions only  applies

where  persons who are not members are excluded.  In

my  opinion, therefore, a licence under  the  Public

Entertainments Ordinance, 1958, is required, and  if

no such licence is obtained, the Police will have to

take   action  under  the  powers  given   in   that

Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on in paragraph 5 to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But if the persons who attend the proposed meeting

constitute themselves into an association of ten  or

more   persons,   they   would  constitute,   unless

registered, an unlawful society, and action  may  be

taken under the Societies Ordinance. Any society  or

trade  union which attends the meeting or sends  its

representatives  will be subject to  the  rules  and

regulations  relating to the society or trade  union

and  to  the over-riding provisions of the Societies

Ordinance  and the Trade Unions Ordinance.  Where  a

society  is used for purposes incompatible with  the

objects or rules of the society, action may be taken

against the society under the Societies Ordinance.'



<br><br>Similarly a trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, Sir. They were then called up by the

Registrar  of  Societies, by  which  time  they  had

discovered  that their Committee of  Eleven  was  an

unlawful  association. They had written  in  to  the

Registrar  to  say  that they were  a  Committee  of

Eleven Trade Unions Working Committee, so-and-so was

the  President,  so-and-so was  the  Secretary,  and

these were their objects. But now they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



discarded two Committee members: saying from  eleven

they were now nine. The Member for Thomson said  now

they were within the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they decided to go on with it on the 16th, and

this  was after the letter had been sent to them  on

the  14th. On the 15th we got information that  they

were  going to go on with the meeting regardless  of

the consequences. So on the 16th we decided that the

point  at  issue  must be taken, namely  association

itself.  There  were  many  contraventions  of  many

Ordinances - the Public Entertainments Ordinance, the

Minor  Offences Ordinance, and so on  - that  require

penalties;  this,  that  and  the  other.  But   the

Ministry  decided, after discussion, that the  point

at  issue must be taken, because the thing was going

to  repeat  itself. If they could not  succeed  this

way, they were going to try some other way. And  the

point at issue is association for purposes which  we

consider incompatible with good law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was sent on the 16th:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to the report in today's Straits Times of

a proposed meeting of delegates from 40 trade unions

to be held tonight at 7.30 under the auspices of the

Singapore Trade Unions Working Committee,  of  which

you are Chairman. I would refer to our interview  in

my  office on the 15th of June, 1962, with regard to

the  activities of your Committee, when you informed

me  that  the membership of your Committee had  been

reduced from eleven to nine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear from the report of the proposal to

hold   tonight's  meeting  that  you  are  under   a

misapprehension as to the law. Since our  interview,

I  have  been  advised  by  the  Law  Officers  that

irrespective of the fact that the number of  persons

forming  your  Committee does not exceed  nine,  any

meeting  comprising  ten persons  or  more  in  all,

whatever its nature or object, will be a meeting  of

a  society  within  the  meaning  of  the  Societies

Ordinance.  Unless such a society is registered, it

will be unlawful ...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sending a representative to be present at the

meeting  tonight and to inform the persons attending

the meeting of the legal position.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I deal with the events of that night,

may  I  display to you and to the Opposition Members

an   incident   recorded  by  one   of   the   Press

photographers  - one  of  our  Ministry  of   Culture

photographers of this "repressive" police action, of

"intimidation" or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



"repression"? Sir, the photograph shows the

Secretary of this Convention -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister tabled a copy of the photograph and handed copies to Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Ministry of Culture is

quite in the open. All the Press were there. If

there were any broken heads, broken glasses, they

would have seen it. This was the 16th at 7.30 p.m.

There was Mr Ghouse, the Secretary. Now who is the

aggressor there, Sir? The man he was talking to was

a police officer, representing the Registrar of

Societies, who was asked to execute his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we wanted to be difficult, Mr Ghouse

should  be  in  for  an offence for  intimidating  a

police   officer,   using  violent   and   truculent

language.  I  do  not think there is  any  point  or

purpose  in  my  going  to  answer  the  Member  for

Thomson's allegations - they are futile and  tedious.

They  want to make out of this Government the  image

that  they were able to make of the last Government.

But  we have the advantage of having seen how it was

done  the  last  time, why it was wrong,  where  the

mistakes were made, and we do not intend that  these

mistakes   be   repeated.  Therefore,  when   police

officers go down, they are given strict instructions

- to be polite, always firm but always polite, always

within  the law. I would say, if there is any doubt,

I  have  a whole series of photographs - a record  of

the  events that evening that will leave  nobody  in

any  doubt  as to who was the violent and aggressive

party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just read out some of the incidents that

took  place - this was the 16th. This was  between  7

and 8.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the Registrar of Societies

attended   together   with   Ministry   of   Culture

photographers. Then Mr Ho Piau - I know Mr Ho  Piau,

Sir,  he  is not a friend of mine, but I have  known

him  for a long time - a very hot tempered young man,

excusable   because  he  is  not  mature,   a   very

aggressive chap. He wants to impress the world  that

he  is a great fighter for human rights and workers'

rights  and on with the revolution. Well  he  turned

up,  very aggressive, and he was given a copy of the

letter. He raised his voice and said, "I don't  want

the letter," The police

officer  explained to hint that it was only for  his

own good that he should read the letter. He refused.

Then Mr Dominic Puthucheary came on the scene. Sir,

he  is  another young man - a brash young  man - and  he

wants  to prove to the world and to himself that  he

is  a brave man. He stood with me and the Member for

Farrer  Park  and said, "What now?" Hands  on  hips,

gesticulating  while he was pointing his  finger  at

me,  nearly thumping me on the chest. And  this  was

the  way he behaved to the police officer. He  said,

"The  Police  should not force the  letters  on  the

representatives." The officer told him that they not

forcing  letters on the representatives.  They  were

only doing their duty by letting, those who went  in

know  that  they  were going to  participate  in  an

illegal meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dominic Puthucheary closed the iron gate, and

asked  for  the representative of the  Registrar  of

Societies to come in. Now, Sir, who is the aggressor

in all this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the Registrar of Societies

had  been given strict instructions not to allow any

incidents  to  be construed as provocation.  He  had

done his duty and informed everybody present of  the

position  by  distributing  these  letters  in   all

languages  for the convenience of those  who  cannot

have  friends  do  the  translation  for  them.  The

letters were distributed in all languages. They then

met and they called off the meeting, quite sensibly,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  The whole  procedure  had  been

observed.  Everybody had been properly  informed  of

the position. Had they proceeded, the law would have

taken  its course. So they decided that they  should

abide by the law. But not till they had gone to  see

a lawyer and he had written his learned opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to be my own lawyer, and I would

like  to read only one passage of the comments  from

the S.A.G.'s Chambers on this lawyer's letter. I  do

not want to bore the House. I think I will just read

two   short  paragraphs  which  will  set  out   the

absurdity of the proposition which the Trade  Unions

Working Committee have put to this lawyer. I do  not

know  whether  it  was  for a  fee,  but  obviously,

according  to the explanatory note, the accompanying

advice must have been a professional piece of  work.

And  on the advice and the instructions of the facts

from his clients, he gave this advice,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



and  this is what the Government's Legal Department,

the S.A.G.'s Chambers, had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One does not usually come across a committee

without  some  form of organisation  for  which  the

committee  is  responsible. The word "committee"  is

defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as "a  body

of  persons  appointed or elected for  some  special

business or function"'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Trade Unions Working Committee; Hussein

Jahidin,  President;  Mr  Ghouse,  Secretary.  Both

gentlemen  are  known to me, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  Mr

Ghouse is particularly, I think, known to the Member

for  Joo  Chiat.  Sir, if such a  committee  invites

delegates  from 40 unions or a hundred  associations

to attend a meeting or convention to protest against

this,  that or the other, and continues to  meet  as

such, what else is the body of persons attending it,

except an association of more than ten persons,  for

that object? The point may be technical, but it is a

valid  point  in  law. Guests at a tea  party  or  a

musical recital are a different kettle of fish. That

is,  if  they really were not foregathered to admire

folk  dancing - genuine  old  Chinese  classical  folk

dancing, an exposition of the Chinese guitar  or  of

the flute - that is a different kettle of fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They usually meet on one occasion only. The team

varies  from time to time. Invitees need not attend.

Their common purpose is a social one and the thought

involved is the pursuit of an object as used in  the

definition of "society". They sip their tea;  listen

or  not to music or speeches, as they think fit, and

they  do  not indulge in debates or pass resolutions

for  or  against  any common course  of  action.  De

minimis  non  curat lex. My Latin  has  always  been

weak,   Mr  Speaker  Sir,  and  needs  a   bit   of

translation. It says, according to the lexicon, "the

law cares not for trifles of that nature".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting of delegates of 40 unions or a hundred or

more  sponsoring bodies with a sponsoring  committee

is,  in  my  opinion,  over the borderline  dividing

trifles   from   ponderables  into  the   realm   of

"association".  I am unable to see  the  analogy  of

representatives at a Press conference. The latter is

a meeting of persons who do not always know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



one   another  and  each  Press  representative   is

entirely  on  his  own pursuing the  policy  of  his

newspaper.  He does not particularly care  what  his

rival  thinks. His interests lie only  in  what  the

V.I.P. concerned thinks. Nor is there any committee

of any kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the legal position. I say it is quite

simple.   There  are  constitutional   methods   for

establishing  the position. There  are  people  with

many  friends  in the law. The Trade Unions  Working

Committee  there  is  also  this  Council  of  Joint

Action,  I see now, strong enough to take  over  the

work  of this Trade Unions Working Committee. It  is

the  same  idea. You cannot revive the Trade  Unions

Working  Committee.  Even the  Lib-Socs.  too.  They

suffered - it does not matter. I mean it is a  little

awkward and embarrassing to have to use labels which

you  once  condemned as reactionary,  wicked,  vile,

discarded  by  the people; but whatever  the  people

discard,  the Communists never hesitate to use.  And

so this Council of Joint Action - all their boys, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Nobody in his right mind watching  the

proceedings   will  not  know  and  will   not   but

acknowledge  it. Party Rakyat - it is  the  same  old

gang.  The  Barisan Sosialis, the Party Rakyat,  the

Workers' Party. The Member for Anson knows full well

what  happened in Kuala Lumpur. It is on the  record

about  his Party being captured. It is on the record

publicly  about what the Minister for Law  has  said

publicly. [Interruption] Publicly. Well, he has  his

remedies.  Mr Speaker, if lies are told  about  him

which  bring  him into ridicule and contempt.  As  I

have said, these remedies should be pursued. We must

do  things constitutionally. A lie cannot be  killed

by  a  counter lie. A lie has got to be nailed.  And

the newly-formed U.P.P. and the Barisan Sosialis - ah,

sorry -  Lib-Socs. 120 votes in Anson. That will  do.

It   does   not  matter.  People  discard  it:   the

Communists can use it. Our line is quite simple. Let

us go strictly according to the rules of the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not put off by all these threats that people

may  turn to other methods. What other methods? What

are  these  innuendoes meant for - to frighten  us  in

this Chamber? The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



Thomson  with his lean and hungry look,  picking  up

big cobblestones from the road. He will not have the

strength if he does not watch out, sitting  up  here

late every night till he is groggy. He will not have

the  strength even to pick up a pebble,  let  alone

big cobblestones -[Interjection]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever it is, let me tell them this. They

face an entirely different situation from l955-l956.

I  welcome  the  Member for Thomson's  interjection,

because  he  clarified the air. Had the matter  just

rested with your stout defence of the rights of this

Chamber,  not having people throwing imputations  at

each  other, a lingering suspicion might  remain  in

the  mind  of everybody that the P.A.P. has  salted

away  half  a  million dollars.  Somehow,  there  is

something  shady  about it.  But  there  is  nothing

shady.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put by some money for a long-term political

struggle and he contributed to it. So did I. So  did

lots of other people. We are not going to perish and

fold up and buy tin mines and vanish. No. We will be

here  long after the others have gone. Do not worry.

I  have  told  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  that

they  have got enough on their plate to worry  about

themselves.  Never worry about others, because  they

are  in  no  position to waste their time about  the

good  or  bad  fortunes of other people.  They  have

enough  troubles  coming upon them.  The  wheel  of

fortune  - Nemesis  is  inevitable.  That  is   their

problem.  But  our  problem is this:  to  prevent  a

repetition  of  the  events  of  1955-l956,  by  any

variation whatsoever. This is a stalemate for  them.

They  are not fighting a Government that is corrupt.

By  their  own  admission it is not.  They  are  not

fighting  a  Government that is  ignorant  of  their

tactics. They are not fighting a Government that  is

weak  and vacillating. Nobody is going to be reduced

to  a  whimpering pulp of a man. Nobody - not anybody

on  this side. And I tell them: if they are wise  - I

hope they are - they will abide by the rules. It is a

fair cop. If they know it is a fair cop, we know  it

too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they have got to face the consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not going to use any guns, unless people use

sticks  and  stones and ask for it. We  have  better

weapons than that. The photographer with his  camera

is  a  much more valuable defender of democracy than

the  soldier or the policeman with a gun. The  radio

reporter  with  his tape recorder  makes  a  greater

contribution to truth than all the mass of lies that

they can pour in their weekly diatribe. And that  is

the    way    we    intend   to   discredit    them.

Constitutionally,  according to the  rules,  to  the

bitter  end.  If  it  is  a  zugzwang,  it  is  most

unfortunate;  but  those who find  themselves  in  a

zugzwang and decide to throw the bits and pieces  on

the  floor and Start from scratch will have most  to

regret.  I  only hope that all these foolish  things

they  say from time to time, as what the Member  for

Thomson  has  said  today  about  turning  to  other

methods; the Member for Queenstown shaking his  hand

with uncontrollable rage; the Chairman of this Trade

Union  Working  Committee,  Inche  Hussein  Jahidin,

saying  in a Press statement - was it yesterday?  - in

virulent   language,  "If  the  people   face   this

continual  repression, they will turn to other  less

democratic means."



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let them apprise themselves of this. Here is

a  Government that is going to do what is  right  by

the people, regardless of the consequences. And what

is right means that the people should be informed of

who is who, who is playing what role, whether it  is

called  the  Council of Joint Action with  Falstaffs

thrown in to make for comic relief, or whether it is

called the Human Rights Convention with Jamit  Singh

shouting  "Keras,  keras!"  Whatever  it   is,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the motion in the name of the  Member

for Thomson is untenable. I can supply, and it is my

intention to supply these photographs of the  events

and  a  factual account of what took  place  to  the

Press, and the public can judge for themselves. Were

they repressive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we heard Hitler without a

moustache  making a speech like one delivered  by  a

Fascist. The Prime Minister has not fully replied to

the points raised by the Member for Thomson. He said

the  Government  is  run  on democratic  lines.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, all of us have said many things  about

the  democratic  system and our Prime  Minister  has

mentioned the democratic system in practically every

speech he has made in this House. I was very pleased

to hear him saying that the democratic system should

not be destroyed. But what are the facts? The people

of  Singapore  should enjoy democratic rights.  Have

they  enjoyed  these  rights? In  fact,  the  P.A.P.

Government  have  not allowed them  to  enjoy  their

democratic rights even under peaceful conditions and

they  do  not  allow  the  trade  unions  and  other

organisations to express their views, is  there  any

so-called  free  competition  with  other  political

Parties?  They  must  toe the line  of  the  P.A.P.,

otherwise they cannot express any views at all.  The

Prime Minister means that all political Parties  and

organisations  should toe the  line  of  the  P.A.P.

Actually  all  political Parties  and  organisations

should be allowed to express their views freely.  We

have  a very good example in the Referendum Bill  to

show  that  the Government have destroyed  democracy

and not the unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Prime Minister said that

these trade unions wanted to organise a united front

on  the  same  lines as the Civil Rights  Convention

organised in 1956. We can draw this conclusion  from

his speech. Today these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>





people have formed a Joint Council of Action to show

that their actions and decisions are in harmony with

the fundamental democratic rights of the people.  In

1956,  the  Civil Rights Convention  was  formed  to

safeguard the fundamental democratic rights  of  the

people  under  the previous Government.  I  remember

that  at  that time this Convention held a  one-week

meeting  to  protest  against the  Government.  This

movement  not only gained support from  the  various

organisations, unions and from all classes of people

but also from the various organisations supported



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member could step a little

further  back,  because he is  coming  through  very

loudly. If he could step a little further back  from

the  microphone or speak in a softer voice, it would

be all right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry, Mr

Speaker.  The  leading people at that time  and  the

leaders  at  the present time are the  same  people.

This  proves that these people have not  stopped  to

safeguard  the people's rights and to fight  against

colonialism.  The  Prime Minister  has  forgotten  a

lesson   he  has  learned.  In  1956,  he   strongly

condemned the Government. At various conventions and

meetings,  he spoke out strongly against colonialism

and  that is why some people took him to be a leader

who  would fight for the rights of the masses. As  a

result  of the Prime Minister's activities in  those

days,  he is the Prime Minister of Singapore  today.

But  strangely  enough when the Prime  Minister  was

sitting  on  this  side of the  House  in  1956,  he

strongly  condemned the undemocratic  activities  of

the  then  Government and today when he  is  sitting

opposite  on  the Government Bench  he  should  turn

round to heap abuses on those who helped him in  the

past  to  become  Prime Minister. I refer  to  those

trade  union  leaders and the leaders of  rural  and

cultural  organisations who are now accused  by  the

Prime Minister as stooges of the Communists. But  in

fact  it  is the Prime Minister who has changed  his

previous  stand. It is not because these people  are

Communists or have carried out Communist activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are of the opinion that the police are

necessary  for the maintenance of life and  property

of  the  people.  Every year, the  Government  spend

about $20 million on the Police Force, but today  it

has  lost the meaning of what it stands for,  it  is

being  used  by the P.A.P. to deal with  all  trade

unions, cultural organisations, students' unions and

other  organisations which are  competing  with  the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister pointed out to this House that the meeting intended to be convened by the Council of Joint Action was illegal. He tried to quote legal arguments to prove that the Fascist action of his Government was reasonable and democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has not answered the various points raised by the Member for Thomson, namely, the meeting at the Headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, when the Prime Minister was present. Now this organisation has been made a

puppet  organisation of the P.A.P. and has been  led

by  one Mr Devan Nair, a henchman of the P.A.P. The

Prime  Minister did not show that this organisation,

namely,  the Headquarters of the St. John  Ambulance

Brigade, got a police permit to hold such a meeting.

I  hope the Government can produce evidence to prove

that  the  said organisation at that  time  had,  in

fact, got a police permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's actions, and

the  way  the police has dealt with various matters,

show  more  and  more that the P.A.P. Government  is

trying  to  make use of the police to  suppress  the

people's feelings of dissatisfaction with the P.A.P.

We  are of the opinion that every legal organisation

should have the right of assembly to discuss matters

of  national  importance.  But  the  Government  has

deprived  them of this basic right. The leaders  and

representatives  of  the various organisations  have

been  elected to discuss various pertinent questions

and  these organisations have been registered  under

the   Trade   Unions  Ordinance  and  the  Societies

Ordinance. That is why these organisations, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



have been properly registered, cannot be accused  of

carrying out illegal or subversive activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation given by the Government is merely

to  hide  their  fear  that  more  people  and  more

organisations  will  come  forward  to  show   their

dissatisfaction  with the National Referendum  Bill.

The  Government  is merely hoping  to  suppress  the

people  of Singapore and to prevent them from  being

united  against this undemocratic Bill. That is  why

the  explanation  given  by the  Government  can  be

acceptable  only to the Government Benches  and  the

S.P.A.  The  people of Singapore - can never  accept

the  explanation  given by the Government  and  they

cannot  approve  the attitude of the Government.  If

the  Prime Minister says that the democratic  system

exists only by peaceful democratic competition, then

let  the Government show that it has this democratic

attitude  and  put  it into practice,  and  let  the

people  have  the full right of free expression  and

the right of free assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the motion moved by the Member for

Thomson  should  be accepted by the Government,  and

the Government should rectify its past mistakes,  so

as  to  allow  the  organisations  in  Singapore  to

exercise  their  democratic right to  express  their

views  to the Government. Only in this way  can  you

say  that  the  democratic system is operated  under

free  and  democratic competition. If the Government

believes  in  this,  then the motion  moved  by  the

Member  for  Thomson  should  be  accepted  by   the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the importance of

this motion is inadequately enunciated, although  it

fumbles  at  what  it means. The importance  of  the

motion  is not in the "undemocratic actions"  - there

have been many - but it is in the illegal action, the

unconstitutional action of the Government.  I  would

like  to make my position clear. The Workers'  Party

was  invited by this group to the meeting on the 9th

of  June. We declined on the ground that in view  of

the  imminent  sitting of the Assembly  and  with  a

representative in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



Assembly,  it  was more appropriate to register  our

views,  and  our  protests,  if  necessary,  in  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

On  a  point of clarification, Sir, If I  heard  the

Member  for Anson correctly, he mentioned  that  the

Workers'  Party  declined  the  invitation  to  this

meeting on the 9th of June. I wonder if he is  aware

that  a  member of his Central Committee was present

at this particular meeting.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir, I am aware that I signed the

letter.  One  of us signed the letter declining  the

invitation  to  attend.  I  trust  this  is  not   a

repetition of the Tommy Koh story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I go on then to the important

constitutional aspects of the motion before  you?  I

wish these aspects could have been clarified in  the

only  place  which  is really appropriate  for  such

issues,  that is a court of law, instead of  in  the

political  atmosphere  of  political  bias  in   the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would draw your attention to the first letter of the Acting Deputy Commissioner,

dated  the  9th of June. In that one he  tells  them

that they have organised a "public assembly", and it

is  exclusively on the ground that it  is  a  public

assembly  without  a  permit that  he  considers  it

illegal,  and  consequently  sends  his  police   to

prevent the commission of an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public assemblies without licence are made offences

under  two  Ordinances. One is  the  Minor  Offences

Ordinance. There, under the provisions of section  5

there have been rules made, rules that are known  as

the  Minor Offences Assemblies and Processions Rules

of  1960, being Supplement No. 28 of the 13th of May

and gazetted as S 134. Under Rule 2, Sir, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No assembly or procession consisting of five or

more persons shall take place in any public road  or

in  any  public  place, or place of  public  resort,

except  in  accordance with a  permit  issued  under

these  rules  and in compliance with the  conditions

and restrictions endorsed on such permit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You notice, Sir, the words after "shall take place

in  any  public road" - we take it, Sir, there  is  no

question  about  this - "or in any public  place,  or

place of public resort".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will turn to section 5 (6) of the Minor

Offences Ordinance, Chapter 117:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By amendment of Ordinance 24 of 1959, "public

place"  is defined as a building, park, garden,  sea

beach  or  other place to which the public  for  the

time being has access.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not suggested and has not been suggested by

the  Prime  Minister that the premises  of  a  trade

union  are  a place to which the general public  has

access.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second definition "place of public resort",

means  an  approved place as defined in  the  Public

Entertainments Ordinance, and there it is, "a  place

to  which  the public or a class of the  public  has

access  and  for  purposes  of  entertainment  which

requires  licensing." That is Ordinance  No.  40  of

1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the reading of that letter of the 9th of

June,  it is apparent that a meeting in the  private

premises  of a trade union of persons who are  there

by  special invitation cannot possibly be deemed  to

he a public assembly. This the Commissioner seems to

have  noticed  when  a protest was  registered,  the

protest  being  the letter of the Committee  of  the

11th  of  June in which they asked for the  specific

provision  of the law whereunder they had  offended.

And  then  we have the letter of the 14th  of  June,

Sir.   Here   he  says,  "Addresses,  debates   and

discussions at any place to which the public or  any

class  of  the public has access, would come  within

the  definition of `public entertainment'." That  is

so.  But again, he must have known, because he  does

not suggest it here, that it is not the public or  a

class of public that has access. The meeting was not

open  to,  say, all members of the Indian community,

or  all  persons who have passed the Chinese  Middle

III  School Examination, or anything like that,  and

he leaves it at that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come then to the next one, paragraph 3: "Conduct

of  Assemblies  and Places of Public Resort."  Well,

that  is repetitive, because that would be the  same

as   public  assembly  which  is  under  the  Public

Entertainments Ordinance. Again in this  case,  Sir,

there  is  no  suggestion that the  members  of  the

public  or  any  part of the public, as  such,  were

being invited. I want you to notice this, Sir,  that

whereas - if I may pause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



for  a  moment  the  action  of  the  Government  in

refusing a licence to hold a national convention  in

the   Badminton  Hall  was  undemocratic,   it   was

nevertheless  constitutional because  the  Badminton

Hall  was  a  place of public resort  to  which  the

public  were  being  invited, and consequently,  the

organisers  required a licence. The  licence  should

have  been  given  if the Government  sought  to  be

democratic,  but in law they were not  compelled  to

give it and they could refrain from giving it, as in

fact  they  refused to give it. So their  action  in

refusing  a  licence  to  the  organisers   of   the

Badminton Hall meeting was undemocratic, in my view,

but it was by no means illegal. Here, I seek to draw

the  distinction  between what is  undemocratic  but

legal  and  what is in fact illegal because  I  have

sought to show so far, Sir, that this meeting of 9th

June  did  not  come within the terms of  "place  of

public  resort"  or "public place" under  the  Minor

Offences    Ordinance   or    under    the    Public

Entertainments Ordinance, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes, Sir, paragraph 4 - he seeks to put

everything  in to catch them if he can, "If  persons

who   attend   the   proposed   meeting   constitute

themselves  into  an  association  of  10  or   more

persons, they would constitute an unlawful society."

Notice  the "if", Sir. Sir, if five of us decide  to

call  a  national anti-nuclear meeting and  we  send

invitations  to  named  organisations  to  send  two

representatives each to a private home,  no  licence

is  required, because that is not a public  assembly

and  there  is no association of 10 or more  persons

for  a  specific purpose. Those who are  coming  are

coming  to listen. If it is then decided to  form  a

society,   then   you  make  your  application   for

registration of the society. But until a decision is

made, Sir, there is no question of an association in

law  of  10 or more persons. A tenuous argument  was

sought  to  be  introduced at this juncture  by  the

Prime  Minister  who suggested that  the  fact  that

there were 9 members did not itself remove the group

from  the  need  from registration. It  was  put  in

extraordinary language in the letter of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



Registrar of Societies, in his letter of the 16th of

June where he alleges that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have been advised by the Law Officers

irrespective  of  the fact that the  number  of  the

persons forming your Committee does not exceed 9, any

meeting  comprising  10  persons  or  more  in  all,

whatever its nature or object, will be a meeting  of

a  society  within  the meaning  of  the  Societies'

Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know no lawyer, no matter how beardless he

may  be  or  how  wet  around the  ears,  who  could

possibly  justify that extraordinary proposition.  A

society begins to be a society only if there  is  an

organised  association of 10 or more persons  for  a

specific  object. In this case there were 9  persons

and   they   were   calling   a   meeting   inviting

representatives  to make certain representations  to

them. I repeat, Mr Speaker, it is unfortunate  that

this  matter  is not adumbrated in court  where  the

position   could  be  clearly  considered   in   the

impartial  atmosphere  of a  court  of  justice  and

decided  upon,  because it  is  a  matter  of  major

constitutional import that the Government should not

seek to act illegally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we have finally paragraph 5. In that

paragraph  of the letter of 14th June  it  does  not

suggest  that the meeting is illegal  but  it  is  a

clear-cut  threat.  If you hold  the  meeting,  your

registration as a union may be cancelled.  It  means

nothing else. It is clear intimidation, You can call

it  a warning if you like, but in the context of the

letter  as  a  whole, I would suggest, Mr  Speaker,

that  it is in fact intimidation. I can but say that

I regret, In the light of the letter of the union of

the  11th of June, that the Government did  not  see

fit  to arrest one of the persons. They signed their

names,  they were quite frank about who  they  were.

They   did  not  arrest  one  of  the  persons   for

attempting to organise an illegal meeting  and  then

have  the  issue clarified in a court  of  law.  The

Prime  Minister  said  that the  unions  have  their

remedies.  Mr  Speaker,  I  confess  they  have  my

sympathy  in this matter. They were told  that  they

were  acting  illegally; they had the police  around

them.  If  they held a meeting prima fade they  were

acting  in  an  illegal fashion, I admire  them  for

their    restraint   and   their   urge    to    act

constitutionally,  that though  they  believed  they

were  right, legally entitled to hold that  meeting,

nevertheless they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



refrained  from  doing so. I  will  say,  Sir,  they

deserve  credit for doing so, although it  may  have

been  a more useful approach if one of them at least

had risked being arrested so that the issue could be

clarified  in  a court of law. They  have  no  other

means,   Sir,  at  that  juncture.  You   know   the

difficulties  of seeking to bring any action  for  a

declaration of right against the Government and  the

tremendous  technicalities involved, the delays  and

the  expense,  Mr Speaker. I would suggest  to  you

that,  apart from the lurid bedtime stories we  have

been  listening to, purely on the legal  aspects  of

the  problem  as  it  is  presented  to  us  in  the

documents  before us, the Government  does  seem  to

have  acted in an illegal fashion and to have abused

its powers of using the police in a manner for which

the  law does not provide. If the Prime Minister  is

right  in his tale, then it is a question of seeking

additional powers to meet unusual circumstances. But

I  do say this, that in the context of the law as it

stood on the 9th of June and on the 16th of June, on

the  face  of  it,  the Government  does  seem,  Mr

Speaker, to have acted illegally and knowingly so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

most  sickening acts which show also how  debased  a

traitor can be when he betrayed his comrades and his

Party is the reference to the P.A.P. symbol tonight.

Mr Speaker, Sir, in comparing the P.A.P. emblem  to

the   Fascist   Party  in  Britain,   we   see   how

treacherous, how disloyal and how dishonourable  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen have become since  they

betrayed  their Party. Mr Speaker, Sir, it  was  on

this  very  P.A.P. symbol that Lim Ching Siong,  the

present  Secretary-General of the Barisan  Sosialis,

was  elected to the Assembly as the then Member  for

Bukit Timah in 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It was under the P.A.P. emblem

fists to shout "Merdeka".

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think these references were invited

by  the Member for Thomson. I think the Minister  is

entitled to go thus far, and perhaps no further;  he

may complete what he has to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

propose  to  go any further but just  a  little  bit

more.  I  just want to add that it was on this  very

P.A.P. symbol also that all the 13 Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen were elected to this Assembly. They  did

not feel ashamed at that time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe in

democracy  because of the greater freedom and  civil

liberties enjoyed by the people than is possible  in

a  dictatorship,  be it the Fascist dictatorship  or

the  one-Party Communist dictatorship. Even the pro-Communists and their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis

also  pay lip service to the system of parliamentary

democracy -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Kandasamy knew!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In a democracy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is getting worried.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - the individual and the

community  as  a  whole  enjoy  certain  rights  and

liberties  which are safeguarded by  law.  When  the

rule  of  law breaks down, then whatever rights  and

liberties that are enjoyed by the people will go  to

the wind. One of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



functions of any Government is to uphold the rule of

law  and to ensure its effective operation. For this

the  State  must have certain powers and instruments

to  bring forces inimical to law and order,  to  use

the term of the Member for Anson, under control. The

powers  of the State are those provided for  in  our

laws  passed  by  the  Assembly,  coupled  with  the

instruments  - the  police and,  in  times  of  need,

augmented  by  the military. Laws are  made  by  the

representatives of the people in this Assembly. They

are made for the purpose of affording and protecting

certain  fundamental rights and civil  liberties  to

the greatest number of people. However, these rights

and  liberties can only be enjoyed if there is peace

and  good  order. Therefore, the first task  of  any

State  is  to  maintain law and  order  through  its

police force, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House seeks ostensibly to

condemn the Government for depriving representatives

of certain organisations from exercising their civic

rights   in  calling  meetings  to  discuss  certain

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, what the motion seeks is

not the protection of civil rights but the right  of

the Communists and their stooges to flout the law as

and  when  they like in carrying out their nefarious

activities  to  undermine and destroy  democracy  by

fomenting  chaos and disorder in the name  of  human

rights and civil liberties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the legal aspect of the

proposed  meetings  called by  the  so-called  Trade

Unions  Working Committee. I propose to be brief  in

this  respect because the various points  have  been

touched on by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the first meeting was scheduled

to  be  held  on  9th  June at the  Singapore  Motor

Workshop  Employees Union at 87  Bukit  Timah  Road.

This  was to be a meeting attended by allegedly  one

hundred   organisations,  ranging  from  old   boys'

associations,    rural    organisations,     musical

associations to trade unions and political  parties,

all   of  which  have  different  objects  and  were

constituted in a different manner. At this  meeting,

the organisations intended to form



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



a  body  similar to the 1956 Civil Rights Convention

Committee  in  order  to promote  further  agitation

against  merger and Malaysia. No permit was  applied

for  such  a  public assembly. The  organisers  were

therefore  informed  that such a  meeting  would  be

illegal  and  unconstitutional  and  that  if   they

proceeded with it, they would lay themselves open to

action  under  the law. Further, they were  informed

over the radio that if the meeting was held and  the

purpose  of the meeting was carried out, the persons

concerned  would be acting outside the constitutions

of  the  unions and other organisations they claimed

to represent. They called off the meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further explanations on points of law were

furnished by the police to Inche Hussein Jahidin and

Salahudin  Ghouse  calling themselves  Chairman  and

Secretary  of  the Singapore Trade  Unions'  Working

Committee on 14th June, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, the proposed meeting on 9th

June,  if carried out, would have violated the Minor

Offences   Ordinance  (Chapter  117),   the   Public

Entertainments  Ordinance,  No.  40  of  1958,   the

Societies  Ordinance, (Chapter 228)  and  the  Trade

Unions Ordinance (Chapter 154).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organisers sought to by-pass the law by

reducing   the   so-called  Trade   Unions   Working

Committee from 11 to 9 presumably on the bright idea

of  a  lawyer's clerk - [Interruption] - since  turned

professional trade unionist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Thomson is in an

especially  fortunate  position  of  being  able  to

reply.  So  if he makes notes, he will  be  able  to

reply to all these points. Mr Ong Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a further

meeting  was called for on 16th June in the name  of

this  Committee now reduced in size. The  organisers

were again informed by the Registrar of Societies on

16th  June  that irrespective of the fact  that  the

number  of persons forming the Trade Unions  Working

Committee   does  not  exceed  nine,   any   meeting

comprising 10 persons or more in all, whatsoever its

nature  or  object would be a meeting of  a  society

within



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



the  meaning  of  the Societies Ordinance  and  that

unless  such society was registered - which  was  not

done  in  this case - it would be an unlawful  society

and  attendance at any meeting of such a society  or

membership thereof would be an offence under section

12  of the Societies Ordinance. A statement to  this

effect was issued by Government the same day.  I  do

not propose to go any further into the legal aspects

of  this  case. The Assembly is hardly a  place  for

legal argument. Suffice it to say, if the organisers

of  the  proposed unlawful meetings are dissatisfied

with  our  interpretation of the law, they can  seek

the assistance of their legal advisers to have their

grievances redressed in a court of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is alleged in the House that the police

have  acted in a provocative and intimidatory manner

in  preventing the two meetings from being held. How

did  the  police intimidate these tough and seasoned

professional trade unionists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there were no riot vans outside

the  premises of the proposed meeting, and according

to  the  memorandum of appeal to the Assemblymen  by

these trade unions, the intimidation was carried out

by  the  use  of flash-camera. Camera, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  not  bayonets.  The  Member  for  Anson  loves

cameras. He likes his picture to be flashed all over

the  place. No doubt, the Member for Queenstown,  or

for  that  matter  the Member for  Nee  Soon,  feels

likewise.  Those of us who are not  up  to  mischief

have   no  anxiety  about  cameras,  but  the   pro-Communists  and their sympathisers have  an  intense

dislike  for the camera, because their faces  cannot

bear  close scrutiny. They have to operate behind  a

front provided by innocent people. No doubt, some of

the  persons  invited to attend these  two  proposed

meetings belong to this category of persons who fear

exposure in front of a camera.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how the student agitators hid their

faces behind handkerchiefs during the Secondary Four

Examination  Boycott. We have  also  seen  the  Work

Brigade strikers dropping parangs and iron rods  and

scattering  before a camera during the  strike  last

year.  We  can therefore understand why they  should

make a hue and cry about a camera.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already far too

much work for the police to do in the maintenance of

law  and  order  without having  to  cope  with  the

additional   deliberate  acts  of  law-breaking   by

certain   professional  trade  unionists.  In   this

instance,  if  there  were  no  professional   trade

unionists  going about organising unlawful  meetings

with  a view to wrecking merger and Malaysia,  there

would be no need for the presence of police officers

near  the  premises of the Singapore Motor  Workshop

Employees  Union. The police have more worthy  tasks

to  perform than to prevent unlawful meetings called

by  persons  who were well aware that such  meetings

were unlawful. In spite of the first refusal on  9th

June,  the  so-called Trade Unions Working Committee

deliberately  called for a second  meeting  on  16th

June  which  necessitated  the  presence  of  police

officers a second time to warn the convenors of  the

legal  consequences.  Without  the  deliberate   and

provocative act of the professional trade unionists,

there  would  be  no need for police  officers  with

cameras around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us deal with the purpose or the motive of

the two proposed meetings to be held at the premises

of  the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees Union  at 87 Bukit Timah Road. Ostensibly the meetings were to

be  called  to discuss certain so-called undesirable

features  of the Referendum Bill. However, in  fact,

the  proposed meetings were called to form a  united

front  of students, old boys' associations, workers'

unions,  rural organisations and other people  under

the  leadership of the Communists and their  stooges

to  carry out various forms of agitation not against

the  Referendum Bill itself, but against merger  and

Malaysia. They hoped that in involving large numbers

of  different organisations and people - many of whom

were  innocent, though gullible - they would be  able

to  create  an impression of popular dissatisfaction

and  also  to  provide a protective cover  for  the

Communists.  A recent parallel to this  attempt  was

the  Civil Rights Convention in 1956, the activities

of   which   eventually  culminated  in  riots   and

sufferings to untold numbers of people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I compare the pattern of the activities of

the two organisations, I should like to give a brief

background  of  this so-called Trade Unions  Working

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Trade Unions Working Committee was

originally  known as The Singapore Trade Unions  May

Day  Joint  Celebrations  Committee  elected  at   a

meeting of representatives of trade unions belonging

to the pro-Communist

S.A.T.U. group held on 18th March,  1962,  at  the

premises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop  Employees

Union.  The  Committee then consisted of 11  persons

with  Tan  Teck Wah as Chairman, Foo  Yong  Fong  as

Secretary, Chan Saye Jame as Treasurer and  8  other

members  comprising Dominic Puthucheary, S.  Ghouse,

Chang Yuen Tong, Chan Yin Ann, Visva Lingam, Chen Ee

Fong,  Goh Chong Kwee and Hussein Jahidin. This  11-man Committee was responsible for organising the May

Day celebrations by the pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group

of    trade   unions,   student   bodies,   cultural

organisations,   political   parties    and    rural

organisations. On the conviction of Foo Yong Fong in

an  assault case, Mr Tan Siew Chwee took  over  the

post  of Secretary in this Committee. After the  May

Day celebrations on 19th May. 1962, the name of this

11-man   Singapore  Trade  Unions  May   Day   Joint

Celebrations   Committee  was   changed   into   the

Singapore   Trade   Unions   National   Day    Joint

Celebrations Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from a Joint Committee formed with the purpose

of   organising   the  May  Day  Celebrations,   the

Committee  went on to other anti-national activities

such  as  the  calling  of a separate  National  Day

celebration, the effect of which, of course, was  to

promote   disunity  of  the  people.  However,   the

separate  National Day celebration  called  by  this

Committee was cancelled because the organisers  were

warned  that  should they pursue their intention  to

organise  processions,  the organisations  concerned

were likely to be considered for de-registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said just now that the separate National Day

celebration  - to be more correct,  it  should  be  a

protest meeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



was  cancelled  by  the  anti-nationalists  iii  the

S.A.T.U. unions  because  of  the  threat  of   de-registration if any of the 10 conditions attached to

the permit was breached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Communist stooges in the

Barisan   Sosialis  cannot  be  expected  to   speak

honestly. These 10 conditions were comprehensive and

intended  to  cover all kinds of occasions  and  all

foreseeable   types  of  meetings.  Although   these

normal conditions are attached to every permit as a

matter  of routine, this does not mean that all  the

conditions   are  applicable  generally.   In   this

particular  instance  about  the  proposed   protest

meeting  on National Day at the Happy World Stadium,

the   Government  was  specifically  interested   in

condition  3,  i.e., there should be no processions.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, all the police were committed  on

National  Day  at the Padang where the occasion  was

celebrated  by  people  from all  sections  and  all

strata of society, unlike the one at the Happy World

Stadium.  If  the  pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group  of

trade  unions  and  their front  organisations  were

allowed  to  defy  the law and stage  demonstrations

along  the streets of Singapore with hardly a police

officer  around even to look after the traffic,  the

situation would be very delicate indeed. Hence,  the

Government  issued a warning to the organisers  that

if  they persisted in carrying out their procession,

they might be required to show cause why their union

registration should not be cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech just now the Member for Thomson

attempted  to  create the impression that  the  pro-Communist  S.A.T.U. group of trade unions  were  all

reasonable  and law-abiding, whereas the  Government

was inciting violence. Mr Speaker, Sir, who are the

people  the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are  trying

to  fool?  These  two meetings of the  Trade  Unions

Working  Committee had to be called off not  because

the  pro-Communists were reasonable and law-abiding,

but  because, may I suggest, firstly, they  realised

these proposed meetings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



were  unlawful; secondly, they were trying  to  find

out  to what extent the Government were prepared  to

go; thirdly, they were still hoping that there might

be  a  possible  hitch in the Cobbold Commission  on

Malaysia;  and  finally,  the  higher-ups  of  their

command  have not yet made up their minds to  resort

to  more  violent means of struggle, or, to use  the

words  of  the  Member for Thomson, "a more  painful

form of expression".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Mr Speaker, Sir, this so-called

Trade  Unions Working Committee was originally known

as   the  Singapore  Trade  Unions  May  Day   Joint

Celebration Committee, re-named the Singapore  Trade

Unions  National  Day  Joint Celebration  Committee.

Then on 31st May, 1962, this 11-man Committee was renamed  again  and styled itself the Singapore  Trade

Unions Working Committee with a re-shuffle of posts.

Hussein   Jahidin  now  became  the   Chairman   and

Salahudin Ghouse became the Secretary. It was in the

name   of  this  so-called  Singapore  Trade  Unions

Working  Committee that a meeting  of  trade  unions

belonging  to  the  pro-Communist  S.A.T.U. group,

student  bodies,  cultural organisations,  political

Parties  and peasants' organisations was  called  on

9th  June, 1962, ostensibly to discuss the  National

Referendum  Bill. Here then we see how a  Committee,

which  was  originally formed with  the  purpose  of

organising a May Day celebration, was turned to good

use  by  the  Communist stooges  into  a  weapon  of

political agitation against merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the proposed meetings called by this

so-called  Trade  Unions Working  Committee  was  to

build a Communist-led united front of students,  old

boys'    associations,   workers'   unions,    rural

organisations and other cultural organisations on  a

common  platform  of opposition  to  Government  and

merger  and  Malaysia. This move  by  the  Communist

stooges  is,  in fact, a repetition of  the  history

leading up to the riots of October 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that on 28th September. 1956,

there  was held at the Hokkien Association  premises

in Telok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



Ayer  Street  a similar meeting which styled  itself

the Singapore Civil Rights Convention. Inche Hussein

Jahidin  was the front man of that meeting  and  was

elected  to  the Civil Rights Convention  Committee.

The   workings  and  agitation  of  this   Committee

eventually  ended  in the riots of  1956.  The  1956

Committee, which also comprised 11 persons like  the

present  one, also drew its members from a so-called

Trade Unions Working Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be aware that the attempt at forming

a  united front by the 11-man so-called Trade Unions

Working Committee having failed, the Communists  and

their  stooges  attempted  another  one,  this  time

calling   itself   the  Council  of   Joint   Action

comprising  five  political  Parties  - the   Barisan

Sosialis, the Workers' Party, the Partai Rakyat, the

United Democratic Party, and the Liberal Socialists.

This so-called Council of Joint Action - a name which

even  the  Member  for Anson felt  rather  squeamish

about  - then  picked  up where the  so-called  Trade

Unions Working Committee had left off, and attempted

to  revive  the united front by calling a convention

of civic organisations to be held on 6th July at the

Badminton  Hall. Now having refused  the  Communists

and  their stooges their meeting for a united  front

organisation   through  the  Trade  Unions   Working

Committee,  the  Government  has  no  intention   of

allowing  the Communists the use of the  Council  of

Joint  Action  to  start  another  convention.   The

Government  has  no  intention of  allowing  diverse

organisations  constituted  for  different  purposes

from  coagulating  and  perverting  themselves  into

Trade   Unions   Working  Committee,  Civil   Rights

Convention, Council of Joint Action, etc.  Attracted

to the latest "Council of Joint Action" are a number

of  persons who are being used with their  knowledge

to  provide a cover of respectability the Communists

need  for carrying out their present work. If  these

people   continue   consciously  and   publicly   to

associate  themselves as co-sponsors of a  Communist

United Front campaign after their attention has been

drawn to the probable consequences of such a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



Communist united front campaign, then they  will  be

held  responsible  equally with the  Communists  and

their associates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to make it clear to the House that

the  Government is not against political Parties  or

trade  unions  holding meetings for which  they  are

properly  constituted. The Government  has  recently

approved  permits to the Singapore Rural  Residents'

Association  and  the  Singapore  Country   People's

Association  to  hold their annual general  meetings

and  celebrations;  and  the Singapore  Bus  Workers

Union   and   the  Wood  Workers  Union   to   stage

celebrations  and  concerts  to  commemorate   their

anniversaries.  In  these meetings,  bitter  attacks

were   made   against  the  Referendum   Bill.   The

Government has also approved permits to the Workers'

Party,  the Barisan Sosialis and the United People's

Party  to hold public meetings, specially to  attack

the  Referendum Bill. Therefore, the charge that the

Government   is   denying  the  people   and   their

organisations  their fundamental  democratic  rights

and civil liberties is utter nonsense. The charge is

not only dishonest but malicious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their memorandum to the Assemblymen from the

Singapore  Trade  Unions Working  Committee,  it  is

alleged that at paragraph 38, I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The laws at present being referred to by the

Government  in preventing the people from discussing

matters  of grave concern to them have been enforced

for  several years. They have never been invoked  to

repress  and  suppress the legitimate expression  of

our  people on matters affecting them by the  former

governments  as  they fully knew  that  such  action

would  be  a complete abuse of these laws which  are

meant for other purposes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I point out to the

House   that   the  result  of  such  inaction   and

feebleness  in  such matters resulted  in  the  1956

riots, with consequent suffering and distress  to  a

great  number of people? The duty and responsibility

of  the Government is to see that such suffering and

distress  does  not befall the people  of  Singapore

again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their memorandum to the Assemblymen, the Trade

Unions  Working  Committee alleged in  paragraph  42

that "democracy is in danger and that the democratic

rights of the people are being threatened -"



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Is it

proper  for the Minister to touch on this memorandum

since  it  has  been referred to  the  Committee  of

Privileges, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Not the whole memorandum. The whole

memorandum has not been referred to the Committee of

Privileges; only certain passages. Paragraphs 45  to

49 cannot be referred to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It is true, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  democracy is in danger and that the democratic

rights  of the people are being threatened. But  the

danger  and  the  threat come  from  the  Communists

outside and from their stooges inside this Assembly.

It  is not the democratic rights of the people  that

they are interested in. What they are interested  in

and what their stooges are championing in this House

are the democratic methods of the minority group  of

Communists   and  their  stooges  to  threaten   and

intimidate  all  people  who  disagree  with   them,

including  even  Members of this  Assembly  who  are

democratically elected by the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There I think the Minister for Home

Affairs is treading on forbidden ground.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no amount of

double  talk and no amount of pretence will  deceive

the Government and the people of Singapore as to the

real and hidden intentions of the Communists and the

pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis in wanting to

wreck merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we were not born yesterday. We

are  fully  aware of the tactics of  the  Communists

perpetrated  not  only  in  our  own  country,   but

elsewhere.  We know what their plans and  intentions

are.  In  short, we know exactly how  they  work  to

achieve their sinister ends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They manipulate their stooges and puppets. They

make  their  puppets  utter  falsehoods  which  they

themselves do not believe in. They make use of their

stooges  to  stand  in  the front  line  while  they

themselves  remain in the background. The Communists

set up front organisations in the name of democratic

institutions   fighting  for  civil   rights.   They

infiltrate into trade unions, student organisations,

cultural organisations, political Parties and  every

possible  institution and organisation  to  make  it

look  as  though these organisations  are  genuinely

expressing their opinions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the very naive and the uninitiated will tag

along  with  them  in  their insidious  campaign  to

poison and pollute the atmosphere around us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the events which have taken place

in Singapore and Malaya since the termination of the

Second  World War are still fresh in our  minds.  To

the  casual  observer who recalls them in isolation,

these  events may not reveal much. But to those  who

take the trouble to follow and understand them,  the

nefarious activities of the Communists will  clearly

show  a  familiar pattern not unlike those found  in

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where armed insurrection and violence have failed,

as   in  the  case  of  Burma,  Indonesia  and   the

Philippines, the Communists change their tactics and

strategy to that of subtle infiltration into legally

constituted  organisations.  Where  they  are   held

suspect  and cannot function by themselves, they  go

into alliance with men who have "respectability"  in

the  public eye. In such alliances they exploit  the

genuine grievances of political leaders, student and

cultural  leaders, and never fail to feign  sympathy

and   support  for  these  leaders.  Outwardly  they

subscribe to democratic principles and lend  support

to  any overt expression of dissatisfaction with so-called  threats to the democratic system.  In  their

minds   they   have   the   utmost   contempt    for

parliamentary  democracy. But, of course,  they  are

the  most  articulate  in  their  pronouncements  in

support of parliamentary democracy. They do not even

hesitate to out-do and out-bid innocent democrats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



in  the call for greater democratic rights and wider

civil liberties. To the Communists this phase of the

activities  is understood as the "minimum struggle",

the maximum struggle being to oust their allies when

they have gained enough strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it is today when we are on the threshold of

merger and Malaysia. They know what they will be  in

for   and  they  know  what  will  happen  to  their

Communist  activities in Singapore with  merger  and

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They accuse the Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  memorandum  to Assemblymen of  playing  up  the

Communist  bogey. Mr Speaker, Sir,  a  bogey  is  a

ghost.  But  the Communists are neither  bogeys  nor

ghosts.  They exist in our midst. And we  know  they

exist.  If the Communists were bogeys, then  Stalin,

Mao,  Ho  Chih Minh, Chin Peng, Aidit and all  their

followers were also bogeys. If they were bogeys, the

M.C.P. could not have started their violent  revolt

in 1948. If Chin Peng was a bogey, he would not have

demanded,  as  one of the conditions  to  surrender,

that the Communist Party of Malaya be legalised. The

House  is  aware  that  a  Commission  is  currently

sitting to inquire into the Communist activities  in

secondary  schools. We shall see  whether  Communist

activities in schools are facts or bogeys. No,  Sir,

they  existed  then and they are still in  existence

today. The only difference being that today they  do

not  carry the Communist flag, and they do not  wear

the  symbol  of the hammer and the sickle  on  their

shirts.  They have hidden these emblems of Communism

in  their pockets for reasons of security - their own

security and safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1948 they helped to set up the All-Malaya

Council of Joint Action which organised a hartal  to

oppose  the  first  Federation of Malaya  Agreement.

Under the then prevailing circumstances, they wanted

a united Malaya with Singapore. Now they do not want

a  united  Malaya.  In 1956 they set  up  the  Civil

Rights  Convention.  Today they  are  attempting  to

revive  it  to  carry  out  their  anti-merger   and

Malaysia  campaign. In 1957 they  formed  the  Anti-Yellow Culture Council. Now, unfortunately for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



them, they are unable to form a similar organisation

simply  because they cannot find support for such  a

body because the Government has done all it could to

stamp  out yellow culture. Likewise, they find  that

the  people are satisfied with the education  policy

giving  equal treatment to all streams of education.

So they cannot successfully mount opposition against

the Government in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, can we allow the pattern

of  events we learned so bitterly in the past to  be

repeated?  One reason why the Communists  and  their

stooges have failed last year and this year is  that

now  the  people are already aware of the facts  and

the  truth. The people are aware that the  so-called

undemocratic   action  which  the   Government   was

supposed   to  have  taken  at  the  Motor  Workshop

Employees  Union is nothing more than a reminder  to

the  organisers not to break the law. The organisers

knew  very  well  that an assembly  of  10  or  more

persons  not belonging to the same registered  trade

union  or  other organisations would  constitute  an

unlawful assembly and that they would have  to  face

action  as stipulated in the law. After they  failed

in  this  first attempt to defy the law, these  same

mischief-makers next set about forcing their beliefs

through the so-called "Council of Joint Action".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is determined to

avoid  the  mistakes of past years. It  will  expose

every attempt by the Communists to build up a united

front of legal organisations. It will be failing  in

its  duty  if  it  allows the Communists  and  their

stooges  to  have their way in wrecking  merger  and

Malaysia.  The people hope the Government  does  not

let  them  down  this time and at any  time  in  the

future.  The  stakes  are  too  big,  for   we   are

responsible  for  the lives of  1.7  million  people

whose  happiness depends not on what the  Communists

say  and  do, but on what is even  more  vital  and

greater, and that is that their future in  Malaysia

must be secure and their prosperity ensured.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully support this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



motion.  In  this motion the Member for Thomson  has

stated  very clearly our point of view.  The  Member

for  Anson  has  also spoken very clearly  from  the

point  of  view  of  law.  Therefore, there  is  no

necessity for me to repeat what they have said.  The

Minister for Home Affairs, in a speech which  lasted

about  one  hour, mentioned Communists,  Communists,

more than 100 times. But he did not produce any  new

and fresh arguments. He was repeating the pet phrase

which  is  used by the P.A.P., that is, "Communists,

Communists".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister for Home Affairs in his one-hour speech said one sentence which was very

interesting  to  me. He said that the  Civil  Rights

Convention  of 1956 is the same as the present  one.

The  1956 and 1962 Civil Rights Conventions are  the

same  because their purpose is the same, that is  to

safeguard and protect the fundamental rights of  the

people.  But we have to carefully study the sentence

spoken  by  him.  Let  us recall  the  Civil  Rights

Convention  of 1956. The present Prime Minister  was

the  legal  adviser to that Civil Rights  Convention

then  and the organisers are also the same group  of

organisers of the present Convention. In  the  short

period of six years, on the question of safeguarding

the  people's fundamental rights under the same  law

in the same country and by the same group of people,

the Civil Rights Convention in 1962 is now termed as

Communist-inspired. Why should it be  like  this?  I

have  tried my best but I cannot find any difference

between the present Civil Rights Convention and  the

one  in  1956.  There might be only one  difference:

that  is,  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew was in  the  Opposition

Party,  but  today  he  is  the  Prime  Minister  of

Singapore. This is the only difference. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  during the adjournment for tea after the Prime

Minister  had finished his speech, I told  him  that

the  Prime  Minister of today is a person who  after

crossing a river demolishes the bridge. I also  told

him  that  as soon as he catches a fish  he  forgets

about  the fishing net. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  sort

of person will be drowned in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



end.  When discussing the National Referendum  Bill,

one  thing  interested me very much. The Member  for

Cairnhill "presented" a pair of gloves to the  Prime

Minister which was stained with blood and filth. The

Prime  Minister has always said that he  will  never

use  the dirty and bloody gloves of the Lim Yew Hock

Government,  but today the Member for Cairnhill  has

presented  these gloves to the Prime  Minister,  and

the  Prime  Minister  is now  making  use  of  these

bloodstained gloves. But there is one difference  in

this  pair of gloves, and that is that although this

pair  of  gloves was made in Britain, the  brand  is

different.  This  pair  of  dirty  and  bloodstained

gloves has got the brand of Lee Kuan Yew. Therefore,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in debating this  question,  the

P.A.P. are not able to produce any new arguments  on

this  matter.  What they are doing  is  to  use  the

pretext of "Communists, Communists".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope my last

sentence  will  be remembered by the Prime  Minister

and  his Back Benchers. Whatever we do, we must  not

demolish the bridge after having crossed the  river;

and we must not forget the fishing net after we have

caught the fish.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this  motion before  us  is  a  very

serious  motion.  I do not know the  impression  and

feelings of the P.A.P. Government. I think  if  they

are  still  capable of having some sort of  feeling,

they should feel ashamed of themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion is like a sharp sword

which has cut through the false mask of democracy of

the  P.A.P.  Government. We want them to answer  our

motion  which condemns the Government.  I  have  two

questions  to ask. First, have the P.A.P. Government

lost  confidence in democracy? Second, do  the  P.A.P.

Government want to deprive the rights of the  people

of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government control all its propaganda

organisations. They control the Press, the radio and

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



even  do  not want the people to know the  arguments

put up by the Opposition Parties in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Prime Minister said this sentence at

a  forum  of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  which

turned  out  to  be  a listening  forum  only.  This

sentence  was  obtained from the debate.  Today  the

Prime  Minister does not want the people to  discuss

things  concerning their rights. From the speech  of

the Minister for Home Affairs as well as that of the

Prime Minister, we know that they dare not face  the

questions,  but they try their best  to  smear,  and

they  push  all  the unsolved questions  on  to  the

Communists,  as  if the Communists have  become  the

life-savers  of the P.A.P. Government. The  attitude

of  the Government is pitiful. At the same time,  it

is also known for political opportunism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say three things about the speech of the

Prime  Minister.  Just  now he  has  said  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis Party has been used as stooges  by

the  Communists. But I think this is ridiculous.  Do

you  say  that  if  we  are  going  to  achieve  the

fundamental rights of the people, we are being  used

as  stooges by the Communists? I can say truly  that

the  Prime  Minister has become the  stooge  of  the

reactionary power today.

<br><br>7.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has been very smart and clever, but today he has dropped into the mire and is unable

to come out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Prime Minister has said that his

Party and his Party's politics are incorruptible and

that  he  can be proud of it. But I feel  that  this

word  "corruption"  should be interpreted  properly.

What  does it mean? It is a corrupt Government. That

means corruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, is that relevant to the motion?

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  is  going to argue with  the  Chair.  The

Prime  Minister has made his speech and she has  got

the right to reply to the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, from what the Parliamentary Secretary

has  said,  we  can  see that the  Prime  Minister's

policy is strange to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now I have said that

the  word "corruption" means corruptible. Today  the

P.A.P.  Government is a corrupt Government.  What  I

mean by corruption is political corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Prime Minister has said the P.A.P.

Government has a stand on this point. If the  P.A.P.

Government has a stand, it is ridiculous. We can say

it is an opportunistic stand. Actually we cannot say

it is a proper stand at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we believe that in a

democratic  struggle we must proceed in  a  peaceful

and  constitutional  way  for  the  welfare  of  the

people.  We have rights and we have faith.  We  have

found  out the position in which these organisations

concerned have been put. They have been deprived  of

their rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the struggle against colonialism, in

constitutional progress, and in the reunification of

the  two  territories, these democratic  rights  are

most  important. What little democracy we have  been

enjoying  are  the results of our struggles  in  the

past.  All  the suppressed peoples of the world  and

those  colonised and suppressed countries have stood

up   bravely,  struggling  to  secure  the  people's

democratic  rights and to secure their  welfare  and

their  future.  These have been  the  objectives  of

these peoples. This is something the cunning British

colonialists cannot stop. The United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



Nations  in  1960  passed  a  resolution  about  the

colonial  countries.  I hope that  the  P.A.P. will

abide by that resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion by

the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, one very significant sentence comes out of  the

long  speech  by  the Minister for Home  Affairs.  I

think  he  asked, "Are we to allow  the  pattern  of

events  we  learned so bitterly in the  past  to  be

repeated?" He posed that question in the House.  But

I  do  not know whom he meant by"we". Surely it  was

not the P.A.P. who learned the pattern of events. It

was the P.A.P. who formed the pattern of events. But

if  the  Government now, having been a party to  the

pattern  of  events  in the past that  have  brought

misery and hardship to the people of Singapore,  are

prepared to learn the mistake of their ways and  are

now  willing  to nail their erstwhile  friends  with

whom  they  had worked together, there is no  reason

why  we, as a responsible Opposition, should do what

he  did  when he was in the Opposition. We  did  our

best  to  contain the Communists.  We  did  what  we

thought  was right for the good of the country.  But

it  was  he who led in the formation of that pattern

of  events which is now unfolding itself. But  there

is one difference in this pattern of events, Sir, In

1956 it was I who stood on the other side facing the

Communists, aided and abetted by the P.A.P. Today it

is  the P.A.P. Government that has to face the  same

Communist  threat. But I can assure  the  people  of

Singapore  that the S.P.A. will at no time  aid  and

abet the Communists to overthrow the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard from the Member for Havelock that I

have  presented  a  pair  of  gloves  to  the  Prime

Minister.  If he is so anxious to know what  I  have

presented to the Prime Minister, may I tell him that

through  my actions against the Communists  in  1956

and 1957 I presented to him the government under the

new  Constitution?  I  am happy  that  after  having

received the present of being in the government,  he

is now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



having a dose of the medicine which he gave  to  me

when I was in the Government. My hope is that having

to  swallow this bitter pill, the P.A.P. will really

mean  business when they say that the  interests  of

the  people  of Singapore should be protected.  They

want  to do it in the way that they think is  right.

Events  will prove whether they are right or whether

they are wrong. But I would like to say that I agree

with  the Prime Minister that this pattern of events

is  really coming to the forefront. There have  been

indications in the past few days, and in fact in the

past few months, that the Communists are mounting  a

campaign  to damage merger, or what is more  correct

to  say,  closer association with the Federation  of

Malaya. They are, in this attempt, adopting the same

tactics that they adopted during my time. The  Prime

Minister,  who  was with them the  other  time,  now

knows  that the best way to meet them is to do  what

he  has  been  doing. Since this is a fight  by  the

Government  against the Communists, it is  our  duty

not   to  make  the  job  more  difficult  for   the

Government.  But  since it is  a  retracing  of  the

pattern  of events that took place in 1956 and  1957

when  the  P.A.P. was in the lead, the  S.P.A. will

abstain.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, we long ago expected that  the

Barisan Sosialis and their fellow travellers  wanted

to  smear our stand. We believe that everyone  knows

that  when  we of the P.A.P. will not go  with  them

into a blind alley they will resort to certain means

to  try  to  topple the P.A.P. In a short  space  of

time, the people have seen clearly their motives and

actions.  They  have been trying  to  use  the  word

"democracy" to cover their viciousness.  They  hoped

that the Government would make use of the police  to

deal  with  the students and to have conflicts  with

the  workers.  They hoped that the Government  would

make  things unpleasant. But the P.A.P. in all these

things  have  made preparations. We associated  with

them  for  some time. That is why we can  understand

them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



quite  well.  For instance, say, when  the  parents

are  staying  with  the children,  the  parents,  of

course,  know the character and behaviour  of  their

children. That is why when we parted ways with them,

we prepared steps in anticipation of what they would

do.  Although  in the past one year there  was  such

confusion  in  Singapore, the Government  peacefully

passed through the unnecessary turmoil and confusion

created  by  them. Their time is numbered.  As  time

passes,  their ruthless actions and motives will  be

all the more exposed to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleagues and the Minister for Home

Affairs explained clearly the various actions  taken

by   the  Government.  It  is  because  the  Barisan

Sosialis want to resort to their ways to condemn the

P.A.P. that they have brought up a motion  in  this

House. They realise clearly that the P.A.P. have all

along adopted the correct stand. If we want to  seek

political rights, we must do it through peaceful and

constitutional means in accordance with  the  wishes

of  the  people. Have they now forgotten  about  all

this? They have been guilty of double talking.  They

should know that the P.A.P. will not act contrary to

their principles. We will struggle for the interests

of   the  people  under  our  Party  banner  and  in

accordance  with  our principles. They  have  talked

about forgetting the net after catching the fish and

destroying the bridge after crossing a river. Now  I

throw back all these phrases to them. They can apply

them to themselves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I think we have just seen

how  the Member for Cairnhill tried to encourage the

been  trying against the people, the dirty work that

was  carried  out in 1956. We have  all  along  been

saying that the Lim Yew Hock Government are one with

the  Lee  Kuan  Yew  Government. The  Lee  Kuan  Yew

the  referendum. Let me remind you once again,  Sir,

that  in  Singapore today the vast majority  of  the

people  are  against this merger  and  against  this

dirty  referendum. Are they all Communists?  In  the

Borneo territories, the Ibans and the Dyaks are  all

against  Malaysia, and in Brunei all the Malays  are

against Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member

for Queenstown that we are not debating Malaysia  at

all?  We  are debating a motion moved by the  Member

for  Thomson and the Member for Havelock.  So  these

arguments  on Malaysia and the referendum have  been

completely  irrelevant to the motion  which  we  are

debating now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I agree with you, Mr Mammen,

Sir, It is a pity that these remarks were allowed to

come  from the mouth of the Member for Cairnhill.  I

have to rebut them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have been talking about freedom of

speech,  free association, assembly and publication.

Let  us remind the P.A.P. Government once more. Laws

are made by men and not men made for the laws. It is

the  spirit  of  the  law  that  counts.  Any  dirty

government  can interpret the law to  suit  its  own

convenience.  I  have  had the personal  experience,

Sir, of being charged by this P.A.P. Government  for

having  convened  an  assembly - a  similar  type  of

assembly, Sir - and this Government saw to it  that  I

was  fined  $40. It is not that we really broke  the

law, Sir. The law says that you are not supposed  to

cause   violence;  you  are  not  supposed   to   be

disorderly.  There  is no suggestion  whatsoever  in

this particular case that there was any commotion or

any  disorder. Yet the Government saw fit to prevent

any   public  expression  of  condemnation  of   the

Government.   Everybody  in  town  is  against   the

Referendum  Bill, and if you do not allow  people  a

free  means  of expression to condemn the Government

for  its  dishonesty  and dictatorship,  what  other

opportunities  are  left  for  the  people  to  give

expression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



to  their feelings against the Government?  Is  this

not one of the ways of the Government to provoke the

people  to some other method of protest against  the

Government?  The mere fact that they had  to  employ

all  the  Special Branch police to go along to  this

union  headquarters with flash-bulbs  all  over  the

place showed that they wanted to intimidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this camera business has been used by many

previous  governments. They want to have records  of

the faces of Mr X, Mr Y, Mr Z, and the whole idea

is  to identify that man or woman and make sure that

the  future of that man or woman will come to  grief

as long as that government is in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, Sir, for example today, that there are

prominent businessmen who have been pressured to say

what  the Government want them to say. They pressure

them by withholding passports. They pressure them by

inconveniences in their business. They pressure them

by  special investigations into what they have - their

money  and their property. Sir, there are many  ways

of  pressuring people and the camera is just one  of

the  lot  that  is  used in the case  of  the  trade

unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> You have a camera

also.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not have to answer this. He

never  knew what he was talking about. For  example,

when the students had their faces photographed their

pictures were recorded and if in future they  should

ever  apply  for jobs as teachers or  in  Government

offices,  they  would  be turned  down.  What  other

avenues of employment will be open to them? This  is

the  P.A.P.'s  special  way  of  intimidation  which

everybody  objects  to. I only want  to  stress  one

point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Stretch your imagination

further.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You must allow the people a

chance to express their grievances in a peaceful and

constitutional  manner. The  Government  talk  about

parliamentary democracy. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



already  pointed out to you before that  it  is  the

failings in our human material that have caused  the

failure  of  parliamentary democracy  in  Singapore.

[Interruption]  What we see in the  Referendum  Bill

goes  to  prove  exactly that.  The  P.A.P. are  so

ashamed of the Referendum Bill themselves that  they

want to bury it quickly. That is enough indication -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Come to the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to you that they are

undemocratic,  that  they are dictatorial  and  that

they are dishonest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs mentioned "Communists", "pro-Communists", I think, about 200 times. I am sure his speech must have been written for him by the Special Branch. They have no other material. [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have on many occasions spoken on this Communist

label.   Many  years  ago,  they  used   the   label

"Socialist  and Labour". Seventy years ago,  it  was

"Radical",  and it is not unreasonable to  say  that

1900  years  ago, the label was "Christian".  Today,

they say "Communists and Reds".



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Say something new.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, I would like to hear

something  new  from the Minister for Education.  He

has  nothing  to  say. He cannot say  anything.  But

since  we are going to stop at 8 o'clock tonight,  I

would  like  to remind our Government Ministers  and

the  P.A.P. Assemblymen that if they want people  to

work  peacefully and constitutionally, let them give

the   people   a  chance  to  work  peacefully   and

constitutionally. I think the Prime Minister himself

said  not so very many years ago that if you  are  a

democrat,  you  will at least allow your  enemy  the

very   same  facilities  which  you  want  to   have

yourself.  Let them not kill democracy  in  the  way

they  have been interpreting the law - just  to  suit

themselves and not the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I

had  not  intended  to speak. When  the  Member  for

Queenstown  said that the Communists of  today  are

like  the Christians of 1900 years ago, I felt  that

that would lead to confusion because the Christians,

Sir,  put  God as No. 1, whereas the Communists  put

one  man  as No. 1 and they must obey him regardless

of   their   conscience.  That  is   the   essential

difference, Sir.



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

at least the Barisan Sosialis are able to touch some

soft  part of the Members of the Singapore  People's

Alliance  - if not a part that yields to a  sense  of

logic,  at least it is a part that yields to  things

connected  with  religion and the higher  ideals  of

moral  rearmament. Sir, I do not have very  much  to

say  in  reply  because the Government Members  have

only  cried Communism in reply to the speech I  made

when moving the motion. Besides that, they have  not

put  forward any argument to justify why  these  two

meetings  called  at  the Motor  Workshop  Employees

Union premises by the Singapore Trades Union Working

Committee were disallowed. Sir, I am sure we are all

tired of listening to this cry of Communism over and

over  again.  I  do  not want to make  it  any  more

tiresome by replying to the Communist bogey that the

Ministers saw fit to raise once again in the  debate

before  the  House. Sir, all that I wish  to  do  is

merely to touch on one or two points that the  Prime

Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs  made  in

the course of their speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister - I have only one point to

deal with in his speech - suggested that in 1956  the

premises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees'

Union,  87  Bukit  Timah  Road,  was  the  scene  of

rioting. And now the Singapore Trade Unions  Working

Committee convened the meeting on the same premises,

and,  therefore, there was something sinister.  Sir,

this  is typical of the bankruptcy in his arguments.

It  is typical of the absurdity of the arguments the

Government Members put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



forward. This is only an indication of the fact that

they disregard logic, even in their propaganda. Sir,

if  one  looks through the records of the  Singapore

Motor  Workshop  Employees' Union,  one  will  find,

besides  the meetings called by the Singapore  Trade

Unions   Working  Committee,  besides  the  meetings

called  by  the Singapore Motor Workshop  Employees'

Union   itself,  there  have  been  numerous   other

meetings  held.  Meetings convened by  the  People's

Action Party itself were held on the premises of the

Singapore Motor Workshop Employees' Union. What  was

the Prime Minister trying to suggest? Because on the

26th of October, 1956, there was a violent scene  on

the premises of the Motor Workshop Employees' Union,

does  it  mean that every meeting held in the  Motor

Workshop  Employees' Union will necessarily  end  in

violence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I pointed out earlier on that if the

Government  had no intention of wanting  to  provoke

violence, they could have informed the convenors and

the  organisers well before 7 p.m. on the  night  of

June  1962. No, they chose the last moment. Why  did

they  want to choose the last moment to inform  that

the  meeting was banned? The news was flashed in the

7  p.m. news  over  Radio Singapore.  If  they  had

informed  the convenors earlier in the day,  morning

or in the early afternoon, there would not have been

anybody going to the premises of the Singapore Motor

Workshop  Employees'  Union. As  I  said,  no,  they

thought fit only to inform at the last moment.  They

knew that delegates would be coming to the premises.

They knew that when they discovered the meeting  was

being  banned wrongly, they would be  in  a  fit  of

temper. To make matters worse, they had their police

force to indulge in very provocative acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs said there were

no riot vans. I am sure if he checks up his records,

he  will find that riot vans were parked near by the

premises of the Union. And if they want photographs,

we   ourselves   are  quite  prepared   to   produce

photographs to show where the riot vans were  parked

and who were the chaps who were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



guarding  them.  Incidentally, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  it  reminds me - once the Minister for  Culture

said if we were to produce a picture showing the use

of police on the workers, he would give us $50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union

has  published a very good picture - in fact,  a  few

good  pictures - of police assault on the workers  in

their  organ  called the Baybuck,  and  nothing  has

happened.  I  do  not see the Minister  for  Culture

making  any  suggestion that he  is  happy  that  we

published these pictures. But, in any case, now,  if

they are doubtful, if they think we are dishonest in

saying  that  there  were riot vans,  we  are  quite

prepared to produce pictures to show that there were

riot  vans. The Minister for Home Affairs said  that

all  that  happened was police photographers  taking

photographs.  He  thought fit to make  fun  of  some

Members  of this House. Sir, I do not think  anybody

who  attended  the meeting at the premises  of  this

Union  on  the  9th and 16th were  afraid  of  being

photographed. I am personally not camera shy.  I  am

quite certain that nobody was afraid of being caught

by  a  camera.  But the manner in which  the  police

photographer was acting was itself a provocation.  I

have  the  advantage  over  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  because I was there myself. I know how  the

police   photographer  behaved  himself.  Sir,   the

Minister   for  Home  Affairs  suggested  that   the

Singapore  Trade  Unions Working  Committee  reduced

itself  to  having  nine members from  the  original

eleven on the advice of a lawyer's clerk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Who was the lawyer!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> K. M. Byrne!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I must say that if the Committee was

reduced  in  number, it was not on the advice  of  a

lawyer's clerk, but it was on the suggestion made by

the  Registrar  of Societies himself.  Incidentally,

again  on  a  number of occasions, both  inside  and

outside  this House, we have heard expressions  from

the Government which seem to disclose an attitude of

contempt and snobbery in regard to lawyers'  clerks.

I wonder, on such occasions, what the feelings of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



my  good friend, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister for Finance, who was for a very long time a

lawyer's clerk in the legal firm of Lee & Lee,  are?

Sir,  all  the legal aspects of the issue - I  do  not

have  very  much  to say about them - have  been  very

adequately  dealt with by the Member  for  Anson.  I

cannot do any better even if I tried.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is a humbug.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But I can assure the Ministers and the

Government  Members, particularly the  Minister  for

Law  who is very anxious to know who gave the  legal

opinion,  that  whatever legal  opinion  the  40-odd

trade  unions  took,  whatever  legal  opinion   the

Singapore  Trade Unions Working Committee took,  was

not  from what they call a lawyer's clerk. They were

taken  from  a  very leading firm of  advocates  and

solicitors in Singapore. As the Member for Anson has

clearly put forward the case, it has been made clear

to   us   that   the  Government  not   only   acted

undemocratically in denying the unions the right  to

hold meetings, but also acted unconstitutionally. It

is  our view that the Government not only sought  to

deny  the  people  the  fundamental  right  to  hold

discussions,   the   fundamental   right   of   free

association  and  free communication,  but  it  also

sought  to  act  unconstitutionally and  beyond  the

limits of its powers.
