<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CROWS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

what  effort is being made to control the population of crows

and how successful it has been.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Senior Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in recent years, we have noted an increase  in

the crow population in spite of stepped up efforts by PPD  to

cull  them and by ENV to deny them waste food. The growth  of

the   crow   population  is  due  to  the  crow's  successful

adaptation to the urban environment where there is ample food

and inadequate culling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of crows culled by PPD has increased from a

monthly average of about 1,000 in 1998 to 1,500 last year,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>

1999. To maintain continuous pressure on the crow population,

PPD,  with  the help of the Singapore Gun Club and the  SAFRA

Shooting  Club, will continue to carry out crow  shooting  at

roosting  sites where large numbers gather to sleep overnight

on the trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV has required all foodshops to use a standard refuse

bin  with  lid and to make sure that there is no  food  waste

left  exposed.   We have also been working closely  with  the

Town  Councils  to improve on their housekeeping,  especially

the  cleanliness of their bin centres.  The bin centres  also

have  been protected against crows with wire meshing  to  all

openings. We have also sent out circulars to all operators of

restaurants,  coffee  shops and hawker stalls  to  warn  them

against feeding crows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD and ENV are continually reviewing the methods of

crow  control.  A new method being introduced is the  use  of

specially  designed crow traps.  These traps will  contribute

towards  greater culling of the crows.  An ornithologist  has

also  been commissioned to make a study on the behaviour  and

biology  of  crows  so  that other  control  methods  can  be

developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the meantime, PPD will further intensify the

culling  of  crows by shooting and ENV will strictly  enforce

the  regulations on waste management and removal to deny  the

crows food to further contain the problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Senior Minister of State what he is crowing

about.    What   crow  friendly  measures  is  the   Ministry

undertaking other than shooting these crows and culling  them

with shotguns?  It also creates problems for the residents if

the  guns misfire in the area which may endanger their lives.

This is a serious matter.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, besides culling and

removing sources of waste food to reduce the crow population,

we can also look into new ideas that may help.  For instance,

one  idea that crops up is to have bins and plastic bags used

for containing refuse infused with a repellant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>

so  that crows will not go near them.  I will give an example

of how we control the dengue now with the help of my Ministry

and  the  university.  For example, in  the  case  of  dengue

control,  scientists in my Ministry have discovered  that  by

raising  the temperature of stagnant water to 45o C,  it  can

kill  the  larvae  in the water within one hour.   With  this

finding,  they have developed a heating element that  can  be

installed  in  roof  gutters.  By switching  on  the  heating

element for slightly more than one hour, and this can be done

by  a  timer  switch in the middle of the night,  any  larvae

breeding  in the gutter will be destroyed.  I hope  the  same

effect  will  be  done towards this.  We are working  towards

this.   This  is a case where many people, out  of  kindness,

just  give food to the crows.  There is one instance where  a

hawker purposely gives the crows something to eat every  day.

He  said otherwise the crows will be a nuisance.  And one  of

those  days, he even pat the head of that chap.  This feeling

of  kindness,  as  far  as  Asian people  are  concerned,  is

understandable.   That  is  why we  try  to  look  into  this

particular area with new ideas and hopefully a breakthrough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

whether the PPD has ever offered a bounty on crows and  leave

it  to the creativity of the community to think out new  ways

to trap them.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> The bounty hunters are from the

two  clubs, Singapore Gun Club and SAFRA Shooting  Club,  and

they are doing it on a voluntary basis.  Other than that, the

traps seem to be working.  We have given out to Town Councils

about  22  traps that have managed to trap about 10  birds  a

month.  We hope to give another 30 to the town councils and I

hope the town councils will be ever ready to accept them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the Minister of

State  what  is  the  connection between  crows  and  dengue.

Second,  does  the crow cause dengue which is  the  issue  at

hand?   The  measure proposed is not effective  in  a  sense.

Firing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>

a  few  shots may not deal with the problem.  Are  there  any

ecological  or  eco-friendly measures that  the  Ministry  is

considering,  other than the measures that he  has  suggested

because  the crow problem has not been resolved?  There  have

been a lot of complaints from different quarters.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> I share the concern. But,

somehow, we do not have any species, like eagles or vultures,

that  can  take care of the crows.  In Malaysia or Indonesia,

they have musang (fox) that can really mash their nests.   In

our  case,  it is just ourselves.  As for connection  between

crows  and  dengue, I just mentioned that  we  are  seriously

looking  into  this method.  Dengue is one case.   Some  were

fatal.  To me, one death is one death too many.  And we  have

managed to come out with this heating element measure.   This

is  just an example.  We hope the so-called repellant  effect

at  the  bin, or in the plastic bags especially, can  do  the

work.  If you consider that as a friendly way of dealing with

the crows, that is our friendly way of using it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Can I ask the Senior

Minister  of State whether, when he is crowing about shooting

crows,  he can also go after the pigeons because I understand

the pigeon droppings are more dangerous than the crow?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> We will certainly look into the

matter also.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, from the number of crows

that  we  are seeing, and it is increasing with each  passing

year,  I wonder if the Ministry could set a benchmark  figure

and  give  a definite timetable as to how they are  going  to

control the growth of the crow population.  Could the  Senior

Minister of State give an indication of the plans?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, there are about 6,000 crows

in  Singapore.  It is something to crow about.  If they  were

to  mate,  usually they produce between two to  four  chicks.

Out  of four, half will somehow survive, that is, 6,000  plus

the  present 6,000, which is 12,000.  It is quite large.   We

have managed to handle only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>

about  1,000-1,500 a month.  We will certainly intensify  our

efforts  whether by culling, looking after the waste,  giving

some public education to our people, or providing traps.   We

hope that the latest one will work.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, unlike

my  colleague,  Dr Vasoo, I still cannot see  the  connection

between  dengue fever and the crows.  Is the Senior  Minister

of  State  trying to suggest, in fact, crows with the  dengue

fever?    Then  he  mentioned  about  housekeeping  by   town

councils.  I  am sure, as the Chairman of a town council,  we

want  to cooperate with the Ministry of the Environment.  But

one should not pass the buck to the town councils because the

crows  fly  everywhere.  The individual town  council  cannot

control  them because they fly from one town council  to  the

other.   I think it is more a matter of the Ministry  of  the

Environment  taking  a concerted action  to  deal  with  this

problem at source.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I thought we are taking a

concerted  effort with all the measures taken.  There  is  no

intention at all to pass the buck.  To me, it is a matter  of

asking  cooperation, rather than you and me with  a  gulf  in

between.   As  for the findings on dengue, when we  cooperate

with  certain authorities, like the universities, we are very

serious  about it.  We have managed to get a cure for  dengue

fever  by destroying the larvae in the gutters.  You  do  not

have  to tear down the roof.  We have managed to do that  and

the  findings  may  be  there.   Hopefully,  with  these  new

measures  or new breakthroughs, we can do the same, like  the

findings,  where we heat the roof gutters.  Is that  a  wrong

comparison?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Teo, last question. We have to move on

otherwise the Committee of Supply cannot start.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> May I ask the Senior

Minister  of State how does the crow trap work?  I understand

the  crows  are quite intelligent.  If you have 6,000  crows,

the  town councils will spend a lot of time and effort trying

to catch the crows.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> I can supply you the cage. It

is  a very simple one where you can put the bait inside,  and

the  crows will come in.  The moment they come into the  box,

they cannot come out because they are so large.  Remember the

monkeys, when they take something, they will refuse to let go

their  hands  with  the food.   So they were  caught  by  the

Africans.  I will let the Member have the opportunity to  use

it if he wants to.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Living conditions)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Manpower what

steps  are  being taken to monitor the living  conditions  of

foreign  workers  and  what are the  penalties  for  inhumane

treatment of foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I do not have much to crow about  as  far  as

foreign workers are concerned.  But when applying for foreign

workers,  all employers have to undertake to provide adequate

accommodation  for their foreign workers.   In  the  case  of

foreign  domestic  workers, they live in  the  homes  of  the

employers.  Although there are no specified standards for the

accommodation  of foreign domestic workers, my  Ministry  has

issued   guidelines  to  employers  to  ensure  that  foreign

domestic  workers'  need  for privacy  should  be  respected.

Employers  have also been reminded not to make their  foreign

domestic  workers sleep on beds in the corridors  or  in  the

living  rooms or in the kitchens with little privacy. Foreign

domestic workers should not be asked to share a room with  an

adult of the opposite sex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living conditions of foreign workers in the economic

sectors vary from industry to industry.  In the manufacturing

and  marine  sectors, foreign workers are generally  provided

with reasonable and acceptable accommodation.  In many cases,

foreign  workers  are  housed  in purpose-built  dormitories,

whose living conditions are comparable to that enjoyed by the

average  Singaporean.  Shipyards, for example,  provide  very

good accommodation to their foreign workers such as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>

the Acadia Lodge by Keppel Shipyard.  Sembawang Shipyard also

provides   good   quality  accommodation   in   company-built

dormitories.   Other  foreign workers  in  the  manufacturing

sector  are housed in commercially run dormitories  built  by

the Jurong Town Corporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the construction sector, the majority of the foreign

workers,  ie,  80%,  are  housed  on-site.   Contractors  who

provide on-site housing have to meet basic standards  set  by

various  Government  agencies, such  as  the  URA,  BCA,  the

Ministry of the Environment and the Fire Safety Bureau.   The

remaining 20% of foreign construction workers are housed off-site.  Some  are  accommodated in purpose-built  dormitories,

such  as  the Kaki Bukit Hostel which provides not only  good

quality  housing, but also social recreational  amenities  to

the 3,000 residents.  Other foreign workers are housed in pre-war  shophouses,  old  buildings or  in  private  residential

estates.   This is where the problem lies. Some  unscrupulous

employers may force their foreign workers to live in cramped,

and  sometimes,  unsafe living conditions. Those  responsible

will  be  taken  to  task  for violating  the  guidelines  on

accommodation set by the Work Permit Department  and  various

Government  agencies.   The URA, for  example,  ensures  that

there is no misuse of private and residential buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the inhumane treatment of foreign workers, the

Government  takes  a  very  serious  view  of  employers  who

mistreat or abuse their foreign workers.  The Penal Code, for

example,  was  amended in May 1998 to enhance  penalties  for

employers   who  physically  abuse  their  foreign   domestic

workers.   Errant employers will not only be taken  to  court

for  their actions, they will also be debarred from employing

foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers in the economic sectors are protected

under the Employment Act which spells out the basic terms and

conditions of employment.  Employers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>

who  fail to provide basic statutory benefits and who do  not

comply  with  the provisions of the Act will  be  dealt  with

under  the  law.  In addition, these employers may be  barred

from employing foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are reminded to treat their foreign workers

decently  and  not  to subject them to any inhumane  actions,

whether  in the homes or other workplaces. Those  who  do  so

will have to face the consequences of the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister whether

designated  sites to house foreign workers  in  the  economic

sectors,  like  the  construction industry,  are  subject  to

licensing and how often are they inspected on-the-spot basis?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> When a contractor wants to build

dormitories to house foreign workers, they have to apply  for

the  land  and the land would be made available,  subject  to

various  conditions  from the Land  Office.   Obviously,  the

contractor  or  developer who puts up the  dormitory  housing

will  have  to  comply  with  the  various  building  control

regulations  and this will obviously also be  inspected  from

time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Leong Horn Kee]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam is not here. Mr Thomas.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in 1993, as

the Vice President of the Consumers Association of Singapore,

I  appeared  before a parliamentary Select Committee  on  the

Goods  and Services Tax (GST).  CASE had, at that time,  just

submitted  a paper on their views on the GST, and during  the

hearing,  we asked for the extension of coverage of  existing

consumer  protection legislation as the existing  legislation

was inadequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in year 2000, at the beginning of this new

millennium, I can say the same thing.  We had, back  in  1993

asked  for  the  introduction of  a  Fair  Trading  Act.  The

arguments for it are still the same. A Fair Trading Act would

make  the  marketplace  competition  equitable  to  all   the

retailers, as well as the consumers. It would be an extension

of  our  laws that we have to protect the environment, health

and  safety, and now to protect consumers.  This  will  be  a

further improvement on the quality of life for our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I hear in CASE and my colleagues from CASE,

some  of the problems that consumers face today can be  quite

easily  eradicated  if there was a Fair Trading  Act.   These

include  things  like  the misleading  and  non-substantiated

claims,  deceptive  labelling, door-to-door  sales  and  hard

sell, the bait and switch method of sale, just to name a few.

With  globalisation, the power of big business will increase.

It  therefore will become more and more urgent to have  rules

to  ensure fairness, equity and a more level playing field in

the  marketplace. A Fair Trading Act will hurt no one, except

the  unscrupulous trader.  It will help legitimate  business.

It  will  lift  the floor of minimum standards and  ensure  a

level  playing  field for all the players. It will  help  the

retail  industry,  as  locals and  tourists  will  have  more

confidence in shopping without being taken for a ride.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we, Singaporeans, do not have to wait very

much longer to enjoy the advantages of a Fair Trading Act.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, massive

crowds gather to hear how to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>

make money quick from a "dot.com" business. Even more massive

crowds shove and push to get forms for the public listing  of

a "dot.com" company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a fever out there. Nay, not a fever, but

a  mania.  There is a frenzy when people rush to  grab  these

opportunities so they think to get rich quick and painlessly.

In  one  month,  a dream merchant demonstrates  that  he  can

collect  S$6 million.  No, better still, an assetless company

can  raise US$12 billion in cash on the basis of that  mania.

This  is  a  new economic doctrine called "hasti-Li  Ka-shing

in".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to urge the Government to do four things to

protect consumers from being dot-conned:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Amend our pyramid selling laws to ensure that those

who  build  pyramids on the Net do not get away  with  $5,000

slaps  on the wrist. There must be real products and services

before  a network marketing merchant is legalised. A business

which offers partners, franchisees or customers (however they

are  called)  more money from merely recruiting  new  members

rather  than  selling a service or product  must  be  clearly

identified as a pyramid seller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Create a separate bourse for dot.coms. My

colleagues  in  the House have proposed this  earlier  and  I

support the proposal for the reasons they have given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Introduce consumer protection provisions, such as a

Fair  Trading  Act, to criminalise businesses which  conclude

contracts,  whether of sale or investment,  on  (a)  promises

which  they do not intend to keep or do not believe they  can

keep; (b) over-exaggerate the potential of the businesses  or

products  without  full  disclosure  of  relevant  risks  and

shortcomings; and (c) to make misrepresentations  of  opinion

or  future  projections  and it is irrelevant  whether  these

misrepresentations  are  made  directly  or  indirectly,   by

allusion or deceptive juxtaposition of unconnected facts  and

figures   or  implied  from  subsequent  conduct.   All   the

unconscionable and unethical conduct I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>

described  currently  is  not  proscribed  by  our   consumer

protection laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To promote self-regulation by industry and fund

organisations such as the Consumers Association of  Singapore

to  educate and create consumer awareness and to monitor  the

industry codes of practice.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to

urge  the  Minister for Trade and Industry to look  into  the

issue  of  "third line forcing" as an unfair trading practice

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In "third line forcing", the supplier's goods or

services  will not provide the goods or services  unless  the

customer agrees to purchase from a third party chosen by  the

supplier.  The supplier is thereby "forcing" the customer  to

purchase  from a third party as a pre-condition to  supplying

the goods and services to the customer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most common type of "third line forcing" can be

found in lending arrangements.  Take this for example. Before

lending money for the purchase of a new home, a bank requires

the borrower to take out home insurance.  Unless the borrower

insures  his home with the insurance companies stipulated  by

the bank, the bank will not approve the loan to the borrower.

The  effect  of  this arrangement limits the choices  to  the

borrower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of arrangement is illegal in Australia, a

country  advanced in terms of its statutes,  legislation  and

court  processes.   Sir, we have adopted much  of  Australian

legislation,  such as the Land Titles Act, the Companies  Act

and  also  their mediation and dispute resolution  processes.

The  rationale  of making "third line forcing" illegal  under

their  Trade Practices Act is that it snuffs out competition,

which  can  only  be beneficial for the citizens.  There  is,

however,   a  slight  inadequacy  in  the  Australian   Trade

Practices  Act  which we may further improve on.   Their  law

only stops arrangements

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>

between the supplier of goods or services and a third  party.

Their law does not prohibit a supplier requiring the customer

to  purchase another product or service of the supplier.   If

the third party were a subsidiary of the supplier, section 47

of  their Trade Practices Act would not prohibit the supplier

from  forcing the customer to purchase products  from  itself

and its subsidiary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister for Trade and Industry consider

introducing a similar Fair Trading Act in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I have previously raised in this

House  the issue of the dangers of buying foreign properties.

These  properties  are  usually  promoted  in  Singapore   by

developers  and  it has never failed to amaze  me  that  many

members  of  the  public can part with large sums  of  money,

purely  on  the  basis  of  mock-up  models  and  beautifully

designed brochures.  I distinctively remember telling  myself

then,  when  these foreign properties were first promoted  in

Singapore,  that  the buyers may run into problems  with  the

properties as this is an area which is very poorly regulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, my misgivings have proven right. We have

seen  many disappointed buyers venting their frustrations  in

the press or at the sales offices on how they have been short-changed,  either  in  the  form  of  shoddy  construction  or

uncompleted   buildings.  Examples  of  such  incidents   are

numerous. But to be fair, not all foreign property developers

are   out   to   deceive   local   purchasers.   There   are,

unfortunately,  enough  of  them  out  there  to  cause  some

concern.

As  you  are  aware, if anyone were to attempt  to  sell  any

security  interest in Singapore, the law requires substantial

disclosure  of information by the promoters and  lodged  with

the  authority before promotion of such security interest may

be  allowed.   The  information  memorandum  would  typically

contain  information of the company, its  history,  business,

principal  officers  and finance and information  on  matters

which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

material.  The  idea,  principally, is to  allow  prospective

investors  to  make an informed choice.  Unfortunately,  such

requirements  are  not  required  for  promoters  of  foreign

properties   where  financial  exposure  can   be   just   as

substantial as investment in shares and other securities.  It

does  seem,  Sir, to be a bit of anomaly.  I understand  that

the  Government's  position has  always  been  based  on  the

principle  of  caveat emptor. However, if the  law  does  not

provide a framework where sufficient information is given and

where  promoters  do  suffer from a real  prospect  of  being

liable  for such promotions, it would be quite difficult  for

investors  in foreign properties to make informed choices  or

to enforce their rights.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1998 and also in 1999, I made a similar comment,

and  the  Finance  Minister had informed  me  then  that  the

Government  would consider an Estate Agents Bill to  regulate

the  sale  and  promotion  of foreign  properties.   I  would

appreciate  it if the Minister could inform this  House  when

the Government intends to introduce such a Bill and to give a

rough indication how such activities would be regulated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, water is a

scarce  resource.  I wish to ask the Minister for details  of

his  Ministry's  plan  to  explore other  sources  of  water,

besides  our  own water and water from Johor.   For  example,

what   is   the  status  of  the  announced  plan  to   start

desalination  plants?  Can the private sector be  enticed  to

participate in the construction of desalination plants?  What

are the technologies available, and the current economics  of

desalination  plants  versus processing  of  raw  water?   In

addition,  I  would also like to know whether the  Government

intends to promote water conservation again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea that has been mooted is to have a dual

water  reticulation system, ie, one system for potable  water

and another for industrial water.  Is this system, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>

has been used in other countries, feasible for Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I just like to add

to  the concern Mr Leong has raised.  Basically, in the high-tech  industries,  eg,  wafer fabs, chemical  industries  and

pharmaceutical companies, one of the concerns among investors

to  locate their factory in Singapore is the availability  of

water.   And  I  think we need to make them feel  comfortable

that  Singapore will have enough water, so as to attract such

industries in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the points I wish

to  raise have already been raised by both Mr Leong Horn  Kee

and Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the prices of electricity

tariffs  have increased quite substantially, by  20%  in  the

last  few  months.  Most local manufacturers are  complaining

and,  in fact, are very concerned.  This is due to the  sharp

rise  in oil prices in the last few years.  For example,  oil

prices actually increased from US$11 in 1998 to nearly three-fold, to $32 this week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is very dependent on external sources for

energy,   especially  on  crude  oil  for   our   electricity

generation.   I  would like to know how to  make  the  energy

sector  more efficient.  For example, electricity  generation

can  be deregulated so that more companies can be allowed  to

participate  in  electricity generation in Singapore.   If  a

company  can find it useful and cheaper to generate  its  own

electricity, and even have some spare power to sell to  other

users, they should be allowed to do so.  Moreover, in view of

the  rising  electricity prices, would it  be  worthwhile  to

reactivate the energy-saving campaigns?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the   Minister  to  address  the  following  policy  and

structuring issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the role of the regulator post-exercise. To what

extent  will  the regulator play a price stabilisation  role,

especially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>

for   households,  for  example,  during  periods  of   price

volatility   as  players  establish  their  relative   market

position?  In several markets, price volatility can sometimes

prevail for two to three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the regulator be charged with any responsibility as

far as the overall supply capacity is concerned, for example,

during  a  downturn or simply an over projection  of  demand,

which  if given entirely to market forces, might cause prices

to  collapse,  ultimately to the detriment of the  generating

companies?    Whilst  consumers  may  rejoice  at  collapsing

prices, they may, at the same time, be shareholders of  these

generating companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the structure of industry. From the

perspective  of promoting certain industries,  which  may  be

energy-intensive,  who would help  ensure  that  prices  make

economic sense for them?  A larger question would be  whether

the  allocation  of the pool by user groups, ie,  households,

large  consumers, will be incorporated as part of the  supply

structure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, would the transmission portion, ie, the

existing  Power  Grid,  which will  be  a  natural  monopoly,

include  the distribution role as well?  Otherwise, would  we

run the possibility of over providing for energy distribution

if each player were to build its own infrastructure?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, Sentosa Island brings back fond

memories  for many of us.  During our younger courting  days,

many  of  us spent happy hours there.  But I wonder how  many

Members here have recently been to Sentosa.  Sentosa is still

one  of the few popular places for recreation and sports  for

locals  and tourists.  But, sadly, I feel that the place  has

lost its novelty and attraction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish to urge the Minister to look into

spending  more  money to revive and improve Sentosa.   For  a

start,  the  existing  access and  transportation  should  be

improved.   The  monorail system there  is  very  slow,  old,

inefficient and it only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>

goes in one direction.  In fact, new attractions can be added

to  make the place more interesting.  Why not add some roller

coasters  or  more fun and interesting rides  to  thrill  the

visitors?   We should also encourage more outdoor  activities

there  like windsurfing, boating,  horse riding, kite  flying

and  so  on.   At present, the entrance fees to  the  various

attractions are too high and are a deterrent to visitors.   I

have  computed that the entrance fees to Sentosa and  to  all

the  attractions,  such  as  Fort Siloso,  Underwater  World,

Fantasy  Island  and so on, cost a total  of  $93.50  for  an

adult,  and  a total of $57 for a child.    It is not  cheap,

even by Singapore standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to make Sentosa vibrant and affordable, I would like

to  suggest  that  the Government should  treat  the  capital

expenditures  for  the infrastructure and the  facilities  at

Sentosa  as  grants  to  be provided for  the  recreation  of

Singaporeans.  Sentosa Development Corporation  (SDC)  should

be  required to recover only the operating cost.  This is the

same   principle  used  for  the  SMRT,  where  the   capital

expenditures for the fixed stocks and the rails  are  treated

as  Government infrastructural grants.  SMRT is only required

to  recover the operating cost.  Therefore, I would  like  to

urge  the  Minister to direct his officers to do a quick  and

comprehensive review of Sentosa.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

Sentosa  is  our  tourist  attraction.   Especially  in   the

evening,  it  is  very  beautiful.   It  has  all  kinds   of

recreational facilities for locals and tourists.  Recently, I

was  given an opportunity to visit Sentosa when I was invited

to  the  Beach volley ball and mini-golf tournament.   During

these  visits,  I  noticed that this place  of  interest  was

extremely quiet in the night, except that on occasions,  when

the Sentosa Development Corporation organised a foam dance or

a  concert  by  Taiwanese singer "Ah Mei".   I  encourage  my

grassroots  organisations to organise visits to Sentosa,  but

they told me that the admission fees are so high that it  put

them off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that if you go there by bus or on foot, you

have to pay $6 to enter.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>

if  you  drive  in, they charge you $10.  If there  are  five

people in the car, each person is charged just $2.  If you go

by  car, you pay $2 but if you walk in, you pay $6.  I  think

$6  is  too  high.  Admission charges should be  lowered  and

standardised.   Sentosa is part of Singapore.   All  citizens

should be entitled to go there at a nominal charge of $2  per

person.  Senior citizens should pay half price or even  free.

Then more people will be attracted to Sentosa for recreation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest that Sentosa should be

further  developed.  I agree with Mr Leong's suggestion  that

it  must  have  more facilities.  During the  weekend,  there

could  be  some pasar malam at the beach.  We can  also  have

hawker  stalls  to sell  local food like Malay satay,  Indian

roti prata and Chinese char kway teow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also invite cultural groups and all kinds of

local  performing  groups to perform their  arts,  so  as  to

attract  more  people to Sentosa, instead  of  going  to  the

neighbouring countries and subject themselves to the nuisance

of being caught in traffic jams.  Let us turn Sentosa into  a

Bali or Pattaya.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, I thank Members who have spoken on MTI's budget.

From  the issues raised and the suggestions made, it is clear

that all of us are seized by the challenges posed by the  new

economy.  To thrive in this new environment, we have to  ride

the wave of technopreneurship, strengthen our SMEs, help them

restructure,  develop  promising  emerging  industries,   and

ensure  that  we  remain cost competitive by  developing  new

capabilities  and  deregulating  the  key  services  sectors,

including utilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and ICT have changed the nature of

competition.   Start-ups which are small but nimble  can  now

compete  head-on with big and established companies and  win.

The   new  environment  is  a  great  threat  to  traditional

industries.   It also opens up all kinds of new and  exciting

opportunities.  As Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>

Inderjit  Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua pointed  out,  how  well

Singapore  thrives  in the future depends critically  on  how

well  we  are able to arouse a new spirit of entrepreneurship

amongst  Singaporeans, especially among  young  Singaporeans.

This requires changes at two levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a fundamental change of mindset in both the

public  and private sectors with regard to matters like  risk

taking, tolerance for failure and international benchmarking.

And  we must allow for some untidiness in our system so  that

there is room to make changes and innovate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the mindset change must lead to specific reviews

of  systems,  rules  and regulations,  so  that  we  do  not,

wittingly  or  unwittingly, impede  entrepreneurial  efforts.

All  of  us  have  heard  horror  stories  by  young  budding

entrepreneurs about the difficult problems they face, and  we

should  address that.  We have taken steps but, as  Mr  Leong

and  Mr Singh proposed, we must do more to free up the system

for initiative and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax system should also favour greater risk taking.

Start-ups find employee stock options (ESOP), which are given

in  lieu  of  cash  salaries, very helpful.   In  his  Budget

Speech,  the  Finance  Minister  has  announced  Government's

intention to enhance the tax treatment of ESOP.  My  Ministry

is working closely with the Ministry of Finance to announce a

revised scheme by the end of May.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Leong and Mr Singh have highlighted

the   importance   of  adequate  venture  funding   to   help

technopreneurs   succeed.    To   catalyse    such    venture

investments, NSTB launched the US$1 billion Technopreneurship

Investment Fund (TIF) and the Business Angel Fund last  year.

The  TIF  is managed by NSTB and GIC, which work with private

sector venture capitalists and business angels to coinvest in

promising  start-ups and venture funds.  And as Dr  Tony  Tan

announced  in San Francisco recently, more than half  of  the

fund  has  been  committed.  We will  review,  within  a  few

months, whether a second fund, or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>

some  other  initiatives,  will be  needed  to  continue  the

momentum that has been achieved so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong suggested the establishment of a third fund

which is wholly managed by the private sector.  In fact,  the

existing  funds  are  already invested  through  the  private

sector.  Each is, in fact, a "fund of funds".  Because we  do

not  have  the  expertise,  we  do  not  do  the  investments

ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Mr Singh that NSTB is recruiting experienced

and industry-savvy people into its ranks, and they have to be

incentivised appropriately, of course.  And this is a general

problem for officers who work in the statutory boards and the

civil  service  - how do we ensure that they are not just  on

fixed  salaries and their rewards are somehow tied  to  their

performance.  Otherwise, the regulator, looking at the people

he  regulates, will feel a certain envy that he is not on the

other  side.  So this imbalance must somehow be corrected  in

the  way  we remunerate the officers in the statutory  boards

and  in  the civil service in the future.  But it is  not  an

easy  problem.  We have got to do some hard thinking on  this

subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only succeed by being part of a global network.

We  must have good links with the critical high-tech nodes in

the  world  and  tap top global talent, the way  Mr  Inderjit

Singh  suggested.   Let me here assure  Mr  Thomas  that  the

Singapore   Government   and  its  agencies   encourage   our

businessmen  to be good corporate citizens in  the  countries

they operate.  We have a collective reputation to protect and

this collective reputation, which is a good reputation, is  a

common  asset  which we all have, particularly  when  we  are

overseas.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is a key resource in the new economy. We are

therefore   strengthening   our  entire   infrastructure   to

generate,  protect, manage and exploit intellectual property.

Singapore's legal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>

framework  for  intellectual  property  protection  has  been

ranked  highly by international agencies.  But as Mr Inderjit

Singh   suggested,  we  should  do  more  in  the  areas   of

intelligence  gathering and analysis,  licensing,  technology

transfer, valuation and management of IP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Science Hub, the geographical focal point of our

Technopreneurship 21 efforts is the Buona Vista area.  As Mrs

Lim  Hwee  Hua,  Mr  Leong Horn Kee  and  Mr  Inderjit  Singh

suggested,  we  want  the Science  Hub  to  be  a  hotbed  of

technopreneurial activities with offices and  watering  holes

for   inventors,  researchers,  investment  bankers,  venture

capitalists,  lawyers,  and  e-commerce  experts   to   meet,

exchange ideas, stimulate each other's thinking and to strike

deals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to incubators and offices, the Science Hub

will also have entertainment and residential facilities.   It

will  be  well  served  by  a  good  transportation   network

including  an  LRT line and all the bandwidth  which  may  be

needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many start-ups are already operating at the Science

Park.  More are moving into incubation units set up by JTC at

the   Ayer  Rajah  Industrial  Estate  which  is  within  the

vicinity.   To provide more space at low prices,  and  it  is

important  that  we  provide more space at  low  prices,  the

Government  will  renovate  existing buildings  such  as  the

unoccupied bungalows at Wessex Estate and Rochester Park.  We

will  consider renovating old buildings in the  area  in  the

nearby  army  camps  that  have  been  vacated  and  even  at

Alexandra Hospital when they move somewhere else, equip  them

with  broadband so that the technopreneurs can take up  space

cheaply and start business with low barriers to entry.  For a

quick  start,  we may even truck in porta-cabins  to  provide

additional  incubator  space. The Government  is  looking  at

different  management models for the Science  Hub.   We  will

establish a dedicated agency, which may be a statutory board,

to drive the long-term development of the Buona Vista Science

Hub.   Presently, the one-stop agency which  Mr  Ahmad  Magad

asked for is NSTB.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T21 Plan and its various programmes will help

prepare us for the New Economy.  The current dot.com boom  is

also helpful in the way it draws talent, resources and public

attention to this new sector.  But, as Mr Inderjit Singh  and

Dr  Toh  See Kiat cautioned,  we must also be aware that  the

boom which has spread from the US to our region is bubbly  in

character.   When  IPOs are hundreds of times  oversubscribed

just because they carry dot.com, we should worry.   This does

not  mean that we should discourage start-ups because of  the

high failure rates.   Although the risks are high, so too are

the rewards.  From a detached standpoint, bubbles perform  an

economic  function  by  the way they suck  technological  and

financial resources into new areas of growth.  Even when they

burst  after that, the transfer of resources is positive  for

the  long  term  growth of the economy.  The  lessons  learnt

through  failures help us to succeed in the future.  However,

one should not invest money or speculate in dot.com companies

thinking lightly that they are one-way sure-fire bets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the recent warnings by Mr Arthur

Levitt, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission

is  worth  repeating here.  He said "unless  investors  truly

understand  both  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  today's

market,  too  many  may  fall victim  to  their  own  wishful

thinking".  As in all investments, there is no substitute for

deep knowledge of the industry and careful assessment of  the

company  we  are  thinking  of  investing  in.   US  Treasury

Secretary  Larry  Summers put it very well recently  when  he

said that the New Economy must still be built on old virtues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another exciting growth sector, which Mr Inderjit Singh

touched  on,  is  the life sciences.  Advances  in  the  life

sciences  will  open up a whole new frontier  and  spawn  new

industries.   We must position ourselves for this  new  wave.

The  life  sciences is likely to become the fourth pillar  of

our  manufacturing sector, after electronics,  chemicals  and

engineering.   EDB will drive its development under  Industry

21, as will NSTB.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we recognised the potential of biotechnology

some  20  years  ago, Singapore is already a  pharmaceutical-manufacturing  hub  in  the  world.   Our  universities   and

research  institutes, especially the Institute for  Molecular

and Cell  Biology (IMCB), have made good progress in the life

sciences.   We also have excellent healthcare facilities  and

doctors.   Upon  this foundation, we hope to build  a  world-class hub for the life sciences, with capabilities in various

fields   including  basic  research,  manufacturing,  medical

engineering, regional headquarters functions and, of  course,

medical services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are lucky to have world experts helping us in IMCB.

IMCB's  original  godfather was Dr Sydney  Brenner,  a  South

African  Jew  of  Lithuanian  and  Latvian  extraction.    In

Cambridge, he achieved world fame working with Francis  Crick

who  won the Nobel Prize for the work on the double helix  of

the  DNA.  Dr Brenner himself discovered messenger-RNA  which

takes  the  code from the DNA and directs it to  the  protein

making  factories in the  body.  He made many other important

discoveries.   After  retiring from Cambridge,  he  moved  to

California,  teaching  at Berkeley and  San  Diego  where  he

helped  to  start many new companies which are now  household

names. One of them called Lynx, recently discovered a way  to

detect  defective genes found in some diseases.  As a  result

of  which  the company is now worth a fortune and Dr  Brenner

who  has  many  founder's shares in that  company,  has  come

across a large sum of money, a portion of which he intends to

establish a foundation. This is quite a feat for a retirement

job!  It is remarkable that what started as a retirement  job

should become such an exciting proposition.  Happily too,  we

have some investment in Lynx.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Dr Sydney Brenner, Dr David Baltimore,

another  Nobel  Laureate and President of  Caltech,  and  his

Chinese  wife,  Dr  Alice Huang, the  Chairperson  of  IMCB's

Scientific Board, have been absolutely wonderful in  the  way

they have supported IMCB and guided Dr Chris Tan and his team

in IMCB's work..  Today, IMCB is an internationally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>

renowned research institute because of their help.  Over  the

years,  Mr  Philip Yeo, who is the Chairman of EDB and  IMCB,

has  built close personal friendships with top men and  women

in  the life sciences in many countries. With their help,  we

will build up our capabilities in this most important field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the entire human genome will be mapped. This

is  an epochal event in history.  But there is still a lot of

work  to  be  done  to  research into the  genetic  variation

between human groups, between individuals, and between normal

human  beings  and  those who suffer from  cancer  and  other

genetic diseases.  We are well-placed in Singapore to do  our

share   in  Asian  genomics research because  of  our  ethnic

diversity  and  our excellent healthcare infrastructure.  Our

capabilities   in  information  technology   and   biomedical

engineeering are also a big plus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life sciences is a field that will open up new and

exciting  opportunities not only for our  doctors  and  life-sciences   professionals,  but   also   for   investors   and

entrepreneurs.   To  move ahead, we will have  to  strengthen

further our research capabilities, integrate better the  work

in   the  research  institutes  and  hospitals,  and  promote

investment  and  entrepreneurship  across  the  entire   life

sciences sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked about the promotion of

environment-related industries in Singapore.  In  fact,  this

is  being  done  by  EDB.   We  promote  the  entire  cluster

including  incineration facilities, waste recycling,  systems

manufacturing,    water   systems,   engineering    services,

consultancy and R&D.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve our capabilities, we have been supporting R&D

in  some  aspects of environmental technology.  We  encourage

foreign companies to form partnerships or joint ventures with

local  firms.  The Ministry of the Environment also plays  an

active  role  in  promoting Singapore as a regional  hub  for

environment-related industries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the

cost  competitiveness  of  the  manufacturing  sector.    The

fundamental  need here is to remain cost competitive  in  the

New  Economy.  Besides ensuring that our wage growth does not

exceed  productivity growth, we need to keep  other  business

costs  low,  including  electricity,  gas,  water  and   port

charges.  The  best  way  is  to introduce  more  competition

wherever  possible.  This will also achieve the international

benchmarking which Mr Ahmad Magad proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Leong Horn Kee argued that

we should open up the electricity and gas markets, allow more

players  in,  in  order to bring prices down.   Part  of  the

increases,  which  are because of the  recent  rises  in  oil

prices,  cannot  be helped.  But whatever the  level  of  oil

prices,  we  should be as efficient as possible. Three  weeks

ago,  I  informed  this  House that  we  would  open  up  the

electricity  and  gas markets to competition.    The  details

will be released today.  Let me here give the highlights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Government decided that the electricity

market  should be restructured from a state monopoly  into  a

competitive regime.  The question was the scope and  pace  of

deregulation.  We were then among the pioneers in  the  world

and  we decided that because of the complexity we should move

cautiously in an evolutionary way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, many more countries have deregulated their

electricity  industries, resulting in lower  prices,  greater

product  innovation, and better services for  consumers.   We

have  now fallen behind because of our more cautious approach

and must therefore move decisively again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors have also complained that our market rules

lack clarity with PUB as regulator having to intervene in the

market too often.  Retail competition, although allowed,  has

not  happened.  EDB has received feedback from some MNCs that

our  electricity  tariffs have become  less  competitive  and

reduced our overall competitiveness in their eyes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI therefore initiated a major study last year together

with Temasek Holdings. The key objective was to implement  an

electricity  market structure and regulatory  framework  that

will  support  a  competitive industry  in  Singapore,  while

ensuring  that  reliability  and every  security  are  looked

after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiences in the last five years and the

significant improvements made by Singapore Power  have  given

us  confidence to press on with further deregulation in order

to  derive  the  full benefits of competition.  Specifically,

this  requires,  at  its  core, a  clear  separation  at  the

ownership  level of the contestable parts of the market  from

the monopoly parts of the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grid, which is a natural monopoly, should not be

owned  by the same company that owns generation companies  or

retail companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we informed this House that Singapore Power

will  divest  its ownership of its generation  companies  and

transfer  them  to Temasek Holdings by April 2001.   We  will

press  on  with this decision and go further.   Temasek  will

divest  all  three generation companies.  There  will  be  no

foreign  ownership  limit.    We have  decided  to  lift  the

restriction on foreign ownership to increase competition  and

raise  our standards to international levels. Energy security

will not be a problem because foreign owners cannot walk away

with  their  power plants.  In an emergency, the workers  are

still here.   There are Singaporeans to operate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three existing gencos and the new co-generator on

Jurong  Island will support a competitive market and lead  to

lower wholesale electricity prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked about price stability in the

transitional period.  During the transition, we will  put  in

place measures such as vesting contracts to prevent excessive

volatility in pool prices while allowing the market  to  find

its own level.  As for the question on security of supply, we

will first rely on a well designed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>

market which allows price signals to flow through.  PUB  will

play  a  watchdog  role to ensure that  there  is  sufficient

capacity planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity retail sector is also contestable. But

to-date,    PowerSupply,   which   is   wholly    owned    by

SingaporePower, is the only retailer in the market.  This  is

not  desirable. Retail competition is important as it enables

the  benefits of competition upstream to flow through to  the

end  consumers.   Retail competition will  also  bring  about

greater  choice.  In New Zealand today, an ordinary household

has more than a dozen companies to choose from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring about retail competition, we need to provide

first  a level playing field for new entrants into the retail

segment.   Singapore Power will therefore divest  the  retail

business  of  PowerSupply from 1st April  2001.    This  will

separate the ownership of the retail business from PowerGrid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these and other measures, we can look forward to

full  retail competition for large industrial and  commercial

consumers  from April 2001.  Retail competition  for  smaller

customers  and households will take longer and is not  likely

to  take place before year 2002 because a detailed study must

first be done.  Once it is done, we expect domestic consumers

to  enjoy  lower  charges and a wider range of  services.   I

assure Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that we will pay particular attention

to the impact of these changes on households.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim has asked about PowerGrid. Unlike the

generation   and   retail  sectors,  the   transmission   and

distribution  network  is a natural  monopoly.   It  will  be

neither  practical nor cost-effective to have competing  grid

companies  duplicating power lines on our small  island.  The

grid   will  therefore  be  tightly  regulated.   Performance

standards  will be set and PowerGrid will be incentivised  to

improve  efficiency  further.  The system operating  function

would be taken out of PowerGrid and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>

put  directly under PUB.  This will assure investors of  fair

play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move to changes in the gas sector. The gas

industry  will be restructured in a similar way by separating

the  ownership of the gas transportation network, which is  a

natural monopoly, from the contestable sectors of gas import,

trading and retailing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire gas distribution and transmission network

will  be owned by a gas grid company which will allow players

open  and non-discriminatory access to the network.  SembCorp

Gas will have to give up its business of transporting gas  if

it  stays  in  the  contestable  business  of  importing  and

retailing gas to large users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP has indicated that PowerGas prefers to stay in the

gas transport business, and this would mean that SembCorp Gas

will have to get out of it.  The gas grid and the electricity

grid, which are both natural monopolies, can then be owned by

Singapore  Power.   Although the privatisation  of  Singapore

Power will be slightly delayed, we still hope to carry it out

by  the end of 2001 or early 2002.  After this restructuring,

Singapore Power will be the power and gas network provider in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes that I have outlined today are substantial.

Implementing them will take about 15 months or so.  In making

the  changes,  we must be fair to Singapore Power  staff  who

support privatisation and have been gearing themselves up for

increased competition.  I met Singapore Power management  and

key  union  leaders of UPAGE two days ago.  They had  earlier

been  briefed of the changes that we are going to make.  They

gave  me  many useful comments and suggestions which  I  have

incorporated  into my statement to you today.   I  understand

the  difficulty  which the union leaders face explaining  yet

more  changes  in  the  industry to  Singapore  Power  staff.

Without  the  understanding and support  of  Singapore  Power

management and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>

the  union  leaders,  the process of  restructuring  will  be

slower and much more complicated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh commented on power dips. Although

power  dips occur in all systems, the five dips that  we  had

last  October  were not at all acceptable  to  us,  and  many

companies  involved  suffered great  losses.   In  Singapore,

where the grid is buried, we should be much less affected  by

such  disruptions.  In the past, our cables were occasionally

damaged  by construction contractors against which  our  laws

were  amended last year to provide stiffer penalties.   While

we  cannot prevent power dips completely, we must work harder

to reduce them.  All parties which are responsible must exert

themselves in this direction.  PUB is also working  with  EDB

and  PowerGrid to provide premium quality power for customers

who  need  very high reliability, like those in the  chemical

industry and in wafer fabs.  These customers will, of course,

have to bear part of the additional cost incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh and Mr Ahmad Magad spoke on the important

subject  of water.  Let me assure Members  that, one  way  or

another,  we will ensure that there is adequate water  supply

in  Singapore  for all our needs.  PUB's demand forecast  has

factored  in  the requirements of all future users  including

wafer fab, chemical and petrochemical plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, technological advancement is working in our

favour.   We  are  surrounded by the  sea  and  desalination,

although  expensive,  is  already  affordable.   Desalination

technology   is  advancing  rapidly  and  likely   to   bring

desalination  cost  down  in  the  future.   We  are  closely

monitoring developments and looking into doing some  research

ourselves in our universities on the desalination of tropical

water where it is warmer and has biological content.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had earlier announced our intention to build a 30

million  gallon per day (mgd) desalination plant by the  year

2005.  Based on the advice of its consultants, PUB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>

wanted  this  first  plant to adopt Multi-Stage  Flash  (MSF)

distillation  technology.  This is a track proven  technology

which has been used extensively in desert countries to supply

large quantities of fresh water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, recent experiences in the US and Europe show

that  other  technologies such as Reverse  Osmosis  (RO)  and

Multi-Effect  Distillation (MED) are  becoming  significantly

cheaper.   For  example, using the RO process, the  price  of

recently contracted water has come down to between $0.84  and

$1.20  per cubic metre, compared to about $2 per cubic  metre

using  Multi-Stage Flash distillation.  As MSF may no  longer

be  the  most  cost effective solution, we  have  decided  to

change  our  original  decision  and  leave  the  choice   of

technology for the new desalination plant open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completely agree with Mr Leong and Mr Ahmad Magad

that  the private sector should participate in the supply  of

desalinated  water.  Instead of PUB building and running  all

the  desalination capacity, it will commit to buy  a  minimum

quantity  of desalinated water for a minimum period of  time.

The  private  sector will then be invited to  bid  for  these

supply  contracts.  It is then up to the tenderers to  choose

the  best  technology and the optimum plant size to meet  our

requirement.  PUB will then choose the best option or options

from  the bids received.  In this way, we lower the  cost  of

consumers and access a wider range of technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is looking into the operational details and will

call for tenders early next year for the delivery of about 20

mgd  of  water  by  the year 2005.  At  the  same  time,  the

Government will own and operate a smaller desalination  plant

of  about  10  mgd,  for  PUB to understand  more  fully  the

technology  to go into its operations in-depth  and  to  gain

operating experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we continue to explore alternative sources

of  water, we must not let up our water conservation efforts,

a point which Mr Leong made.  Large users

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>

must  be  encouraged  to  recycle  water  where  economically

feasible.   Where appropriate, we encourage the  substitution

of  potable water by non-potable water.  Industrial water  is

currently  used  widely in Jurong and Tuas.   To  extend  its

usage,  industrial  water  pipes were  recently  extended  to

Jurong  Island  and will be extended to Tuas  View  Extension

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua raised a point on Jurong Port, which is

our  major  port  for bulk and conventional cargo.   It  also

handles  some  containerised cargo.   Jurong  Port  has  been

upgrading its facilities to serve better the increasing needs

of  companies in Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong Island  and

Tuas.   Jurong  Port will install container  quay  cranes  to

increase its productivity and provide better service  to  its

customers.  However, Jurong Port does not intend to  go  into

the  container transshipment business.  This is best left  to

PSA  which also faces fierce competition from other ports  in

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will corporatise Jurong Port by the first quarter of

next  year.   As  Mrs  Lim  pointed out,  Jurong  Port  as  a

corporatised entity will be better able to respond swiftly to

market trends and customers' needs.  JTC can then concentrate

on  its  core  business  of providing world-class  industrial

facilities  and providing innovative business  solutions  for

the  new  economy.   Corporatisation will  also  ensure  that

Jurong  Port does not receive any hidden subsidy from JTC  in

competing with PSA for the domestic container business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann and Prof. Toh See Kiat spoke on the need

for  anti-trust laws.  This is a complex subject about  which

there  is  no  agreement even among advanced economies.   The

issue of cross-border monopoly is a very difficult one.   The

US  acts  under  Sherman and MaClaren, but it does  not  want

others to have similar acts.  The US operates a unique regime

because  of  its size and historical distrust of  government.

The  EU  adopts a different approach.  As a city  state,  the

best way for us to curb monopolies is to open our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>

doors  to  trade in both the goods and services sectors.   We

are  not likely to need a comprehensive anti-trust law as  in

the US.  But we will study how legislation can be improved to

enhance  competition, which was a point made by Dr Lily  Neo.

We  will progressively amend our laws and regulations to open

up as many sectors to competition as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fair trading legislation, I leave it to Mr Tang

Guan Seng to reply later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked the Government to put up more

economic   statistics  on  Singapore  and  the  international

economy  in  a  timely  way.   Our Department  of  Statistics

consults  frequently  with industry players,  academics,  and

investment analysts.  We welcome suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On services, we have put on more data since last year.

On  GNP data, I am happy to announce that we will release  it

on a quarterly basis from the first quarter of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now leave the other replies to my Minister

of State and my Senior Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have two cuts. May I get on

with these so that the Minister can reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have to come back after Mr Lim has

finished, if there is time.  Mr Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I would like to start with the two cuts on

industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh suggested

intensifying our land use to cut business cost and  the  need

to  keep  land cost for manufacturing competitive.  We  agree

with them.  JTC has extended rental rebate to the end of this

year  and  will  pass on the property tax  savings  to  their

tenants.  But our land cost cannot be as low as those of  our

competitors simply

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>

because land is scarce here in Singapore.  Therefore, we need

to intensify our land use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current efforts today include introducing innovative

design  such as multi-storey factories, integrating  suitable

non-industrial  use with industrial development  in  vertical

mix-use development, and developing industrial buildings over

MRT  depots and sewerage treatment plants.  I am also pleased

to share with the House that we are looking into lowering the

differential  premium (DP) for industrial land  to  encourage

industrialists to build higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides building higher, we also need to build

better.  Our industrial landscape will have to keep pace with

the  needs  of the new economy.  To cater to the requirements

of  the knowledge workers and knowledge-driven industries, we

have  to  incorporate innovative design and features  in  our

industrial  facilities.  Since 1996, new and refurbished  JTC

industrial  buildings are fully ready for  broadband  access.

JTC is now going one step further by working with the service

providers  to  bring  broadband  services  content   to   new

development in the Science Park, Business Park and Ayer Rajah

Technopreneurs  Centre.  In Paya Lebar  and  Senoko,  JTC  is

experimenting with a new kind of industrial park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will adopt the community-based approach in the

planning and development. This new industrial park will be  a

place where tenants can seek and congregate for not only good

jobs  but  also  quality  housing,  active  liftestyle  in  a

congenial  work  environment.   This  will  bring   about   a

transformation in Singapore's industrial landscape,  offering

enhanced  quality  of  life to both  the  local  and  foreign

talents, thereby strengthening Singapore's competitiveness as

a KBE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the cuts relating to the SMEs. Mr

Tay  Beng Chuan is concerned that Government support  may  be

targeted  at successful local enterprises to the  neglect  of

the broad-based SMEs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government offers a broad range of assistance

schemes to meet the needs of our SMEs.  Last year, more  than

2,000 SMEs were awarded a total of $42 million worth of LETAS

grant  to  upgrade their systems and processes.  90%  of  the

grants  went  to SMEs with less than 50 employees.   We  also

approved a total of $340 million worth of LEF loans to  about

1,000  SMEs.  Again, 90% of the loans went to SMEs with  less

than  50  employees.   If   we take into  consideration  non-financial assistance programmes offered by the PSB, the total

number  of SMEs assisted came to more than 5,000 in 1999.   I

would  like  to  assure Mr Tay that the Government  has  been

providing  assistance  to  a broad  base  of  SMEs  and  will

continue to do so under the SME 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global economy is going through the e-revolution

driven  by  the rapid penetration of Internet  all  over  the

world.   Several MPs, including Mr Inderjit Singh,  Mr  Ahmad

Magad,  Mr  Zulkifli, have expressed their concern that  many

SMEs have yet to embrace Internet and pursue e-commerce as  a

business strategy.  Sir, I share their concern.  We  need  to

help as many of our SMEs as possible to be e-ready as quickly

as  possible.  On their own, we recognise that  many  of  our

SMEs  do  not have the resources and the expertise to  be  e-ready.   PSB  and  IDA  are working  together  to  help  them

overcome these obstacles.  Mr Ahmad Magad suggested that  the

Government  should  offer financial assistance  to  SMEs  and

promote the adoption of locally available portals.  These are

good ideas and I agree with them.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are taking steps to promote the development of

vertical,  horizontal, corporate and SME portals in Singapore

and  these portals will have regional and global connections.

These  will  make it easier for SMEs to integrate  themselves

into  the  business value chain of various business  sectors,

making  it  easier  for  them  to  carry  out  B2B  and   B2C

transactions in our local cyberspace, regional cyberspace  as

well  as the global cyberspace.  We are also helping our SMEs

to learn to exploit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>

the  full potential of e-commerce in their businesses.   SMEs

can  now obtain up to 70% of funding support from the PSB for

their  feasibility  studies  and consultancy  services.   For

those SMEs which are ready to implement e-commerce under  the

Local  Enterprise  Computerisation Programme  (LECP)  for  e-commerce,  jointly  managed by the PSB  and  IDA,   SMEs  can

obtain  a  grant  of up to 50% of the cost of the  e-commerce

project,  subject to a ceiling of $20,000.  Today, more  than

300 grants, amounting to $4.5 million, had been granted.  Our

target on the whole is to help 25,000 SMEs to be e-ready over

the next five years.  This is an ambitious undertaking and we

have just started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our SMEs have the potential to grow into

world-class  companies and global players  in  the  KBE.   Mr

Leong  Horn Kee, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Zulkifli and Mr  Ahmad

Magad  have highlighted the need for Government to  help  our

promising local enterprises (PLEs) and promising SMEs (PSMEs)

develop into global players.  Some Members suggested that our

SMEs  could  overcome the limitation of  small  size  through

consolidation and partnership.  I agree with them.  Under the

PSB's   Business  Connect  programme,  we  organise  business

missions  for our SMEs to meet up with potential partners  in

countries  like Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and  France.

So  far, about 3,000 SMEs have participated and more than 800

joint  ventures  have  come out from these  trips.   We  will

continue to facilitate such cross-border partnerships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh is concerned that our PLEs' selection

criteria may be outdated.  Sir, the existing list of criteria

is  both quantitative and qualitative, covering areas such as

capabilities and innovation, professional management,  market

potential  and  international  orientation.   I  think  these

criteria  are broad enough and are necessary for  success  in

the global environment.  However, I do agree with Mr Inderjit

Singh  that we have to be mindful that the world is  changing

very rapidly.  Our economic agencies are doing their best  to

look  ahead  and  be as responsive as we can to  this  global

trend.  Even so, there could be times when we are behind

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>

the  market.  What is important is for us to know when we are

behind and be able to respond quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the part of the SMEs, they can help us to

transform  the  identification  of  the  PLEs  into  a  self-nominated  and self-selection process.  SMEs that believe  in

their   potential  could  present  themselves  to   PSB   for

assistance  under the promising SME programme.  Others  could

approach  the EDB under the PLE programme without waiting  to

be  spotted.  Likewise, innovative start-ups can  go  to  the

NSTB  for  incubation assistance or venture  financing.   The

role  of  the  economic  agencies is to  offer  developmental

support  to  as  many promising and deserving  companies  and

projects as possible.  It is then up to the companies to pass

the market test, succeed and become global players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh felt that we have not been able to

find  the  right  formula  to help SMEs  to  be  world  class

players.   I agree that we are not prefect.  But I think  the

Member  will  agree that we are making some good progress  as

well.   In  1995, EDB set targets to nurture  100  PLEs  with

annual turnover of $100 million in 10 years.  I am pleased to

report  to this House that, by the end of 1999, 45 PLEs  have

achieved  the  annual  turnover  target  of  more  than  $100

million, up from 31 in 1998.  Last year, 23 PLEs made  it  to

the   Business  Times  Enterprise  50  Awards.    There   are

altogether  350 PLEs now being nurtured by the EDB.   And  we

expect  the  list to grow further.  As for the promising  SME

programme managed  by the PSB, there are now 786 SMEs on  the

list  and 16 of them have made it to the Enterprise  50  list

since  1996.   So  on  the whole, we are  encouraged  by  the

progress of the PSME and the PLE programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we liberalise our markets and transit into the

KBE,  we  will  need  to  speed  up  the  transformation  and

redevelopment   of  some  of  the  traditional   sectors   in

Singapore.  Our  immediate focus is to upgrade  two  domestic

services  sectors  with  persistently low  productivity,  the

retail sector and the construction sector.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked how can economic agencies reach

out  to  the  non-English speaking SMEs as well  as  the  job

placement and retraining of redundant workers.  Sir, take the

retail  sector, for example, it is highly fragmented  due  to

the  low  barrier of entry.  Our retail density is among  the

highest in Asia and, yet, its productivity level is less than

half of the national average.  PSB will work closely with the

Shopkeepers'  Association to reach out to neighbourhood  shop

owners  and  operators, including those who  are  non-English

speaking  to restructure and double the productivity  of  the

industry.  We will support retraining of workers through  the

SRP  and the SDF.  We are also working with the HDB to reduce

the  retail  space  in those neighbourhoods  where  there  is

access by allowing for alternate use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in launching SME 21 early this year, our collective

vision  in  the  private and public sectors is  to  create  a

vibrant   and   resilient  SME  sector  that  would   enhance

Singapore's competitiveness and the economic growth.  Several

MPs  have raised concerns about the implementation of SME 21.

Mr  Inderjit Singh suggested spinning off part of PSB into  a

consortium jointly managed by the private and public sectors.

Mr Tay Beng Chuan is concerned that we may pay more attention

to  MNCs  and large local enterprises and neglect  the  large

number  of  SMEs.  Sir, we recognise that it is not  possible

for  PSB  alone  to  reach out to all  the  100,000  SMEs  in

Singapore.  It is never our intention to go it alone.  At the

launch  of the SME 21, we invited business organisations  and

private  sector organisations to come forward  with  specific

ideas  and  initiatives.  We hope industry associations  will

play  an  active role in helping our SMEs realise their  full

potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to say that some industry associations have

already  been appointed approved-in-principle (AIP)  agencies

for  PSB's  grant scheme, LETAS.  This includes the Singapore

National   Employers'  Federation.   We   look   forward   to

appointing more AIP agencies in the private sector.  The role

of  PSB  as  an  economic agency is to  provide  the  overall

coordination and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>

keep  track  of  the  Board's  main  interest  of  the  SMEs,

including those SMEs without any strong industry association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked about funding for SME 21. Sir,

SME  21  programmes will be funded under existing  grant  and

loan  schemes.  For this year, we have set aside $500 million

for  LEFS  loan scheme and $35 million for LETAS grant.   The

Government  will  continue to assess the situation.   As  and

when   needed,  additional  developmental  funding  will   be

launched.   The  recent  launch of a $20  million  Industrial

Productivity Fund (IPF) is a case in point.  In  response  to

the  comment  by  Mr Tay, our Ministry would suggest  to  the

Ministry  of  Finance  to consider grouping  all  SME-related

fundings into an SME account in future years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng):</b> Sir, let me reply to

the  two  remaining  subjects raised by MPs.   They  are  the

development of Sentosa and consumer protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on Sentosa. Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Ang Mong

Seng  have  made  a  number  of suggestions  to  improve  the

attractiveness of Sentosa.  The Government has been  a  great

supporter  of  Sentosa.   Since  1972,  the  Government   has

invested about $300 million on Sentosa for infrastructure and

attraction development, and vested the entire island  to  the

Sentosa  Development Corporation.  I would like to inform  Mr

Leong  that they are getting as good a deal as SMRT.   It  is

now  up  to Sentosa to further exploit its assets to  improve

the quality of life for Singaporeans, besides being a tourist

paradise.   Sentosa  can  be our special  resort  island  for

Singaporean families to enjoy both in the day and  at  night.

It  can also be an exciting place for our tourists.  In fact,

Sentosa  is  already the most popular tourist destination  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it even more attractive, we will be introducing

a  number of major changes.  Let me elaborate.  Sir, we  will

build  a $140 million people mover system to link Sentosa  to

the  North-East MRT line at the World Trade Centre.  This bi-directional system, which is like an LRT,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>

will  replace  the  existing monorail.   It  has  double  the

capacity.  With faster and more trains, waiting time would be

much  shorter.   The  system will be  partly  funded  by  the

Government.    Tenders  for  the  system  has  been   called,

construction  will begin by early 2001.  And  we  expect  the

system  to  be  running  by  end 2002  to  tie  in  with  the

completion  of the MRT North-East line.  The new system  will

offer visitors a seamless journey via MRT, from their home to

Sentosa.   So  it  is very convenient and this  will  enhance

access to Sentosa in a significant way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng has suggested that the admission

charges to Sentosa should be reduced.  I would like to inform

the   House  that  we  will  be  cutting  admission   charges

significantly  to  make  them  as  affordable  as   possible,

especially  for  repeat  visitors.   There  will  be  special

discount  schemes for NTUC union members, reservists,  school

children and retirees.  Sentosa will announce the details  in

due  course.   The objective is to have as many  Singaporeans

visit Sentosa as frequently as they wish, whether in the  day

or at night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to attractions on Sentosa, visitors

will soon be able to enjoy the upgraded musical fountain  and

the dolphin shows.  Sentosa is also considering introducing a

hawker  stall  bazaar and an artist village to add  life  and

vibrancy  to  the island.  The new upgraded musical  fountain

and  cabaret  shows  at the Fantasy Island  will  anchor  our

efforts to promote Sentosa as a popular night destination for

food,  drinks, entertainment and parties.  With more visitors

to  the  island,  the  existing attractions  will  also  have

greater commercial incentives to be upgraded.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will launch the land sale for Sentosa Cove later this

year.   When  fully  developed,  this  integrated  waterfront

leisure  and  residential development  will  bring  a  unique

lifestyle to Sentosa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we are moving Sentosa into its next phase of

development.  We will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>

building  on its sound foundation. Singaporeans and  tourists

can  look  forward  to exciting changes ahead.   The  Sentosa

Development  Corporation will actively solicit  feedback  and

suggestions  from locals and foreigners and from  experts  in

this field to help it refine its strategy.  To this end,  SDC

will set up an International Advisory Council to tap on fresh

ideas to make Sentosa even more attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to talk about the issue of

consumer  protection which was raised by Prof. Toh See  Kiat,

Mr  Thomas  Thomas,  Dr  Neo and Mr Sin  Boon  Ann.  Consumer

protection  issues have been raised in this House many  times

before.  Some cases are so bad, they lead rightly  to  public

indignation  and calls for legislation to prevent  them  from

happening  again.   However, I must point out  that  consumer

protection  issues cover a wide range and  the  responses  to

each  of  them  cannot be the same.  For issues that  concern

public  health  and  safety, or fraud,  the  Government  will

tackle   them   robustly.   We  believe  that  the   existing

legislation is largely adequate for this purpose.  But  where

necessary, the Government will amend our existing legislation

to take such fraudulent acts to task.  In this regard, MTI is

finalising  the  amendments to the Commodity Futures  Act  to

tackle  the  problem of bucket shops.  This  is  the  problem

raised by Members in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested by Prof. Toh, my Ministry is also working

with  the  Ministry  of Finance on amending  the  Multi-Level

Marketing Act to prevent recurrence of cases similar to  S888

in  future.  We  will take CASE's point into account  in  our

work.   In  this connection, let me take this opportunity  to

commend CASE for its vigilance in alerting the Government  to

the  S888  problem  before  it grew  out  of  control.   CASE

steadfastly  stood  its  ground  that  such  activities  were

against  the  welfare of consumers and, as a result,  pricked

the balloon early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all consumer protection cases involve fraud.

The  majority of cases involve acts of mischief  by  traders,

like the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>

"switch-and-bait" or "third line enforcing" as  mentioned  by

Dr  Neo.  In these cases, consumers may walk out of the  shop

feeling  cheated. The question then is whether it  is  indeed

possible  for  the Government to prevent or stamp  out  every

such act of mischief, or even criminalise them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful not to over-regulate. Every single

regulation  comes  with  a cost to business.  The  additional

business  cost  is  eventually borne by  consumers.  We  must

therefore weigh the pros and cons carefully. For example,  we

do  not require the same degree of labelling for clothing  in

Singapore  as  in the United States.  It is easy  for  us  to

impose  the  same requirements, but the result  will  deprive

Singaporeans of cheap clothing from China and elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to better consumer protection is to promote

competition  in the marketplace, and this is very  important.

The  power  of choice is the best check against unfair  trade

practices. We must maintain a free and open economy  so  that

there  are  no barriers to the flow of goods and services  in

and  out  of Singapore. This allows consumers, retailers  and

manufacturers to source for products and raw materials at the

most competitive prices, locally and from abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers must also be alert themselves. In response to

Mr  Sin  Boon Ann's concern, I would say that the  Government

cannot watch over every foreign property sale. Consumers have

to  be careful and not go into a contract blindly. But on the

Government's  part, what we can do is to work  with  CASE  to

improve  our  efforts in educating consumers  and  disclosing

more  information, so that consumers can make more discerning

choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members also commented on the cartel-like behaviour

in  certain  sectors.  I think one common complaint  was  the

uniformity  of  petrol  prices  in  Singapore.  We  will  not

hesitate  to take action should we find evidence of collusion

to  fix price. However, we must remember that price stability

by  itself  is  not proof of collusion.  It is well-known  in

economics  that  oligopolistic  pricing  tends  to  oscillate

between

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>

high stability and price wars.  This is commonly observed  in

industries  like air travel, commodity chemicals  and  petrol

retailing.   For a long time there will be no price  changes,

then one player will break ranks to increase market share and

the  result  is price war which sometimes takes the  form  of

gifts or discounts.  The best way for us to stop monopolistic

behaviour is to let in the fresh air of competition.  One way

to  prevent  such monopolies is to allow parallel imports  of

items like motorcars. Another way is to let in more suppliers

like allowing fleet operators to supply petrol and diesel  to

their  own fleet. We will continue to explore other  ways  to

promote competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas suggested that the Government enact a Fair

Trading  Act. As Prof. Toh mentioned yesterday, CASE will  be

putting  up  a  proposal for such an Act for  Singapore.   My

Ministry  will  study  CASE's  proposal  when  it  is  ready.

However,  we  must  bear  in mind the  principle  of  minimal

intervention in the market and caveat emptor.  If we are  not

careful,   the   so-called  fair  trading   regulations   can

strengthen  the market power of some players in  the  market.

In  many  professional  fields, regulations  which  claim  to

protect  consumers  may  end up protecting  existing  players

against new competition.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to applaud

the Senior Parliamentary Secretary on the Ministry's stand on

the  three  points  that Mr Tang has  mentioned.   First,  to

concentrate  consumer  protection  on  deception  and  fraud.

Second,  to  promote competition and competition  will  lower

prices  and benefit the consumers. Third, the consumer should

be  given a choice. Sir, I do believe all these are fair  and

correct  but one of the things in the Fair Trading  Act  that

CASE  would  want  to  promote is a  legislation  that  would

concentrate on these points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there are a lot of areas of deception which are

not  covered  by current law.  Secondly, competition  can  be

deviated  from by very, very careful tricks which I mentioned

yesterday.   Thirdly, the power of choice really  depends  on

informed choice and there are no laws that prevent, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>

example, as in one situation, a house being sold in Australia

with  a  picture of it right next to the Sydney Opera  House.

That  is  a  deception but there was nothing mentioned  which

current law could have taken action on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to

just  make a few comments.  I would like to thank the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary for giving us a  good  reply  to  my

request for improving Sentosa.  In fact, I think this is  the

fastest response I have ever come across in the Committee  of

Supply.   A large $140 million will be given out straightaway

after  a request has been made.  On this point, I would  like

to  ask  the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether this  new

MRT  link will link up with the Sentosa Cove which is the new

residential area in Sentosa.  I would also like to thank  him

for the reduction in the entrance fee to Sentosa. How about a

reduction  in  entrance  fees to  the  other  attractions  in

Sentosa as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is to ask the Minister himself. I did

raise   a   suggestion  about  pioneer  status  for  start-up

companies.   Could he comment on the proposal of giving  some

pioneer status to start-up companies?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has missed my point. I am not  asking

the  Government to be watching over every property  purchased

in  Singapore.   What I asked for is a framework  legislation

that will require greater disclosure and strengthening of the

legislation  to allow enforcement of rights in Singapore.   I

hope  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary can respond  to  my

query.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you for

allowing me to ask my questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have not much time left. Can you ask

your questions straightaway?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I would like to ask the

Minister about the PUB deposits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>

I  believe that there must be at least a few hundred  million

dollars  worth  of  deposits held by PUB, and  now  Singapore

Power. What is the amount of money held by Singapore Power as

deposits?  Is  Singapore Power willing  to  pay  interest  to

consumers on those deposits, and whether Power Supply  treats

the  deposits  as part of their assets?  Also,  is  Singapore

Power  willing to reduce the amount of deposits to  customers

who have not defaulted on their monthly bills for the last 10

years by the interest they would have earned based on 3%  per

annum?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, for efficiency, I would

take  the whole lot of additional questions. Prof. Toh  asked

about  the house in Australia next to the Sydney Opera House.

I do not think we can protect against the gullibility of such

consumers.   You buy a house, you part with vast  amounts  of

money,  I think it is incumbent upon you to do due diligence,

by  talking to people who know property in Australia and  not

just rely upon the beautiful glossy advertisement.  I do  not

think  it  is  possible  for  us to  legislate  against  such

foolishness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about the possibility of amending

the  law  to  provide a framework for better disclosure.   On

that, we will raise the matter with the Finance  Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked whether the people mover system

in  Sentosa will be extended to Sentosa Cove. Right  now,  it

does  not appear possible because it is still a long distance

from  the main beach, pass Beaufort to Sentosa Cove, and  may

not  be cost-effective. However, we are taking a closer  look

at  that  because  if  we intend to do  so,  then  we  should

announce it before we have a public auction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong asked about his proposal yesterday for pioneer

status  for start-ups. He acknowledged that the tax  benefits

are  unimportant because these start-ups are  not  likely  to

earn  money  in  the  first  years  but  he  wanted  it   for

recognition purposes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>

We are looking at that.  I will put it to NSTB, which will be

giving  an  award  called  the  "Phoenix  Award"  for   those

companies  which have failed before and have risen  from  the

ashes  to  succeed.  We will find some other ways  to  extend

public recognition for those who put in good efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong asked about PUB deposits. Once the

retail  business  is privatised, then the  issue  of  whether

deposits  are  required  will be left  to  the  retailers  to

decide.  It is a risk that they may take versus the  customer

goodwill  that  they hope to gain. As for past  deposits  and

whether interest should be paid, that is part of the bargain.

The  result  has been lower electricity charges which  would,

otherwise,  be  the  case.   If  Singapore  Power  had  given

interest, then it would have to balance its books by charging

higher  prices.  But this problem will solve itself  once  we

privatise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have one minute left. Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Minister

touched  upon the privatisation of Singapore Power  and  said

that it has been slower than expected.  I thought one of  the

stumbling  blocks  was the valuation of  land  on  which  the

generation  plant  was sited.  In the  next  move,  will  the

Minister  review this perception and how the land  is  to  be

evaluated?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, that is not the key

issue.  There are existing procedures for valuing land.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Minister,

the  Minister of State and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

for their excellent replies.  May I beg leave to withdraw  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour market is changing more rapidly than

most workers realise.  Advances in technology, especially  in

IT and communications, are already revolutionising the way we

work   and  the  way  business  is  done.   Many  traditional

occupations  that  older Singaporeans were trained  for  when

they commenced employment may become extinct in the knowledge-based  economy.   Also,  in  an era  of  globalisation  where

capital and production can move rapidly to virtually any part

of  the  world,  our workers must be able to hold  their  own

against  the  best  and the cheapest in  the  world.   It  is

therefore  vital that our workforce be trained  and  equipped

with  skills  and knowledge that will enable them  to  remain

competitive in this new environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers are unaware of current trends in the labour

market  that  may have serious consequences on their  current

employment  and  future employability.  Even as  the  economy

recovers  and  more and more jobs are created,  many  workers

learn about KBE and structural unemployment the hard way when

they  face  retrenchment, as their skills become outdated  or

when  they are no longer competitive.  Some still do not know

what  hit  them,  as factories closed down  or  relocated  to

countries with cheaper labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new jobs that are being created usually require

skills that they do not possess and are invariably filled  by

younger,  better  educated workers or  foreign  talent.   The

Ministry  of  Manpower should therefore  develop  a  national

manpower  planning framework that can quickly anticipate  and

identify   key   manpower  trends  in  this   fast   changing

environment, and also ways to get this vital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>

information  effectively  and  in  a  timely  manner  to  our

workforce, so that informed decisions can be made on the type

of   training  and  upgrading  courses  that  workers  should

undertake in order to enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the National Manpower Council had its

inaugural  meeting just last month.  Could the Minister  tell

us   whether  the  Council  has  made  any  projections   and

recommendations?   Could the Minister also inform  the  House

what  initiatives and strategies his Ministry has taken  with

regard  to  manpower development in the  face  of  this  fast

changing economic landscape?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is well and good to study trends and anticipate

changes  in  the  labour market and advocate relevant  skills

upgrading, we should also be realistic enough to realise that

there  are  many  in  our workforce, especially  older,  less

educated workers, who may not be able to upgrade due to  lack

of  literacy and numeracy skills and therefore are unable  to

benefit from the skills redevelopment programmes.  Could  the

Minister  tell us what measures his Ministry would take  with

regard  to  professionalisation  of  certain  industries  and

occupations,  and the redeployment of such workers,  so  that

they too can have dignified employment, earn decent wages and

be made to feel that every Singaporean indeed matters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, with regard to the management of foreign

manpower, Singapore needs to augment its indigenous workforce

with  foreign  manpower for our continued economic  progress.

In  many areas such as financial services, IT, communications

and  leading-edge manufacturing technology, there may not  be

enough  Singaporeans  yet  and  there  may  never  be  enough

Singaporeans  with  the required skills  to  compete  in  the

global  market against the most advanced countries and emerge

as winners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must accept the fact that we need a healthy

infusion  of foreign talent to raise our competitiveness  and

to  create more job opportunities for Singaporeans.  In fact,

there is now a global war

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>

for  talent and Singapore may be left far behind  if  we  are

unable to attract our share of international talent.  Even in

the  field of sports such as football and table tennis, clear

examples  can  be seen on how the infusion of foreign  talent

raises  standards and competitiveness, and also how countries

around  the  world  scramble for  such  talents.   Could  the

Minister  tell  us what measures his Ministry  is  taking  to

attract more foreign talent into the country, and whether the

figures indicate that these measures are indeed effective?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower down the scale, there are also many areas of

employment  that  there are just not enough Singaporeans  who

seem  inclined to undertake.  Consequently, we now have large

numbers of less skilled foreign manpower in occupations  such

as construction and cleansing services that Singaporeans seem

unwilling to do.  With such large numbers of low wage and low

skilled  workers  available, there is little  motivation  for

employers  to  raise  productivity and  professionalise  such

occupations.   Wages in these occupations would  also  remain

depressed   and   continue   to   remain   unattractive    to

Singaporeans.  Could the Minister tell us what  measures  are

being taken to reduce the number of unskilled foreign workers

in  Singapore and also what incentives are being provided  to

ensure  that  employers bring in better skilled workers,  and

indeed if these measures are effective?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, during the last recession, our

unions  and  workers  were praised for taking  a  cooperative

posture  in contributing to cost cutting measures  to  revive

the  economy.  Looking ahead, the challenges ahead are  going

to  be even more difficult.  The twin forces of globalisation

and   technological   changes  are   creating   changes   and

uncertainties at an incredible speed.  We need to  strengthen

tripartism  to better manage the uncertainties of the  future

and  to  make  all  the  stakeholders in  Singapore  winners.

Tripartism  can  only work well if there is strong  bipartite

relations  at  the  lowest working level  in  our  factories,

offices and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>

workshops  between managers, supervisors, workers  and  trade

union leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial relations is like friendship between people.

Going  through a crisis can result in two possible  outcomes.

Firstly, the shared experience could result in better bonding

and  better  relations.  This in turn can make it  easier  to

work together and overcome future difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is that friendship suffers when

one party feels taken advantage of by the other.  We all know

of  individuals  who are nice to us when they  need  us,  and

ignore  us or even be unkind to us when they do not need  us.

If  good  relations suffer, we know it is very  difficult  to

rebuild them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot afford to have confrontational

industrial relations.  Relations at the top level between the

Singapore  National Employers' Federation,  the  Ministry  of

Manpower and NTUC are generally good, but bipartite relations

at the workplace generally need more improvement.  There is a

gap.   I hear of cases where employers are being unreasonable

or  taking  the  union for granted.  For  example,  they  are

asking  workers  to take pay cuts even when  the  company  is

doing  well.  Retrenchment exercises are done without  regard

to  the  human  factors and its impact on workers  and  their

families.  Union leaders are being picked on, just to name  a

few.  It is unnecessary to have these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While unions put people first, yet union leaders know

that  without commercial success we cannot promote the  well-being of people.  Businesses also must realise that they  can

do  better if they can motivate the people who work for them.

Fear  of  losing  one's  job is not  an  effective  long-term

motivational tool.   The best tool to motivate people  is  to

show  genuine care and concern.  Then business decisions will

have to be more than just economic decisions.  It has to take

into account people factors and be adjusted accordingly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions. The Manpower 21 has made some

very  good  points on strengthening relations  and  promoting

good  human  resource practices.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister to give top priority to its implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key players in industrial relations are union

leaders and HR practitioners.  We need to upgrade their level

of   professionalism.   They  have  to   conduct   industrial

relations  with openness, honesty and, of course,  integrity.

While  unions  spend  a  lot  of resources  in  training  and

developing union leaders, the quality of our HR professionals

varies very widely.  I suggest the Ministry work closely with

the  Singapore  Human Resource Institute to train  and  maybe

even  certify  HR practitioners to ensure a higher  level  of

professionalism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government, as the biggest employer, can set

the  example.  It will have to involve, consult and recognise

union  leaders. I also hope that the Government  will  ratify

the core ILO conventions as in the Declaration of Fundamental

Principles  and  Rights of Workers as soon as  possible.   It

will help our image and increase the social consciousness  of

our  business.   We  do  not  have blatant  and  unfair  work

practices  in  this  country, but without  ratifying  it,  it

creates a kind of impression in the international community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I hope that the Trade Unions Act will be amended

to  allow  trade  unions  to  represent  more  categories  of

workers.  I mentioned this in the debate on the amendments to

the  Trade Unions Act.  I also hope the Act will allow unions

to  buy shares of companies where they have members.  Some of

these companies may not be trustee stock companies.   Some of

them  may be listed in foreign stock markets.  This will mean

allowing  unions  to buy shares of foreign  companies  and  I

think  this  will  also help to bring about  a  link  between

employers and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think we cannot succeed without the

wholehearted support of the business leaders at  the  top  of

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>

business community.  And I hope the political leadership will

do more to sell the benefits of tripartism.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the 10% CPF cut was made on 1st

January  last year in an environment of economic and regional

recession.  Since then, there has been a sharp rebound in the

regional  economies,  and the Singapore economy  has  emerged

well  placed  for  expansion in the next  few  years.   A  2%

restoration  will  be made on 1st April this  year.  However,

many companies are well able and some may even be willing  to

restore  the 10% cut at a faster rate than that announced  by

the  Government.   Is there any reason why  the  Ministry  of

Manpower  should  not  permit a  faster  restoration  of  the

employer's  CPF contribution by companies that are  able  and

willing  to  make such restorations?  And will  the  Ministry

consider  granting  such restorations the  usual  income  tax

exemptions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, the main social security safety

net  for  Singaporeans  is the Central  Provident  Fund.   It

provides  for  our old age, medical, education  of  children,

home ownership, investments.  And the question asked, is  CPF

really  adequate to meet all these needs?  Apparently,  going

by  newspaper reports, it may not be adequate because a large

amount of CPF contributions has been used by workers for home

ownership.  While it is right, I support the use of  CPF  for

home  ownership but, unfortunately, the prices of houses  are

going  up faster than the wage rises, and more of the CPF  is

being used up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is that there is an income ceiling of

$6,000  on  CPF  contributions and this has not  been  raised

since  1985.  Moreover, the liberalisation in investments  of

CPF  holdings  has meant quite a number of people  have  lost

money on the stock market.  I want to suggest some points  to

ensure  that we have enough money needs to carry  through  in

CPF  and  other  means  to  our  old  age.   First,  I  agree

completely  with Mr Charles Chong that we should restore  the

CPF cut as soon as possible.  We do not have to wait for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>

five  years. The Government did a good example by not waiting

till  next year but restoring it this year.  Keep up the good

work and do even much faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is that we should never ever use CPF as

a  tool  for cost reduction.  In the 1985 recession, CPF  was

used  and  the Government said that it was very painful.  The

reason  the  CPF  was used was because the  wage  system  was

inflexible.   So  a  flexible wage system was  promoted.   In

1998, CPF was again cut because many firms had not introduced

a flexible wage system, especially in the private sector.  In

the   private  sector,  for  categories  of  executives   and

managerial  people,  practically  no  flexible  wage   system

exists.   So  we should promote the flexible wage system  and

now, base-up wage system, so that we do not have to have  the

painful  CPF cut, which actually affects people at the  lower

level of income more painfully than people at the top.  These

are people who need CPF savings most.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I suggest that we lift the income ceiling of

$6,000 for CPF contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, increase their income through education and

training.   If  we can use CPF for investments in  the  stock

market,   we  should  also  allow  people  to  use  CPF   for

investments in increasing human capital.  Therefore, they can

use  it for training and educational purposes.  We heard from

the  Ministry of Trade and Industry that they want  consumers

to  have  choice.   Give workers choice.  Give  workers  some

money  into  their  CPF accounts and let  them  decide  which

training courses they want to take which are useful for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, allow the employers to have some tax incentive

benefits  to  contribute to the SRS which  the  Minister  for

Finance  has  announced.  The SRS could  be  a  supplementary

income for old age, and let employers contribute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, tax allowance for savings in excess of CPF.

The most they get is for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>

CPF allowance and people who save in insurance do not get any

advantage.  Can the Minister look for supplementary provision

retirement  which  could be through employers  and  companies

like  insurance  companies, banks and cooperative  societies?

Therefore, in that way, they will have CPF plus private means

to give them income for old age.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I am speaking to

reinforce the point which Mr Thomas just made on the usage of

CPF for education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been strong arguments both for and against

opening  up  the  use of CPF funds for educational  purposes.

While  it is laudable that the Government has set aside funds

for  training and skills redevelopment, this does not  extend

sufficient  flexibility to employees and  workers  to  freely

choose  the new skills or courses they would like to  pursue.

Also,  in the case of parents wanting to use their CPF  funds

for   their   children's  education,  CPF  funds   usage   is

permissible  only  for  courses at  our  local  universities.

However, quite a large number of students do not qualify  for

admission  into the National University of Singapore  or  the

Nanyang Technological University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an age where a first degree is quickly becoming

the  norm for entry level jobs, parents whose children do not

qualify  for local university admission are forced  to  admit

their  children  into  foreign universities  which,  in  most

cases,  cost much more.  The denial of CPF funds usage  means

that  the  education has to be financed from savings  or  the

parents have to work doubly hard to raise the money for their

children's  overseas  education.   Sir,  this  imposes  undue

strain on the family as parents have to work overtime or hold

two  jobs to pay overseas tuition fees and lodging costs  for

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a KBE environment where all Singaporeans are

encouraged  to  pursue life-long learning to remain  relevant

and  employable in a fast changing business environment,  our

people should be given maximum flexibility to various sources

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>

funds,  including  those statutorily held  on  their  behalf.

After  all,  pursuit of life-long learning  is  a  worthwhile

investment  to  keep  them relevant with  the  needs  of  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond tertiary education in Singapore's

institutions of higher learning, I would like to propose that

CPF  funds  usage  be  selectively  permitted  at  least  for

accredited courses of study,  both local as well as  foreign.

The Ministry of Manpower in conjunction with the Ministry  of

Education could perhaps issue some guidelines on the types of

accredited courses permitted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Female workers form about

half  of our population.  They also make up more than 40%  of

our  workforce.   They  are  a very  important  part  of  our

society.  They enjoy equal pay as men for the same job  done.

They  enjoy tax rebates that are extended to men.  There  are

many  women  who  are  working  and  are  not  classified  as

economically active.  They play a very important role at home

in  keeping  the  family  together, in  taking  care  of  the

children,  in keeping them cope with the school work.   While

all  those  who  work  would enjoy  CPF  savings   for  their

retirement and old age, our home makers, while working  women

like  working males benefit from Government CPF  top-up  from

time to time, non-working wives do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the important role of the home makers, I

would  like  to  urge  the Ministry  to  extend  the  planned

Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) to the working wives or

spouses  by  allowing the husbands to contribute to  the  CPF

savings  account.  We can start this with women  who  already

have  CPF  accounts but who stopped working to take  care  of

their  families.  But in future the scheme should be open  to

all working non-spouses.  In order to encourage such savings,

it  is  important that the relevant tax incentives be offered

to  them.   When  we  have budget surpluses,  the  Government

should  top  up  the SRS account of the non-working  spouses.

The  SRS  is particularly for workers in the lower income  so

that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>

can boost their savings for old age.  Unfortunately, as shown

by  the experience of the USA in regard to the optional  401K

savings  scheme, the lower income workers are less likely  to

contribute  to the SRS.  To start with, they have less  money

to set aside as savings, and they would benefit less from the

proposed  tax nature of the SRS.  After all, 70% of our  wage

earners do not pay income tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I propose that the SRS should offer good

incentives to encourage the lower income workers to save  for

their  own  and  their spouses' old age and retirement.   One

possible  way to encourage them to save up through this  CPF-based scheme is by the Government topping up the SRS accounts

when  there are budget surpluses.  Of course, to start  with,

good tax incentives should be offered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> The Member before

me, Mr Hawazi Daipi, argued very eloquently for the extension

of  SRS  to spouses.  In the previous day, Mr Seng Han  Thong

has  also asked for the same thing.  I would like to also add

my voice to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contribution that working spouses

make  to the well being of the family, this particular  group

is  vulnerable because the women are the ones who live longer

and  will form the largest portion of the elderly population.

The  Report  of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee  on  Ageing

Population had registered we were greatly concerned that many

CPF  account  holders  would  have  inadequate  balances   on

retirement.   This particular group which is most  vulnerable

is  in  fact  also  the  group that will  not  have  any  CPF

balances.   I support the proposal put forward by  Mr  Hawazi

Daipi  and Mr Seng Han Thong.  I would in fact like  to  take

one  step  further to suggest, over and above the  favourable

tax treatment, a voluntary contribution to the CPF account of

their wives.  We should consider making it mandatory that  in

the  case  where one spouse is not working in a salaried  job

but  is  a  full  time  housemaker,  a  portion  of  the  CPF

contribution  of the salary of the spouse must be  channelled

into a CPF account of the homemaker so that the latter is not

totally dependent on the goodwill and indeed the prudence  of

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>

wage  earner to have some funds available to see her  through

in her old age.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,

thank you for allowing me to respond to the hon. Members  who

have just spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to respond to Mr Charles Chong who

spoke  about  the  need to have a national manpower  planning

framework  to  quickly anticipate and identify  key  manpower

trends  in  a  fast  changing  environment.   I  am  in  full

agreement with Mr Chong that we need to have such a  manpower

planning   framework.   This  is   in   fact   one   of   the

recommendations of the Manpower 21 study, namely,  to set  up

a National Manpower Council in order to conduct an integrated

holistic  approach towards manpower planning  for  Singapore.

Sir,  as our economy transits into a knowledge based economy,

effective  manpower planning will  be crucial to help  us  to

meet  the challenges of rapid changes as well as to ride  the

new   wave   of  opportunities.   Sir,  a  manpower  planning

framework  with the Manpower Council at the helm will  enable

us  to  better anticipate manpower needs and to facilitate  a

better fit between manpower demand and supply.  It will  also

enable  us  to  address  the manpower issues  in  a  holistic

manner.   The  end objective is, of course,  to  enhance  the

competitiveness  of  our  workforce  in  the  knowledge-based

economy.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to report that the National Manpower

Council  had held its inaugural meeting last month.  I  would

like to take this opportunity to inform the House on some  of

the  key issues which were discussed and the strategies which

were endorsed by the National Manpower Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the area of manpower demand. With the

economic recovery well underway, job creation is expected  to

be  positive in the medium term, with a projected average net

job creation of about 45,000 jobs per annum between the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>

years  2000 and 2005.  This will be much lower than the  pre-crisis  year.  45,000 jobs a year might sound a lot, but,  in

fact,  it is much lower than what we were doing in the  years

before  the  financial crisis.  Between 1992  and  1997,  for

example, we saw employment gain of about 83,000 per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years, the sectors with the fastest job

growth  per annum include business services (about 8,800  per

annum),  financial inter-mediation (5,900),  computer-related

activities   (4,007),   transport  and   logistics   (4,000),

education  (2,008),  health  care  (2,300),  wholesale  trade

(1,900)  and  petroleum  and chemical  (1,400).   Sir,  these

projections,  I have to emphasise, are based on  the  economy

growing steadily at an average of 5% per annum and also based

on  what  we  know of the investment trends and the  business

opportunities or business forecasts in the short term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is not so much the actual projected

number, but the projected changes in demand between different

sectors  of  the  economy.   The projections  show  that  the

service  sector and the IT-related will lead in job creation.

In  the  manufacturing sector, the turnover of  lower  value-added  jobs  to be replaced by higher value-added  jobs  will

continue.   EDB's Industry 21 plan is on target  to  generate

about 15,000 jobs per annum, two-thirds of which will require

fairly  highly skilled workers.  New jobs in the  electronic,

chemical and life sciences industry will be created.  At  the

same time, job losses are expected from restructuring of  the

light manufacturing and electronic industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment growth in the service sector will be

underpinned  by  the rapid growth of Internet and  e-commerce

activities  across  various  industries,  including  finance,

business  and  education and the growth of new activities  in

logistics, communication and IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the move towards more knowledge-based

activities, the demand for manpower will be greater  for  the

highest  skilled and education category.  Manpower demand  is

projected  to grow for those with degree, diploma  and  post-secondary qualifications, while the job

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>

demand  for  workers with secondary and below education  will

continue to drop.  In general, a greater proportion of highly-skilled  manpower will be needed across all  industries.   In

terms  of  manpower  demand  by occupations  -  professional,

associated  professional and managers - will  emerge  as  the

fastest  growing  occupations  in  the  industries  such   as

business,   computer   and   related   activities,   finance,

engineering,  electronics and communication.   Sir,  to  meet

these    emerging   manpower   needs,   various    strategies

encompassing manpower development, manpower augmentation  and

industry re-engineering will be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on retraining the workforce, the Skills

Redevelopment Programme and the Strategic Manpower Conversion

Programme have been formulated to provide skills training and

conversion to help workers move from one industry to another.

The National Manpower Council has identified additional areas

that could be considered for SRP and the SMCP.  For instance,

workers   within   electronics,   electrical,   retail    and

construction industries can be upgraded through  the  SRP  to

take   on   higher  skilled  jobs  within  these  industries.

Training  and conversion programmes could also be offered  to

enable  workers  to  be  deployed to  other  industries  with

growing  demand  for workers.  Workers in engineering,  light

manufacturing, finance and construction, for example, can  be

deployed  to  appropriate jobs in IT,  health  care  and  the

transport and logistics sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the anticipated growth in manpower

needs for specific disciplines, the National Manpower Council

also  set new targets for university and polytechnic intakes.

For  example,  the  universities will expand  the  intake  of

engineering and computer science by about 4% from last year's

intake.  Other disciplines with significant increases to cope

with  anticipated demand could be seen in pharmacy (about  8%

increase)  and  communication studies  (about  9%  increase).

Polytechnics will increase engineering intake by about 2% and

12%  for  computing.  The polytechnics will  aim  for  higher

intake for media and design studies of about 14%,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>

and  for  health-related subjects, about 9%.  In the case  of

business studies, the intake will go up by a very significant

14%,  with SMU taking a share of the increase.  In the  other

disciplines, the intakes will be maintained more or less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in a knowledge-based economy, when

knowledge creation could come from the convergence of various

disciplines,   it  is  recommended  that  the  post-secondary

educational  institutions  adopt  a  more  multi-disciplinary

approach.    For  example,  core  skills  such  as   IT   and

communication   should  be  included  as   modules   in   all

disciplines  of studies.  This approach will provide  younger

Singaporeans with multiple skills and capability for a  wider

range of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve the desired educational profile for the

workforce  of 25% degree, 20% diploma, and 20% post-secondary

workers  in 10 to 15 years' time and to ensure that  workers,

especially those at risk of structural unemployment,  can  be

trained  and  deployed  to emerging industries  quickly,  the

National  Manpower Council strongly endorses the Manpower  21

programmes to enhance in-employment, education and  training.

Under  this  system,  we will optimise  the  use  of  current

educational   infrastructure  to  expand  the  capacity   for

continuing  education and training.  My  Ministry  will  work

closely  with Ministry of Education to look into the  funding

arrangements  for  specific  programmes  and  the  means   to

optimise  the  current infrastructure  to  provide  this  CET

needs,  for example, through the provision of more  part-time

and evening classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another strategy is to re-engineer jobs and industries

which  are  low  value-added and are  labour-intensive.   The

objectives  are  to  improve  productivity,  reduce  manpower

demand and raise the image of the industry to encourage  more

locals   to   enter  such  occupation.   This  is  especially

important  given  that  there  are  many  in  our  workforce,

especially of the older age group, who may not have the basic

literacy,  numeracy and language skills to benefit  from  the

Skills Redevelopment or Conversion Programmes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these strategies, Sir, we hope some of the

structurally  unemployed will be able to  fill  the  manpower

gaps   in  the  domestic  service-based  industries  and   be

meaningfully  employed.  This strategy has been initiated  in

the  cleaning  and  construction  industries.   The  National

Manpower  Council has identified other areas in health  care,

hotel and restaurant and retail sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in augmenting manpower supply, there is a need to

augment  the  local manpower supply.  That is quite  obvious.

In  many  areas, we have jobs where we do not have sufficient

Singaporeans  to  take  these  jobs  or  we   do   not   have

Singaporeans  with the required expertise and  experience  to

take  on  these  jobs.  That is why we need  to  augment  our

manpower  supply.  But, first of all, in terms of  augmenting

or  increasing our manpower supply, we must also look at  our

own domestic population, our own workforce.  For instance, if

we  can  increase the female labour force participation  rate

by,  say, 3 percentage points, we will be able to draw  about

40,000  women, who are now economically inactive,  back  into

the  workforce.  So just a 3 percentage point improvement  in

our  female labour force participation rate amounts to 40,000

additional  or  new  workers to the  workforce.   This  is  a

significant area for us to look into, if we are talking about

augmenting our manpower resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even after we try to draw the economically inactive

women  into  the  labour force, we will find that  there  are

still  gaps in the manpower demand and supply which the local

workforce  will  not be able to fill, as I said  earlier  on,

perhaps where Singaporeans do not have the experience or  the

expertise  or  where  there are just  simply  not  enough  of

Singaporeans  to go around.  Consequently, we  will  need  to

supplement  our  local workforce with foreign  manpower.   We

must continue to leverage on the global manpower resources at

all  levels  in  order  to bring about  sustainable  economic

growth.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the shortage in professionals and technicians

as  well  as production workers and manual workers to persist

for  some time to come.  Foreign manpower is therefore needed

to  plug  these gaps, especially at the higher end, where  we

continue  to  attract foreign talent.  At the lower  end,  we

will  continue to admit foreign workers selectively.  So  the

thrust is to raise the skills profile and the productivity of

lower-end foreign manpower as well as to professionalise  the

lower-skilled jobs, so that we can reduce our reliance on low

or unskilled foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these strategies will help us to build a

globally competitive workforce to meet the economy's needs as

we  transit into a knowledge-based economy.  My Ministry will

work  closely  with  our  various partners  and  implementing

agencies on these strategies and programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also raised questions on manpower development

and  on  foreign  workers.  There are cuts later  on  in  the

debate  on  this.  Either my Minister of State or I  will  be

responding to those other points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to Mr Thomas Thomas' point on the

importance  of  tripartism.  Here, again, I agree  completely

with Mr Thomas on the importance of tripartism.  It has been,

I  would say, a cornerstone of our economic well-being.   The

strong     tripartite     cooperative,    non-confrontational

relationship  has helped us tremendously and is,  indeed,  an

asset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas suggested that we give top priority to the M21

recommendation  to upgrade the human resource  practitioners.

Yes,  we  will  do that.  We will work closely  with  various

human resource institutes.  In fact, my Ministry has set up a

unit  to promote a HR promotion unit where we will study  the

companies  which  have  developed  or  implemented  good   HR

practices.   We will use these as case studies  and  we  will

then  promote these practices to other employers  by  way  of

seminars or workshops, so that employers and HR practitioners

can  learn  about what other companies are doing  by  way  of

improving their HR management practices.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also suggested that the Government as an

employer   should  contribute  to  building   up   tripartite

relationship, consulting the unions whenever there is a need.

Let me assure him that that is our approach.  I know that the

Public  Service  Division  does consult  the  unions  on  key

issues, whether it is NWC wage increases or any other matters

that would affect the public sector employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned in passing about ratifying ILO conventions.

Let  me  point out that there is a cut later on and  we  will

give   him   a  full  reply  on  our  approach  towards   ILO

conventions.  But at this juncture, suffice to say that  when

ILO convention does not run counter to our national interest,

we are very open and we are ready to ratify such conventions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also suggested that the Trade Unions Act be

amended  to  enable unions to represent a wider  category  of

workers.  As it stands today, any employee who has a contract

or  service  with an employer, in other words,  there  is  an

employer-employee  relationship, he is  already  entitled  to

join  the union, regardless of whether the worker is a  part-time worker, a casual worker or hired on a contract.  As long

as there is a real employer-employee relationship, the worker

can  join  a union.  The group that is excluded, in fact,  is

only the self-employed workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, prior to 1982, even self-employed could

join  the trade unions.  But then it was noted that obviously

being   self-employed,   there   was   no   employer-employee

relationship,  and  the  group or the union  that  represents

these self-employed workers could not negotiate or could  not

have  collective bargaining with the employer  because  there

was  no  real  employer-employee relationship on  which  they

could  base  their collective bargaining on.  And  also  such

self-employed workers - even if they joined the union, before

the  1982 amendment to the Trade Unions Act - found that they

could  not  avail  themselves  of  the  conciliation  or  the

industrial arbitration process within the ambit of our labour

legislation.  So, in fact, there was no advantage for them to

become union members in this sense.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, there are some vocations which

generally are considered as self-employed but, in fact, there

may  be specific instances where they are actually employees.

For instance, many musicians are considered self-employed and

they  are  not  members  of a union.  But  musicians  of  the

Singapore  Symphony  Orchestra, for  instance,  are  actually

employees  of  the Singapore Symphony Orchestra  Limited  and

therefore  they are eligible to join a union.  There,  again,

it  is  not  a question of what you do.  It is a question  of

whether there is an actual employer-employee relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also suggested that unions should be allowed

to buy shares of their own companies, including foreign-based

companies.   This is an area that we have to study carefully.

Presently,  unions can invest their funds in trustee  shares.

They  can  invest  in  land, they can  also  invest  in  land

overseas, although that will require a different procedure to

get  approval from the members.  But whether they should  buy

overseas shares and also foreign denomination shares,  it  is

something that we should study.  We should not rush into  it.

Of  course,  as  Mr Thomas would agree, the risks  of  buying

overseas  shares with foreign denomination are  much  greater

than buying Singapore dollar denominated shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to Mr Charles Chong's query on some

companies  which are able and may be willing to  restore  the

10% CPF cut faster than announced by the Government.  Let  me

say  that the CPF cut that we introduced on 1st January  1999

had  enabled  many companies to become more cost competitive.

Companies,  which were facing severe difficulties during  the

financial crisis and economic downturn, could, in fact,  have

fallen by the wayside, but ended up with a second chance as a

result   of  our  CPF  reduction  and  other  cost  reduction

measures.  Many have in fact survived and are well  on  their

way  back  towards a growth path again.  Companies that  were

doing  well  during  the  crisis and economic  downturn  also

benefited from the cut in CPF because they then found

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>

themselves to be even more competitive than they were before.

They  could  gain a bigger market share.  So what happens  is

that  when  you  cut  the CPF across the board,  you  benefit

everybody because those companies that are not doing well, we

help them to survive.  Those companies that are already doing

well,  they are able to increase their market share  and,  in

the process, even create more jobs.  So we both preserve jobs

and also create more jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to allow companies which are able to make

quicker  restoration of the CPF on their own  and  also  give

them  the  full tax benefit, then we are going to lead  to  a

situation   of   invidious  comparison   between   companies.

Employees  who want to compare may say, "Why is this  company

able to make the restoration faster, although voluntarily, as

compared   to  mine?"   That  would  remove  this  sense   of

collective  burden sharing that was so important  in  how  we

rallied Singaporeans together to face the crisis in 1998.  It

could lead to a situation where employers, including the less

profitable  ones,  could  be  pressured  to  make   voluntary

contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do not think companies that are

doing well should just enjoy the CPF cut and reflect it as an

additional  surplus or profit to be enjoyed by  shareholders,

who  are  owners of the company.  There is a  case  here  for

companies that are doing well to also reward their workers by

either  wage increase, if they think that their good prospect

is  sustainable, or by one-off special bonuses, at the end of

the  year,  if  they  are  not  too  sure  whether  the  good

performance  will  continue  or  not.   In  fact,  this   was

recommended  by  the NWC in October 1998 to account  for  the

differences that if you are doing well, the companies  should

reward  workers with special bonuses, rather than go back  to

the old CPF mechanism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Government is concerned, we will restore

the CPF cut, and this is a point which was also brought up by

Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>

Thomas.  We will restore the CPF cut at a pace which will not

hurt the economic recovery and growth.  The first step is the

2%  restoration on 1st April this year.  We will speed up the

restoration if there is clear evidence that a faster pace  of

restoration will not hurt our overall competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas next went on to suggest that the CPF should

not  be used as a tool for cost reduction.  I agree with him.

We  should not treat the CPF as a means of adjusting our wage

cost at the slightest provocation.  We should look at the CPF

as  a  last  resort.   Only  if there  is  no  other  way  of

preserving our competitiveness should we then touch the  CPF.

This  has always been my position even in 1998, when we  were

first  discussing the CPF cut.  Because whenever you cut  the

CPF, it will affect people in a whole range of ways, some  of

which are quite unanticipated.  So we should always treat  it

as a last resort measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that we should use the flexible wage

system   as   the   first  mechanism  to  adjust   our   wage

competitiveness.   In  this regard, we  should  get  all  our

employers  to  sit  up and take a more proactive  stand  with

regard  to  the  recommendations by the NWC  to  institute  a

monthly variable payment.  A monthly variable payment,  which

is in a way bringing part of the end-of-the-year bonuses into

a  monthly  payment, will help employers to cope with  sudden

changes  in  the business environment.  They do not  have  to

wait  till the end of the year to adjust the bonuses in order

to  reduce their labour costs.  They could in fact adjust the

monthly  variable payment whenever business  takes  a  sudden

turn  for  the  worse.  This is an area  that  all  employers

should  sit  up and take notice of, and try to  implement  as

soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that we should review the CPF

contribution   ceiling   because,  presently,   no   CPF   is

contributed for salary above $6,000.  The $6,000 was fixed in

1985.  We have looked at this possibility.  But we should  be

careful  about raising the CPF contribution ceiling.  Because

if you do that, you are increasing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>

the  cost  burden  to the employers.  And at  this  juncture,

while  the economy has recovered, we cannot be sure that  the

recovery  will be smooth and uneventful.  We do not  want  to

over burden the industry with additional cost factor.  So  we

should be very careful about adjusting the CPF ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, we do want Singaporeans to also save

more  for  their  retirement which is why  the  Minister  for

Finance  announced the Supplementary Retirement Scheme.   The

scheme will enable those who want to save more and also  have

a  tax  incentive to save, to put aside more of their  income

into  the  Supplementary Retirement Scheme, ie,  open  a  SRS

account  and put aside additional savings for their old  age.

As to the details of the scheme, the Minister for Finance has

explained  that  he will study it in greater  detail  because

there is a wider tax implication.  We will seek feedback from

various sectors and if Members have any comments, we will  be

prepared to consider, particularly, whether employers  should

contribute to the SRS by way of incentives so that they  will

put  in  their co-contribution  together with the  employees.

This is something we can look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point was that we should consider additional

tax  allowance  for employees or workers who have made  other

investments, such as by way of insurance policies.   This  is

an   area   that   had  been  studied  before.    Under   our

arrangements, all mandatory CPF contributions are tax exempt.

You  can buy insurance and claim tax exemption on the premium

that you have paid, provided the total amount does not exceed

the  mandatory  CPF contribution.  I am not sure  whether  we

should at this juncture change the tax ruling.  But this is a

matter for the Minister for Finance to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to respond to Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Ang

Mong  Seng and also Mr Thomas.  Both Mr Magad and Mr Ang Mong

Seng  raised the concern about using CPF for self-improvement

courses,  part-time courses and overseas education for  their

children.  This is not a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>

new  subject.  It has been raised on many occasions  in  this

Chamber  and we have discussed this extensively.  Let  us  go

back to the objectives of the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the CPF's core objective? It is to help the

member to save sufficient money for his retirement needs.  We

have  allowed one deviation from this and, that is, to  allow

him  to  borrow  against   his CPF  savings  to  finance  his

children's  full-time  education in a Singapore  institution.

We also have allowed the CPF member to borrow against his own

account  if he himself wants to undertake a full-time  course

in a Singapore institution.  This was in order to allow lower

income  Singaporeans who have difficulties  supporting  their

children   to   study   full-time  at  the   local   tertiary

institutions.   We  are comfortable with doing  that  because

tertiary education in Singapore is highly subsidised, and the

fees are in fact regulated and controlled by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for self-improvement courses, the

fees  are charged at the market rate.  Overseas education  is

very costly.  Even if we say yes, you can borrow against your

CPF  account  to finance your children's overseas  education,

there would have to be a limit obviously.  You could not  say

you  could take everything out of your CPF account and  spend

it  on your children's overseas education.  What would be the

limit?  The limit naturally must be what you can withdraw  if

your  children were studying in Singapore.  If you  do  that,

then  you will find that the portion that you can borrow from

your   CPF   account  to  finance  your  children's  overseas

education is a very small part of the total cost of financing

the  education overseas.  In which case, you would  therefore

run  a  greater risk of losing that investment if,  somewhere

along the line, the parent loses his job or has to take a cut

in the income, and he can no longer support his kid overseas.

That is why we are concerned that if we open up this area, we

will allow greater erosion of CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when you buy shares, there are risks. We

know that there are risks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>

associated  with buying shares.  But at the end of  the  day,

those members who make prudent investments, in the long  run,

will  certainly  enhance their CPF savings.  There  are  many

studies  to  show that, over the long run, equity investments

generate  significantly  higher rates  of  return  than  just

putting  money in the bank.  There may be ups  and  downs  in

between,  but  if you are prepared to hold those  investments

over  the  long run and if they are wisely invested,  if  you

make a careful study or, better still, allow professionals to

help  you make the investment, then you will find that,  over

the  long run, you are unlikely to lose out.  That is why  we

are prepared to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings to

invest in shares.  Whereas investing in overseas education is

a totally different thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing in overseas education is not just paying the

fees.   It means supporting the student during the period  of

stay  and that can be quite costly.  The fees can be tens  of

thousands  of  dollars compared to what is being  charged  by

NUS.   That  is  why we are quite concerned and  we  are  not

prepared,  at  this juncture, to relax the  ruling  that  CPF

savings can only be used for education if the person using it

is studying in a Singapore institution on a full-time basis.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas suggested, if I get him right, that the

Government  should consider transferring some of the  surplus

to  top-up CPF members' accounts and allow them to use it  as

some  sort of training fund. This is a different presentation

from  what was raised sometime ago about allowing CPF members

to  use part of their CPF savings for training.  If it is  in

fact to ask whether the Government would make this CPF top-up

available  for CPF members to pay for some training expenses,

that  is  a totally different proposition and it is something

for the Minister for Finance to consider and see whether this

should  be the way to give out some of the budget surplus  or

not.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that today we are not facing a shortage of

funding in order to support workers' upgrading or retraining.

In  fact,  skills upgrading or retraining is well within  the

reach  of  every worker today.  Let me point out an  example.

Last year, we had a training commitment of 18,200 workers for

the Skills Redevelopment Programme.  18,200 workers signed up

for the Skills Redevelopment Programme.  In fact, only 12,600

or  about  70% actually turned up for the training. The  rest

never  showed up.  In fact, the SRP budget that  we  have  is

grossly   underspent.   We  have  the  funds,  the   training

capacity, but the workers have not turned up.  The issue that

confronts us today is not a lack of funds.  It is a sense  of

complacency,  a lack of urgency on the part of employers  and

their  employees.  I think the economic recovery has made  it

even worse.  The employers do not feel the urgency. They  see

a pick-up in business and prefer to keep their workers on the

job  or  even  to work overtime.  Investment in training  for

their  employees is now seen as less important.  On the other

hand, workers who see that his job prospects are much better,

see  little  need for training as the threat of  retrenchment

seems to be over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that individuals should take responsibility

for their training, career and learning needs and they should

make   full  use  of  the  extensive  support  and  financing

mechanism  that we have instituted in order to upgrade  their

skills  so  that they can remain employable even as  the  job

market continues to change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to respond to Mr Hawazi Daipi and

Dr  Jennifer Lee. I also agree with Mr Hawazi that housewives

contributed  immensely  to the family  and  to  the  national

development  of  the country.  I do not think  this  is  ever

debated  or  anyone  would argue against  this  point.   Even

though  they are not actively working or contributing in  the

economy,  the  housewives, by looking after the children  and

the  homes are making an enormous contribution.  In fact,  we

do provide incentives for spouses and children to build up or

to   contribute  to  CPF  accounts  for  the  housewives   or

homemakers.  Children of the homemakers can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>

make  contributions to their parents' or their  mother's  CPF

account  under  the existing Minimum Sum top-up  scheme.  The

children  would  be allowed a tax relief on the  cash  amount

contributed into their non-working mother's CPF account up to

$6,000  a year.  Spouses of homemakers can also top up  their

wife's CPF account with CPF savings under the Minimum Sum top-up  scheme  provided they themselves have double the  Minimum

Sum amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have other incentives for children or spouse to

make  contributions for homemakers in the form of  CPF  share

ownership  top-up  scheme. This was done in  1993,  1995  and

again in 1997 and we also have the CPF top-up scheme in  1995

and the Medisave top-up scheme in 1996 and 1997.  In some  of

these  top-up  schemes,  the children  or  the  spouses  were

required to make a co-payment before Government would  credit

a certain amount of top-up into the homemakers' CPF accounts.

It  is  not quite correct to say that homemakers cannot  take

advantage  of various Government CPF top-ups.  In fact,  they

did in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent top-up announced by the Minister for

Finance in his Budget speech, Government is going to  give  a

special  top-up of $250 into the Ordinary Accounts  of  every

Singaporean CPF member aged 21 and above, provided they  have

made  at  least one contribution for the whole  of  1998  and

1999.   The  objective of this top-up is in fact to recognise

Singaporeans who have accepted the wage and CPF cuts as  part

of  the  package to deal with the economic crisis.  In  fact,

homemakers who had made at least one CPF contribution  during

this  same  period, either by their children or spouse,  will

also be able to receive this $250 top-up from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed all the points that were

raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the suspension

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head T (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the  downfall of communism, the opening up of many  countries

in  the  region  and  in  the  world  to  trade  and  foreign

investment, and recently the advent of the Internet, all have

an   impact   on   the  Singapore  economy.   The   Internet,

especially, has speeded up the development towards  a  global

economy as it becomes possible to communicate with anyone  in

the world and at any time with the click of a mouse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the challenges posed by emerging economies,

like China and Thailand, we have begun to move away from low-cost  manufacturing where we have become less competitive  to

high value-added industries where we are in a better position

to  compete.  In the process, many of our workers from  these

low-cost  operations have been retrenched.  We  need  to  re-train them for jobs that new high value-added investments are

bringing  in.   But while our intentions are good,  not  many

workers seem prepared to go along with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have cited many reasons: working place is too

far,  shift  work,  pay  is too low, employers  want  younger

workers, having to re-learn and so on.  Whatever the reasons,

I feel that there is a need for re-training to begin as early

as  possible,  not  at  the  stage  when  workers  have  been

retrenched, or about to be retrenched. Maybe this  will  make

the  transition  easier.  Workers will  feel  more  confident

about taking on new jobs because they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>

already  have some basic knowledge of the technology acquired

some  time back.  Is there a way to identify industries where

re-training can be intensively pursued?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that employers who can rely on foreign

workers  also  tend to be the ones who do not  want  to  hire

older  Singaporean workers.  Perhaps some incentives  can  be

given to them to encourage them to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Internet, its actual impact is still unknown.

In  the past two years, we saw a lot of developments  .   New

Internet  start-ups,  retailers going  online.   Big  players

merging  to become even bigger  -  all clamouring to position

themselves for a share of the Internet market.  As  companies

deal  directly with customers on the Internet, there is  talk

that  the middlemen may be sidelined.  What is the impact  on

the  small  businessmen in Singapore?  What is the impact  on

the Singapore worker?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to prepare ourselves for the onslaught.

New  IT  training,  new and innovative marketing  strategies.

Net technology is still developing.  What you learn today may

be   superseded  by  advancements  tomorrow.   Just  take  an

example.   HTML (Hypertext markup language) that the Internet

depends  on initially is now no longer enough.  You have  new

developments like Javascript, Vbscript and so on.   How  soon

can  training institutes catch up with and impart the  skills

to our workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are issues that the new Manpower 21 Committee

should address.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, much has been

said  about  the  impact of globalisation on  our  employment

prospects  for  our workers, and the need  for  training  and

retraining  our workers in order for them to stay employable.

I  applaud the Minister for his Ministry's M21 Report and the

strategy   to  help  meet  the  demand  sectors  in  manpower

resource.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern here is trying to convert a significant

portion  of  the workforce with a certain level  and  set  of

skills into a higher one.  While this is laudable, it may  be

limited  for many of our workers, because the pace of  change

of  industries and the knowledge economy is taking  place  at

such  a  fast  pace that even well trained  people  from  the

polytechnics and the universities may find it hard  to  cope.

Such  workers, however, may learn another less onerous  skill

and seek employment in another sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the interesting features of the new economy is to

be  found in the United States in the growth of employment in

the  traditional  services sector in the face  of  employment

decline in the traditional production sectors.  Even  in  the

new  economy, people need to be served.   They need to go  to

restaurants.   They  need  to  enjoy  music,  having   things

delivered to them, cleaning and maintenance work, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers, young and old, need to be equipped with,

for  want of a better word, I would call, a skill multiplier,

and  that  is to be able to use the computer and the Internet

for  communications.  I am not even talking about information

technology..This familiarity and skill will equip  them  well

to  bridge distances, to match the demand and needs for goods

and  services  with  the fulfillment  of  that  need  and  to

communicate with the customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight here that the NTUC has done

quite  a  lot in training and retraining more than 20,000  of

such  workers to acquire this kind of skill.  And the  recent

initiative  announced by the Government  to  train  our  more

senior  workers in learning this new skill is  laudable.   It

can  be  a delivery service.  It can be a restaurant service,

the  cleaning service, the hospitality service,  a  childcare

service  or  retail service.  The Ministry  should  therefore

identify this kind of service sectors where we can upgrade or

professionalise the work with the right kind of equipment  to

work  with,  so  as to enable our displaced workers  to  stay

employed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the present situation in Singapore is

that there are many foreign workers working in these sectors.

The  wage  in these sectors is also low.  Hence, I  urge  the

Minister   to   focus  on  this  issue  and  accelerate   the

development of services associated with high-tech  affluence,

so  that  there  will  be available jobs  for  our  displaced

workers in order to let them stay employable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I had wanted to ask the Minister

about  the  projected growth of jobs and the pattern  of  job

growth, but the Minister had already informed the House about

this.   Let  me  just focus on retrenchment and unemployment.

What  are  the  projected unemployment rates  in  the  coming

years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1998, it was noted that among the less educated,

there  were more unemployed workers among the older group  of

people, whereas among those with tertiary education,  it  was

noted  that  fewer older workers were unemployed but  younger

graduates were having difficulties in getting jobs.  What was

the  situation last year when the economy turned around?  And

what would be the likely pattern in the coming years?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, while companies should be

primarily responsible for motivating their employees  through

the  various incentive schemes, there still remains an  issue

of rampant job hopping among young Singaporeans.  Despite the

tough  employment environment last year, many employers still

faced  serious  problems  in  employees  changing  jobs  over

trivial  reasons.   This is especially  so  for  our  younger

workers  and  those  employed  at  the  lower  ranks  in  the

companies,  and especially too for those who work in  shifts.

Employers have been fortunate that the Government allows them

to  hire  foreign  workers to make up  for  the  shortage  of

workers up to now.  In many cases, employers have depended on

the foreign workers to be their stable backbone to keep their

operations  going,  while having to live  with  a  much  more

volatile local workforce at those levels.  Surely this is not

the type of image we want for our workers in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why I am bringing up this issue again is

because  I am concerned that even in the years when  the  job

market was tough and when we had record retrenchments in  the

last few years and uncertainty of jobs and job security,  our

younger   workers   still  did  not  take  their   employment

seriously.  I know that the Minister will push the issue back

to  the  employers  but, in the long term,  the   issue  will

become  Singapore's competitive disadvantage,  and  it  is  a

national problem and will need a national solution for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us have asked that the CPF be used as a tool to

control job hopping, but the Minister has many times objected

to  this  because the purpose of CPF is mainly for retirement

savings.   I  can  accept this argument.   In  its  place,  I

suggest that we implement a national compulsory saving scheme

or  a fund where both employees and employers contribute some

money to the employee's account and the money contributed  to

such  accounts  can be used for a number  of  purposes.   For

example, one way to motivate employee loyalty is to pay  them

a  gratuity  every  five  years or  so  of  employment.   The

employee can also borrow from his or her own account in times

of difficulty, like when a retrenchment comes, very much like

what  some insurance policies allow you to do where  you  can

borrow from your policies when you need to.  Such a fund  can

also  be  used  to  address a number of  social  and  welfare

issues,  not  possible with the CPF.  In fact, many  Members,

just  before the suspension, talked about the use of CPF  for

various things, including for education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the employer's perspective, if an employee leaves

the  company within the first or second year of service,  the

company  should be able to claim back part of its own portion

that  he contributed to the employee's account, to compensate

for  the cost of hiring and training.  The employee's portion

can  remain in the fund for the employee to use in future for

whatever uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is an

excellent  way  to  implement some of the things  that  I  am

suggesting.  In fact, it is very timely that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>

this  scheme  has  come about.  We can do  many  more  things

without  touching  the CPF.  Furthermore,  I  would  like  to

suggest, as we go about restoring the CPF savings rate in the

next few years, we should take the opportunity to revamp  the

system  and the quantum that goes into the CPF and  the  SRS.

For  example, in the long term, I would suggest that the  CPF

rates  could be 15% contribution each from both the  employer

and  employee and 5% each from the employer and  employee  to

the SRS or an equivalent scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we will take this opportunity to

address  the  issues  that I have raised  because  these  are

national issues and not employer specific.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in

Singapore's  drive towards a knowledge-based  economy,  there

will inevitably be structural unemployment.  The Minister has

charted the key directions just a while ago which is  a  long

view  and  it is a laudable one.  However, I think there  are

concrete  steps to further help the current older and  lesser

educated  workers who may not even know how to look for  jobs

in  the  classified advertisements of newspapers,  much  less

through the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accessed the MOM's webpage and under the section of

unemployment assistance for job seekers and employers,  there

were  a  total  of 2,005 job seekers compared  to  1,187  job

vacancies posted by employers in December 1999.  Compared  to

the national figure of unemployment, which was reported to be

79,900  last  September, the capture  rate  by  the  web  was

dismal.   That tells me that the web is not a very  effective

way  in  reaching job seekers.  And if we look at the figures

closely  on  the  web, the occupational groups  of  cleaners,

labourers  and related workers are the largest group  of  job

seekers.   This  means that there are more people  than  jobs

available.   On  the  other  hand,  the  job  vacancies   for

production  craftsmen,  machine  operators,  assemblers   and

related  workers, there are more jobs than there  are  people

wanting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>

to fill them.  As these two groups belong to the lower income

group,  I am concerned whether these trends reflected broadly

the  employment opportunities in our society.  If so, then  I

would imagine that what MOM  has to do is to train the excess

cleaners   and  labourers  to  take  up  jobs  as  production

craftsmen, machine operators, assemblers and related workers.

Who  would  play  this coordinating role?  Is  the  mechanism

being set up to track the people and companies on the web  or

is  it  merely a bulletin page for reference and  people  are

left on their own to seek employment?

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a broader level, we know that the factories in

Singapore hire an overwhelming number of workers from  nearby

township.   In  this respect, I think the  CDC  can  play  an

important  role  to match their employment  needs  with   the

older  lesser  educated  workers  who  find  the  CDCs   less

threatening than MOM's Employment Service Department.  I  was

told that there were exhibition fairs and keen employers  but

those who needed jobs did not turn up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the following can be done by each of the nine

CDCs.   Hire one or several full time job placement  officers

who  will  actively liaise with employers within the  CDC  to

counsel workers as to retraining opportunities as well as job

opportunities  and finally to play the very  important  human

role  of  matching employer and employee for workers who  are

threatened and intimidated by a high-tech world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, I could see the development of new jobs

within the CDC for the role of a worker-manager who is linked

up  to  multinational employment agency to identify new  jobs

and  using a job database to facilitate the matching process.

He or she could represent the job applicants to the companies

to  arrange  for different work schedules by redesigning  job

programmes in such a way that benefit employers and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not an easy process, but a flexible and

dynamic one which I believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>

can  help in redesigning our job landscape for women  workers

who  look for part-time or flexi-time work, older people  who

look  for  maybe  just two to three hours  of  work  to  keep

connected, for people with special needs like those  who  are

wheelchair bound and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe there is a role for human beings to play

this job matching function and I would urge the Government to

provide  adequate funds to each CDC so that this can be  done

efficiently.   And  I urge all the CDCs or Town  Councils  to

provide the leadership in driving this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also recommend setting up a telephone Jobline in

each  CDC so that all nine CDCs are in close touch with their

specific  community needs.  Unlike the National CDC Helpline,

the CDC Jobline approach is localised, focused and efficient.

The  Mayors and the respective MPs and grassroots leaders are

the  best consultants for identifying job and people's needs.

It  is  clearly revitalising a kampung gotong royong  spirit.

In  all  this talk about the new economy and job redesign,  I

have  come  across the 4Rs adopted by  MOM - the redeployment

of  displaced  workers, renewal of workforce, realignment  of

employment    practices,   revitalisation    of    employment

recreation.  These concepts, Sir, may be true and well at the

broader  national  level.  What I recommend  may  well  be  a

concrete   way  to  help  bridge  the  gap  between  national

strategies  and  the  real dilemma  of  the  older  and  less

educated workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, Singaporeans face stress at work,

stress  in schools and stress at home.  Stress at work arises

on two fronts.  Firstly, just keeping up with the pace of the

new   knowledge   and   new   technologies;   and   secondly,

concurrently managing the balance between these demands,  and

those of the home and family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on managing this work-family balance that I would

like  to  speak.  Essentially I am  talking  about  promoting

family  friendly  practices in our companies and  workplaces.

This  effort must be a joint effort, not of Government alone,

but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>

very   much  involving  the  initiative  and  commitment   of

employers, and indeed of our human resource professionals  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is a much greater awareness of the

importance  of  helping  employees  manage  this  work-family

balance  in the US and Europe, locally however, very  few  of

our companies have taken more than just rudimentary steps  in

the  direction  of  being family friendly.   Apart  from  the

recognition  that employees are more productive if  they  are

able  to  balance their work and personal lives  effectively,

there  are  benefits  of  being able to  retain  skilled  and

experienced   staff   and  these  benefits   are   real   and

quantifiable.

SNEF,  together  with MCD, MOM, and NTUC has already  made  a

start  in promoting family friendly practices among our local

firms,  in implementing a Family Friendly Award for companies

in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But SNEF can take the initiative of another step, by

galvanising   and  recruiting  enlightened  employers,   most

obviously the past and future winners of the Award,  to  come

together to share best practice and establish a self-help one-stop  shop  and  support  service,  for  employers  to  share

information  on work-family issues.  Very often,  it  is  not

being sensitised, not having an awareness of the implications

and also of the way we can address such issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing this, we do not have to re-invent the wheel,

but simply take the lead of organisations in other countries,

for  example, there is an  "Employers for Work-Life Balance",

an  alliance  of  major companies in the UK,  who  have  come

together  in  exactly  this  cause.   The  alliance  has   an

interesting and informative website, and provides information

on  case studies, and research and publications, including an

employer  manual on how to begin taking action  on  work-life

issues,  and  another  manual offering specific  guidance  to

small businesses.  We usually tend to think that the big boys

can  afford some of this but it is very hard for the  smaller

companies to look at family practices.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming together of these major companies, which

include  the  big banks, the accounting firms and  the  major

retailers  in  the  UK,  just to name  a  few,  endorses  the

business  benefits of implementing family friendly practices,

and it lends credibility and support to this enterprise.   In

addition, this alliance works in partnership with a long list

of voluntary and community organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for us to similarly energise into action in

Singapore  getting  firms together with  the  human  resource

institute  and  see  if we cannot just move  ourselves  at  a

little bit faster speed.   I know we are doing something, but

by  the time we get there it will be two more generations  of

young  Singaporeans having to struggle with this.   I  cannot

complete   without  at  least  asking  for   something   from

Government.  We would disappoint every Member in  the  House.

Certainly  Government can also help in this, over  and  above

its role as an employer, of course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Productivity and Standards Board has just

last  month  announced  its  new $50  million  Work  Redesign

Programme to encourage companies to review and revamp the way

they  work  so  as  to  improve productivity.   The  projects

approved for support under the programme should include  work

redesign  to  enable and facilitate family friendly  flexible

working patterns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MOM could commission local cost-benefit

analyses on family friendly practices to demonstrate to local

companies  that the experience of US and European  companies,

of  tangible  benefits  to  be had from  implementing  family

friendly practices, holds true also for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MOM could help in producing informational

material such as manuals and training guides for the use  and

guidance of employers that local companies could use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fourthly, the PSB should include family friendly

practices as a component

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>

of  the  Singapore Quality Class and Singapore Quality  Award

criteria.   This would certainly help to focus  attention  of

companies  on  doing something about it.  And ,  as  a  small

bonus,  the Minister could convince IRAS to throw  in  double

tax  deductions  to companies for expenditures  on  providing

family friendly benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, a separate but related initiative, I

believe  MOM  is  looking  at  how  it  can  facilitate   the

development of a home management industry at community level.

Such  a  development would provide a most welcome  additional

source of assistance to working homemakers in juggling  their

varied responsibilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I want to ask the Minister some

questions  on  the alternative arrangements in  a  knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new development in work arrangement under a

KBE  including  flexi-time  working  at  home,  stock  option

schemes, etc., which are used to facilitate the new knowledge

workers,  there  is  also  a  need  to  incorporate   a   new

compensation  and  worker  welfare scheme  into  our  current

system.   For example, currently employees' medical coverage,

work  remuneration,  savings  in  the  CPF,  leave,  workers'

compensation are all found under the Employment  Act  in  the

ambit  of  the  employment relationship.   When  workers  are

engaged  on contract schemes for intensive work and are  paid

in  wages or stock options, and perhaps working most  of  the

time  outside the office, how does the Ministry  ensure  that

these   workers  will  also  have  sufficient   savings   for

retirement and medical cost, savings for training, etc,  when

they reach old age so that they will not become dependent  on

the  State, and that when these new economy workers reach old

age they will be adequately protected?   We can either devise

a  new system of contract service employment or we can pep up

the  existing  Employment Act to meet these new requirements.

I hope the Minister will elaborate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, during the debate on the Budget, I

spoke about the part-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>

time   and  contract workers.  I am concerned today with  the

situation of our part time and contract workers, most of whom

are less skilled and less well worth off.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these people generally face difficulties in

getting  full-time job because they lack the skills  and  are

maybe in the process of acquiring new skills, or deemed to be

too  old  by  employers.   But these workers  have  financial

commitments to honour.  With their already lower income  from

part-time or contract work, and their CPF savings being  very

small,   they  will  face  difficulties  in  their  financial

commitment.   In comparison to other sectors of  the  working

population,  they  possess fewer savings.   Unlike  full-time

workers,  part-time  and  contract workers  have  no  medical

benefits  and  are  not even granted the  basic  sick  leave.

Generally,  they  do not even have any CPF contribution,  and

this  makes it impossible for them to plan for their  future.

Simply  put, if they are unable to work, they would  not  get

paid.   It  is  likely that they would not have any  form  of

savings to fall back on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of part-time and contract workers is still

small.   It  is  growing.   The long term  solution  to  this

problem  lies  in  getting  this  group  of  workers   skills

upgrading  courses.  We have done quite well  here  and  have

achieved  some  measure of success.  But  due  to  the  large

number  and  there  is  time lag in training  them,  we  will

continue  to have a large number of people who may be  unable

to  get  full time jobs and unable to honour their  financial

commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not realistic to expect employers to give

full  benefits to this group of workers, there  is  space  to

provide  a  higher minimum social safety net.   For  example,

they  could  have regular but reduced CPF contributions  from

their  employer's side based on their average monthly income,

which  at  least  means  regular  payment  into  their   CPF.

Employers  can  also  be  required  to  provide  the  minimum

insurance coverage to contract

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>

workers.  A system of medical co-payment would help our part-time  and  contract workers.  It would enable them to  become

more  independent and they would be able to  plan  for  their

retirement as well as other needs, for example, repayment  of

their  HDB  mortgages without relying too  much   on  special

assistance schemes.  In the absence of any assistance to part-time  and  contract  workers, this group  would  be  severely

disadvantaged  in  the  rapid progress  of  our  society.   I

strongly urge that we help those who are most needy and there

is  little  doubt  that  this group of  workers  is  in  this

category.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have

spoken on the various subjects.  Let me now first respond  to

Mr  Ong  Ah  Heng.  He raised a number of issues.   First,  I

would  like  to  say that I agree with him that  one  of  the

problems that we are facing is this shift in the  industries.

They  have  to  move  away from low cost labour-intensive  to

more  high  value-added  which will result  in  the  emerging

structural  unemployment.   More  workers  are  going  to  be

retrenched from these lower skilled jobs and they just cannot

find alternative jobs unless they upgrade their skills.  So I

agree with Mr Ong  that retraining of the workers is critical

and  that retraining cannot be put off until the workers have

been  retrenched.  It will be rather late in the day to  talk

about  upgrading the skills of a worker on  the  eve  of  his

retrenchment.   Because  that means you  have  to  undergo  a

period of training before you can take on another job.  It is

better  for  a  worker in this situation, in such  vulnerable

jobs,  lower-skilled jobs, to constantly upgrade his  skills,

so   that   any   time  when  the  threat   of   retrenchment

materialised, he should be comfortable in the knowledge  that

he  has  acquired sufficient skills that will  allow  him  to

transit  to  a different job with another company,  or  maybe

even  undergo  a short period of retraining to take  on  jobs

that are available in other sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is one aspect that we have to be well aware

of,  that as we evolve into a knowledge-based economy and  as

we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>

face the pressures of globalisation, our workers are going to

be  exposed  to  the  full pressures of  global  competition.

Skilled workers will remain in demand in Singapore, like they

are  in  demand  everywhere  else.   For  instance,  recently

Germany  has  announced that they want to open the  doors  to

75,000 IT professionals.  There are jobs going for this  area

and they cannot find enough people.  The US is also facing  a

severe shortage and they have already increased the visas for

professionals  for  skilled  workers  from  about  65,000  to

150,000.   In  fact,  the  employers  there  in  the  US  are

clamouring  for  even more for this type of  H1B  visas.   So

strong demand will really push up the wages of these workers,

the   highly-skilled  workers.   But,  at  the   same   time,

technological changes will also compel these skilled  workers

to undergo constant upgrading, and they should not put it off

until  the  threat of retrenchment is imminent.  They  should

constantly  make  effort  to upgrade  their  skills  to  stay

relevant, to remain employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have our lower-skilled workers.

They  will  face  threats  of unemployment,  as  Mr  Ong  has

mentioned,  because many of the jobs are going to  be  phased

out  as  the  company relocates from Singapore, because  they

find  that  the environment is too costly for  that  type  of

operation.   For this group of workers, skills  upgrading  is

even  more  critical.   It will really  make  the  difference

between  getting an alternative job or remaining  permanently

unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also mentioned that maybe we should have some

incentives to encourage employers to hire older workers.   We

already do give employers such incentives by way of providing

a  higher  level of subsidy for their training and retraining

under  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme.  Employees  above

the  age  of 40 can receive 100% full subsidy on all training

expenses and up to 85% subsidy for absentee payroll under the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme.  So I think this would  help

employers to overcome the mindset about the reluctance to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>

employ  older workers.  But, at the same time, we  should  be

careful.  We should not go overboard with incentives so  much

so that it could distort the labour market and create a sense

of  complacency among older workers that, in fact,  they  are

going to be guaranteed a job, regardless of what happens.   I

think  we want the older workers to also feel the same  sense

of  urgency  that they must make personal effort  to  upgrade

their skills, so that they will stay employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the other Member who spoke on this issue is Mr

Chay  who has commented on the group of workers who  may  not

have the basic ability to be upgraded broadly because of  the

low  level of education.  I mentioned just now in my response

to  Mr  Charles Chong that we are equally concerned  if  this

group  of  Singaporeans, who through lack of education,  will

have  greater difficulty to be upgraded.  Our approach is  to

try  to  re-engineer jobs in different sectors so  that  this

group  of  lowly  educated workers can also find  alternative

employment.   For instance, we have initiated a  strategy  in

the cleaning industry and the construction industry.  We want

to transform jobs in these industries into more skilled jobs,

into  higher value-added jobs, so that older workers who  are

retrenched  from their jobs in the manufacturing sector,  for

instance, could move into these new jobs with minimal  amount

of  retraining.  Such retraining would be at a level which we

believe these older workers would be able to cope with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with his idea of introducing skills multiplier,

in  other words, helping our workers to be more adaptable and

to  have greater capabilities to cope with the demand of  the

new  jobs.  I mentioned earlier on in my response to Mr Chong

that  we  will, in fact, encourage the workers,  particularly

those with post-secondary education, to move into more multi-disciplinary  training.   But at  the  level  of  the  mature

workers,  we will also have programmes under the Manpower  21

initiatives to help workers who need to acquire new skills or

different skills in order to remain employable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has asked what would be the projected

unemployment rate this year.  In 1998, when we faced the full

brunt  of the economic downturn, we saw about 29,100  workers

retrenched  over  the year.  Last year,  in  1999,  when  the

economy  started  to  recover, we saw  14,600  workers  being

retrenched.  Prior to the crisis, the average retrenchment  a

year  was around 10,000.  So I would say that this year,  the

likely retrenchment numbers are going to be somewhere between

10,000  and  15,000,  unless something  exceptional  happens,

because  the  process of restructuring will continue.   Faced

with   greater  competition,  companies  will   continue   to

restructure, particularly in sectors like electronics,  where

the margins are getting thinner, and there will be tremendous

push to raise productivity and cut costs.  In the process  of

restructuring  and redistributing their operation  where  the

lower  value-added operations are moved out of Singapore,  we

have  to  anticipate continuing retrenchment in this  sector.

So  while  new jobs are being created, we are also  going  to

lose  some  other  jobs.  I would expect retrenchment  to  be

somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Inderjit Singh who suggested a scheme

to  prevent job-hopping.  I am glad that Mr Singh has  agreed

that  the  CPF is really not the mechanism, because this  was

proposed  previously.   He  has  now  come  up  with  a   new

suggestion,  a  national  compulsory  savings  scheme,  where

employees and the employers can jointly contribute to a  fund

which  will  be  used  to  pay  a gratuity  for  long-staying

employees.   I  think the approach is sound.   I  agree  with

that, and I would support employers who want to set up such a

fund.  But my question is:  Do we have to make it compulsory?

Do  we have to apply this across the board to everybody?   As

it  stands  today, there is nothing to stop an employer  from

negotiating  with the union or with the employees  concerned,

if they are non-unionised, to say that they will put aside  a

certain amount, whether it is from the wage increase or  from

the  end-of-the-year bonus and keep this as  a  part  of  the

gratuity to be paid periodically.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is entirely possible, especially if the

employer  were to tell the union or the employee that  he  is

going  to make an additional contribution to this fund, which

his  employee  will benefit from if he stays  for  a  certain

period  of time.  So I think this can be done now, and  I  do

not  really think that we need to make it a mandatory  system

to be applied across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a scheme would, in fact, reinforce other schemes to

reward  their long-serving employees.  For instance, employee

stock option scheme is, in fact, attracting growing interest,

and the Minister for Finance has announced that tax incentive

for employee stock option scheme will be reviewed and studied

to see how it could be made more favourable, particularly for

the high-tech start-up companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I want to explain why I am not quite

keen  to make this a mandatory system.  As Mr Singh has  said

earlier on, job-hopping is quite a complex issue, and I  also

believe that some degree of job mobility is helpful.  It sort

of  lubricates  the labour market.  In fact,  with  rapid  IT

development  and  globalisation, I  think  job  mobility  has

increasingly become an essential feature of today's knowledge-based economy.  People move swiftly to jobs and opportunities

where  their  skills and abilities are most valued.   Let  me

quote  the  President and CEO of Korn/Ferry International,  a

leading  USA  executive search firm, Windle Priem,  who  said

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Internet revolution means employees and executives

know  their value on the market in a click.  With the average

employee  changing jobs five times in his career, as  opposed

to two times, the framework has changed dramatically."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the new economy, market condition changes

rapidly.  Competition is global, capital abundant, and people

must  be  prepared to seize opportunity quickly, just  as  Mr

Singh  himself  has  closed a deal in 48  hours  at  Internet

speed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key for companies to win in this economic race is

whether  they are able to recruit and retain the best talent.

With skilled employees in short supply in all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>

sectors,  companies  must  provide  innovative  and  flexible

remuneration packages to compete and retain the best  people.

For  example, Intel Corporation was one of the first  to  use

employee   stock   option  scheme  as  part   of   employees'

compensation.  Interwoven, a leading edge enterprise software

developer  on  Web  infrastructure  and  content  management,

recruits  engineers with the lure of a BMW.  And I just  read

this   morning  in  the  Straits  Times  that  a  New  Jersey

technology company called ARCNET is also using BMWs to retain

its  staff.   The company offers the staff a BMW  after  they

have stayed for one year.  I am not saying that we should  do

the  same  in Singapore.  But I am saying that these examples

illustrate that successful companies use incentives to retain

their  valuable employees.  They did not wait  for  mandatory

schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our employees must do likewise. If we restrict

labour  mobility,  my  fear is that our young,  creative  and

dynamic  talent  will  be  drawn elsewhere.   They  could  be

attracted  to freer labour market where they can apply  their

skills   for   maximum  return  without  restrictions.    For

instance, if in the Silicon Valley there is a rule to prevent

job-hopping, to prevent people from switching jobs  or  there

is a mandatory scheme which will result in some personal loss

if  you  switch jobs too quickly, will the Valley be able  to

spawn so many success stories and innovations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a competition for talent in this new economy.

So   tying   people  down  through  locking  part  of   their

remuneration  or  other mandatory savings  plan  may  not  be

desirable  or,  in  fact, appropriate in  this  new  economy.

Apart  from  not  attracting the talent that you  need,  this

additional labour market rigidity could translate into higher

business  cost for some other companies.  I think  we  should

leave  it  to  employers to exercise their innovativeness  to

come  up  with  packages and plans which will  help  them  to

retain the talent that they need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mdm Claire Chiang's point. She also

talked about structural

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>

unemployment,  particularly the problem  of  older  and  less

educated workers and the mis-match between job vacancies  and

job  applicants.  These are issues that we are very concerned

with.   As  I have explained in my response to other Members,

these  are  issues that we will continue to address,  and  we

will  come  up with programmes to tackle them, ie,  mis-match

and emerging structural unemployment.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also made a point about CDCs playing a role as a job-matching agency. I completely agree with her. There is

tremendous scope and opportunity for the CDCs to play a  very

useful  and  effective  role  in  helping  the  older,   less

educated,   less  well-informed  and  non-Internet  initiated

people  to  find  jobs.   In fact, my  Ministry  is  actually

working  on  this.   We  are  taking  up  this  approach   to

collaborate with the CDCs.  We have already done so  in  1998

when  the  economy went into a downturn.  We worked with  the

CDCs  and  CCCs  of various constituencies  to  organise  job

fairs.   We  brought  groups  of employers,  who  were  still

recruiting workers during the economic downturn, down to  the

constituencies.    We   provided  the   framework   and   the

organisation  for them to put up stands.  And  we  publicised

and  attracted  people  living  in  the  surrounding  housing

estates  to  come  down  and  look  at  what  were  the   job

opportunities available, and helped those who were unemployed

to  get  jobs and in fact conducted the interviews there  and

then  to be considered for various job vacancies.  So we have

already been doing that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to go one step further, along the line that the

Member  has  suggested, by working closely with the  CDCs  to

offer  a more easily accessible and a more comprehensive  job

matching  service.  We are thinking of starting  up  one-stop

career  centres  to  be  located in the  housing  estates  in

collaboration  with the CDCs.  These centres will  provide  a

full  range  of services to job seekers, not just identifying

possible  job  vacancies for them, but actually looking  into

the skills requirement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>

of these jobs and then assessing the skills capability of the

person  who  is looking for the job.  In fact,  advising  him

where  to go to get the required skills upgrading, what  kind

of  schemes  would  be available to him  to  get  subsidy  or

funding  to undergo the skills upgrading so that he can  take

on the job.  In other words, it performs a much higher value-added job matching service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to launch the first one-stop career centre

later  this year in collaboration with one of the  CDCs.   We

want  to take it up as a pilot project first to see how  well

it  can  be  translated in real life.  As  regards  telephone

jobline,  we can consider this in the context of our one-stop

career centre to make it easily accessible to anybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Dr Jennifer Lee. She spoke on the

importance  of  balancing the demands of home  and  work.   I

agree   entirely  with  her  that  we  should  try  to   help

Singaporeans balance the demands of home and work.  As I said

earlier  on,  if  we  can increase the  female  labour  force

participation  rate  by  3%,  we have  an  additional  40,000

workers to contribute to the economic effort.  So it  is  not

to  be  trifled with.  It is a very significant contribution.

Increasingly, many of the housewives are better educated  and

have  useful  skills that can make a significant contribution

to our economic effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also accept the point that there is no need to

reinvent  the  wheel.   We should learn from  other  people's

experience.  In a way, we are doing that.  As I mentioned  in

my  response  to  Mr Thomas, we have set up a Human  Resource

Promotion  Section within the Ministry.  The mission  of  the

unit  is  in fact to promote awareness and implementation  of

good  HR practices.  We will source out companies which  have

implemented good HR practices and we will then develop  these

as case studies to be shared with the other employers so that

they  can also test out such innovation in their own  context

and,  hopefully, help their workers or employees  to  balance

the  needs of home and work.  We will particularly be looking

at  companies that have introduced flexible work arrangements

which  are better suited to help women balance the  needs  of

home and work.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>

Where  there  are  local consultants or people  with  similar

expertise,  as  mentioned by Dr Lee, we  will  certainly  tap

their  expertise to help us improve this kind of HR promotion

effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pass on the suggestion to the Productivity and

Standards Board to consider family friendly practices as part

of  the  Quality Award.  This is something we should consider

to  give  greater recognition.  I know that  since  1997,  we

already  have this Family Friendly Firm Award as  a  form  of

recognition.   This was instituted together with  NTUC,  SNEF

and  Ministry of Community Development.  We will continue  to

do  this and we will continue to refine the framework so that

it   gives   greater  recognition  to  companies  that   have

instituted family friendly practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On double tax deduction for family friendly practices,

this  is  something that has got to be considered by IRAS  as

there are tax implications.  I am not in a position to commit

whether or not we should do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the home management industry, mentioned by Dr Lee,

yes,  this  is something that we are looking into because  we

firmly   believe  that  there  is  opportunity  for  a   home

management  industry to be organised in Singapore  to  enable

more of our women to go out and join the labour force and yet

have some of the duties, ie, the household chores, to be done

properly  by a professional group.  This is an area  that  my

Ministry  is  exploring.   We  are  talking  with  interested

parties to see whether they have an interest in initiating or

starting up such ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Chay Wai Chuen who pointed out that,

under  the  knowledge-based economy, you are  going  to  have

various  innovative work arrangements, some of which we  have

touched   on  earlier  in  connection  with  family  friendly

practices,  like  flexi-time, working  at  home  and  also  a

remuneration or compensation system that includes  new  ideas

like stock option scheme.  But his concern is whether workers

who  are  hired by companies on a contract basis or  who  are

working outside

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>

the  office most of the time, are covered.  Let me assure him

that  as  long as the person is an employee and there  is  an

employer-employee relationship, whether the person  works  in

the  office  full-time or part-time, or  whether  the  person

works  at  home full-time or part-time is not relevant.   The

person  will still be covered by the Employment Act  and  the

employer  in this instance will still have to contribute  CPF

at  the  statutory rate, and in the case of medical benefits,

like  sick  leave,  etc, the person is entitled  to  what  is

stated in the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if a person is working part-time only, then

we  have  in  fact  a guideline on part-time work  regulation

under  the  Employment Act which will enable the employer  to

recruit part-time workers and offer them benefits on  a  pro-rata  basis.   But the important point to note here  is  that

even part-time workers are entitled to the benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also concerned that some of these workers may not

be  able to save enough for their old age, particularly, with

regard  to medical expenses.  As I have pointed out,  in  the

case  of those who are actually employees, they will be  able

to  accumulate  CPF  savings like any other  workers  at  the

statutory contribution rates.  The concern is with the  group

who  is self-employed.  This is the group that does not  have

to  make  any  mandatory  CPF  contribution  except  for  the

Medisave.    A  lot  of  them  do  not  make  any   voluntary

contribution despite the fact that, if you are self-employed,

you  can make voluntary contribution and benefit from the tax

exemption  for your voluntary contribution up  to  a  certain

limit which, I believe, is around $14,000.  So for this group

of  self-employed who only contributes to Medisave, they will

obviously not be accumulating sufficient savings in their CPF

accounts  for their old age.  We have to consider whether  we

should  progressively encourage this group to also contribute

to  the  CPF.   One  way  to start is to introduce  mandatory

savings  in the Special Account for this group so  that  they

can accumulate savings for their retirement expenses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>

because  most  of  the money in the Special Account  will  go

towards their retirement expenses.  This is actually in  line

with  what was recommended by the Inter-ministerial Committee

on  Ageing  Population.  This is an area that my Ministry  is

studying.   We  are  assessing whether we  should  move  into

requiring   the   self-employed  to   also   make   mandatory

contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Hawazi Daipi. Basically, he also

raised  the concern about part-time and contract workers  who

do  not get medical benefits and CPF.  As I said earlier  on,

if they are in fact employees, regardless of whether they are

part-time  or  full-time,  they  are  entitled  to  the  same

benefits  spelt out in the law.  So the question of requiring

part-time or contract workers to contribute lower but regular

payments  to  CPF  is linked to whether we should  make  this

group,   that   is  presently  not  included  in   this   CPF

contribution  framework, to also contribute, in other  words,

to bring in the self-employed.  As I mentioned earlier on, we

will  look into whether we should make it mandatory  for  the

self-employed to also contribute to the  Special  Account  in

order  to  help  them build up savings for  their  retirement

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have covered most of the points that were

raised by Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, one of the

objectives  of the National Skills Recognition System  (NSRS)

is  to  help  workers secure re-employment  should  the  need

arise.  I would urge the Ministry of Manpower to identify and

certify  more skills that are suitable for older workers  and

lower  educated  workers.  These two groups  of  workers  are

vulnerable to any structural change in our economy  and  many

may  lose their jobs.  In fact, many have lost their jobs and

cannot find a new job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSRS should set priority on these two groups of

workers so that many of them can benefit from the system  and

have  a  clear  competency  for  re-employment.   The  course

content,  training pace and language of instruction  have  to

take into account the uniqueness of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>

particular industry and profile of the workers.  Let me  cite

one  example.   I  remember that when I was a  young  boy,  I

followed my mother to a goldsmith's shop.  She bought a piece

of  gold ring.  She was told that the weight of the gold  was

so  much,  according to the day's market price of $20.   That

part  you  could not bargain.  But it was the gong qian  (the

craftmanship)  that was $5 which you could bargain.   So  $20

plus $5 was $25, and you must pay.  I remember that my mother

bargained for 50 cents less, so it was $24.50.  You could buy

the gold ring.  So who set the value of the craftmanship?  In

fact,  today, when you walk into any jewellery or goldsmith's

shop,  the  same thing applies.  The price of the  gold,  you

cannot  bargain.   In  the matter of  craftmanship,  you  can

bargain  for  another  $1 or $2 less.  Again,  who  sets  the

value?  Who certifies the skills?  Can we re-skill or upgrade

their skills so that they come out with better and variegated

designs  and our lower educated or older workers can enjoy  a

better standard of living through NSRS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as skills are certified at industry level

and is driven by industry under the NSRS, it is difficult  to

get various companies, especially the smaller companies where

these  two groups of workers are employed, to agree  on  what

are  the  generic  skills required  for  the  industry.   The

problem  has become more complicated when it comes to similar

companies  in  the  same  industry  to  share  the   training

strategies  due to competition in the same industry.   NTUC's

experience is that the certification assessment structure  of

the  NSRS  has so far been flexible enough to meet the  tight

operational  requirements of the industry needs such  as  the

taxi industry or public bus.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to urge MOM to be more proactive

and  create awareness among the industries that need the NSRS

system and urge the industry not just to be responsive to the

industry's  development. The certification  process  must  be

running ahead of the industry so that older workers and lower

educated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>

workers are reskilled and upgraded well in advance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, in the M21 plan, the National

Skills Recognition System will incorporate modularity in  the

course  content and the certification of skill  competencies.

This  is  a  scheme that deserves to be supported.   I  feel,

however,  that  there is a need for industry  experts  to  be

involved to map out the skills set for this NSRS.  This  must

be  people  who  have  long experience  in  the  industry  or

involved  with the evolution of industry clusters locally  as

well as internationally. For example, the retail industry  is

mashed into logistics and supply chain. Hence, the skills set

for  the retail industry must be widened.  Conversely, people

from  the freight delivery handling sector also converge into

retailing  and e-tailing.  Such industry experts should  also

be  aware  of the strategic directions of the investments  in

our  economy,  as well as internationally. This is  necessary

because otherwise, we may come up with a very limited map  or

a  map  for  yesterday's industry skills and this map  should

always  be  periodically reviewed.  A map  devised  by  human

resource   managers  or  even  training   managers   is   not

necessarily the right map for the NSRS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with the rapid

advance  in IT today, we must consistently upgrade ourselves,

otherwise,  we  will  be  lagging behind  others.  We  should

therefore  encourage  our workers to learn  and  continue  to

learn  and  to  cultivate the concept of life-long  learning.

Some  workers  who  are  aware of  the  need  for  continuous

learning  have  gone to attend classes to upgrade  themselves

and  hence enhance their market values, while others have not

seen  such a need. Some do not even know where to attend such

classes  and  maybe there is no impetus to motivate  them  to

learn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 plan formulated last year aims to

promote life-long learning and to set up a national institute

to realise such a plan.  But I am particularly concerned with

workers  who  are in the service sector. They  urgently  need

such upgrading but they lack the necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>

encouragement  and information on how to go about  doing  it,

whereas  in the manufacturing sector, a lot has been done  in

this  area.   With  the participation of  some  companies,  a

series of technical courses have been designed and conducted.

Moreover,  there  is  a comprehensive range  of  standardised

courses  for the workers.  But workers in the service  sector

have  been  neglected. How do workers in the  service  sector

upgrade themselves?  What suitable courses are available  for

them?  What types of jobs would no longer be available?  What

new  skills must they learn?  All these questions  should  be

comprehensively   addressed  in  the  report   on   life-long

learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite an example. I know of an unemployed student

who   has   studied  mass  communications  in   an   overseas

university.  He  would like to work in the IT  industry.   He

consulted  a  professional who worked in the IT  industry  on

what  sort  of  IT courses he should take up.  He  wished  to

pursue  an  external Masters degree on IT  for  non-IT  savvy

people conducted by a private institution. After reading  the

prospectus  for the course, he felt confident that  he  could

complete such a course.  However, his friend advised him  not

to  pursue  such  a  course because it was meant  for  senior

managers  who  need  IT  knowledge  to  help  them  formulate

policies.  It was not a course on how to use IT.  Eventually,

he chose a diploma course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example concerns a worker in his 40s. Like

other workers, he was eager to upgrade himself by attending a

personnel management course which had nothing to do with  his

present  job.   Having completed this course,  he  was  still

doing  the same job and he felt that it was a waste  of  time

getting such a diploma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that there are many people who have had

such  similar experiences.  Life-long learning is not  a  new

concept.  In  the past, we have adult education  courses  for

people who, for some reasons, could not complete their formal

schooling in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>

their  younger  days and would like to catch  up  with  their

studies,  and for those who have finished a certain level  of

their  formal education but would like to upgrade  themselves

professionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, life-long learning is no longer the pursuit

of  formal  education but an effort to ensure one's life-long

employability  in  the changing labour  market  and  to  stay

competitive. As such, our national life-long learning concept

should  encompass workers in all sectors to  enable  them  to

upgrade their skills and to change jobs.  Employers should be

involved in training their workers and when they have  learnt

certain new or better skills, due recognition should be given

to them, though not necessarily in monetary form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a related issue. As the objective

of   life-long   learning   is   to   ensure   the   workers'

employability, it is the employers who should undertake  such

a task as they know better what their workers need.  But many

employers  are  not  taking  the  initiative.  We  have  many

excellent  managerial  people.   This  is  evidenced  by  our

ranking  by  the  World Economic Forum and other  independent

organisations.  Therefore, our managerial staff  can  upgrade

themselves,   particularly  in   areas   such   as   business

strategies, decision-making and human resource management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to remind this House that while urging

our  workers  to upgrade themselves, we should  provide  them

with the necessary information and incentives and should  not

resort to applying pressure on them.  In this way, they  will

be  more interested in learning a new skill and feel that  it

is to their benefit that they do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in last

year's  Budget  debate,  I  pointed  out  that  the  training

programmes  of workers have to be supported and  approved  by

employers. I am glad to know that now the workers can  go  to

the CDAC or the CIDB as their "surrogate employers" to obtain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>

training  and  retraining.  But   this  "surrogate  employer"

scheme   has  not  been  publicized and  made  known  to  the

workers.   I think MOM has to step up its publicity of  these

training  programmes  for  workers  so  that  they  know  the

channels  to which they can obtain such training  and  skills

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my meet-the-people sessions, quite a number of

people  came  and  told me that they were  facing  employment

problems.  Broadly,  there  are  two  classes  of  unemployed

workers.  One  class  is 40 years and  below,  but  with  low

education  and low skills. They have to compete with  foreign

workers and they either lose their jobs or their incomes  are

reduced. The other group consists of those above the  age  of

40  years.   Some  of them have some skills,  some  with  low

education and some have no skills and they could only go  for

odd jobs because most of them are not unionised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These workers are facing difficulties in finding jobs.

We  can  imagine  that  when  our economic  restructuring  is

complete, it would be even more difficult for these people to

find jobs suitable to them.  MOM should look after the plight

of  such  people  and give them the proper training  and  job

opportunities so that they will be able to contribute in  the

framework of our new economy.  I do not know how many of such

workers  we  have.  Maybe MOM can give us some figures.   But

even  if  this  is only a small number, they  should  not  be

overlooked because they are most vulnerable. They are part of

us.  We  expect MOM to give them all the necessary  help  and

support.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am addressing

employment and challenges of a group of older people  on  the

other  end  of the spectrum. These are not the over  40s  who

have  secondary  education, in the unskilled or  semi-skilled

category.  They  are the over-40s who have post-secondary  or

even  higher  educational qualifications in the  professional

and  management categories who are also not spared  from  the

trauma of unemployment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the web page in MOM again under the section on job

sought  and vacancies available in December 1999, there  were

more  people in this category looking for suitable  placement

than  there are jobs.  In fact, during the economic downturn,

those retrenched had turned to taxi-driving and various other

means  of livelihood not quite befitting their qualifications

but  they  tried  their best to make ends meet  in  order  to

support a growing family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, for companies not in the manufacturing sector,

which  were  and  are still restructuring,  streamlining  and

downsizing  to  survive, the layer of  personnel  they  would

first retrench is the middle management workers because  they

are  the ones who constitute higher operation cost and  their

retrenchment  actually  makes  a  significant  shift  in  the

company's bottomline. This middle management layer are  those

usually  in  the  40s,  who  cannot  benefit  from  the   SDF

programme.  May I just add that, unlike previous years,  when

the  social  service centres were frequented  by  women  help

seekers,  they are currently responding to increasing  number

of  men on the helpline and in face-to-face counselling.  The

highest  worry  is  the loss of jobs which  clearly  affected

their  self-esteem. This has a triggering  effect  on  family

dynamics and equilibrium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek the Minister's direction on what

more  we can do for these educated 40s, who are neither  here

nor  there,  to stay competitive and employable in  our  lead

towards KBE. What concrete help can we extend to them to  tap

their  productivity? Can we also launch a sector  driven  SRP

for  the professionals and mainstream occupational groups  to

see  how they can reskill and redeploy the talents in the new

economy?   If  they were to get a MBA course, Sir,  where  do

they get the money and how do they pay for the mortgages, and

what  does  the family live on?  It would only add  financial

stress  to  the  family.  I seek the Minister's  comments  on

these matters.
