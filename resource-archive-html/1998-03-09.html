<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHED WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Retraining for alternative jobs)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Labour whether, in the light of

the economic down turn and the possibility of more workers being

retrenched,  the  Government  has taken  any  steps  to  retrain

workers, who are retrenched, for alternative jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Question No. 1.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> There are

presently   several  Government-supported  schemes   to   assist

retrenched workers in enhancing their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) funded by

Government  and  managed by the National Trades Union  Congress,

employers  who  recruit  retrenched  workers  could  apply   for

training grant to upgrade the skills of the workers so that they

could  meet  the needs of the new jobs. The SRP is targetted  at

less educated workers in their 30s and 40s, who may face greater

difficulty seeking re-employment.  Government's support is up to

80%  of course fees to be paid by the Productivity and Standards

Board (PSB) from the Skills Development Fund (SDF) and up to 70%

of  absentee payroll subject to a maximum of $4.20 per  trainee-hour, paid by EDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been informed that to date, 1,230 workers have

gone  through or are undergoing certifiable training  under  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme.  Of these workers, more than 50%

are  above  the  age  of  40 and approximately  70%  have  below

Secondary 2 education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance is also granted to the retrenched workers under

the  tripartite "Back to Work" Programme launched  in  September

1996 by my Ministry together with the Productivity and Standards

Board,  the  National Trades Union Congress  and  the  Singapore

National Employers Federation. The assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



includes  helping the retrenched workers find suitable jobs  and

encouraging  employers to employ retrenched  workers  through  a

training grant which enables the workers to undergo Core  Skills

and Job Skills Training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Skills Training includes confidence building, personal

effectiveness and basic computer literacy. The training is fully

supported  by the SDF which provides a flat grant  of  $350  per

trainee  including an allowance of $100 to each trainee to  help

defray his meals and transport expenses. Job Skills Training  is

for  the  purpose  of  helping the workers to  acquire  specific

skills  required  for  the  jobs. For such  training,  SDF  will

provide  enhanced  funding up to 80%  of  the  course  fees  for

external  training programme or $4 per trainee hour for  on-the-job training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in anticipation of more retrenchments in the coming

months as a result of the regional financial crisis and slowdown

in  the  economy, my Ministry has recently set up  a  Tripartite

Panel on Retrenched Workers comprising representatives from  the

EDB, NTUC, SNEF, PSB and my Ministry itself to assist retrenched

workers  seek  re-employment.  The  Panel  will  also  encourage

employers to take advantage of available training incentives  to

improve  the  skills of their workers during  the  lull  period.

Workers, on the other hand, are urged to take training and skill

upgrading   seriously  so  that  they  can   remain   employable

especially during an economic slowdown.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> As I

understand  from the Minister, 80% of the cost  will  be  funded

from  the  Government.  Is it the intention that the  retrenched

workers should bear the 20%?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the SRP which is

targetted  at  the  older  and less educated  workers,  we  have

identified   workers  who  may  be  retrenched  and   who   need

alternative jobs.  The programme is available to them while they

are  still  being employed by the existing employer  and,  as  a

result, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



Government's  support, 80% of the cost of  retraining  them  for

some  other jobs would be borne by Government, while  the  other

20%  would  be  borne by the existing employers.   If  they  are

already  recruited by a new employer, the new employer can  take

up the other 20% of the cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask how much of this has been brought

to the notice of the workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the SRP is a

very  well publicised programme.  Since December 1996,  when  it

was  first launched by the National Trades Union Congress,  they

have done a lot to publicise the programme, ie, the benefits and

advantages of participating in the programme.  In fact,  if  the

Member  had  taken the trouble to read the NTUC News  dated  6th

March ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I do not read it!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I think the Member should from time to

time  read it to keep himself apprised of the good work that  is

being done by the NTUC and the massive effort that the NTUC  has

been involved in in trying to help the workers.  There are a lot

of  details  in the report and they are all publicised.   It  is

also duly reported in the media what NTUC has been doing to help

workers  to  upgrade their skills.  In fact,  I  would  like  to

mention  that  in this report of 6th March, it was  stated  that

they have signed up quite a large number of employers under  the

new  phase to launch further Skills Redevelopment Programme  for

their  workers  and  currently, a  total  of  76  companies  are

participating and 5,000 workers are involved in the scheme.

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST MASSIVE BLACKOUT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry

what  measures already exist, and what additional  measures  are

needed,  to  safeguard  against  the  occurrence  of  a  massive

blackout  like  that  which  recently  affected  Auckland,   New

Zealand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> The cause of the recent cable failures in

Auckland,  New Zealand, has yet to be established. According  to

some  reports, they were probably caused by the abnormal  drying

up  of the soil surrounding the cables due to the prolonged  hot

and  dry summer. Consequently, heat could not be conducted  away

from   the   heavily  loaded  cables  fast  enough.  The   cable

temperature   could   have   risen   well   above   its   design

specifications, leading to the cascading cable failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such form of cable failure is unlikely in Singapore as

PowerGrid  Ltd, the electricity network operator  in  Singapore,

has instituted the following measures:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, PowerGrid has built a strong transmission

network.  For example, the CBD network is supplied  by  multiple

230 kV sources and is interconnected to provide contingencies to

take care of unforeseen cable failures or damages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, PowerGrid's 230 kV transmission cables are

installed  with  backfill  designed  to  ensure  efficient  heat

dissipation and avoid thermal overloading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Thirdly, with advances in technology, Distributed

Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables are now available which  enable

real-time monitoring of the actual cable temperature.  PowerGrid

has  installed  such DTS cable on a 400 kV  cable  and  will  be

installing it on two additional 400 kV cables and future 230  kV

cables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PowerGrid has a rolling 10-year development plan to expand

and renew the network to meet Singapore's electricity demand  in

a reliable, secure and timely manner.  For example, PowerGrid is

currently  developing  a  new 230 kV substation  at  Peng  Nguan

Street  to  reinforce the network in anticipation of  the  CBD's

rising demand in the years to come.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Deferment of implementation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether he will defer the implementation of the Electronic  Road

Pricing (ERP) system after 1st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



April 1998, in view of the current difficult economic conditions

which will impact local businesses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  road pricing is a major pillar in our  long-term

strategy  to  keep our roads  free-flowing. Our  roads  are  our

economic arteries. If they get clogged, transport costs will  go

up, businesses will lose time and money, and the productivity of

our workers will suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road pricing has been implemented in Singapore since 1975

with  the  Area  Licensing Scheme, and recently  with  the  Road

Pricing  Scheme on our expressways.  It has been  successful  in

managing  the traffic on our roads.  But more needs to  be  done

because  on one hand our vehicle population is growing,  yet  on

the other hand our land area remains constant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) will replace both the ALS

and the RPS schemes.  It is more flexible, more efficient and in

the long run, more cost effective. It marks a shift in emphasis,

from  charging for vehicle ownership to charging for usage.   It

will   encourage  more  judicious  usage  and  keep  our   roads

congestion free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason to delay the start of ERP on 1st April

because  of the current economic situation. In fact, the current

slow-down should spur us to implement policies to strengthen our

advantages, like our transport system, in order to maintain  our

economic  competitiveness.  The ERP  and  the  new  vehicle  tax

structure revealed on 4th March serve this objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax structure and the package of ERP rebates

benefit  most motorists in general and businesses in particular.

For example, Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for tourist buses

will  be  reduced from 55% of Open Market Value (OMV) to  5%  of

OMV, Registration Fee (RF) for goods vehicles will be reduced by

as  much as $13,000, and ARF for engineering plant vehicles will

be waived.  The annual road tax of most commercial vehicles will

also  be  reduced  substantially, by as much as  $2,000.   Where

taxes have been increased, we will phase in the increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



over  three years.  To help businesses adjust to the ERP system,

we  will  phase-in  the ERP charges for all commercial  vehicles

over  the  next  three to four years.  In effect,  many  vehicle

owners  will pay lower road pricing charges than what  they  pay

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial vehicle owners and fleet operators will benefit

even  more if they exercise their ingenuity and discretion. They

can   reduce  their  ERP  bill  by  planning  their  routes  and

scheduling their delivery times carefully, and pooling transport

resources where possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister whether his Ministry has done any studies or comparison

for  companies  that  are involved in the transport  trade,  ie,

companies  that  are  going  to  use  a  lot  of  vehicles   for

transportation?   What would be the impact of  the  ERP  on  the

total  expenses before and after the implementation of  the  ERP

programme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for companies that are

involved  in  transport and logistics like  freight  forwarding,

there  will be a substantial reduction in their upfront cost  as

well  as in their road tax.  But on the other hand, the ERP will

add  cost to the usage of the roads.  How much additional  costs

they  will incur as a result of ERP is difficult for us  to  say

because  it  depends very much on their usage.  But  ultimately,

ERP  is a tool for us to help businesses to readjust the way  of

doing  business  and  to encourage them to use  the  roads  more

judiciously,  as  I said.  In the long run, if they  succeed  in

doing  so,  it  will even be more beneficial to  them.   Indeed,

companies  like  the bus companies and the taxi  companies  have

already  started to make use of technology, to make use  of  new

ways  of operating their business in order to adjust to the ERP.

In  so  doing, they will reap not only the full benefits of  the

upfront  tax reductions but they will also help to reduce  their

ERP bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> May I also ask the Minister that since

the ERP programme is going to be revenue neutral over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



longer  term,  in effect, would it not actually be loading  more

onto  companies that have to be involved in the transport  trade

compared to what they are now, because they are even now  loaded

against in terms of usage?  But after the implementation of  the

ERP, the loading could even be heavier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, as I said, if everything

remains  the same, if transport companies continue to run  their

business in the same way without making any adjustment, then the

answer is yes, there would be additional cost to them.  But this

is  precisely  the reason why we are implementing a  new  system

which  is charging for usage rather than charging for ownership.

Because there is now a rebalancing of the structure and there is

now  a shift of charges from ownership to usage, there will  be,

at  the very beginning, upfront savings for these companies that

the  Member  talks  about.  It is now a question  of  how  those

companies adjust their business in order to try and keep as much

as possible of those savings that have been given to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister agree that motorcycles

are used by the working class and people with low incomes to get

to  work?  In view of the possible pay cuts, even in basic  pay,

and  their loss of income, why should the Ministry not  consider

deferring  the implementation for  motorcycles at  least,  until

the situation improves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Member obviously has not read the

newspapers or the LTA webpages, in the same way that he has  not

read the NTUC News.  I would recommend that he does so before he

asks  this  question, because if he had, then he  would  realise

that  in fact 90% of the motorcyclists, with the phasing  in  of

road  taxes and with the ERP rebates that will be given to  them

in  the  first  few years, will actually either be paying  lower

road taxes or no road tax.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister

whether  the Ministry has done any survey on the impact  on  the

cost  of goods and services to consumers with the implementation

of ERP?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we have not done any detailed surveys

on the impact of ERP on goods and services.  But the Ministry of

Trade  and Industry has given us an indication that, all  things

being  equal,  there will be a marginal impact on  the  cost  of

doing  business.  Indeed  as a result of the massive tax rebates

that  have  been  given  to businesses, particularly  businesses

involved  in  transportation,  freight  forwarding  and  so  on,

hopefully  there will be some passing back of those  savings  to

the consumers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, since the Minister

intends to implement the system anyway, can I can ask why do  we

not bring the implementation date forward to the 1st April?  The

scheme  has already started to create a lot of confusion to  the

motor  traders.   Since we plan to implement it, why do  we  not

implement it on 1st April?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> May I ask the Member what confusion he is

talking about?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Especially in the area of commercial

vehicles,  with the registration fee coming down  by  a  drastic

amount,  a lot of companies that have placed orders for vehicles

are  waiting  or  cancelling their orders.   This  has  actually

created  problems for motor traders, and there is a wait-and-see

attitude.  In my opinion, since we have decided to implement the

scheme, we  could  bring forward the implementation date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the package of tax reductions and the

introduction  of  ERP  was done as a total  package.   In  other

words,  the  implementation  of ERP  is  actually  going  to  be

effective  in a very small way on 1st April, a very  small  way,

but in a more widespread way from 1st September.  Therefore, the

LTA  formulated  this package of measures to also  be  effective

from 1st September.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards motorists holding back their purchases, as far

as  those  who already have COEs in hand are concerned,  what  I

would term old COEs, there is really no reason for them to  hold

back  their  purchases because those with old COEs will  not  be

allowed  to  register their vehicles under the new  tax  regime.

That



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



would  be unfair to those who have already registered using  the

old  COEs.   Old  COEs already available   have to  be  used  to

register  vehicles using the old tax regime.  So there is  still

business to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards people holding back purchases of new vehicles,

the  Motor  Traders  Association and  other  parties  have  made

representations  to  the LTA.  The LTA  is  now  studying  these

representations  and  it  will  consider  these  views  and   an

announcement will be made one way or another very soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware

that  motorcyclists will eventually pay higher charges for  road

usage?  The fact is that they will have to pay much higher  road

tax after the phasing in of road tax after five years.   In view

of  the motorcyclists' income, is the Minister of the view  that

the system is equitable to them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The Ministry has looked at the position of

motorcyclists very carefully because we realise very  well  that

people  who own motorcycles are people who generally  belong  to

the lower income group and who need to use their motorcycles for

business.  The fact is that more than 80% of motorcyclists today

do not pass through any ALS or RPS point.  This finding is based

on  surveys  as well as on the sale of ALS and RPS coupons.   In

other  words,  86% of motorcyclists do not pass through  any  of

these points.   What that means is that any rebates and any  tax

savings  that  will arise as a result of this  package  will  be

beneficial  to  them.   It  will go straight  to  their  pockets

because they do not have to pay anything upfront.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another 10% of motorcyclists pass through the ALS

or  RPS  points once.  So, if we implement ERP and if the  rates

are  more or less the same as what they are today, again,  there

is  really no difference from what the situation is today.   And

any  rebates  that  they  get will also  go  straight  to  their

pockets.  So it is the very small group of people, about  5%  or

so,  who use the RPS and ALS very often, yes, they will have  to

incur  higher cost.  But as I said, this is the purpose  of  the

road pricing scheme.  This is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



purpose  of electronic road pricing which encourages  people  to

save  and  penalises people who use our roads  during  congested

hours more heavily.  It is precisely for that reason that we are

implementing ERP.  It is not to make the scheme revenue  neutral

for  each and every motorist or motorcyclist.  Therefore, it  is

incumbent on companies and motorcyclists to now  relook  at  the

way  they  are doing business.  That is the whole  idea  of  the

scheme.   It is not meant to be a painless scheme for everybody.

If that were the case, we might as well not have implemented it,

because  this scheme is meant for people to change their driving

habits.   But  in the formulation of the scheme, we  have  taken

pains to make sure that the pain for motorcyclists is minimised,

and we have done so in several ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked at the PCU ratings. We have looked at how

motorcyclists  should be taxed in relation  to  cars.   We  have

taken  the smallest number to compute their road tax.   We  have

looked  at small motorcycles as opposed to big motorcycles.   We

have looked at the motorcyclist who owns a 200 cc motorcycle and

below  and taxed him differently from somebody, say, who owns  a

Harley  Davidson, and we phase in the increases,  if  any,  over

three  years.  All this, taken together with the road tax rebate

and  phase-in,  means  that  effectively  99%  of  motorcyclists

actually do not pay any more taxes.  In fact, if you look at the

calculations  which we have done, motorcyclists owning  vehicles

below  350 cc actually will pay zero road tax over the  new  few

years.  Five years later, they would have adjusted.  But,  as  I

said, this scheme is not meant to be a standstill for motorcycle

taxes.  That I must admit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, if I may revert to the Minister's reply

to  my  question on delaying the implementation of the  ERP  for

motorcycles, would he agree that his answer is really no answer?

Because  in  the  case  of road tax, they  might  probably  have

already  paid or it may not be due for some time.   But  in  the

case of ERP, it is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



present-day  charge, that they keep paying every day  when  they

have to go through the gantry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I have already indicated, the

majority  of motorcyclists, in fact,  over 80% do not pay.   10%

pay once, which they are already paying today.  So the Member is

talking about the 5% of motorcyclists who use it regularly.   As

I  explained to his colleague, Mr Low Thia Khiang, it is  up  to

the  motorcyclist  himself  to start  to  readjust  his  way  of

operation.   If  you  are a motorcyclist who use  the  congested

roads  in  the CBD five times, 10 times or 20 times, why  should

the rest of the  motorcyclists who do not use the roads have  to

pay?  Why do they not get the benefits?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They may need to go through it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> If he needs to, then he pays for it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, as a follow up to my earlier question, if

the   school  bus  operators  were  to  increase  their  charges

unnecessarily, what action would the Ministry take?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the school bus operators will also not

incur higher taxes.  They will also incur lower taxes; again, as

part  of  the total package.  So there is really no  reason  for

them to increase any of the bus fees, for at least this year and

the next few years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that

eventually the motorcyclists will be paying more than what  they

are  paying now?  With the phasing in of higher road tax for the

motorcyclists,  what  is the rationale for  phasing  in  a  much

higher road tax scheme than at present?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, basically, when we did this exercise,

we  started  off  with  a  blank sheet  of  paper.   I  said  in

Parliament,  and  I  said to the Motor Traders  Association  and

various interest groups, that this is an opportunity for  us  to

start  off  from basics, to see how different types of vehicles,

different  sizes, different cc, different seating capacity,  how

much each vehicle should pay for using our roads and for causing

wear and tear of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



roads.  We started off with a blank piece of paper.  We did  not

look  at the existing tax structure.  How much should a big  car

pay  as  opposed  to a small car?  How much  should  a  bus  pay

relative  to a motorcycle and so on and so forth?   There  is  a

whole  range of vehicles registered on our roads today,  680,000

of  them, ranging from very small 100 cc bikes, all the  way  to

very heavy goods vehicles, the semi-trailers and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are starting off, as I said, with a blank sheet of

paper.  We are looking at the right tax that each vehicle should

pay based on (1) traffic considerations; and (2) based on what I

would call social equity considerations, meaning if you drive  a

bigger  car, you should actually be paying a higher tax  than  a

smaller  car.   If you ride a bigger motorcycle, you  should  be

paying  more than a smaller motorcycle.  We put all these things

together  and  we  came up with a basis for  charging  different

vehicles.   In the process, we realised that for some  vehicles,

they  should be paying lower tax, eg, goods vehicles.  For other

vehicles, they should be paying higher tax.  For example, motor-cycles.   Motorcycles'  tax has not been  changed  for  decades.

Some  of  them  pay $20 a year in tax, which also has  not  been

changed for decades.  But that is where we are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go from where we are today to what each vehicle

should  rightly  pay based on traffic and social considerations?

For  all  those who are going to pay less, there is no  problem.

It is a question of charging the new rate for them and they will

enjoy the savings.  Good luck to them.  But those who are paying

more,  we  have taken the decision that we will phase  in  these

increases  where  there  is an increase, and  the  motorcyclists

belong  to this category that they will have to pay higher  road

tax.   That is a fact based on their contribution to road  usage

and other considerations like social equity and so on. So a 1600

cc bike or a 1200 cc bike will pay $620 a year instead of $300 a

year for those big luxury bikes.  A 400 cc bike will pay $180  a

year  instead of $80 a year, an increase of $100 a  year.    The

smallest bike, say, the Honda 125 cc , instead of paying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



$30  a year, will have to pay $100 eventually.  So motorcyclists

should  be paying $100, $180 and $620 relative to other vehicles

on the road.  That is how we derive the new tax structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the pain and to phase in the increases, we have

done it over three years.  On top of that, we are giving the ERP

rebates.  You put all these things together, as I said, the  net

result is that motorcyclists and many other vehicle owners  will

over  the next couple of years actually be paying less road  tax

than  what they are paying today. Of course, yes, this  will  be

phased in.  Motorcyclists will have to adjust to these increases

over  three years in paying the new taxes.  But that is because,

as  I  said, under the new tax regime, this is what they  should

rightly be paying.  We have not adjusted the tax rates for many,

many  years.  This is the overall review that we are undertaking

and  this  is  the  net  result of that  review.   But  we  have

recognised  that  motorcyclists  belong  to  several   different

categories.  The bulk of the motorcyclists in Singapore are  200

cc  and  below.  For them, we are actually charging them  a  tax

which  is less than what they should actually be paying.  So  we

have  also shifted that downwards.  For 1000 cc bikes and above,

we have made no adjustments.  No special consideration for them.

They  are  paying the correct taxes for motorcycles relative  to

cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with these adjustments, with the phasing in, and with an

appropriate  choice  of the PCU unit, we believe  that  we  have

adopted  a  fair, consistent and rational basis  for  taxes  for

motorcycles  as  well as for all other vehicles.   This  is  the

total package that we are implementing together with the ERP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  seek  a  clarification from the Minister  for  Communications

regarding revenue neutrality for this exercise.  I read from the

Minister  for  Finance's Statement that overall  the  Government

expects to achieve revenue neutrality for this exercise in about

eight years.  Is this the target set and whether in fact the new

charges  levied  will  be  reviewed and increased  or  decreased

depending on the target set in terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



eight  years?   Also  on  the question  of  revenue  neutrality,

whether in fact that should be a target by itself or whether  it

cannot  be  based  on a formula of net gain for  road  users  if

traffic usage on the road is under better control.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> When we formulated the new tax structure,

we  had to have some idea of what revenue impact this would have

because  we  are talking about changes in not only  annual  road

taxes  but also upfront taxes.  In establishing the new  regime,

we  took  into  account the basic principles, which  is  what  I

explained in Parliament earlier where we are shifting taxes from

ownership  to  usage,  where  we  are  taxing  cars,  buses  and

motorcycles  relative to road usage, where we are talking  about

giving concessions to public transport vehicles and so on and so

forth.   But  the most important principle for us was  the  last

principle of revenue neutrality.  Because without that principle

we  are  not able to arrive at numbers.  We can only talk  about

principles, but we have to arrive at new numbers, new taxes, for

different classes of vehicles.  It is not a target.   It  is  an

indication of what our intention is for this exercise, ie, it is

not  an  exercise  to raise revenue, but it is  an  exercise  in

changing  the  way we use and charge for the use  of  our  roads

with the intention that this new regime will keep our roads free-flowing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, we have made the shift. We have reduced

upfront taxes.  We have put it into ERP and usage charges.   But

how much to charge?  We have to get the calculations done.  That

calculation was done on that basis of revenue neutrality over  a

period of five to eight years. Why five to eight years?   It  is

because  the current estimate is that with this new package,  we

will  be  revenue  negative for the next five years,  which  the

Finance  Minister  has said, to the tune  of  slightly  over  $1

billion.  So $200 million negative every year, even taking  into

account the increased ERP revenues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it going to be neutral? It is going to be neutral

if  we  can,  and  I  certainly hope we can,  issue  more  COEs.

Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



one of the benefits of this scheme is that we are able to, if we

can  spread  the load and get motorists to use the  roads  less,

actually increase the allowable COEs over and above the 3%.   If

that  happens,  then the additional revenues and the  additional

taxes as a result of that will help to offset this package.  But

it  is  not a target.  The ERP charges will be levied  based  on

traffic   conditions.   It  will  not  be   based   on   revenue

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the LTA has declared that

one of the objectives of the ERP is really to free up the school

bus market and that there will be more competition so that there

will  be no possibility of cartels fixing prices at unreasonably

high levels.  It appears that ---

are  not interested in coming into the school bus market.   Will

the Minister care to enlighten us on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.10 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is a

difficult one.  One main reason is that because of the  region's

financial turmoil and the resultant economic slowdown, there  is

much  public  expectation of the Budget.  The second  reason  is

that  while the region is indeed in turmoil, Singapore has  held

up  quite well.  We are not in a recession.  At least, not  yet.

Hence,  the   Government cannot portray a picture  of  doom  and

gloom,  and talk ourselves into a recession.  In fact, the  most

striking  feature of the Budget is what it is not!  Unlike  many

other countries in the region, ours is not a crisis Budget.   It

does not have the word "crisis" written all over it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of gathering views and reactions from the

business  community, our GPC for Finance and Trade and  Industry

had meetings with members of our Resource Panel, representatives

of  the  International, Chinese, Malay and  Indian  Chambers  of

Commerce,   and   trade  associations  such  as  the   Singapore

Confederation of Industries, Singapore Association of Small  and

Medium  Enterprises,  Singapore Hoteliers  Association  and  the

Singapore  Retailers  Association.   They  have  given  us  very

valuable feedback and I wish to thank them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the various groups have suggested that there

should have been pre-Budget consultations, in addition to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



the  post-Budget meetings.  This is a good suggestion.   I  feel

that the relevant Ministries should consider this idea of having

pre-Budget feedback meetings with selected industry groups.   On

our  own,  our GPC has decided that we shall conduct  pre-Budget

meetings  for  next year's Budget and convey the views  received

from the industry groups to the appropriate Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main message we received from our meetings with the

various industry groups is that, while it is not unwise for  the

Government to be prudent and cautious, they would have liked  to

see  a more stimulative Budget.  They are disappointed that  the

Budget  does not offer enough measures to help companies to  cut

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has predicted the 1998 GDP growth rate to be

between  2.5%-4.5%.  However, many people in business felt  that

the  economic slowdown is already here, and many individuals and

companies   are  facing  severe  financial  difficulties.    The

reaction  is that the Government has chosen to adopt a wait  and

see  attitude.   The reality of the situation is that  difficult

times  have arrived.  Many companies are facing the double  blow

of shrinking business and credit squeeze.  The Government should

not  adopt a reactive stance, but rather a proactive one.   Most

prefer the Government to take a bolder and anticipatory approach

by  introducing  more serious measures now to  help  revive  the

economy.  I share their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify and substantiate their positions, the Singapore

Confederation  of  Industries (SCI) and  the  Singapore  Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) have conducted surveys

among  their members.  The results they obtained was that  about

60%  of SCI members and 54% of SCCCI members (in both cases more

than  50%)  felt  that their businesses would be badly  affected

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same reaction is more or less felt by the man-in-the-street. People are concerned that with the economic slowdown,

their take-home pay will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



smaller.   Some are fearful of the prospects of retrenchment  or

prolonged  unemployment.  To make matters worse, some are  faced

with the problem of higher family expenses and other costs, such

as  higher  interest  costs  for mortgage  loans.   When  people

tighten  their belts, the contraction effect will ripple through

the economy.  The slowdown will be further aggravated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the business and ordinary people are saying is: why

not recognise the problem now and introduce stimulative measures

immediately.   The  comforting point is that  the  Minister  for

Finance has specifically said that he would introduce off-Budget

measures, whenever necessary, to tackle problems that may  arise

or when the economy worsens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to elaborate on some specific

measures  which I feel the Government could have  considered  or

introduced  in this year's Budget or consider them as off-Budget

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the individuals, the following measures could have been

looked into:



<br><br><i>Higher income tax rebate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are puzzled why the Government has reduced the

income  tax rebate from 10% to only 5% this year.  The resultant

higher  tax  payable means that people will have less disposable

income.   They  will spend less, which in turn will  affect  the

retail and other consumer trades.  Lower consumer spending means

that  the slowing economy will be further depressed.  The retail

industry has been facing poor business in the last three  years,

and the outlook for them for the next one to two years would not

be better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, during the mid-80s recession, the Government

actually gave a 25% rebate on income tax in the 1986 Budget.   I

presume  the objective then was to offer various tax reliefs  to

individuals  and  companies to help stimulate the  economy.   We

wonder why the Government took the reverse tack this time round.

Why not retain the 10% level of rebate?  Better still, if it can

be increased to 15%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Relief on mortgage interests</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent budget announced by Hong Kong's Finance

Secretary,   a  new  tax  relief  of  HK$100,000  (approximately

S$20,000) was introduced to help individuals get tax reliefs for

their interest payments on mortgage loans.  This tax relief  was

welcomed  by  the  Hongkongers as it was targeted  to  help  the

"sandwiched" or lower-middle income earners who are  faced  with

high interest costs for housing loan mortgages.  As Singaporeans

are  also  facing the same problem of rising interest  rates  on

their  housing loans, I would like to propose that  the  Finance

Minister  could  consider  a similar  tax  relief  for  interest

payments  on mortgage loans.  This tax relief  will be of  great

help to the younger families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents of HDB estates may have less need for this relief

as  they get loans from the HDB at low preferential rates.   For

young  families  that  recently  ventured  to  purchase  private

properties,  they will benefit from this tax relief.   Moreover,

while  they  are paying substantial income taxes, they  are  not

enjoying  the rental and S&C rebates given to HDB  dwellers.   I

would  like to urge the Finance Minister to consider introducing

this tax relief as an off-Budget measure, when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the measures that can help the business sector, I

have the following suggestions:



<br><br><i>Reduction in JTC/HDB rentals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to freeze JTC/HDB rentals.

While companies are relieved to hear this, they would have liked

to  see  an actual reduction of, say, 10 to 15% in the  rentals.

Although  it  could be argued that the impact of the  reductions

would be minimal on a company's overall costs, I would say  that

any savings would be helpful during difficult times.



<br><br><i>Reduction in CPF contributions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1986 Budget, the Government made a 15% point cut in

employer's  CPF contribution, by suspending the 4%  contribution

to  the  Special Account and a massive 11% cut to  the  Ordinary

Account.  For this year's Budget, I feel that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



Government  could  have  considered  a  cut  in  the  employer's

contribution to the Special Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it will not be wise at this juncture to cut

the  employer's CPF contributions to the Ordinary  and  Medisave

Accounts.  Otherwise, the reduction in the CPF contributions  to

these  Accounts will adversely impact the employees'  needs  for

housing and medical expenses.  However, a short-term cut of  the

4%  contribution  to  the Special Account will  not  affect  the

employees'  CPF receipts which are meant to meet  their  housing

and  medical  expenses.  The amount of savings to the  employers

from this 4% cut to the Special Account will be substantial and,

in fact, will offer them much relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My GPC members will have other suggestions to add to those

above.



<br><br><i>Development of local talents</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to move on to another topic that I

feel  is also very important.  It is on the development of local

talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced its intention to source for

foreign talents to supplement the local pool.  Singaporeans  can

understand  the  objective  as  commendable,  as  it  will  help

Singaporeans  to  achieve a higher plane of growth.   Especially

during  this period of turmoil in the region, there  will  be  a

large  number  of capable and hardworking foreign professionals,

R&D  personnel  and technicians who wish to seek  employment  in

Singapore.  We shall benefit from their contributions if we  can

attract them to come and work here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans are concerned about the competition

from  these foreign talents.  The answer, I feel, is that  while

we  wish  to  attract  foreign talents, we must  not  forget  to

develop and maximise the potential of the locals.  Therefore,  I

support  the  provisions  in the Budget  to  continue  to  spend

substantial sums on education and training.



<br><br><i>Naming of the bond-breakers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean is a rare resource. The Government has

set up several scholarship schemes to send our best students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



overseas to study.  Upon their return, they can better serve the

country.   While we frown upon scholars who broke  their  bonds,

the   statutory  boards,  such  as  the  EDB,  should  not  have

publicised the names of these bond-breakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students break their bonds for various personal reasons.

Many  successful  local leaders, including MPs such  as  myself,

have  broken our scholarship bonds, but we continue to work  and

serve  in Singapore.  I object to publicising the names  of  the

bond-breakers because it is an insensitive move that could  lead

to  the  alienation  of the entire body of scholarship  holders,

their families and friends.  Worse, if these scholars chose  not

to  return  to Singapore, there will be a greater  loss  to  the

country.   In  addition, such a callous practice does  not  jell

with  the  image of an enlightened Government and  a  cultivated

society.



<br><br><i>Moving ahead - Striving for a speedy recovery</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current meltdown of the regional economies offers many

lessons.   As  stated by Mr Claude Smadja, managing director  of

the World Economic Forum, every government in this region has to

learn  how  to deal with a new animal in front of us,  which  is

"the  Global  Economy".   He  said  that  because  of  the   new

information   technology  age,  with   instantaneous   flow   of

information  and funds world-wide, the New World  Order  demands

constant  up-to-date information with transparency of  rules  in

the  operating countries.  Singapore has stood up very  well  to

the  test of the turmoil as we have an efficient, effective  and

honest  Government with a high level of transparency  of  rules.

The  regional  turmoil  demonstrates that  countries  with  less

transparency of rules have suffered badly by the massive erosion

of confidence and outflow of both foreign and local funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are threats, but the current regional turmoil also

offers  many  opportunities.  It is  said  that  there  will  be

abundant investment opportunities in the companies in the region

around  us.   However,  we must remember that  major  MNCs  from

Europe and America are also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



thinking of capitalising on the situation.  They have large cash

hoards, and will be scouting around for good buys in the region.

In  addition,  there will be other healthy and  strong  regional

companies which will also be looking for good investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One disadvantage we are facing is that the Singapore

economy  and  the local firms are pulled down by the  famous  or

infamous  contagion  effect.   We have  to  rapidly  revive  the

domestic  economy  and  restore  confidence.   We  should   pick

ourselves  up  as  quickly  as  possible.   We  must  take  this

opportunity  to move ahead - while the companies in  the  region

are  still trying to regain their balance but have not gained  a

foothold.   I  wish to quote a prominent local  businessman  who

puts  it  graphically in Hokkien: "Pak lang puat lok  long  kow,

goon  nang  em  tang  teh yi nang puat lok gi".   It  means,  in

English,  "Our neighbours have fallen into the drain, we  should

not be careless and jump into the drain ourselves".  I feel that

instead  of trying to walk gingerly across a plank to cross  the

drain,  the  Government should help to put out  as  many  spring

boards  as  possible, to enable Singaporeans and local companies

to leap over the drain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be able to source for investment opportunities in the

region,  our companies must first be able to get their shops  at

home  in  order,  build  cash reserves, then  they  can  venture

abroad.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by congratulating the

Finance  Minister for preparing and presenting such  a  detailed

and  comprehensive Budget.  Having heard the many feedback  from

the ground, I cannot help but to urge the Government that it  is

not  time to be faint-hearted, it is not time to hesitate.   The

Government  must  watch  the situation very  closely,  and  have

regular  dialogues with industry groups and local organisations.

When  the  need arises, off-Budget measures should be introduced

before it is too late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put on our spurs. The first runner off the mark

will win the race.  The early bird catches the worm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing

me  to join in the debate on the Budget proposed by the Minister

for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, during the Budget debate, many Members made

a  call to the Minister to address issues related to the cost of

doing  business  in Singapore and in particular,  to  give  more

consideration to the manufacturing sector and to the  small  and

medium  enterprises.  At that time, when the interim Budget  was

announced,  the business community did express the  difficulties

they  were  facing, but we were all hoping that this year,  when

the  full  Budget was announced, all their concerns  would  have

been adequately addressed by an all-rounded Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can understand the Government's long-term vision

and  plan to make Singapore the financial and logistics  hub  in

this region, I feel the Minister missed out a few very important

sectors  of  the  economy, especially the manufacturing  sector,

small  and  medium  enterprises,  the  tourism  and  the  retail

sectors.  The biggest disappointment, in my opinion, is that the

Minister  did  not  do much for the manufacturing  sector  which

contributes about 25% to the Singapore GDP.  This and the  other

sectors I have mentioned, have seen continual pressures for  the

last  two years and are expected to be badly hit this year  when

the full effect of the regional crisis is felt by our businesses

and our companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in my opinion, the Budget is narrowly focused in the

areas  that  the  Government wants to grow and  I  am  sure  the

intention  is  not  to shrink the other important  sectors.   I,

therefore,  would  have  expected a telescopic  focus  from  the

Minister,   looking  at  the  bigger  picture  rather   than   a

microscopic  focus that ignores those sectors that fall  outside

the scope of focus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there is a perception gap between what the

businesses  in Singapore are seeing and what the Government  has

projected  for the next one year.  In his speech,  the  Minister

stated that the electronics sector in the west, particularly  in

the USA, is set for recovery and growth and therefore he expects

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



the  electronics-manufacturing sector in  Singapore  will  grow.

However,  many  companies, including large  multinationals,  are

seeing the exact opposite.  In fact, the semiconductor industry,

which  is  one  of  the largest components  of  the  electronics

sector,  is  starting  to see book to bill ratios  coming  down,

which  means that orders are coming down.  Similarly,  the  disk

drive industry is seeing a slowdown.  The Commerce Department in

the  USA  recently published, just a few days ago, figures  that

showed  a  drop of about 2.6% in January for electronic products

shipped  out of the USA.  Factory inventories were  also  up  by

about 0.1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore am a little worried that we may not be aligned

and  hence  the  Budget may have been drawn based on  statistics

that  may  not  be up to date, especially in this fast  changing

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has projected a 2.5% to 4.5% growth for the

Singapore economy.  In my opinion, although this may turn out to

be  so  for the overall economy, certain sectors of the  economy

may,  in  fact,  go into recession later this  year.   This  may

happen   in  the  manufacturing  sector,  especially   for   the

electronic  products area.  The retail and tourism  sectors  are

set to see one of the worst times in the last 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government have done? In my opinion, the

Minister for Finance could have been a little more proactive  to

anticipate  a  possible sudden downturn rather than  waiting  to

react  when  it happens.  In this environment of rapid  changes,

why should we wait for a crisis to happen?  We must have learned

from our neighbours that when it starts to fall, it will be  too

late  to reverse things. As Mr Leong Horn Kee has stated,  there

are  surveys  done  by  the Chambers of Commerce  and  also  the

Confederation of Industries that about 50% to 60% of  businesses

expect  to  see a drastic fall in sales and profits  this  year.

Also  in the last few days, from the newspaper reports, we  have

seen  very  disappointing corporate results.  So in my  opinion,

the  Minister  could  have given the benefit  of  doubt  to  the

businesses and the feedback that they have given about the tough

times ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention that at worst, we over stimulate the

economy a little should the situation not be as bad as predicted

and  at  best,  we could have avoided a crisis  by  acting  very

early.  In either case, Singapore would have gained tremendously

should  the Budget have been more generous in helping businesses

address   competitiveness  and  the  regional   crisis   issues.

Although  the  Minister mentioned the possibility of  off-Budget

measures, I hope that he can clarify how fast he would  be  able

to  react  and  how will this be done.  Businesses  need  to  be

assured  that  the help will come on time when  they  needed  it

most.



<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector, SMEs and Regionalisation Drive - The Cost of Doing Business</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cost of doing business in Singapore becomes an

even  more  critical issue as the currencies of  our  neighbours

have  devalued  and thus making these countries more  attractive

for  investors because of the cheaper land and labour costs.   I

therefore feel that the Budget did not adequately address  these

issues  and in particular, it did not address the needs  of  the

manufacturing and the small and medium enterprises sectors, as I

have pointed out earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the rationale for the lack of attention to

these sectors, but I fear we may be giving the wrong signals  to

current  businesses  and  potential  new  investors  as  to  the

importance they have to our overall economy.  While the  overall

economy  has slowed down and as competition from our  neighbours

increases,  business costs in Singapore still remain  high.   As

our  neighbours become more competitive and increase their focus

on the sectors of the economy which we are neglecting, they will

be  successful  in attracting investments that  otherwise  could

have been brought into Singapore.  Worse, we may see flights  of

investments out of Singapore to our neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small and medium enterprises form an important pillar

of  our  economy, employing a large percentage of our workforce.

The regional crisis has a bigger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



impact on them because these companies get jerked around due  to

their  smallness.  These companies need special help, especially

for  those  who have regionalised in the last few years.   While

there  are  many Government schemes to help them,  the  feedback

that we have got from most of them is that these schemes are  so

complex that they just give up trying to apply.  We need  to  be

more  organised in helping the small and medium enterprises more

effectively.   Currently,  I  feel that  the  bigger  companies,

especially  multinational companies, are  the  ones  that  truly

benefit from these schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of regionalisation, once again, I feel that the

Government  has been too quickly distracted by its narrow  focus

on  a few sectors.  Our long-term directions should still be  to

regionalise  and  to  further develop the  second  wing  of  our

economy.   I  therefore expected more to be  done  to  encourage

regionalisation,  especially this is a  good  time  for  bargain

investments in our neighbouring countries.  Therefore, the  lack

of  new  initiatives in the Budget to encourage  regionalisation

was  a  let  down.  Furthermore, for companies that had  already

regionalised  in  the  last two years, the regional  crisis  has

badly  impacted them in terms of loss of value of assets in  the

neighbouring  countries as well as due to inability  to  collect

debts.  I was hoping for some temporary relief measures to  such

companies to tide over these tough times, such as provisions for

losses  in  computing their taxes here in Singapore on  a  group

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer the Minister for Finance to an

article that appeared in the Straits Times on 28th February 1998

that  analysed  why the Taiwan economy was able to  weather  the

regional  turmoil while strong economies like  South  Korea  and

Malaysia collapsed.  In the final analysis, among other  things,

two  of  the  most significant reasons are, first  of  all,  the

competitiveness   of  the  Taiwan  economy   is   due   to   the

manufacturing sector and, in particular, the electronics and the

semiconductor industries which have grown from a  mere  2.5%  in

1990 to 37.5% of the economy in 1997.  Secondly, Taiwan was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



focused  on  many small and medium sized businesses rather  than

conglomerates  or  big  companies,  thus  giving   the   economy

flexibility compared to other countries who were focused on  its

large companies.  While I am not suggesting that we emulate  the

Taiwanese economy, I do believe that there are many lessons that

we can learn from them  and apply to Singapore.



<br><br><i>Strong Dollar/Rising Interest Rates and Financing Problems</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, while the Singapore dollar has depreciated only

slightly  against the OECD currencies, those of  our  neighbours

have  drastically  devalued.  Therefore, more than  before,  the

strength   of  Singapore  dollar  becomes  a  bigger  issue   in

attracting  investments and in competing in the  export  of  our

goods.  I believe that Singapore needs to re-assess the level at

which  our dollar should be, compared to other currencies around

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to moderate interest rate increases which have

gone  up  about three times in the last six months.   Banks  are

also  tightening credit financing, thus making it very difficult

for businesses that can still grow and be successful in the long

term  in  getting loans.  With losses made worse by the regional

currency crisis, many companies are facing short-term cash  flow

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, I would like to urge the Finance Minister to

consider  providing temporary measures to help  those  countries

that  are  willing to restructure and by independent  assessment

are  companies  capable of growing and competing effectively  in

the  world  markets.   These  are  companies  which  are  facing

transient  problems, not permanent problems, and  they  need  to

survive through the next two years or so.  I would like to  make

one suggestion, and I will be talking about the details when  we

discuss  the  various Ministries, and that  is,  to  provide  an

equivalent  to  an  IMF  bailout package  that  was  offered  to

Indonesia, for our own businesses here.  This package can be  in

the  form  of  bank loans with some Government backing.   Others

include



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



various types of rebates that have already been mentioned.   The

temporary  measures  need  not be  handouts,  but  one-off  type

assistance  that  will  not  impact the  long-term  measures  or

policies of the Government.



<br><br><i>Property Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one area where I feel that the Government has done

too  much.   As  I  recall, the general tone of  our  Government

policy  has always been that we should let market forces  decide

the  property  prices.  However, in the last few years,  I  have

noticed  that many incidences of Government interventions  where

sometimes we tempered with the demand and sometimes we  tempered

with  the  supply  in  a seemingly uncoordinated  and  piecemeal

manner resulting in the sector being jerked around many times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to encourage the Government to go back to the

principle  of  `letting  the market forces  decide'  and  to  be

involved  in  only  setting general directions  and  fundamental

strategies and then let go.  While we have made mistakes in  the

past  in  allowing asset price inflation in Singapore and  hence

property prices being out of control, and while I can understand

the  undesirable  impact on our economy if the  property  market

bubble  bursts, I hope that no new measures would be put  in  to

prop  up  the  market.  In May 1996, we had put in  measures  to

remove  speculations  in  the property market.   The  objectives

should  not  change now.  We should never allow  speculation  in

land  scarce Singapore.  These measures must therefore stay even

if prices slide downwards a little more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote Mr Chiang Pin-Kung, not in Mandarin

but  in  English,  the  Chairman of  the  Taiwanese  Council  of

Economic  Planning and Development, who said  "A  lot  of  money

borrowed in South-east Asia went not into manufacturing but into

the  stock and property market", when he analysed the causes  of

the regional turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, while we know of people being unhappy

of  the  income tax rebate being reduced by 5%, I would like  to

highlight that a majority of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  got many other rebates like rental, utilities  and

S&C  rebates.  I am sure this will help many of them, as we know

about  70% of Singaporeans do not in fact pay income  tax.   The

other  area that I would like to compliment the Minister  is  in

the  area  of  development expenditures that have gone  up  this

year.   This  reflects the long-term thinking of the  Government

and  willingness  to  invest in our future.   We  will  see  the

results many years from now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude, once again, by urging the

Government to be more pro-active and not reactive in determining

policies, as this Budget has indicated.  In this case, we cannot

wait  for  companies  to  collapse  before  we  step  in.    The

accelerated loss of confidence if this happens cannot be  easily

recovered  as  we  recently learned from what  happened  to  our

neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud the Government for focusing on the finance

sector  for our long-term good, I feel that we should  not  have

neglected  the other important sectors of our economy.   I  hope

the   Government  will  show  more  signs  to  substantiate  its

commitment  in making manufacturing and services the engines  of

growth for our economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I welcome the

Budget  presented  by  the  Finance  Minister.   It  calls   for

tripartite cooperation among the business sector, the Government

and  the people to overcome the financial crisis before us.   At

the  same  time,  I  would like to commend  the  Government  for

granting  rebates  and  a whole series  of  assistance  for  the

businessmen  to overcome the present difficulties brought  about

by  the currency crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the South-east Asian countries, 1998 is going to be a

very  difficult and painful year.  The political factors in  the

countries around us are uncertain and their economies are  still

very  unstable.  In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that

this  Budget  is  prudent and balanced.   It  could  ensure  the

orderly development of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I personally feel that in this Budget, the

Government appears to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



too optimistic about the impact of the regional financial crisis

on  Singapore.   According to information  I  gathered  from  my

friends in the business sector, the impact of this crisis is far

reaching.   Recovery is unlikely in the next one to  two  years,

especially  for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).   These

people feel that the impact this time is much greater than  what

is   being  reflected  in  the  statistics  of  the  Government.

Therefore,  I  fear that the Government has  not  sent  a  clear

signal to the people. It may well give them the wrong impression

that  the  regional financial crisis is merely a  "flu"  to  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Finance Minister has indicated that if the

economy  should  suddenly take a downturn, the  Government  will

consider  taking  off-Budget measures to  cushion  the  problem.

Because  the Government has all the resources to deal  with  any

unexpected  event,  many Singaporeans feel that  the  Government

should  give a more definite and specific indication on  how  it

will  deal with this crisis, in terms of the impact and the long

lasting  effect  on  our  economy, and take  more  comprehensive

measures  to prepare for any rainy days ahead.   This is  better

than  taking  some temporary measures  only when  something  has

gone  wrong.  Prevention is better than cure.  I feel that under

the  able leadership of the Government, we will be able to  take

more positive measures to deal with this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long-term interest, the Government has provided more

for  the education of our young, a substantial increase by  some

30%.   I  am  very  happy about it because despite  the  present

economic  uncertainties, the Government has not  overlooked  the

long-term investment for the long-term interest of our  country.

I think this is very good.  The Government is always emphasizing

the  fact that our only natural resource is our talented people.

For  this  reason, more money should be  devoted  to  education,

training and opportunities for the upgrading of our people.   We

must  ensure  that our education system remains world-class,  to

develop and nurture our young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



talents.  At the same time, the Government wants to recruit more

talents  from  all over the world to develop Singapore  into  an

oasis  of talents, with foreign talents supplementing our  local

talents,  to  ensure that we remain in front, to deal  with  the

challenges  ahead of us.   To show its support,  the  Government

has  granted  double tax deduction for recruitment cost incurred

by  companies  which  recruit  professionals  and  experts  from

overseas.  The Government is also committed to studying  how  to

improve the "heart-ware" simultaneously with the improvement  to

the  hardware,  so that the imported talents can integrate  into

the   Singapore   society,  thereby  remaining  permanently   in

Singapore  and  make a contribution towards the  development  of

Singapore.  This intention is good and well thought of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think that while it is good to introduce foreign

talents to Singapore,  we should also make the best use  of  our

local  talent  pool.  While attracting foreign  talents,  if  we

overlook  the problem of brain-drain from Singapore  or  if  the

problem  is  not  properly dealt with,   it  may  give  rise  to

negative results.  The people may get the wrong impression  that

the  Government is adopting a double standard in  this  kind  of

situation, and unintentionally undermine the confidence and self-respect of our local talents, thereby causing them to migrate to

other  countries.   This will be a serious  loss  to  Singapore,

where our human resource is very precious to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, three scholars who broke their scholarship bond

had  their  names  published by the EDB and NCB.  This  practice

has  indeed shocked the public and created a controversy.  There

were a few articles written by the readers and published in  the

Lianhe  Zaobao  over  the past few days  on  this  matter.    Of

course,  it  is not right for overseas scholars to  break  their

bonds.  We should take measures to review the situation.  But to

publish  the  names of the bond breakers in order to  achieve  a

deterrent effect, is something really worth re-considering.   To

the  public, the breaking of bonds is only a breach of contract.

It  is  not a criminal offence per se.  It should be dealt  with

according to the terms and conditions in the contract or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



bond.  If payment has been made for breaking the bond, including

the  interest  incurred  and perhaps some  form  of  penalty  or

compensation, then the matter should be closed.    EDB  and  NCB

have  chosen  to publish the names of the bond breakers  in  the

newspapers and this seems to rank them among the criminals.    I

think  this is unreasonable and unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from the article published in the

Lianhe  Zaobao.   Mr Loo Ching Koon said in the article that  we

should consider four key issues: Firstly, on what basis are  the

scholarships  established?  Secondly, why are the recipients  of

scholarships  required to sign a bond?  Thirdly,  what  are  the

reasons for them to break their bonds?  Fourthly, why the  names

of  the  bond  breakers have to be published?  Will  this  be  a

practice from now on and do the bond breakers still need to  pay

compensation for breaking the bond?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the purpose of setting up scholarships is to

develop  our  talents, so that they will  return   to  work  and

contribute to our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article also says that we should be magnanimous by

looking at the world as a whole and to understand that there are

rapid  changes  whether in terms of concepts   or  in  terms  of

technology.  We cannot remain static all the time.  If  we  stay

where  we are, we will be lagging behind and will eventually  be

eliminated.   We will not be able to compete in the  world.   We

should   change  our  attitude  towards  scholarships  and   the

scholars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB spokesman has also pointed out, as reported in the

Lianhe Zaobao on 27th February,  that in future, applicants  who

come from well-to-do families will be asked probing questions on

why  they  are applying for the scholarship when they  can  well

afford  to go on overseas studies on their own means.   I  think

this  will  worry   the  well-to-do families.   They  feel  that

scholarship is different from bursaries.  Applicants  apply  for

scholarship  on their own merits in fair competition.   If  they

are  selected, they are selected on the basis of merit,  not  on

the  basis  of  poverty or wealth.  Regardless of  their  family

background, so long as the children have good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



results  and  good  merit,  they  are  eligible  to  apply   for

scholarships  and they should be treated equally.   They  should

not be discriminated against and they should not be subjected to

such  acute  and probing questions.  If we consider  the  family

background of the applicants in awarding the scholarships,  then

it  will lose the true meaning of these scholarship awards.  Our

scholarships should not be turned into bursaries or study loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the EDB and NCB handled the matter of these three

bond breakers  is very regrettable indeed. It  gives people  the

wrong  impression that while, on the one hand,  we  are  talking

about  attracting foreign talents to come to Singapore  to  work

and  to  settle down by giving them all kinds of privileges,  on

the  other  hand,  we are punishing our own local  talents  just

because  they break their bonds, by publishing their  names  and

shaming  them  in  public.    I  think  this  will  lead  to   a

centrifugal  tendency among our local talents, causing  them  to

stay  away  from Singapore.   They may just remain overseas  for

good.   This  will  be  against  Singapore's  motto  that  human

resource is the best resource that we have. It is also  a  waste

of our investment in education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the free flow of talents is a world-wide trend. All

countries  are competing for the best talents to work for  them.

Therefore,  we should become more enlightened, more flexible  in

handling the question of overseas scholarships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's budget debate, I mentioned that the number

of years for a bond should be reviewed for overseas scholarships

so  that  our best talents can be attracted to stay here.   Now,

with  this practice of shaming the bond breakers, I feel that  a

lot  of  our young talents will turn to scholarships offered  by

overseas  universities, many of which are provided  without  any

bonds  attached. Therefore, we should review our  terms  of  the

bond  to make them more attractive.  For those who return  after

completing their courses of study under the scholarship schemes,

so  long as they come back to Singapore to work for the country,

whether they work for the Government or in the private sector, I

think it is acceptable.  As Mr Leong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



Horn  Kee has already mentioned, he himself had broken the  bond

but he is still serving  Singapore.  So if you feel that this is

too  liberal, then we should consider shortening the  period  of

the  bond.   After  two  years of service  in  the  ministry  or

statutory  board concerned, I think they should  be  allowed  to

serve  in  another capacity, as long as it is in  Singapore.   I

think   this   arrangement  is  better,  because  the   eligible

candidates will not be compelled to go for overseas scholarships

and  stay overseas.  If the scholars want to extend their  study

period  overseas,  they  should  also  be  given  more  flexible

arrangements so that they will be able to complete their  higher

studies before coming back to Singapore to serve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Public Service Commission would take the lead in

studying this issue together with other Government agencies.   I

think this will have far-reaching effects when we enter the 21st

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will pay special attention

to  the  attitude  of  senior Government officers.    When  they

announce  certain policies or when they receive  feedback  which

are  contrary  to the Government policy, they seem  to  be  very

bureaucratic  and  very arrogant.  When members  of  the  public

reflect the views of the people, the senior officers should  not

stick  to  their  own  views  and become  very  discourteous  to

Members.   I  think this is wrong.  They must  not  forget  that

Members  of Parliament are representatives of the people.   They

must  speak for the people.  The senior Government officers  are

Government servants.  So they should not put the cart before the

horse.   They should not think that they are Ministers and  they

are  masters of the people.  It will be very regrettable if they

think so.  I hope  the Government will pay attention to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in this budget, the Government has decided to

grant an across-the-board 5% income tax rebate  and  to increase

the  interest  for the Special Account in the CPF.    There  are

also  rebates for public utilities, SC&CC to help the people  to

overcome their difficulties.  All these show that in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



face  of  the economic uncertainties, the Government  can  still

continue to care and share with the people, especially the lower

income  group. I am very happy about this.  I hope that  in  the

midst  of a financial crisis, the Government should continue  to

encourage  the people to go global.  In Chinese, the  two  words

for   crisis   are  wei  ji,  literally  meaning:   danger   and

opportunities. So long as we are careful and prudent in handling

the situation, the dangers can be reduced, the opportunities can

be  increased. We must seize the opportunities and this is  very

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, although the economic turmoil in the world has not seen its

end as yet, the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance, Dr

Richard Hu, has been able to provide the people with a number of

reliefs  and  rebates which are very well received, particularly

those that touch or concern their pockets.  Although the amounts

may  be  reduced such as the 5% tax rebate which  is appreciated

by  the  people  who  are appreciative of  the  efforts  of  the

Government,  I think in giving the reliefs and rebates,  perhaps

there  might  be a more equitable means which we  can  apply  to

ensure that those who truly need the rebates and reliefs receive

the  assistance provided.  I am referring to the  rebates  given

for  the  greatest majority of Singaporeans who live  in  public

housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced by Dr Richard Hu, the Government will be

granting rebates to HDB flat owners, including those who live in

the  larger  flats, ie, 4- and 5-room flats.   The  4-room  flat

owners,  for instance, will be receiving all the rebates  except

rental  rebates, and this is appropriate because  there  are  no

rental  4-room flats.  5-room HDB flat owners will be  receiving

the  S&C   rebates.  In my opinion, a fairer and more  equitable

means,  although it might be more complicated, would be to  give

the  rebates based on the per capita income of each family,  and

not  on  the flat size.  This will enable us to provide a better

means of assistance to those who truly need them.  I do not mean

to  say  that  we should not provide rebates to those  who  earn

higher incomes.  They should be entitled to such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



rebates.   But  I think a more accurate picture of  ascertaining

the financial ability of Singaporeans would be through their per

capita income. Surely, we realise the ability of Singaporeans to

own  cars  when  we notice that our public housing  estates  are

always  congested with cars owned by the residents in the  area.

These  vehicles include not only the small cars  such  as  Mazda

1.5, etc., but also luxury cars such as Mercedes and BMW.  These

luxury vehicles can also be seen in 4-room flat precincts in our

public  housing estates.  So a relief based on per capita income

is  more  appropriate  as a criterion for providing  rebates  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is on the personal

income  tax relief. This concerns the relief provided  to  those

who  are looking after their parents and disabled siblings.   In

our effort to encourage children to continue to look after their

parents,  we should perhaps also extend the relief to  the  four

parents, ie, one's own parents and parents-in-law.  In this way,

we  will  be  helping  to  prevent and  reduce  misunderstanding

between parents and parents-in-law because they are given  equal

attention  by  their  children and  children-in-law.   The  same

relief  can  also be given not only to just one's  own  disabled

siblings but also disabled siblings-in-law and relatives who are

unable to go out to earn their own living.  I believe this  will

go   a  long  way  towards  strengthening  family  values  among

themselves,  whether between parents and their own children,  or

between parents-in-law and relatives in the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to touch on is our state of

preparedness in facing the economic turmoil in this  region.  We

have  often  heard how the people in neighbouring countries  are

forced  to  scramble in order to obtain their daily  necessities

such as rice and sugar which obviously have fallen far short  in

supply.  I  believe  the  Government has taken  the  appropriate

measures  to  prepare  ourselves  for  any  possibility  of  the

economic  situation getting worse.  But what are these measures?

Can these measures ensure that in Singapore we will not be faced

with a shortage of basic necessities?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the Government's support

for  the  training of our workers so that they can  continue  to

compete  in  this  challenging world.   In  my  opinion,  it  is

necessary  for  the  Government to  provide  as  much  financial

support as possible to ensure that our workers will continue  to

be  able to compete.  In this respect, we all realise that Malay

workers  form  the largest group of workers who are  lacking  in

skills.   I fear that the concerns which have been raised  about

structural unemployment recently will affect more Malay workers.

If more financial support could be provided for this purpose,  I

believe  more active efforts can be carried out to  assist  this

group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br>2.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the financial policy of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Fortune magazine in its 12th January 1998 issue

featured  "The 100 Best Companies to work for in  America".   In

this  feature, there are a number of characteristics which  make

the  100  companies good employers.  First and  foremost,  these

companies  work  hard to retain their best  workers.   Employees

talk  of  their companies as fun places to work. These companies

exercise flexibility and balance the employee's work and family.

Money,  though  important, is not the  criterion  why  employees

remain  in  those  organisations.  In short, these  corporations

accentuate  the positive and place a premium on their employees.

Talent is a very valuable resource in the 100 best companies  to

work  for  in  America.   Contrast  this  with  what  we  do  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we say very much the same thing. In the

Finance Minister's Budget, he speaks of "human talent has always

been  our  most precious resource, and will become  increasingly

critical as we develop into a knowledge-based economy".  He went

so  far as to offer double tax deduction for approved relocation

and  recruitment  expenses for hiring talent  from  abroad.   In

other words, there is a Government subsidy for bringing in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



foreign  talent.  This, I support.  Yet, Sir, on the  very  same

day,  on the front pages of our major newspapers, two Government

agencies, the EDB and NCB, announced the names of three scholars

who  terminated their bonds.  Their crime seems to be that  they

have  decided  to  return the monies they have  spent  in  their

academic  pursuit. They terminated their contracts and  returned

the monies with interest and penalties.  No Government subsidies

here,  but a rather heavy penalty for being talented.   Have  we

been  too  harsh?  Contrast this approach with that of  the  100

best corporations in America.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which this issue was handled, one cannot help

but  feel sorry for Mrs Janet Yee, the mother of Hector Yee, one

of  the  scholars named. As a mother who sees her  son's  future

being  potentially ruined, she has every right to use  the  word

"wicked"   on  these  two  organisations.   Her  very  interview

reported  in the Straits Times on the same day made the agencies

looked vindictive and small.   How have we come to this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the joint statement, the EDB and NCB claimed that naming

those who terminated their bonds is not to shame these scholars.

This sounds disingenuous.  If splashing the names of scholars in

such  statements is not meant to shame or scare  other  scholars

from  thinking or doing likewise, then what is the very  purpose

of  doing  so?  It may be argued that the use of terms  such  as

bond-breaker  and breaking bond are emotional terms  similar  to

law-breaker and breaking the law.  Anything you break cannot  be

right.  Perhaps it is calculated to be so.  Singaporeans take  a

serious  view of names being flashed by those in authority.   In

the  context of bond termination, surely the purpose must be  to

strike  fear.  In the Straits Times of 1st March 1998,  page  3,

the  heading of the box article was headlined "THE NAME  SHAME".

Here, it is the press calling a spade a spade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote two of the interviewees. One said

"Singaporeans  are afraid of embarrassment, so publishing  names

is like the Corrective Work Order".  Another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



comment  "EDB's and NCB's actions would turn people  off.   They

are  using  it  as a threat.  But if the future employer  trusts

you, this measure is ineffective".  Sir, the operative phrase is

"if  the  future  employer trusts you".  Singapore  is  a  small

country when it comes to the work place.  It is not uncommon  to

hear  of employers who shun from employing Singaporeans who have

incurred  the displeasure of Government or Government  agencies.

Although this perception is not true, employers do not wish   to

take chances on doing the wrong thing.  Hence, public naming  of

scholars has very deep repercussions.  We can understand Mrs Yee

when  she said that she is afraid that her son may not come home

-  home to an uncertain future.  Some form of disapproval can be

expressed, Sir, in the case of those who terminated their bonds,

but have we gone too far?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the joint statement, EDB and NCB stated, and I quote,

"Accepting a scholarship implies a moral responsibility to  work

with  the sponsor upon graduation".  Certainly, scholars do have

an  obligation other than legal to serve their bonds.  We cannot

encourage  scholars  to  terminate  their  bonds.   Moreover,  a

scholarship in Singapore brings much honour and prestige to  the

scholar  and the family.  Hence, terminating a bond  must  bring

with it some dishonour.  At the same time, with  this very heavy

handed approach, is there not a moral responsibility on the part

of these Government agencies to protect Singaporeans like Hector

Yee,  Teo Hoon Ping and Huang Yian Teik, whose crime is to incur

the wrath of some Government officials?  They do so by returning

monies  advanced  to them - and this action is  contemplated  in

their  contracts, and then have themselves shamed.  This is  not

in  the contract.  Some form of displeasure must be attached  to

those  who  terminate their bonds.  However, when  a  Government

agency uses the moral argument, it must remember that it owes  a

higher  moral duty through its sheer size, influence  and  clout

not  to overuse its power  on individuals it comes into contract

with.  The exercise of moral responsibility is never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



meant to be one sided.  Hence, I agree with Tan Sai Siong of the

Straits  Times  when she said  that two wrongs  do  not  make  a

right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Straits Times of 1st March 1998, it was reported

that  in the case of the PSC, only 4% of the scholars terminated

their bonds in the last five years.  The URA has reported in the

same article that none of its overseas scholars terminated their

bonds - a very enviable record.  Obviously, Sir, the PSC and the

URA  must  be  doing something right.  Why is the  situation  so

different in the EDB and the NCB?  Sir, going by press  reports,

perhaps  these two organisations should examine their  attitudes

and inflexibility of approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, Sir, I have an experience which lends weight to

this  point.  On 12th October last year, I made a public  speech

against naming of scholars who terminated their bonds.  This was

reported  in the Straits Times and Zaobao on 13th October  1997.

In that address, Sir, I suggested that whilst the Government was

trying  hard to bring in foreign talent to increase  our  talent

pool, shaming scholars ran counter to this objective.  We should

instead increase the number of scholarships by anticipating  the

small number who may terminate their bonds.  Moreover, Singapore

has  the financial resources to do so.  The other reason I  gave

then was that as long as the scholar continued to contribute his

services  to  Singapore, as my friend, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee,  has

mentioned, the country has lost little.  Whether in the  private

sector or public sector, a scholar can contribute to Singapore's

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this did not go down well with EDB. I was invited to

a  breakfast  meeting in January this year with the most  senior

officers of EDB and NCB.  I was shown a draft statement of their

intention  to  name three scholars who terminated  their  bonds.

Amongst  many  things said to me at this breakfast meeting,  the

most  senior  gentleman in the group accused me of  sharing  the

values of these scholars and he said that if I shared the values

of  these scholars I should resign from public office.  In other

words, a civil servant telling an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



MP  to  resign.  Despite this, Sir, I tried to keep a cool head.

I  tried to debate the issue but to no avail.  We must always be

on the lookout for such intolerant attitudes, especially of some

in the apex of Government.  We cannot value human resource if we

are not able to win over those who do not see our point of view.

I  bring  up  this episode not with personal affront,  but  with

sadness because today  the PERC Report says Singapore has one of

the best civil service in this part of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of scholarship bonds should not be encouraged.

Significant  resources other than money have  been  invested  in

those  scholars.   In some cases, the award of  the  scholarship

enables the scholars to gain admission into the most prestigious

institutions  overseas.  As the large majority  of  scholars  do

serve  their bonds on completion of their studies, the situation

is  probably not getting out of hand.  Even though the  regional

economies  are in turmoil, I believe that the demand for  talent

will  continue.  Hence, there should be a review of this  issue.

There must be more creative solutions to this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, since we are on the lookout for talent, the

Government   should  allocate  more  financial   resources   for

scholarships.  As an example, a million dollars will see  to  at

least five scholars a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, perhaps we should consider providing scholarship

loans which may be converted into service bonds.  Such a scheme,

which  comes  with a small `penalty' like a longer bond  period,

will  give  the scholarship holder the flexibility of making  up

his  or  her mind after a few years of studies, bearing in  mind

that the scholar has taken up a scholarship at a very young age.

If  the  scholar chooses to continue further studies,  then  the

loan  must  be  paid up.  If the scholar chooses to  return  and

serve a Government agency, the bond is of a longer duration than

the norm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the terms of the bond should be liberalised

further.  The recent announcement of a shortening of the  period

is a step in the right direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



Lastly,  perhaps  there should be a class of  scholarships  with

bonds  which  may not be terminated.  In other words,  the  bond

must  be fulfilled.  The period may be shortened further.   This

latter  scholarship  will  go some way  towards  addressing  the

concerns  of those Government agencies which have earmarked  the

scholars for certain positions in the establishment.  There  are

many  ways  to  vary  the  terms of employment  to  achieve  our

objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, in the wider context of increasing our

talent pool, nurturing talent and attracting talent from abroad,

the  public  shaming of scholars who terminate their bonds  must

not  be part of the grand design.  Putting such scholars on  the

same  class as road bullies, Corrective Work Order offenders  or

those  who choose to use our lifts as public toilets is  not  in

the  best interest of Singapore.  The natural progression, I ask

myself, is that if this does not work, what will EDB and NCB do?

Perhaps  the next logical step is to paste the faces of scholars

on lift landings.  Sir, I think we need more creative solutions,

and I think we are better than the loan-sharks.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

official GDP forecast for this year has a very wide range,  2.5%

to 4.5%.  This is understandable because of the uncertainties in

the  regional environment.  However, there is a large difference

between  a  growth  rate  of  2.5%,  and  that  of  4.5%.   This

difference  in growth rates could be translated into significant

differences  in retrenchments, in bankruptcies and  in  economic

hardship in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four main features of this year's Budget. First,

it  is a conservative budget aimed at achieving a small surplus.

Second,  there  are  no  major tax cuts.   Third,  there  is  an

increase in development expenditure.  And fourth, there are  tax

incentives  to  promote the development of specific  industries,

particularly in the finance sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the budget surplus should be reduced during a

year of projected economic slowdown.  This is in part due to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



the  increase  in development expenditure from 6.3%  of  GDP  in

fiscal  year 1997 to 7.5% in fiscal year 1998, which is entirely

appropriate  at  this time, for three reasons: to  continue  our

efforts   in   improving  our  medium  to   long-term   economic

capabilities; to take advantage of cheaper prices, for  example,

in  land  reclamation; and in light of the expected slowdown  in

private fixed capital formation, to boost investment expenditure

by  means  of  public  sector capital  formation.   The  current

emphasis now is to further develop the financial sector, without

at  the same time reducing the importance of manufacturing,  and

the  fiscal  incentives  offered for  such  activities  as  fund

management are in line with this strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most significant aspect of the Budget is that

there are no major tax cuts to stimulate the sagging economy and

to  help  businesses.   The  business  community  has  expressed

disappointment regarding this, particularly since  the  recently

announced  Hong Kong budget contained a wide range of tax  cuts,

including  a  reduction  in the corporate  income  tax  rate,  a

freezing  of  most government fees, a reduction in property  tax

and  in stamp duty on share transactions.  And all this when the

forecast for the Hong Kong economy is 3.5%, which is exactly  in

the middle of the range forecasted for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there is no need for major tax cuts, but

provided  growth  is within the upper half of  the  range.   If,

indeed,  the  growth rate this year is about 4% or even  higher,

then  a reduced, small budget surplus with no major tax cuts  is

entirely  appropriate.  A 4% growth rate  will  mean  that  some

companies will be forced to downsize, retrench, merge  or  adopt

drastic  consolidation measures.  But that is part of commercial

risk.   There  are upsides and there are downsides in  business.

Businesses  experienced a very good bull run  since  1987.   And

these  two  years  -  1998, maybe 1999 -  can  be  viewed  as  a

consolidation  phase  after  10  years  of  uninterrupted  solid

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the growth rate for the economy is heading

towards 2.5% or lower, then I do believe that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Government should adopt more measures to stimulate the  economy.

In  other  words, the Budget can remain as it is.  But  where  I

differ  with the Government is the threshold for the  activation

of  off-Budget measures to stimulate the economy.  The  Minister

for  Finance seems to imply that major stimulus initiatives will

only  be  contemplated if there is an actual  recession,  ie,  a

decline  to  negative  growth.   I  would  argue  for  a  higher

threshold.   In other words, a positive but low growth  rate  of

2.5%  or  below should be sufficient to implement  further  off-Budget measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons for doing so. First, I do not see

the  need  to go through a 2.5%, or even a 2% growth this  year,

because it would be due largely to the contagion effect  of  the

Asian  financial  crisis,  and not  to  weaknesses  in  our  own

domestic economic fundamentals.  Yes, I agree, and I quote, that

"our  tax rates remain competitive and no major tax changes will

be  made  against a background of declining revenue  collections

and   rising  development  expenditures."   But  no  amount   of

competitiveness in tax rates and rising development expenditures

can solve the immediate business problems of high interest rates

and  low  demand, and possibly, the inability to  collect  trade

credit  from neighbouring countries; and because businesses  are

in trouble, employees get retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Minister has further stated that it is

important to have a budget surplus in order to continue building

our  financial reserves.  I totally agree with this  philosophy.

But I see no harm in further reducing the surplus this year,  in

order  to  bolster the economy.  To put things  in  perspective.

The  estimated revenue loss of the 5% income tax rebate is  $130

million.  The revenue loss from the 15% property tax rebate  for

commercial  and industrial properties is estimated  to  be  $145

million.   Suppose  these rebates were to be doubled,  in  other

words, you have a further 5% income tax rebate and a further 15%

property tax rebate.  The additional revenue loss would be  less

than $300 million.  The estimated budget surplus is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



$2.68  billion.   In short, as the Minister has  said,  we  have

enough resources to activate further off-Budget measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The off-Budget measures that the Government could adopt to

stimulate  the economy and help businesses include: a  corporate

tax rebate, a further individual income tax rebate, the granting

of further concessions in property tax, for example, in the form

of  rebates, reduction of stamp duty, or a rebate, for  property

purchases  and  share  transactions.   Needless  to   say,   the

magnitude of the cost-cutting off-Budget measures will depend on

the severity of the downturn.  The more severe the downturn, the

greater the cost-cutting measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect to consider, and that is, when

would   these   off-Budget  measures  occur?   Would   they   be

implemented  fast enough?  Or would it be a case of too  little,

too  late?  The Minister has stated that "the situation will  be

closely  monitored."  This is of utmost importance in  the  next

few  months.  Mr Inderjit Singh has alluded to a perception  gap

between the Government's forecast on the one hand, and the views

in  the business community on the other.  By the time the  first

quarter  economic results come out, it could well be  too  late.

The  Department of Statistics might need to work doubly hard  to

churn  out  monthly  statistics fast enough in  order  that  the

Government  can  keep track of the pulse  of  the  economy.   In

addition  to  hard  statistical  data,  extensive  and  frequent

consultations with various sectors of the business community are

in  order,  so  that  the  Government  is  ready  to  act,  when

necessary.  Let us not be caught flat-footed again, as  we  were

in 1985.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether off-Budget measures are implemented

or  not, the Government should implement an immediate freeze  on

public sector cost increases.  Government rates and fees are one

important  component of business costs.  Consider, for  example,

the unit business cost index of manufacturing.  It is noteworthy

that  of  its three components (unit labour cost, services  cost

and  Government rates and fees), it is the Government rates  and

fees component which has increased the fastest since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



1988.   While  the  unit  business cost index  as  a  whole  has

increased  by  26%,  Government rates and  fees,  which  include

property tax payments, increased by 93%, or nearly doubled since

1988.   While  businesses are all scrambling to cut  costs  this

year, Government charges should not contribute to costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as much as wages still constitute a major portion of

domestic  cost,  the NWC recommendations this year  become  even

more  important in cost determination.  The decision  to  freeze

the  salaries  of  Ministers  and  top  civil  servants  was   a

significant gesture in this regard, both politically  and  as  a

signal for caution and restraint in wage increases this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's estimated budget invariably errs on the

conservative side.  In other words, except for 1996, the  actual

budget surplus, since the new system of accounting was published

from  1990,  has been larger than the estimated budget  surplus.

In  today's  context, this is not a welcome trend.  The  economy

does not need any additional fiscal contraction from larger-than-anticipated budget surpluses.  I would urge the Government to be

more  accurate in its budgeting this year.  If the economy grows

faster  than  anticipated  in the budget  planning  and  revenue

increases,  then the Government should correspondingly  increase

expenditure.   Otherwise, actual budget surplus  could  well  be

2.5% or even 3%, well above the estimated surplus of 1.7% simply

because  of  budgeting inaccuracy.  It has occurred since  1990,

except  for the year 1996, and I would urge the Government  that

it does not happen for this particular year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is that one of the major lessons that we can

learn  from  this slowdown is the need to develop resilience  in

the face of international economic shocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current slowdown is a painful reminder that there is no

guarantee  of  economic growth in any economic  system,  whether

capitalist  or  planned.  The global economy  will  continue  to

exhibit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



cycles  of  booms and recessions.  It will also occasionally  be

subject to shocks, which by definition are unanticipated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy has experienced an economic slowdown

only  twice since independence - in 1975, where growth was 4.1%,

and in 1985, with a growth rate of  -1.6%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world recession which began in 1974 worsened in the

first  half  of 1975.  The OECD growth rate for 1975  was  -2�%.

World  trade  in  real terms declined by 12% in  1975,  and  the

volume of imports by OECD countries fell by 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet in spite of the world recession, the Singapore

economy  grew  by  4.1%.   This was in large  part  due  to  the

diversification of the economy.  While manufacturing declined by

2%,  the services sectors, in particular, transport, storage and

communication;   and  finance  and  business  services   sector,

provided 88% of the growth in GDP in 1975.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in this current economic slowdown, it is

expected that those sectors with final output destined  for  the

US  and  Europe,  namely, manufacturing will  fare  better  than

sectors which are regionally-oriented, namely, services such  as

tourism,  retail and healthcare.  The lesson we learn from  this

comparison  is the importance of diversification,  in  terms  of

sectors   and  markets.   Just  like  an  investor,   an   undue

concentration in any one sector or market could cause us  to  be

vulnerable  to upturns and downturns in that sector  or  market.

In  this context, I am happy to note that the Minister for Trade

and  Industry has announced that we would continue to  emphasise

the continued development of both manufacturing and services  as

twin  engines of growth.  Within each sector, there should  also

be  sufficient diversification in terms of industries and export

markets in order to develop resilience in our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, the world economy grew by 3% as did the growth in

world  trade.  The US economy slowed down compared to 1984,  but

still  grew  by  2.4%.  In other words, in  1985,  the  external

environment  was  not  unfavourable.   But  in  spite  of  that,

Singapore suffered a recession.  One main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



reason  was  because  of the 43% increase in  unit  labour  cost

during  1980-1984  which  caused an erosion  of  competitiveness

domestically  and  this  coincided with the  slump  in  external

demand  in  the  key  oil  and  marine-related  industries.   In

addition, fiscal policies had a contractionary effect, and there

was a slump in the property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson we learn from the 1985 recession is the

importance of sustaining domestic competitiveness.  The 43% rise

in  unit  labour  cost in 1980-1984 was one major  factor  which

tipped  the scales and caused the recession instead  of  a  mere

slowdown as occurred in 1975.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the recipe for developing resilience is sustained

competitiveness combined with diversification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, while I agree with the main thrust of the

Budget,  I hope that the Government will indeed not hesitate  to

respond  with  off-Budget measures if the need arises.   I  also

hope  that the Government will not consider 2.5% growth too high

to  activate such off-Budget measures.  There is no need for  us

to suffer unnecessarily this time around.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget emphasises on education and our educational

system is moving towards creative thinking and creativity.   Yet

there  can  be no creativity if discussions are not  done  in  a

gentlemanly   manner  with  opportunities  to   speak   up   and

alternative  viewpoints sought.  It is in this  context  that  I

want  to seek clarification from my Parliamentary colleague,  Mr

Chng Hee Kok.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask Mr Chng Hee Kok

whether  he  would like to confirm what he told me outside  this

House  sometime ago that the Chairman of EDB asked him on  these

points:   (1) that he should resign because as a Government  MP,

he  should  not disagree with this Government policy  of  naming

bond-breakers;  (2)  that  other MPs who  disagree  should  also

resign;  and  (3)  that  the EDB Chairman  stormed  out  of  the

meeting.  Can I ask Mr Chng Hee Kok to clarify?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, essentially I agree and

confirm what my colleague, Dr Tan, has mentioned.  Actually,  on

top  of  that,  he (EDB Chairman)  mentioned two  other  points.

Since this subject has cropped up, I should mention that when he

showed me the statement, he threatened that my name would be put

into  the  statement  because  I  supported  those  three  named

scholars  by speaking publicly against the issue.  My  name  was

supposed  to  be  included in the statement.  He also  suggested

that  I  should send my speech (the speech which I made on  12th

October  1997) to him for vetting.  I want to assure Members  of

this  House  that in all my years as a Member of Parliament,  no

Minister or office-holder has ever asked me for my speech before

I speak on any subject.  I told him that I have never offered my

speech to any Minister of this House for vetting, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not being

personal.   I  just want this House to be clear on why  I  think

this  exchange should be made known to Members of this House  as

this  involves a top administrator and elected Members  of  this

House  and  it  touches on areas of creativity,  leadership  and

alternative views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened to Chng Hee Kok's encounter

with  the  Chairman  of  EDB with shock and  disbelief.   As  an

elected Member of this House, I cannot be a bystander.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> On a point of

order.   I  am not intending to circumscribe Member's  right  of

free  speech.  In this House, Members can bring up any  subject.

In  the Minister's Budget Statement just two Fridays ago, he was

elaborating the Government's financial policy and outlining  the

Government's Budget and these are important issues for debate in

this  House.  I think we should confine our debate to the Budget

Statement  and at other times, raise a motion to have  it  fully

debated  as to whether or not we should publicise the  names  of

the  bond-breakers.   I  think  there  is  another   appropriate

occasion to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not use these two precious days for debating bond

breakers because there are 45 MPs wanting to speak.  With 45 MPs

squeezing  into two days and if we just divide by the number  of

hours  that we have, I think each MP will have very little  time

to  speak.   I  am sure all 45 MPs want to have  their  say  and

express  their views.  But I would suggest that they keep  their

focus on the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of order, Mr Wong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The point of order, Sir, is that we

should confine our debate to the Minister's Budget Statement and

this  subject  about  the  EDB bond-breakers  and  the  Member's

exchange with the Chairman of the EDB should be fully debated on

another occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The subject of bond-breakers of EDB scholars

has  actually been touched upon by two previous speakers  and  I

have  allowed it.  Under the circumstances, it is not wrong  for

Dr  Tan  to  continue with the point that he is making.   But  I

would suggest to Dr Tan that he should confine it as much as  he

can  within  the  context  of  the financial  statement  of  the

Minister.  Dr Tan, you may proceed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think

this subject is important because we are allocating funds to the

various   Ministries   and   organisations,   and   of   course,

Singaporeans would like to know the funds we allocate  to  these

organisations.   They  must also be accountable  to  this  House

whether in terms of their financial performance or the way  they

handle matters, and I still strongly believe that I have a right

to speak on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, as an elected Member of this

House,  I  cannot be a bystander when my Parliamentary colleague

is  insulted in this manner.  I cannot allow the episode to pass

by  without  expressing my concern.  I suppose my  Parliamentary

colleagues would have done likewise.  We are the representatives

of the people.  We are here in this House to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



air  the  views and concerns of the people.  Many of us in  this

House have spoken strongly against the Government policies.   We

were reprimanded by the Ministers and we were taken to task even

by  the Prime Minister, but we are still not embarrassed because

we  have spoken out honestly and frankly what we believe in  and

also  to  let the Government know how the people at  the  ground

feel.  Despite our differences in views, we were never asked  by

the Prime Minister to resign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, my Parliamentary colleague was offering a

view  that was different from the EDB Chief and because of this,

he was asked to resign.  His reasons are: (1) he is a Government

MP; and (2) naming bond-breakers is a Government policy.  Let me

state  my stand on bond-breaking.  I think it is not gentlemanly

and should be discouraged, but not by naming them in public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to continue because I have to paint

the  picture to this House why this subject is important.  After

he  asked Chng Hee Kok to resign, he stormed out of the meeting.

Should  a  man  of his standing do such a thing  to  an  elected

representative who refused to agree with his views?   I  do  not

think  our  Prime  Minister has ever done that.   It  is  not  a

gentleman's  behaviour.  We want to build a more  civil  society

and we must behave like one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add insult to injury, he wants Chng Hee Kok to let him

know  the names of those MPs who share Chng Hee Kok's views  and

he  does this by way of a letter, signed not by him but  by  his

Head  of Human Resource Division, a Mr Timothy Sebastian, asking

these  MPs  to meet and discuss with him.  Since he has  already

concluded  that  those who disagree should resign,  there  would

have  been no civilised discussion.  And I presume the MPs  will

be  told  off, similarly, the way he told Chng Hee Kok, and  the

demand  for  their resignation will be asked.  Let me  read  the

letter that was faxed to me by Chng Hee Kok:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dear Mr Chng,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your meeting on the 19th January 1998 with our Chairman Mr

Philip  Yeo  refers.  During the meeting, the issue of  scholars

terminating  their  scholarships was  discussed.   It  was  also

mentioned that there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



other  MPs  who have differing views from our Chairman  on  this

issue.   Our Chairman would like to meet with these MPs to  hear

their  views and further discuss the issue with them.   In  this

connection,  we would appreciate if you could let  us  have  the

names  and contact details of the relevant MPs so that a meeting

can be arranged.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, has he the right to summon MPs for a

meeting  to answer to him why they disagree?  Is he getting  too

big  for  his  shoes?  And this is not the  first  time  he  has

displayed such an attitude towards elected leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I discussed this with my Members of

Parliament,  I was shown a copy of a newsletter called  Pioneers

of  Computing  where he was featured as IT  champion.   In  this

interview, he had expressed views contrary to Government policy.

For example, he questions Government upgrading of our HDB flats.

He is quoted as saying, and I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We spend millions of dollars renovating HDB apartments for

people.  What for?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he disagreed with this major Government policy.

No  one  asked  him to resign.  Yet, he wants Chng  Hee  Kok  to

resign and other MPs to also resign.  On what matter, on a minor

issue - a departmental issue on bond-breaking.  He obviously has

his own views as to who should lead Singapore.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When we were a young country in the 1960s, we were

creators, Lee Kuan Yew, Howe Yoon Chong [referring to all in the

frontbench]. Now, we have the era of the CFOs.  [I will  explain

what  "CFO" stands for.]  This is where Singapore is right  now.

Now we have to see if we go up or down.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must get rid of these people. These people should

never be allowed to be No. 1, because they are not creators.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you judge for yourself. Is this not a

reference  to the present leadership, as no more than uncreative

CFOs,  which stands for chief financial officers?   Earlier,  in

his  interview,  he  equates CFOs as  bean  counters.   Are  our

Ministers bean counters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the naming of bond breakers a Government policy? No, it

cannot  be.   It is a departmental policy.  As Members  in  this

House must have read in the papers that even PSC, the body  that

awards  prestigious scholarships, is not naming the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



scholars.  Therefore, he is not being fair to Mr Chng  Hee  Kok,

and  was  hiding behind the Government to push his own view  and

belief.   He  then has the audacity to ask Mr Chng  Hee  Kok  to

resign as an elected MP and, as I said, on what issue?  A  minor

issue, a different approach to management of bond breakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok's electorate, those who voted him in, will

be  wondering  why they  have to lose their MP.  Maybe  the  EDB

chief  should  go to Mr Chng's constituency and explain  to  the

constituents why their MP should go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked of a lack of leaders with creativity in his

interview with Pioneer IT.  I think Members must read this.   It

is  a  very   important  paper and  I  will  ask  the  Clerk  of

Parliament to circulate this later on.  And I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They are preoccupied with auditing, counting, making sure

that  every  chair and table is there.  They are so  preoccupied

with  the material part, they forget that the most important  is

the creative part, the people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all that is well said, but you ask

yourself: how to be creative when the leader of a company has no

room  for differing views?  All this talk of creativity in  that

interview is just lip service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a serious matter, because I see his action as

an  affront to the office of the elected Members of this  House,

by  a  member  of the Administrative Service.   May  I  ask  the

Minister what he intends to do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the budget. I am very impressed by the

Nominated  Member's discussion on the budget.  She  did  a  very

good  job.   And  I  am  sure we support our Finance  Minister's

budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

would not be any bond breaking in my speech!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget is oriented towards strengthening and

elevating   Singapore's  position  as  a  premier  international

financial  centre.   Whilst  the countries  in  the  region  are

struggling  with  the crisis of confidence in  the  banking  and

financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



sectors,  Singapore is in the enviable position of  keeping  our

credibility  and reputation intact.  There is strong  confidence

in Singapore's banking system and the viability of the financial

services  industry.  Even then, we are not spared from  the  ill

effects of the meltdown in the  regional economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international financial community is a very important

constituency.   Our  Government recognises  this  and  tries  to

address the issues and concerns of the foreign fund managers and

foreign  players  in  the international capital  markets.   Some

regional  countries have blamed their sad state  of  affairs  on

"international  conspiracy"  of the  currency  speculators  that

started  and fuelled the currency crisis.  If indeed  there  are

areas  that  foreigners  can create  problems  on  the  domestic

economy,  we  have to be careful that the rights of Singaporeans

to  decide their own destiny are not jeopardised.  Singapore  is

already  a  very  open economy.  Foreigners are  already  owning

assets and shares in Singapore.  These foreigners will next want

to  seek  control over "blue chip" Singapore banks and companies

which  are  strategic  to our national interest.   We  ought  to

ensure  that  the  foreigners do not take over  control  of  key

sectors  of our economy which pose dangers and security risk  to

our country.  We should continue to open our economy so long  as

there  are  benefits to be obtained from as diverse a  group  of

foreign investors as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken active steps to support our neighbours.

We  hope  to help restore confidence and bring the economies  of

our  neighbours  back to an even keel.  We have  not  been  very

successful  so  far because of domestic circumstances,  but  the

message  and signals from Singapore have been clear.   Singapore

wants to be helpful during this period of currency turmoil.  Our

national  interest  and  prosperity  is  tied  to  that  of  our

neighbours.  Singapore's line of credit under the IMF  programme

to   Indonesia  shows  our  Government's  resolve  to  help   in

Indonesia's  stability,  progress and development.   The  sooner

that the countries in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



the  region recover, the better it is for all of us.   A  stable

and prosperous ASEAN is indeed beneficial to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main thrust of this year's budget is to prepare

Singaporeans for the tough years ahead but, more importantly, to

prepare  ourselves  for  the  recovery  that  will  come,   with

Singapore emerging even stronger than we did in the aftermath of

the  1985 recession.  How long this economic slowdown will take,

no  one can predict because of the volatility and uncertainty of

the  situation.  One thing is certain: the recovery  will  come.

What  is needed is for us to continue with the prudent long-term

policies.  Singapore, under the PAP Government, has consistently

pursued sound policies with strong fundamentals that provide for

the  long-term  good of our people.  We are prepared  and  stand

ready for difficult times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has once again placed top priority in

education.   The hefty 30% increase provided for expenditure  on

education is very significant as it constitutes 3.6% of GDP  and

one-fifth  of  total Government expenditure.  The investment  in

education  has  always been proved to be worthwhile.   The  high

standards  of  education given to our young  has  paid  handsome

dividends in the quality of our manpower.  Our well-educated and

hard  working workforce has given Singapore the competitive edge

and contributing to strong economic growth and development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government could have given working adults

more  financial  help  to encourage them  to  pursue  continuing

education  programmes.  In difficult times, many  employers  are

not   likely  to  provide  additional  funds  for  training  and

development of their officers and staff.  Company training tends

to  suffer during times of belt tightening and cost containment.

Also,  there  is likely to be more retrenchments this  year  and

those  who are out of work could go for further training  whilst

looking   for  alternative  employment.   Perhaps   the   Skills

Development Fund could review its policy to be more generous  in

providing  the  necessary help to employers and individuals  who

seek to attend training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



courses to upgrade themselves and enhance their competencies  to

remain employable and perform their jobs better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of economic slowdown, many Singaporeans

would   be  losing  their  jobs  through  retrenchment   because

companies   are   facing  financial  difficulties.    We   have,

therefore,  to be judicious and impose stringent standards  when

approving the employment permits for foreigners who want to work

and settle down in Singapore.  In fields where local talents are

in  short  supply,  for example, in information  technology  and

telecommunications, there would be less repercussions.   But  it

is still vague as to what constitutes "talent".  Should we allow

the  employers  only  to decide?  Are our bureaucrats  competent

enough  to  assess the true foreign talent?  The Public  Service

Commission  scrutinises  all top talents  that  join  the  civil

service.   Is there not a need for an independent panel  set  up

under  the  Ministry  of  Manpower to ensure  that  the  foreign

talents  employed  in the private sector are  indeed  assets  to

Singapore?   We  want  to  be  fair  to  Singaporeans   in   the

competition for suitable employment and that the foreign talents

selected are indeed of very high quality for the long-term  good

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, HDB sold shops and hawker stalls to the

sitting tenants.  In recent times, the businesses of these shops

and   stallholders  have  been  adversely  affected.   With  the

economic  downturn  and  the decline  in  business,  the  higher

interest  rates  have made it difficult for some  businesses  to

service  the  loans from banks.  Is there any way in  which  the

Government  could  help to alleviate the situation  of  affected

owners  of HDB shops and hawker stalls?  Will HDB continue  with

its sale of shops programme in the new areas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the macro level, the general economic situation appears

satisfactory.  However, at the individual firm level, there  are

serious  challenges  and difficulties faced  by  our  small  and

medium-sized businesses.  The manufacturing and services sectors

employ  a  large number of workers and contribute a  substantial

amount to our GDP.  The Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



Finance has indicated that there would be off-budget measures to

tackle  the specific problems of the different sectors.  I  hope

that  timely  measures would be taken for if they  come  in  too

late,  many otherwise good businesses that we wish to help would

have gone asunder and would have become casualties.  We have  to

try  our  very best to save as many jobs as possible.   I  think

jobs will be important in the coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic crisis is certainly taking its toll

on  everybody.  We are facing a period of uncertainty.   Indeed,

this is so even to predict the economic outlook for Singapore in

the  months ahead.  It is therefore prudent for the Minister for

Finance in his Budget Statement to have said, "we are keeping  a

tight lid on operational expenditure".  In this context, Sir, it

is  a  good  opportunity  for  us to  redouble  our  efforts  at

efficiency and economy.  I would like to draw attention to  this

in  terms of healthcare cost in the future and the need for  its

containment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual escalation of healthcare cost, real or

apparent,  is of much concern to most Singaporeans  today.  And,

although our country has not faced excessive hikes in healthcare

cost,  as  in  the United States, for instance, we  need  to  be

prepared  for  cost-related problems to contend with.   This  is

especially  so  in  terms of secondary-level and  tertiary-level

healthcare requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is as good a time as any to review our system and

look  for  ways to contain further rapid increases in healthcare

cost  and to maintain the high-quality care we now have.   There

is no simple solution.  We should be prepared to re-evaluate our

present  system  with a different mindset  and  be  prepared  to

tackle  the  problems with new perspectives and  through  multi-approach ways.  What follows are some aspects in our system that

merit our immediate attention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There should not be plans for more new restructured

general  hospitals for a while yet; we certainly have sufficient

of  them  now.   Building more new ones will only cause  further

duplication of the various disciplines which frequently leads to

wastage   of   resources.   Sir,  the  likes  of  our   existing

restructured general hospitals are both expensive to  build  and

expensive to run.  A small country like ours should not need any

more  of  them.   We  should, however, look into  building  more

community hospitals instead.  They will be cheaper to build  and

definitely cheaper to run.  These hospitals will be much  needed

to  treat  the  increasing numbers of elderly sick  who  usually

require  longer  hospitalisation because of  chronic  illnesses.

These  community  hospitals will be  more  accessible  and  more

suited  to provide better and cheaper care to the chronic  sick.

If  we have sufficient beds to cater for these chronic sick,  we

will   not  waste  the  expensive  acute  beds  in  the  general

hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There should be enhanced collaboration amongst

healthcare  personnel  and  increased  cooperation  between  the

various  restructured general hospitals.  This is important  for

prevention of excessive duplication of under-utilised facilities

and  personnel.  Wastage of resources in terms of equipment  and

of  doctors and other personnel becomes significant when we have

multiple  centres for each and every speciality  or  discipline.

The  problem  of  finding medical staff to run all  the  general

hospitals,  especially when we are continually facing  shortages

of  trained manpower, can become insurmountable.  The fact  that

there  is  just  not  enough  case  material  in  some  of   the

specialities  or  disciplines  to  go  round  at  any  one  time

compounds  the  problems.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  competition  for

excellence is desirable, but "fighting" for patient-load is not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We should look for more practical and prudent ways to

integrate  and  tap  all  sectors of  our  available  healthcare

facilities.   We should induce the primary level care  providers

to  cater  for  the increasing numbers of the elderly  and   the

chronic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



sick.  Perhaps they can work more closely with the hospitals  in

share-care  schemes  and  remunerated by  the  Government  in  a

reasonable  and controlled manner to ensure affordability.   The

advantages from such schemes would be the significant savings on

cost,  the decreased demands on the hospitals in terms  of  beds

and  medical staff,  but more importantly, the positive  effects

of  having  patients continuing to stay in their own homes  with

their  loved  ones.   Thus,  some sort  of  managed-care  scheme

between the general practitioners and the Government may be  the

way to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Preventive medicine as the key to maintaining good

health  in  any  population  cannot be  over-emphasised.   This,

therefore,  is  one  area  we can ill-afford  to  cut  back  on.

Instead,  we  must  seek out all avenues  to  help  the  healthy

maintain their well-being for as long as possible.  In the  long

run, it will be the ministry of continuous and concerted efforts

in   promoting  preventive  medicine  that  would  contain   the

escalating  cost  of  healthcare.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is

especially so when there are increasing numbers of elderly folk.

Now,  for this group of citizens, I would like to again  suggest

that  for the best results, "preventive care" should be  started

as soon as possible and through centres utilising a "total-care"

concept.  In other words, these  Centres of Activity for Retired

and Elderly (CARE) should cater for the physical, the mental  as

well  as the social well-being of each elderly.  For the general

population, I would like to suggest that we increase mass public

education  on preventive healthcare and enable easier access  to

regular  health  screening tests. We have to reach  out  to  the

people and increase their awareness for this need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The attitude and the mindset of our people in relation

to  affordable healthcare in Singapore has to be reviewed in the

light  of our increasing affluence and expectations.  And, if we

have  to  address the need for change in order to  cope  with  a

litigious public, it is likely that affordable healthcare may be

jeopardised.   When doctors and other healthcare  providers  are

given to over-investigating and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



over-treating  the patients because of pressures  from  patients

and  because  of  fear  from litigation,  healthcare  cost  must

increase  and  affordable healthcare, as we  know  it,  will  be

impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we are very fortunate here in Singapore.

We have the means to afford a world-class healthcare service for

our people.  Indeed, we do have an abundance of what the medical

world  can  offer  and  we  do  have  some  very  good  hospital

facilities.  Let us make sure we get the mileage from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the annual Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this year, the

budget  surplus has shrunk to about $2.7 billion,  showing  that

business  shall be bad again this year.  Last year, all  sectors

showed  a  decline,  the  stock market plummeted,  the  finance,

property,  tourism, manufacturing, retail sectors, all declined.

Despite  the  poor business showing, the Government  refused  to

lower  corporate  tax by one or two percentage  points.  At  the

moment,  the  corporate tax is about 26%.  Businessmen  expected

the  Government  to reduce the corporate tax  by  at  least  one

percentage point to 25%.  But that expectation was not met.  The

excuse  given by the Government was that it already had  reduced

the tax low enough and that if the corporate tax were reduced to

25%,  Singapore shall be deemed to be a tax haven.  I say  these

are  all  lame  excuses.  I think the true reason  is  that  the

Government  is waiting for the 5-year moratorium for  the  Goods

and Services Tax at 3% to expire next year, and then we will see

the  reduction of corporate tax.  But, of course, we  expect  an

increase in the GST from next year onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shrinkage of the budget surplus, the Government

shall  have less money to be transferred to the Edusave  account

and  to  Medifund.  I hope with this transfer of less  money  to

these   two   funds,  the  Government  shall   not   hold   back

disbursements on these funds, especially to needy pupils and the

people who need them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can remember that in 1984-85, the opposition were

calling for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



employees'  CPF contributions to be reduced so that  they  could

have  a  bigger take-home pay.  But at that time the  Government

asserted  that the CPF contributions are sacrosanct.   They  are

the  workers' salary.   They belong to the workers.  They cannot

be  cut.  But when the economy went really bad, to a minus  1.6%

growth,  the  Government went back on its word and  allowed  the

employers'  component of the CPF to be reduced  by  a  hefty  15

percentage points, from 25% to 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such a precedent, I believe that workers are

worried today.  Despite the fact that flexi-wage system has been

introduced,  they  are still worried that the  Government  shall

allow  the  CPF rate again to be slashed downwards.   Doubtless,

should  the CPF rate be reduced again, the workers shall  suffer

greater  hardship this round because HDB flat prices have  risen

much higher than those in the 1985-87 period.  The financing  of

these flats is higher today and HDB flat purchasers have to  pay

much higher monthly loan instalments.  I urge the Government  to

do everything possible and prevent the recurrence of another CPF

cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect of the CPF is that the Government

should  allow retrenched workers to draw on their  own  CPF.   I

remember  that  in the 1985-87 recession, the  hon.  Member  for

Tampines  GRC,  Mr  Yatiman Yusof, called on the  Government  to

allow  a  retrenched worker to withdraw $200 per month from  his

CPF  account.   I  would now suggest that the  Government  allow

retrenched  workers to draw up to $300 per month  from  his  CPF

savings subject to, of course, the amount of CPF he has  in  his

account.    The  Government  should  look  into  this   proposal

seriously  because  the  number  of  retrenched  workers   shall

increase.  The expected number of workers retrenched  is  to  be

about 15,000 workers and some expect this number to increase  to

as high as the 1985-87 level of 20,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a survey recently carried out by two international

consultancy firms showed that 62% of our workers' savings cannot

last  them more than three months should they be out of  a  job.

Another 22%



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



of  the  workers interviewed said that their savings could  last

only  up  to six months.  The survey also revealed that most  of

these  workers have low education and they are employed as blue-collar workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of these workers are also not young. There is

merit for the Government to allow CPF savings to be drawn out by

retrenched workers, especially if there are sufficient funds  in

their CPF accounts.  After all, it is the workers' own money and

they should be allowed to use it when they are out of a job  and

they  are  unable to find alternative employment  or  they  have

dependants to support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that the Government is not going to

fully keep its election promise to upgrade HDB flats since there

is  going to be a downturn in the economy.  The upgrading of HDB

flats programme is going to be slashed down this year from 15 to

10  precincts.   The question is: should the economy  get  worse

next  year, is the Government going to further cut down  on  the

HDB  upgrading programme?  I would think so.  We have  seen  the

Government  going back on its promise before.   The  problem  is

that  in  the  last  election, the Government thought  that  the

Singapore  economy  shall  be  forever  on  the  upward   trend,

accumulating  surpluses year after year, more  than  $5  billion

each year.  Under such an illusion, it promised voters that  the

Government shall carry out upgrading of their flats should  they

support the Government policies, ie, in plain language, vote the

PAP.    Well,  they  have  voted the PAP and  returned  all  PAP

candidates to Parliament except two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens now? One-third of the voters may have to wait

a very long time for their flats to be upgraded.  The Government

tells  them  now,  "The economy is bad.  We do not  have  enough

funds."  What is surprising is that the Government does not have

enough funds in its coffers, yet it made a bold election promise

to  the  people.   Indeed, the Finance Minister  in  his  Budget

Statement  does not think that the upgrading of HDB flats  is  a

priority.  The Budget does make special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



provision  for education, defence, economic infrastructure  like

the  reclamation  of  land at Jurong island,  but  there  is  no

mention at all of HDB flats to be upgraded on a priority  basis,

although an election promise was made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Budget also has not mentioned

about retraining of retrenched workers.  In fact, the Government

only  spends  money on pre-employment training  in  schools  and

vocational  institutes.  The only source  of  funds  for  worker

retraining  is  from  the  Skills Development  Fund,  which  are

contributed  by  employers.   The  Budget  this  year  has   not

specifically  put any money aside for retraining  of  retrenched

workers.  This only shows how caring the Government is  for  the

plight  of retrenched workers.  I know it is not right to pamper

our   workers   unnecessarily.   But  in   times   of   economic

difficulties, the Government must show some compassion  to  take

care of our workers who are out of job and not rely entirely  on

the  business concerns to retrain our workers.  Business  people

are never altruistic.  They are only profit-motivated.  As such,

they  may even take advantage of the economic downturn  and  use

the attract foreign talent policy to employ cheap foreign labour

and  to  train them with skills so that they can take over  jobs

from  Singaporeans.  In the end, many of the top-paying jobs  in

our  workforce  may be taken over by foreigners  -  a  situation

where Singapore workers cannot accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income tax rebate this year is only 5% compared to the

previous  year's  when  10%  rebate  was  given.   Although  the

personal  income tax rate this year has not increased,  the  net

effect  is that Singaporeans are paying more income tax  due  to

the  fact  that rebates have been sliced by one-half.   The  10%

rebate  should  have  been  maintained  because  only  a   small

proportion  of the population is carrying the bulk  of  the  tax

burden.   Since there are no tax reliefs this year, the Minister

should maintain the 10% rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebates and grants given to HDB flat dwellers in the 1-room to 4-room flats should be increased by at least one-half.

The Government is spending $72 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



on  these  grants and rebates, which is only about 2.7%  of  the

expected accumulated surplus.  The Government should double this

spending  because,  firstly, many of the HDB  flat  dwellers  or

members  of  their families may be retrenched.  Secondly,  these

grants  and  rebates  are  only  sufficient  to  cover  for  the

increased  charges  in S&C and the increase in  electricity  and

water  conservation rates.  The HDB flat dwellers at most  shall

be  put  in  a  neutral  position as regards  payments  for  the

utilities and S&C charges.  They shall not gain by these  grants

and  rebates.   If  the  Government really  wants  to  ease  the

hardship  of  HDB flat dwellers, especially the 1-,  2-  and  3-roomers, it should double the amount allocated.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again we

meet in this House to discuss the Government's policies for  the

new  fiscal  year  and  the monetary means  they  are  using  to

implement their policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is a strong believer in the

effectiveness  of  market forces as a means to  allocate  scarce

resources.   The  pricing mechanism appears to  be  particularly

effective in regulating demand and supply of goods and services,

except  where there are monopolies, duopolies and cartels.   The

price  mechanism is, in fact, such an efficient tool  to  modify

Singaporean  behaviour  that its wide  use  has  earned  us  the

dubious  reputation of being a "fine" city.  Every  unacceptable

social  behaviour has its price, from littering to  spitting  to

smoking in public places.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For better or worse, monetary disincentives do hurt our

pockets   and  monetary  incentives  do  cheer  up  the  masses,

especially  in these increasingly hard times - and  Singaporeans

have  responded accordingly.  So we jack up university  fees  in

arts  courses so that people will go into engineering;  Accident

and Emergency clinic charges so that people with non-emergencies

will  turn  to  other  clinics;  and  increase  taxi  fares  and

Additional  Registration Fees so that people  who  do  buy  cars

really  do  so because they need to.  In this way, we curb  high

demand  for  limited  resources and  channel  demand  to  under-utilised  facilities  in the national interest  and  to  promote

Government priorities, and I think that is a good thing.  In  so

doing,  however,  I believe we have become too trigger-happy  in

using  price  mechanisms.   It  has  become  the  Jack  of   all

Ministries  and  Master of all civil servants.   Some  of  these

incentives  are present in this year's Budget.  I  am,  however,

not  criticising  any  of them specifically,  but  I  am  merely

raising a matter of broad principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monetary disincentives are painful but, I submit, not

necessarily  the  most effective measure to  deal  with  certain

matters, such as the overuse of services with inelastic demand - some  would say that would include A&E services - or to  channel

university students to do courses in which they have no aptitude

nor  interest.  Policy makers should not just go for the easiest

route but should look to more creative, non-monetary options  if

they  wish  to modify Singaporean behaviour along the  lines  of

what they have determined are good for the public at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money as a policy tool may often be effective but is always

uncreative.   It can become the panacea and "easy way  out"  for

all  sorts  of  things  that Government wants  to  encourage  or

discourage.    In  so  doing,  we  invariably  create   a   very

materialistic  and,  if  I might say so, uncouth  society  where

"only money talks", because, in this case, the Government is the

unchallenged leader



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



and  the  trend-setter.  Is that good ultimately for our society

when we are all trying our level best to produce more volunteers

and promote a more civic society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is too blunt a tool even if it is effective. We

should  perhaps  ban  all Government officials  from  suggesting

direct  fiscal solutions till they have proposed  at  least  two

other  non-monetary options first.  If monetary  incentives  and

disincentives are indeed the only justifiable option, we  should

require our officials and the Government to spend a little  more

time garnering public support and culling public feedback before

the  policy  is  cast  in stone.  This way, Government  is  more

visibly  accountable to the people and public  feedback  is  not

seen as merely post-policy (or post-Budget) chipping away at the

policy's  edges.  There  will be no more  unthinking  resort  to

monetary  mechanism as a first, rather than as a  last,  option.

Surely,  there  must be plenty of alternatives always  -  albeit

these alternatives may require patience, time, gentle persuasion

and tedious education efforts.  I surfed the Internet discussion

groups,  for  example, during the A&E fees furore and  found  at

least  seven sensible non-monetary suggestions on resolving  the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if these methods are time-consuming to implement, we

should not totally discount them.  Not every policy needs to  be

implemented  overnight and we can explore these options  slowly.

We  took  one year to persuade Singaporeans to accept  GST.   We

have  six months to educate them on the benefits of the ERP.   I

know  the Ministry of Communications has been working very  hard

to  win support from the public and has been working behind  the

scene  with  special  groups to justify and  fine-tune  the  ERP

plans.   Like them, I hope other Ministries will not  stinge  on

the efforts to educate the public on their own future policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with increased A&E charges, it later appeared (as the

debate heated up last year) that the proposed increased fees  to

deter excessive use of A&E for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



non-emergency  cases  was  actually  justifiable   because   the

increases  were  lower than the costs that  the  hospitals  were

incurring.  If that were so, why did not the Ministry take  them

through to the public in the first place, painstakingly perhaps,

so  as to win the hearts and minds of the public?  Why could not

they  do  it upfront rather than as a kind of afterthought?   We

have an increasingly educated and sophisticated electorate -  we

must  not  think  that all this explanation is  unproductive  or

wasteful  or will indeed go over their heads.  Let us  all  have

the  benefit of knowing all the deep thinking and sound analysis

that  went into each Government policy and not just be  told  to

accept   unquestioningly  the  eminent  conclusions  they   have

reached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us work together towards being a society that responds

more  caringly and sensitively to matters of Government  policy,

rather  than to always turn to the over-ready financial  beating

rod.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Budget  comes at a time of economic uncertainty.   It  is  clear

that Singapore will be affected by the regional downturn.  It is

also clear that the present downturn is unlike any other we have

faced, quite different and potentially deeper than what we  have

seen  in  the mid-1980s.  What is less clear is the  extent  and

duration of the downturn and the particular sectors that will be

hardest   hit.   But  also  has  to  be  decided  which  sectors

Government  will intervene to help and which it  will  leave  to

their own means, for better or worse.  For those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



sectors  where Government intervenes, the method and  extent  of

intervention have also to be seen.  Against this background, the

Government  has set three priorities:  (1) to rally the  people;

(2) to help resolve the regional crisis; and (3) to plan for the

future,  so that Singapore will emerge from the crisis  stronger

than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget seems to focus on (3) to plan for the

future.  It gives a wide range of incentives for newer, emerging

industries that Government wishes to foster.  For other sectors,

the  Budget  gives  less relief than many had  hoped  for.   The

Minister for Finance has emphasised that the Government believes

there  is  no  immediate need for bailouts and  that  off-Budget

items  would  be held in reserve if things turn for  the  worse.

This  seems a confident and prudent approach.  It is an approach

that,  however, postpones potentially harder economic  questions

that  this present economic crisis may yet require us to answer.

When the Government holds other measures of help in reserve,  it

remains  to be seen how well and how timely the Government  will

read  the needs on the ground and shape its response.   What  we

need,  at  this  juncture, is a promise of close monitoring  and

that the Government would remain open to calls for assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present Budget, while the emphasis seems to be on

incentives  rather than bailouts, as I have said, one  exception

stands  out.  This is the measure to forgo property tax on  land

under  development.  This measure will cost the Government  some

$200 million in revenues forgone.  This is a considerable amount

to  assist one particular sector, property developers.  The last

time  this measure was taken was in the mid-1980 recession.   In

contrast,  Sir, measures to help other sectors, such  as  hotels

and  retailers,  are scant, if not, non-existent.   Measures  to

help the individual taxpayer with a 5% rebate, while useful, are

not  as  ample  as they were last year where a  10%  rebate  was

given.  The present rebate seems even smaller when we compare it

to the 25% given during the recession year of 1985.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we compare the assistance given to property developers

with  the  5%  rebate,  we must note that the  relatively  small

number  of developers will receive some $200 million, as I  have

said,  while all taxpayers will in total receive the lesser  sum

of about $130 million from the rebate.  Two questions arise from

these  comparisons.  First, is it the Minister's view  that  the

property  developers are in a situation akin to that  which  was

witnessed in the mid-1980s and, by comparison to the help  given

to  them,  is  it the Government's view that other sectors  like

hotels  and  retailers and individuals are not so badly  hit  at

present?  The second question is how much must other sectors and

individuals  be  affected before Government  will  assist  in  a

larger way?  What yardsticks will Government use to measure when

it will be timely to bring in its reserved off-Budget assistance

into play?  In asking this, I note that the business sector  has

perceptions that things are already bad.  Among some individuals

I  also know there have been already reports of distressed sales

of  property  and  even  some suicides apparently  triggered  by

economic  woes.   We  have  a reactive  Budget.   The  important

question  is  that it should be clearer when the  threshold  for

reaction will come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in bad times of uncertain growth, many will look to

the Government for assistance.  It is not of course that all who

ask  must  get what they ask for, not even Singapore's  reserves

are  large enough for everyone's wish-list.  But in deciding who

to  help,  when  and how much, there has to be a legitimate  and

fair basis for decisions and just as important, transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have suggested that this Budget focuses on the third

priority  to plan for the future so that Singapore would  emerge

from  the  crisis stronger than before.  While I  agree  largely

with  this policy, I think it is also important that this Budget

gives  equal  expression  to the first priority,  to  rally  the

people.   In  good times, many would be proud of  Singapore,  of

being Singaporean.  The more severe test of this pride is during

bad   times.   Will  the  people  rally?   Does  Singapore  have

sufficient heartware to pass the test of bad times?  This  is  a

question that follows from the Prime Minister's speech  in  this

House in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



June  last  year  about  Singapore of  the  21st  century.   The

Singapore 21 Committee, of which I am a Member, and I declare my

interest,  Sir, will undertake its work on Singapore's heartware

during  the course of this budget year.  There is a real danger,

Sir,  that  some will think that the relevance of  heartware  is

sidelined by economic exigencies.  I hope that many more will be

persuaded  that,  to  the contrary, the  question  of  heartware

becomes  even more important this year.  It is precisely  during

these  testing times that the heartware becomes vital and people

have an opportunity to unite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does heartware and the priority of rallying the people

find expression in this present Budget?  I am encouraged by  the

farsighted and generous provision for education.  There is every

need  for  a long-term and sustained commitment to the education

of  our youth.  Additionally, Sir, I believe more can and should

be done for heartware in terms of charities and the arts.  These

two subjects are of course very different.  But they connect  to

heartware, how we take care of the less fortunate in our society

and  how we give expression to ourselves as Singaporeans.   Both

charities  and  the  arts  also  need  long-term  and  sustained

commitment  and  they  both  share the  prospect  of  diminished

financial support during the coming hard year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic uncertainties of 1998 will likely cause

businesses and individuals to cut back on their contributions to

charities and the arts.  Some arts groups I have spoken to  have

already  seen or anticipate a drop of about a quarter  of  their

support.   The  Government's emphasis  has  been  on  the  `many

helping  hands' approach.  The Government is not to be the  sole

provider  but  businesses, individuals and the people  sector  - societies,  clubs and others -  must also help.  I  do  not  ask

Government to change the `many helping hands' policy.  I do  not

ask  them  to step in with more money where private  sector  has

pulled  back,  although of course there seems to  be  more  than

ample surplus for this.  What I do ask is for Government to keep

its  contribution to charities and the arts constant, as far  as

possible.  If there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



cuts  by  this  Government, this would be read  by  the  private

sector  that the Government accepts that these matters  are  not

priorities.   Then  they too will cut back.  The  other  helping

hands will take their signal from Government.  In this way,  our

`many  helping hands' policy means that a cut of a single dollar

by  Government  must be multiplied by the corresponding  cut  of

other helping hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also ask Government to recognise that even if their

contribution to charities and the arts remains constant, the cut-back by the private sector will be felt.  That is to say, in the

`many helping hands' approach, the pulling back of any one  hand

would  destabilise  the  charity or the  arts  in  question.   I

therefore  ask  Government to consider  if  there  are  ways  to

encourage  the  private sector hand to remain constant  even  in

these coming hard times.  One measure, it seems to me, is to use

the tool of double deductions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we currently allow contributions to approved charities

and  the arts to be deducted from taxable income on a one-to-one

ratio.   My  suggestion  is  that  this  ratio  be  doubled.   I

understand  a  double deduction is already  available  for  some

contributions  under  the National Heritage  Board,  mainly  for

donations  made  to  museums.   I  would  encourage  its   wider

application during the current downturn.  I reiterate that  this

is not for Government to give more money or to give up the `many

helping  hands'  approach,  rather  my  suggestion  is  to  find

incentives for private sector hands not to waver in hard  times.

This  would help maintain the consistent support that is  needed

for both the charities and the arts.  For charities, especially,

it should not be the case, that in hard times, the recipients of

charity  who  can least help themselves would be  those  hardest

hit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the Budget is not just a question of

dollars  and  bottom lines.  It represents our priorities  as  a

nation.   In bad times as much as in good, or even more  so,  we

must  prioritise not just big businesses and heartware but  also

people and heartware.  I urge the Minister to consider the needs

I have pointed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the Minister has a

particularly  difficult task this year.  The groups  which  seek

his  assistance are many.  If the Minister accedes  to  all  the

requests,  we  will be well and truly on our  way  to  financial

ruin.   On the other hand, he cannot completely acknowledge  all

requests.   The  difficulty is always in identifying  and,  more

importantly,  defending his choices as being  legitimate.   This

year, in particular, there has been a chorus of complaints about

the  budget  due  partly  at  least  to  the  unreasonably  high

expectations of handouts aired publicly before the budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we assess the budget and to what extent are the

complaints  legitimate?   I  would, as  a  point  of  reference,

consider  three  factors.   The  first  is  the  macro  economic

picture.  Does the budget serve to retain investor confidence in

Singapore and show the world that we are rational people who set

a  steady  course and do not steer away from it?  By that  test,

the  budget scores extremely well.  It tells the world  that  we

are  in a strong position, that there is no reason to panic  and

that  there  are no U-turns.  By going for budget  surplus  even

this year and by refusing to accede to most of the requests  for

help,  the  Minister has produced what I would call a  "crunchy"

budget.   It is a word I borrowed from a journal which uses  the

yardstick  of crunchiness to test government policy, crunchy  as

opposed  to being soft.  It is a crunchy budget which recognises

that  there will be pain, and rightly recognises that  generally

Government  cannot  ameliorate that pain.   The  Government  has

succeeded until now by being crunchy and not by being soft.   It

should continue on that course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of reference that I would use is to

consider  the  extent  to which the Government  is  prepared  to

consider  or  create  a  macro economic environment  which  will

provide  the  framework for sectors of the  economy  to  thrive.

Again, the Minister has to be commended for recognising the need

for creating the right environment for the banking and financial

sectors  to  grow.  People complain that this is a  Shenton  Way

budget.  That criticism appears to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



overlook  two  points:  first,  that  the  manufacturing  sector

already  has several tax breaks and incentives and that  perhaps

this budget simply tries to equalize that position vis-a-vis the

banking  sector.   Secondly,  the  criticism  really  fails   to

recognise  the  great potential there is for  Singapore  if  the

financial sector's full potential is recognised and realised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point of reference that I would refer to I will

call  the  cost  of business issue.  It is not the  Government's

business to do micro economic tinkering or molly coddle specific

sectors.   The  Government should broadly aim to  provide  macro

economic  stability, keep taxes low and provide its services  at

market rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government do about the services that it

provides?   The  Minister  has heard over  the  years  the  same

complaint - the costs of doing business are too high -  and  his

reply  has  also  been  the  same.  I would  suggest  perhaps  a

slightly   different  way  of  considering  the  problem.    The

Government  provides  various  services  and  charges  for  such

services.  The private sector complains that the charges are too

high.   The Government, on the other hand, says that the charges

are  at market rates and such charges are also sometimes imposed

to  try and achieve certain socio-economic goals.   Having heard

a Member of the GPC who heard representations from the industry,

all  I  would say to the Minister is that there is a substantial

gulf in the perception between the Government and private sector

as  to whether the charges are at market rates and whether  they

are  fairly reflective of the market rates.  This year, in  view

of  the  economic  situation, the Government should  review  its

charges and the cost of its socio-economic policies, bearing  in

mind that often it is a monopoly provider of such services.  And

it  should  carefully  review and, where possible,  the  charges

should be in line with the  prevailing economic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, one other point is that the Minister must

know  that  the retail sector has been suffering for years,  but

consistent with what I said earlier, I am not herer to plead the

case  for the retail sector or any other sector.  But this year,

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



sector  faces even more challenges, and this is a year when  the

individual   Singaporean  is  likely  to  have  less  liquidity.

Mortgage  rates are higher.  Incomes are going to  be  squeezed.

One  should  consider whether this is the year when tax  rebates

should in fact be reduced from 10% to 5%.  It appears a peculiar

move.  It will mop up what liquidity there might otherwise  have

been  in the market.  The Minister may reply by saying that  the

rebate is a bonus anyway and that it is at the discretion of the

Government.  And my short reply to that would be that as far  as

possible,  more  money  should be left with  the  individual  to

decide how he or she wishes to spend it, rather than mopping  it

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the budget.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  during these difficult economic times, it is prudent  that

the  Government  still plans to achieve a budgetary  surplus  of

$2.7  billion.  Some people have said that the Government should

propose  a very expansionary budget, and even chalk up a  budget

deficit, in order to pump-prime the economy which may enter into

recession soon.  I believe, however, that what characterizes our

current  economic  problems, and makes  it  different  from  our

previous  recessions, is our vulnerability to external  economic

shocks.  The fall-out from Indonesia's deepening crisis may  hit

us much harder than we can currently anticipate and, if it does,

we  may well need a mid-year mini budget which may advocate some

deficit  spending.  But at this current state of uncertainty,  I

support a policy of conservative prudence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to know that the Government is spending on

long-term investments on education, infrastructure and  defence,

which truly underpin our economic success.  We cannot just  talk

about  our economic fundamentals;  we must continually  reinvest

in  honing and sharpening these fundamentals, which this  budget

has done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is disappointment, however, about the lack of

immediate palliative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



measures  to help small and medium enterprises in their business

difficulties.  Many SMEs feel that the Government could have cut

more  levies,  fees,  charges  and taxes  and  increased  public

spending  in  more  sectors  of the economy,  thereby  improving

cashflow and business prospects in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may not think that the conditions are

serious  enough,  but a survey done by the  Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce  in  January 1998 indicated that 94% of the respondents

were  adversely affected by the regional financial  turmoil.   I

hope  the  authorities  will monitor the situation  closely  and

prepare  in  time  contingency  measures  to  deploy  off-Budget

expenditures to assist struggling enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the need

to   spend  more  in  areas  which  I  think  are  important  to

Singapore's long-term development.  I shall confine  my  remarks

to  the  community service sector.  I would like to propose  six

priorities for budgetary expenditures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, more spending on social development projects because

prevention  is  better  than cure.  In the budget's  development

expenditure  for  FY  98, the Ministry of Community  Development

(MCD)   is  given  the  lowest  priority  among  all  Government

Ministries.  It is just 0.11% of GDP, with the exception of  the

newly-created   Manpower  Ministry  which  has  no   development

expenditure at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognise that development projects for other

Ministries are equally worthy of our attention and support, I am

concerned and curious to know why a Ministry such as MCD,  which

handles  family  support  services  and  community  intervention

programmes to promote families and prevent their disintegration,

has less need for development projects than other Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observe some disturbing social trends which were recently

reported  in our newspapers: increasing youth crimes,  teenagers

not  confiding  in  their parents, rising  divorces,  increasing

single  households'  problems,  declining  `O'  and  `A'  levels

results  and  low esteem among those who did not  fare  well  in

1997, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well accept that the Ministry of Home Affairs with

all  its  responsibilities will be given  a  development  budget

which  at  $900  million is more than  five times  greater  than

MCD's development budget, which is $178 million only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is perhaps a little lopsided, however, is the fact

that  MHA's  Police programme alone, which is $240  million,  is

given  a  development budget which is 45% more  than  the  total

development  budget of the entire MCD.  The equivalent  is  $240

million for the Police programme and $116 million for the entire

development expenditure for MCD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if there is a correlation between an expanded

Police programme and family instability, ie, the more unstable a

family,  resulting  in  family  abuse,  runaway  kids  and  drug

addiction and other concomitant problems, the more the need  for

policing  activities  to  keep  crime  rates  down  and  restore

community security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an argument that in the long-run, it is a more

effective  and  sustainable strategy  to  invest  and  encourage

preventive  programmes  in neighbourhood  FSCs  (Family  Service

Centres)  by  MCD than having to spend on remedial  institutions

like  the  Police  Force, drug centres,  prisons  and  detention

homes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein of thinking, more development expenditure

by  the  Government  on  family  life  education  programmes  in

promoting  family  relationships will prevent spousal  violence,

child  abuse  and juvenile delinquency, creating  less  need  to

deploy  police  officers  and health  officers  in  clinics  and

hospitals  in the management and rehabilitation of the violence.

The  dollars  wasted in the time and energy  spent  in  managing

family  conflicts is not inconsequential.  Some  countries  have

shown  that the aggregated resources spent represented a sizable

percentage of the GDP.  It may be worthwhile for us to attempt a

similar  evaluation exercise.  If MHA were to focus on  remedial

rather  than  preventive programmes, then perhaps MCD  could  be

given a larger development budget to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



undertake   preventive  programmes.    The   increase   in   the

development  expenditure for MCD, however, is only 7%  which  is

$12  million over the last fiscal year, whereas for  the  Police

programme, the increase is 38%, which is $66 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, spend to build a body of knowledge in our community

service  delivery system.  A more serious concern  is  the  fact

that  MCD  will  spend only $7.5 million or 1.4%  of  its  total

expenditure  of  about $532 million on research and  information

technology.   And  in MHA, there is not even  any  provision  on

research  at  all.  How much of MCD's research  and  information

technology budget will actually be spent on research  on  family

and community issues, I do not know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to emphasise the importance of having

continuously  updated, integrated data on families  at  risk  to

help   policy  makers  from  various  Ministries  define   their

management  strategies  and operational procedures.   A  one-off

nation-wide survey on families which MCD is currently engaged in

may  be  necessary  and useful for identifying  demographic  and

family relationship patterns, but it does not substantively  add

to  our enforcement officers' operational knowledge which should

be  grounded by case analysis, informed by research  inputs  and

tested by practices uniquely adapted for our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without building up a research department within the

Ministries,  handling family cases or providing the  budget  for

such efforts to be undertaken by other academic institutions for

the  Ministries, we will find our enforcement officers less  and

less  equipped  with effective intervention and  family  therapy

methods and able to identify the necessary social programmes  to

enhance service standards among our frontline workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, spend to set up a Neighbourhood Continuum of

Services for all ages.  It is an important item on my wish  list

to see more but small, efficiently run old folks homes, children

centres, youth hang-out joints, family service centres, day-care

rehabilitation centres for the old and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



disabled,   special  programmes  for  physically  and   mentally

disadvantaged in more schools in every constituency.  As to  how

many  of  these  services need to be set up in relation  to  the

population base in the constituency, what optimal size  will  be

ideal to achieve best performance, the number of workers and the

kind  of social work skills we require, these are key issues  to

address, and I do not think we really know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, spend to identify national manpower needs in the

social  service sector.  Without guided research data to  inform

us  exactly  what are community service needs, we  may  be  busy

building  more  development  projects,  but  unable  to  clearly

evaluate  their  relevance, impact and  sustainability  for  the

community  which  needs our services.   How  do  we  even  start

mapping  the needs of the community and determine the  continuum

of services and skills to be set up?  It will be the public, the

vulnerable  victims  and  dysfunctional  families  who  will  be

shortchanged  due  to incompetent service  standards.   It  also

results in economic wastage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparison, our Government seriously identified the need

for  skills upgrading in our workforce and a large sum of  money

is  put aside by the Ministry of Manpower to retrain our workers

in  the industrial sector after research into skills retraining.

We  all  agree  to  this  pro-worker and pro-business  directive

because  it  enhances our competitiveness and fuels  our  growth

engines  in the economy.  In a similar manner, I argue  that  we

need  to  commit  priority  time  and  resources  to  critically

evaluate community  service delivery programmes, identify  where

the  needs are, train our social workers and volunteers with the

necessary  skills  to offer the public value-added  service  and

rehabilitation treatment so that as healthy and well  integrated

families,  we help to build the social foundation for  Singapore

to cope with the challenges of the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, budget for fitting the puzzles of Inter-Ministry

management and integration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another component which I think should be included in a

budget  is  programme  management and evaluation  expenses.   In

cases of juvenile delinquency and drug offences, violence in the

home  involving young children and other family disputes,  their

management  is  very often beyond the boundary of one  Ministry.

Take  a  family  violence case, for example.   It  involves  the

intervention efforts of MOH, MCD, MHA, MOE, the Courts and FSCs.

I take an example of  spousal violence case.  MOH will determine

the  extent of abuse through medical examination; MCD offers the

social support through FSCs and protects the child by taking her

or him to a place of safety; MHA offers protection and safety to

the   victims  and  directs  abusers  for  rehabilitation;   MOE

identifies cues and signs of abused children or child  witnesses

in  schools  to  intervene early before  their  traumas  deepen.

Recognising  that  case management has to be  multi-disciplinary

and involves multiple parties from different Ministries, we need

to  study,  pilot  and evaluate intervention and  rehabilitation

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this argument, I would like to propose that the

Minister set aside a special budget to pay a team of consultants

to  re-engineer a cross boundary integrated study  in  community

management.  It is time to take a fresh look and review as  well

as  recommend  how  Ministries can and should  work  effectively

together to solve social problems.  Models from  other countries

and their experts can be consulted for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last budget proposal is for a Central Registry of

victims   and  perpetrators  for  fast  response  and  efficient

intervention.  In most countries, a Central Registry is  set  up

to  capture victims' information in computers so that front-line

agencies  like the police, the courts, the hospitals,  FSCs  and

Helplines are electronically linked up to better able  to  track

offenders and victims and adopt appropriate prevention  measures

before crimes are alerted.  A national priority must be given to

setting  this up for the purpose of promoting quick alert,  fast

response, efficient referrals and cross-checks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have highlighted six budget priorities for the community

service  sector  which I hope the Minister will  look  into  and

consider  giving  off-Budget expenses for their  implementation.

If  we give $3 million to start up each of these programmes, the

total  will  only be $18 million, which is a small drop  of  the

expected  surplus of $2.7 billion.  The return on investment  in

dollars  spent  in  this  sector, unlike  in  business,  is  not

immediately  calculable,  but  as  in  education,  its  rational

reinforcement only helps to refine our social service network of

institutions  and  expertise and restore to  the  community  its

sense of well-being.  A sense of well-being felt by Singaporeans

is arguably a most competitive human resource which we can bring

to  the  economy  and  this country.   That,  for  me,  Sir,  is

priceless and enduring.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite

of  this year's budget being dubbed a prudent one, I am glad  to

note  that  many  MPs who have spoken before  me  are  generally

supportive  of  it.  The Budget Statement is in  line  with  our

larger  goals  of  preserving our long term competitiveness  and

achieving  a  stable growth pattern as we position ourselves  to

become a developed economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is impressive is the Finance Minister's ability to

show  a  surplus  of $2.7 billion or about  1.7%  of  GDP  in  a

difficult  and  uncertain  year.   This  is  important   as   it

demonstrates   to  fellow  Singaporeans  and  the  international

business   community  that  in  spite  of  the  financial   woes

enveloping  the region, and to some extent our economy,  we  are

still intent on building our reserves even though it may be  the

lowest in years.  The financial crisis has certainly proven  the

importance   of  building a strong and healthy reserve,  without

which  we  would  have suffered the same fate  as  some  of  our

neighbours did in the regional currency battering.  For the year

ahead  of us, what is even more important is the fact that  this

very surplus will become available immediately for infusion into

the  economy  should  there  be a need  for  the  Government  to

implement  off-Budget  measures,  as  already  promised  by  the

Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated by several Members already, the financial

services sector is once again the major beneficiary of the  host

of  incentives unveiled in the Budget Statement.  As this sector

is  one of the key propellants of our economy and the fact  that

it  is also tied to our goal to be a global financial centre and

a  regional business hub, it is therefore appropriate  for  this

sector to be given a further boost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, I am pleased to note that there is no softening

in the allocation of funds for education, although we could have

done  better  in  setting  aside  more  funding  for  Continuing

Education  and  Training  (CET)  in  the  wake  of  the  current

financial  crisis.  I am sure several of my labour MP colleagues

will  touch on this subject at length.  In spite of the need  to

be  prudent in crafting the Budget during this unstable  period,

we  must  continue  to  build on the philosophy  and  wisdom  of

"teaching  a  man  how  to  fish".  Inculcating  creativity  and

thinking  skills  in  our  school  children  will  provide   the

foundation  for  them  not only to survive  in  an  increasingly

challenging world but will also shape their mental framework  to

overcome adversity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the wake of our expected growth slowdown

and the full impact of the regional economic crisis expected  to

be felt this year, it is fair for the business community to also

anticipate  a budget that would offer them some relief  to  help

them tide through the current difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As already stated by Mr Leong Horn Kee, Chairman of the

Government  Parliamentary  Committee  for  Finance,  Trade   and

Industry,  and  also being a member of the Committee  myself,  I

wish  to  echo  the  disappointment  expressed  by  the  various

Chambers  of  Commerce  and Industry and the  trade  groups  and

associations  the Committee met with after the  announcement  of

the  Budget  Statement.  They  strongly  felt  that  the  budget

primarily benefited certain segments of the financial sector and

failed to provide sufficient reprieve in lowering business costs

in the current difficult and challenging business environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the financial crisis afflicting the region,

many  of  our local businesses are experiencing various setbacks

and  are  cash  strapped due to their exposure in  the  regional

markets,  especially Indonesia, Malaysia and  Thailand.   Demand

for  the  products  they  sell to these  countries  has  sharply

decreased  due to the exchange rate situation, and at  the  same

time their imports from these countries are finding fewer buyers

as   Singaporeans  tighten  their  belts  on  spending.    Sales

contracts  made  before the currency crisis and  denominated  in

regional  currencies are resulting in drastic  exchange  losses,

and  to  make matters worse, payments are coming in slower  than

ever before, thereby contributing to cash flow difficulties.  On

the  local front, interest rates are higher and banks  are  more

conservative in extending credit.  Many businesses are therefore

confronted  with  tight cash flow, reduced turnover,  relatively

higher costs, and potentially higher bad debt exposure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent widening of the scope of the Local

Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) is indeed the sparkle in  the

Budget  for our local businesses, especially for the  small  and

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  It will help to alleviate cost

pressures  on  businesses.  However, some groups  expressed  the

concern  that  the  enhancement will  primarily  benefit  larger

companies  which will be viewed more favourably by the financial

institutions  in their lending considerations,  whether  or  not

they are prepared to co-share the lending risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that some attention be given by the

administrating   body   of  the  scheme,   ie,   the   Singapore

Productivity  and Standards Board (PSB), to deserving  companies

which may have difficulty in securing working capital loans from

the financial institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the wide range of Government assistance schemes

available  for  companies  to  take  advantage  of,  the   local

enterprises  continue to feel that there  is  room  for  further

simplification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



the procedures.  Many are turned off by the amount of paper work

required  to  apply  for the schemes.  I  hope  the  appropriate

Government agencies administering the various schemes could look

into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the 15% tax rebate for commercial and

industrial properties, while this directly benefits the property

owners, there is concern that many private owners will not share

this concession with their tenants.  I suggest that some form of

a  concession-sharing formula be considered to require landlords

who  rent  out their properties to share the rebate  with  their

tenants.  Only then will this concession benefit a wider  cross-section of the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the extension of rent freeze by the JTC and HDB, it

was  strongly felt that the freeze did not offer anything  extra

to  lower  operating costs, as both agencies  had  frozen  their

rentals  since the middle of last year.  As rent in  most  cases

represents  the  second highest component of  business  cost,  I

suggest  that this area be closely looked at as a possible  off-Budget action, should the situation worsen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporate tax reduction expected by certain quarters, I

personally  feel that it would not make much of a difference  to

businesses in a year where profits are expected to be  generally

lower or where there are no profits to be made at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do hope that some form of a multi-tier corporate

tax  system for local SMEs as proposed by Mr Lew Syn Pau in last

year's  Budget  debate is being considered by the  Minister  for

Finance.   As  an example, Mr Lew suggested that  the  first  $2

million  in  taxable income could be taxed at 15%, the  next  $3

million at a higher rate of 20% and amounts above $5 million  at

the long term rate of 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a move will help local SMEs grow faster as the savings

in  corporate tax could be ploughed back into the business.  One

way  to  ensure that the money is reinvested is  to  make  it  a

condition that companies could only enjoy the scheme if the  tax

savings are retained in the business for re-investment purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 5% one-off tax rebate for

individuals,  while  I  do  understand  the  rationale  for  the

reduction  from  the 10% one-off given last  year,  I  wish  the

Minister  could  have been more generous in  the  light  of  the

current  economic gloom.  The relief could have helped  make  up

for  the declining disposable income anticipated this year as  a

result of lower variable bonuses and salary increases because of

more  difficult business conditions.  The spare cash  could,  in

turn,  be  channelled back into the economy to help  the  ailing

retail sector which is experiencing a serious slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important in this rapidly changing and

events-driven economic environment for the Government to closely

feel  the  pulse  of the business community  and  economy  on  a

regular basis to ensure that off-Budget measures could be  taken

swiftly before the situation becomes very difficult to contain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe there is

an  urgent  need  for  businesses  to  learn  that  they  cannot

continually  look up to the Government to solve  their  business

problems.   They  need to be educated on the  realities  of  the

harsh  and fiercely competitive business environment which calls

for   responsiveness  to  changing  circumstances  and  customer

expectations in the smallest possible lapse of time.  They  must

be  made  to  understand that survival today  means  effectively

managing perpetual motion or risk becoming obsolete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, amidst the gloom hovering over us, it is

important also for us not to be obsessed with the negatives  and

forget  about the opportunities abound in the region.  With  the

strength   of   the  Singapore  dollar  relative   to   regional

currencies, there are tremendous opportunities to acquire or buy

into companies which are in dire need of capital infusion in our

neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy in the

name of the Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I move on to speak

on the Budget, may I just say a few words about how refreshing I

found Dr Tan Cheng Bock's outburst on,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



what  I guess, an attempt to silence even an MP speaking up.   I

do  hope  that Dr Tan Cheng Bock would accept the invitation  of

the  Leader  to  move  a motion in the House  that  Singaporeans

should not be admonished or stepped down for speaking up, and he

will  find in me a ready supporter.  I await the motion from  Dr

Tan Cheng Bock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, resume your seat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Maybe afterwards. May I move on to the

Budget  because  we  are allowed half an  hour  for  the  Budget

speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a few introductory remarks

about  the Budget before I come to the specific concerns  of  my

Party on this Budget.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.35 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that, reading it, it sounded to me more like the 1997 Budget.

It seems to be a rehash of the 1997  Budget.   It

read more like the 1997 Budget than a Budget for this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other observation that I wish to make is that, as has

been  mentioned  by  a  number  of  speakers,  the  Government's

assessment of the impact of the financial turmoil in the  region

on  Singapore  seems  to  be different  from  that  outside  the

Government.  The Government would appear to take the  view  that

Singapore  should come off quite well without getting  hurt  too

badly.  But that does not appear to be the view of the people in

the  business community and outside.  We only had the  statement

of  the  Singapore National Employers' Federation on 4th  March,

replying to the head of the NWC saying that there should  be  no

cuts  in the basic pay.  The Federation's reply was that it  was

too early to say pay cuts were not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



necessary and that some companies had already taken the step  to

cut  the  pay of their executives.  This is something  that  was

lost  on the Deputy Prime Minister when he replied to my  motion

about  six weeks ago.  Because he seemed to think there were  no

pay  cuts outside the Government and Government should not  move

in first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are these conflicting views. And as has been

expressed,  this  Budget would appear to be  not  alive  to  the

seriousness of the economic crisis that faces us.   I  get  that

impression.  It seemed more alive in the 1985 Budget but not  in

this Budget.  A thought passed my mind and that was whether  the

Finance  Minister  was perhaps getting a bit too  old  in  being

Finance Minister, or getting tired of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. You shall not be personal with

your remarks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir. I am sorry. But may I

also  then move on to the other observation that I wish to make,

and  that  is  this.   He  says in his Budget  speech  that  the

Government  is  keeping a "tight lid", a cap  on  operating  and

development expenditures.  And he goes on to say elsewhere  that

it  was  the Government's "deliberate policy to keep the  public

sector  lean and trim".  Having said that, if one looks  through

the Budget, one finds that the operating expenditure has gone up

by $1.12 billion over 1997, and that is, after the Minister says

it  will be the policy of this Government to keep a tight lid on

expenditures,  particularly operating expenditure.   I  have  no

quarrel  with  the increase in the development expenditure,  but

this operating expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the expenditure for the Prime Minister's Office.

And  I see the operating expenditure there has gone up this year

by $7.55 million.  I also read what was the work programme under

the  Prime  Minister's portfolio.  And if I may  read  from  the

Budget book, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The work areas under the Administration programme include

providing  administrative support to the Prime Minister,  Senior

Minister  and Deputy Prime Minister, administering the Singapore

State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, allocation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



of  state  cars as well as matters relating to National  Honours

and  Awards.  The Elections programme covers the production  and

public  exhibition of the registers of electors, maintenance  of

the  electoral database and conduct of elections in an  election

year.   The  Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau investigates

allegations  and complaints of offences under the Prevention  of

Corruption Act, maintains records of persons investigated by the

Bureau and provides screening services to public authorities and

authorised organisations."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To administer this programme which, as I have read,

includes, among other matters, administering the State Arms  and

Flag,  the  National Anthem Rules, allocating  state  cars,  the

elections  programme  and  the Corrupt  Practices  Investigation

Bureau,  we  are told that the operating expenditure  should  be

raised by another $7.55 million.  And we are told also that this

programme  is  administered by no less than four Ministers,  one

Senior  Minister  (this post has been vacant for  the  last  two

years but apparently it is considered necessary to have a Senior

Minister  as well, besides the four Ministers), one Minister  of

State,   one   Parliamentary   Secretary   and   two   Political

Secretaries.   Really,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  do  we  need   six

Ministers to administer the work programme that I have just read

out?   And  I  see  that,  of  the  increase  in  the  operating

expenditure,  it  is  the expenditure on political  appointments

that  has gone up by $4.4 million from 1997, and it has gone  up

by  $7.4  million from 1996.  I see the Prime Minister has  left

the  House,  but  I  was hoping we would  hear  from  the  Prime

Minister, because the Finance Minister may not be in a  position

to  answer  this.   Why  do  we  need  all  these  Ministers  to

administer this programme?  Is this, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  a

case  of  Parkinson's law in operation?  And do  we  still  need

nannies  for  the  Ministers to oversee what the  Ministers  are

doing  in their own Ministries?  I say this because it seems  to

me  that  not  enough  thought has been given  to  what  we  are

spending  on  the  administration.   I  have  taken  the   Prime

Minister's Office as an example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I move on, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to my Party's

concerns  in this Budget.  Several speakers have spoken  of  the

concern  of the business sector.  I am not here to say  that  we

should not take care of the business sector.  They are most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



important.   But at the same time, I think one must  not  forget

that  labour  has an equal part to play in the  economy  and  in

attempts to resuscitate the economy.  And as I said, my Party is

concerned  about the effect on the workers.  Before  I  come  to

that, may I also mention something which I have overlooked,  and

that  is,  the total absence in this Budget of any cost  cutting

measures  on  the part of the Government.  Mention  has  already

been  made  of  no announcement of JTC and HDB decreasing  their

rental  charges  or  that  they have any  intention  to  do  so.

Neither  is  any mention made of the amount of revenue  that  is

collected by the Government in fees and licences.  Do  we  still

have  to  maintain these high fees and licence charges when  the

businesses are finding it difficult to make their ends meet?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on to the Party's concern. The Minister

says again, in his Budget, that our priority this year should be

to  protect  jobs.  We say amen to that.  But look  through  the

Budget Statement and we see no word at all of how the Government

proposes  to protect the jobs of the workers.  As was  mentioned

by   the  Singapore  National  Employers'  Federation  in  their

statement  on 4th March, the rate of unemployment has  increased

this  year and several speakers have mentioned this.  I was told

the  other  day, when I was at Ang Mo Kio, of a company  telling

one  of its workers that either he took a pay cut or face losing

his  job.   How is the Government going to protect the  workers'

jobs?   Has  the  Government any plans to  stop  employers  from

taking  advantage of the recession to terminate the services  of

workers  who have been with them for years and employing cheaper

labour?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last sitting of this House, when there was a

question  from  my  Party Member to the  Minister  about  paying

retrenchment benefits to workers who have worked for  more  than

10  years, the Minister of State said that there was no need for

any  legislation.  May I tell the Minister for  Labour  and  the

Government  that  if there had been some legislation  protecting

the  workers'  rights by requiring employers to pay compensation

for unfair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



termination, employers would not be trigger-happy, to  use  that

term, to lay off their workers.  But we do not have any such law

and, as I said then, our workers are completely at the mercy  of

the  employers.   What is the position of our workers  vis-a-vis

foreign  workers?   Are  they  going  to  lose  their  jobs   in

preference to foreign workers?  Sometime ago, I thought  I  read

about  the Secretary-General of the NTUC, who is also a  Cabinet

Minister,  saying that it would not be right to expect companies

to  keep  Singapore workers and only get rid of foreign  workers

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Causeway, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see the

government has announced its intention to keep strict  watch  on

companies  laying off workers by requiring them to  explain  the

proposed retrenchment.  Does the Government here propose  to  do

anything like that?  Then there is the question of retraining of

workers.   I  had asked the Minister for Labour to let  me  know

what  is  being  done  by the Government on retraining  and  his

private  secretary rang up to say, "You can't have it now.   The

Minister will be giving an answer in the House on Monday and you

will  have  it  then."  I have not been able then to  study  the

Government's  plans on retraining.  So it is very difficult  for

me  to  speak on that.  But I think Mr Chiam has already touched

on  it slightly, and that is, it does not seem really to provide

for the situation that we are facing at the moment.  A lot of it

is  left  to  the  employers  or the agencies  outside  and  the

Government itself is not controlling the retraining of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister went on to speak about the United

Kingdom  rolling back on welfare.  I think the  Minister  was  a

little unfair.  If he had studied what the Labour Government  in

the United Kingdom has planned, he will find that it is not just

rolling back welfare payments for workers but has prepared  well

thought-out  plans  and  schemes to find  employment  for  those

between  18 and 25 and for those who are over 25 who  have  been

unemployed.   There  are  booklets  available  and  perhaps  the

Minister   should  look  at  them.   Why  cannot  the  Singapore

Government do something on those lines?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the relief or help for those who lose their

jobs.   All the Minister can offer is the rent rebates  and  the

service and conservancy rebates and the utilities rebates.   But

the  rent rebates and S&C rebates are lower this year than  what

they  were  last  year.  For 1- and 2-room  flats,  the  S&C  is

reduced  by one month.  For a 3-room flat, it is reduced  by  1�

months.   For a 4-room flat, it is reduced from one month  to  _

month and for a 5-room flat, it is reduced from one month  to  �

month.   Is  that all the help that the Government  proposes  to

give  to people who are going to find themselves without  a  job

and  are unable to make their ends meet?  Is there nothing  else

that  this Government can do?  There was a wonderful opportunity

for  the  Minister and for the Government to do  something,  not

just for the wealthy but for the entire country, and that was to

suspend  the  Goods  and  Services Tax for  the  period  of  the

recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were opposed to the Goods and

Services Tax.  We called it an evil tax, an unfair tax.  But the

Government  proceeded, and the result was an immediate  increase

in prices of everything.  Of course, retailers and manufacturers

had  to  put up their prices if they have to pay the  Goods  and

Services Tax.  And I see that it is now a good earner in revenue

for  the Government.  For 1998, it is estimated at $1.95 billion

and  it has gone up by $90 million over 1997 and it is the third

biggest earner in tax revenue.  I was curious to see that  there

was another item "Other Taxes" which brought in $2.3 billion.  I

wonder  whether  the Minister would explain  what  these  "Other

Taxes"  are.   And  again,  the fees  and  services  collections

account  for a very significant portion of the revenue.   May  I

ask  the Minister: was suspension of the GST ever considered  at

all?   Even if it was not thought possible to suspend the  whole

GST,  was  any  thought given to exempting the  tax  from  basic

necessities like food and clothing and education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the water tax? Was any thought given to

suspending  the  water  tax and other taxes  on  basic  services

provided to the people?  We were told that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



reason  for the water tax was because there was a threat to  cut

off  our  water  supply.   But now, we have  been  told  by  the

Malaysian  government that it has no intention to  cut  off  the

water  supply.  So will the Minister consider waiving even  that

little  bit,  cutting  off the water tax, because  that  affects

almost every household in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Budget should address all

sections  of the community.  As I said, we have no quarrel  when

it  addresses  the concerns of the business community.   But  it

abysmally  fails to address the concerns of the workers  and  of

those  who  are  not well-to-do.  And it is, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  in  many ways a very disappointing Budget.   As  has  been

mentioned,  the  business  community is  not  exactly  clapping.

Nobody  is clapping at this Budget.  It is unfortunate that  the

Minister has missed the many opportunities that were open to him

and  to  the Government to show that it was concerned about  the

economy  and  its effects on the people and that it  would  take

into  account the hardships of our people and that is why I call

this  a  most  disappointing Budget we have had for  many,  many

years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard a very

refreshing and interesting speech by my parliamentary colleague,

Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock, but not the speech and viewpoints  of  the

NCMP.   That aside, I know that you are functioning  on  a  very

tight  schedule.   So I shall be very precise and  raise  a  few

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to state that this year's budget is

rather  prudent  and  I expected some giveaways  for  low-income

families,  but  there are less giveaways  this  year.   This  is

understandable as the economic situation is expected to be tight

for the next few years.  However, I would state that it would be

better  to maintain a status quo in terms of the budget,  rather

than  to increase other  related charges because there were off-Budget  charges  which  had  been implemented  earlier  such  as

electricity, medical and property charges.  The increases  which

have   been   announced  by  some  Ministries  and  restructured

Government bodies have increased the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



burdens  of  the  households  and  companies.   These  increased

charges  should be reviewed as they were implemented before  the

economic  downturn.   I  hope the Minister,  in  his  off-Budget

proposals,  would  take  this  into  consideration.   Sir,  such

practices  should  be carefully monitored  to  ensure  that  the

budget is not jettisoned out of course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a number of issues. First,

is  the  plight of the low income pensioners.  The pleas of  low

income  pensioners have been heard by the Minister many a  time.

I hope he will not just hear but act to bring some relief to the

pensioners.   It  is high time that we revised the  pensions  of

very low income pensioners, particularly those whose pension  is

very low and meagre, much lower than the public assistance rate.

These  pensioners have given sterling services to the Government

during  their  time and it is about time that we  gave  them  an

uplift  their life and their shoe-string income.   And  this  is

particularly  the case for those without children and  immediate

relatives.  I think they do deserve our attention and we  should

provide  the  best  of  support we  can  give  for  this  group.

Although  there  is  an  argument that there  is  the  Singapore

Allowance,   I  do not think that the allowance   together  with

their  meagre pension would reduce their burden at all.  I  feel

that the Minister should give very close attention to this group

of low income pensioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue is to look at the effects of

corporatisation.   In  the  last  five  years,  Government   has

corporatised  various public sector services.  The  question  we

should  ask ourselves is whether the corporatised public  sector

services are achieving their objectives.  Are these corporatised

bodies efficient and effective?  I think it is very important to

review their performance at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of public sector services such as health

care,  telecommunications, power and gas, and broadcasting  have

made  their  presence felt in the last number of  years  through

corporatisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



and  restructuring.  They set charges and  commit huge expenses.

A  lot  of  them spend millions of dollars.  All these decisions

have  implications on the consumers, namely, cost and efficiency

of  services.   In  short, one cannot ignore that  these  public

services  must be affordable to the majority of the  population.

Sir,  I must say that there is always the temptation that  these

corporations strive to make high and mindless surpluses, as they

do  not  want  to  show up as inefficient.  When  this  happens,

consumers  would  have to carry the brunt as they  have  limited

alternatives to purchase services, other than telecommunications

where  there has been competition in telecommunication services.

A  number  of operators have come in.  Prices have been  reduced

and I am sure you would agree with me that it would be a welcome

change  to  have  a number of other operators to provide  public

services  so that they can give the monopolistic private  sector

services a run for their money.  I must say that the interest of

the  consumers must be protected and regulatory bodies  must  be

established to make them accountable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with much concern the comments of the Public

Accounts  Committee which  stressed for more  accountability  of

corporatised public services and statutory boards.  It  is  high

time  that the Government imposed some controls on them so  that

the interests of the consumers are safeguarded.  I think this is

very  critical at this stage of growth and there is  a  need  to

ensure  that  there  is good accountability from  these  various

corporatised public service bodies.  I want to find out from the

Minister  whether these corporatised public service  bodies  are

efficient  in  making surpluses or cost effective  in  providing

services.   This is essentially a very important issue  that  we

would have to review and  examine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on incentives for savings, we have to encourage

Singaporeans to save more, and not to spend  money that they can

save.   The  spend  culture  will  make  us  more  indebted  and

economically  vulnerable.   We cannot  expect  to  be  a  strong

society  if  we  have low reserves.  I would like  to  urge  the

Minister to give incentives or rebates to those who save.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



We  will have to encourage a more saving culture so that we will

be  more  consolidated and  be able to manage even in  difficult

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of training for workers, particularly

older workers, companies that have older workers should be given

tax  rebates  for training of their workers besides the  funding

from  the Skills Development Fund.  The Skills Development  Fund

is  not  comprehensive to cover various grades of  workers.   An

additional tax rebate for companies which take active  steps  to

retrain   older  workers  should  be  considered.   The  present

incentives  are cosmetic and not serious enough to step  up  the

interest  to  train our workers.  It is important  to  encourage

some  of these companies to think about more innovative ways  to

retrain  older workers.  And I am sure the Minister could  be  a

bit  more  liberal and provide grants and support  to  companies

which   are  more  positive  and   prepared  to  undertake   the

retraining of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

Singapore is facing financial and economic difficulties.     How

long  the difficult situation will continue or how deep it  will

sink  is  still  uncertain.  But what we can see  is  that  many

businesses  are faced with a stagnated market and  serious  cash

flow problems.  Many people are faced with a reduction in income

or  even unemployment.  Everybody is trying to adjust or  adapt,

but  they soon discover that the options open to them to  adjust

or adapt are not many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business community, many items of operational cost

such  as  rent, wages and various Government charges  are  fixed

expenditures.   The  little  bits  of  rebates  offered  by  the

Government  cannot effectively bring down the  operational  cost

for  them to pull through.  As for the ordinary citizens who are

unemployed  or have suffered a reduction in income,  they  still

have   to   pay  the  instalments  for  their  mortgage   loans,

educational  fees, GST and the various charges  that  have  been

raised again and again over the years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate last year, I pointed out that the

escalation  of  the  various  service  charges  such  as  public

transportation, refuse collection fees, university  fees,  water

conservation  tax  and  the  selling  price  of  HDB  flats  was

worrying.  I also warned the Government that if it was unable to

resolve  the problem of business cost resulting in the  workers'

salaries  being  stagnated or the factories closing  down,  then

the pressure on the people would be mounting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, many people are already facing this

pressure.  The Government should review the price mechanism that

it  has  been  employing  all the time  to  achieve  its  policy

objectives.  The side effect from the price mechanism  principle

is  higher  cost  of  living  and higher  operational  cost  for

businesses.   When times are good, and business  is  good,   the

various costs and charges would go up.   Once the economy  takes

a downturn, income is reduced,  and they will face a big problem

because the fixed expenditure cannot be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the business community, when the economy is good, the

costs  of  materials and operations will go up.  When sales  are

good,  they  could still manage to pull through.  But  once  the

situation  is  bad, when their sales drop, they would  not  make

enough  money  and they will have a serious cash  flow  problem.

Because  of  this high cost of operation, the profit  margin  is

low,  and they could not save enough for a rainy day.  Once they

face  difficulties  and are caught in the  midst  of  instalment

payments,  there  is  no way they would  adjust  or  trim  their

overhead expenses to tide over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this budget, it is apparent that the Government feels

that  the  economic situation faced by Singapore is not  serious

enough.   But  the  survey by the Singapore Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce  and  Industry  reveals that  more  than  half  of  the

businesses  are facing cash flow problems.  A global  securities

institution,  Morgan Stanley, has predicted that  Singapore  may

face  zero  growth in its economy.  I hope that the Government's

judgment this time is correct.  I hope that it would not  repeat

what it did in 1985 when it waited until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



many companies had closed down and the economy was well battered

before  they resorted to contingency measures.  What  I  do  not

understand  is that when the Government levy taxes, they  always

say  that we have to provide for a rainy day.  But when  we  are

having  difficult  times, when the people are  tightening  their

belts  and  not  knowing  whether they  could  tide  over,   the

Government  does not come to their rescue.   All  they  say  is,

"wait  and  see".   When the people are faced with  unemployment

problems,   the   Government's  policy  is   to  enhance   their

employability  so  that  they could resolve  their  unemployment

problem.   If  you  can find a new job that pays  you  the  same

wages,  it is well and good.  But if you cannot get a  job  that

gives  you  the same pay or you cannot even get a new job,  then

what is going to happen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we face an economic depression, when people are facing

a long unemployment situation and if the Government is unable to

attract  new investments to create job opportunities, then  what

protection  can we give to our workers?  What I am more  worried

is  that, with the financial crisis in this region, the value of

the  Singapore dollar may be affected.  Our imported goods would

be  more expensive and our people will face serious problems  of

inflation.   Under  such  circumstances,  would  the  Government

promise to suspend the collection of  GST?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also said that if the economy takes a

turn  for  the  worse,   it  will  consider  reducing  the   CPF

contribution  rates  or allowing people  to  withdraw  some  CPF

savings to tide over.  But the problem is how much money do  our

people  have  in their ordinary accounts in the  CPF?   The  HDB

flats are getting more and more expensive. Under the new policy,

the  people   have  to withdraw everything they  have  in  their

ordinary accounts before they could obtain a loan from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that many Singaporeans have only enough CPF savings

to  pay  for their loan instalments. What happens if one day  we

suffer  a very serious depression and many people are unemployed

and  faced with serious inflation, what can our people rely  on?

When the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



economic situation is good, the Government feels that the people

could  afford it and they keep on increasing charges.  When  the

budget  is  released, the rebates given to  the  people  are  so

small.   It is just like trying to put out the fire of a burning

cart-load of wood with a cup of water.  When salaries are frozen

or incomes are reduced, the Government does not provide anything

for  them.   To  the Government, it is a situation  whereby  the

"horses  will continue to be raced, and the taxes will  continue

to be levied."

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, during the Budget debate last  year, the MP for Hougang

used  the  analogy of "wool coming from the back of the  sheep".

This  year,  he switched to the horse, saying "the  horses  will

continue to be raced, and the taxes will continue to be levied".

This   being  the  "Year  of  the  Tiger",  I   think  the  most

appropriate  animal  to  be used as an analogy   should  be  the

tiger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and currency crisis this time is like a

tiger.  When  the  tiger  is around,  we  will  have  difficulty

climbing the mountain.   I think the Government should play  the

role  of  the legendary hero Wu Song.   In the episode from  the

Chinese classic The Water Margin,  Wu Song drank three big bowls

of  strong liquor to gather enough courage to go to the mountain

where  he  encountered the fierce tiger and killed it  with  his

bare  fists.  Our Government can play the role of Wu Song,   but

it  relies  on prudent financial policy rather than  alcohol  to

defeat the "tiger".   We must go to the mountain, face the tiger

squarely  and  defeat it, for the benefit of not  only  our  own

people but the people around us as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is presented in the midst of a regional

financial   and  currency  crisis.  It  hits  our   neighbouring

countries,  like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand,  and  we  are

also affected.  Our Singapore dollar is also affected.  However,

I feel the impact of the currency turmoil has not been fully and

adequately  reflected  in  this Budget.   Perhaps,  the  Finance

Minister wants us to remain unruffled.  He does not want  us  to

be unduly worried.  He only indicated that if the situation gets

worse, he   will take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



off-Budget  measures to assist the people.  I hope that  in  his

reply  tomorrow,  he can enlighten us  on what  measures  he  is

going to take to pull us through the difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, some companies are beginning to downsize or

restructure and many workers are affected.  I feel that this  is

a  very  important lesson to learn. At a time when  we  want  to

attract foreign talents, we should also help our own workers  to

upgrade  their  skills.  However, there is  no  mention  in  the

Budget  of  any specific measures to promote  job upgrading  for

our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businessmen feel that this Budget has not provided

adequate  help  to  the small and medium enterprises.   Although

there  are existing packages to help them, they feel that it  is

something  which "you can see but cannot enjoy".  The government

officials, on the other hand,  say "You do not see it, thus  you

don't  enjoy  it."   So there is a perception  gap  between  the

businessmen  and the bureaucrats.  I feel that  we  should  have

more dialogues between the SMEs and the authorities so that  the

business  community can understand what facilities are available

to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, some people feel that owners of 5-room HDB flats

should  be entitled to the same rebates as those living  in  the

smaller   flats,  because  living  in  bigger  flats  does   not

necessarily mean that they are better off than their  neighbours

in the smaller flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these observations, we can see that people are more

concerned  with their own interest.  Of course, we cannot  fault

them  for looking after their interest.   But at a time when  we

are faced with this regional financial crisis, we should have  a

[                          ] "sense of crisis" rather than the [

]  "sense of self-interest".  I feel that in this budget we have

not  fully  made  use of this opportunity to  inculcate  in  our

people  a  sense of crisis.  Let us reflect on what happened  at

the  SilkAir accident. After the crash, many people came forward

and  signed  the  book  of condolence and  attended  the  public

memorial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



service.   It is a very valuable lesson.  Singaporeans are  more

united  and  have  more human touch because  of  this  incident.

Therefore, we should make use of this regional financial  crisis

to  unite our people so that we have a sense of crisis and  have

less sense of self-interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage the people to upgrade themselves.

In  the  past few years, many Singaporeans have been  upgrading.

They  have been upgrading in terms of their housing.  When  they

can  afford  it,  of course, it is well and  good  for  them  to

upgrade.   Unfortunately,   there  are  many  people   who   are

upgrading  even  when they could not afford it.   They  upgraded

from  a small flat to a big flat, and then from a big flat to  a

bigger  unit.   Now,  because of this crisis,  many  people  are

changing  from the bigger flats to the smaller flats.  They  are

downgrading!    In  fact, the people should be    encouraged  to

upgrade  their skills rather than their flats.  In the past,  we

said that a skill in hand can benefit you for a whole life time.

But  in  the present context, one skill is just not enough.   We

must be multi-skilled so that we will not be caught in the wrong

foot in the face of an economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy to curb property

speculation.   I  feel that we should encourage our  workers  to

upgrade themselves.  Not only the workers, but even the managers

and CEOs should also upgrade their skills.

Of course, this financial crisis has some negative effect on us,

but it has also brought to us some revelation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have a very stringent and highly transparent

monetary  policy.  It is because of this that  we  are  able  to

withstand  the  impact  of  this  recent  regional  turmoil  and

Singaporeans are beginning to understand this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our people are beginning to realise that they

cannot keep raising their expectations indefinitely.  They  must

have the ability to adjust to changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether it is investment or speculation, we have

to  face risks.  Although for investment the rate of return  may

not be very high, if you speculate you may lose your last penny.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel Singaporeans should have more sense of crisis and

less  sense of self-interest.  I hope the Minister will give  us

more  details on the off-Budget measures he proposes to take  if

things get worse,  when he replies tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed with the Budget proper, I hope you

will  allow  me to comment on the point raised by Dr  Tan  Cheng

Bock, and state my view to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with him and the other Members that no civil

servants   should  undermine  the  confidence  of   Members   of

Parliament  and  their  standing  in  public  as  well   as   in

Parliament.   However, Sir, when we discuss  the  conduct  of  a

person  who  is  outside  this House,  we  should  be  cautious,

temperate in our language, and we should see that in no  way  do

we  cast  aspersion of the civil service as a whole  because  no

matter  how  strong the political leadership is,  if  the  civil

servants  are  not committed to carry out the work,  goods  will

never be delivered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a Member wants to speak on the conduct of a civil

servant, he should at least file a proper motion.  Dr Tan  Cheng

Bock,  in fact, spoke more on the Chairman of EDB than  on  this

Budget.  I think it is proper that we, the Members, should abide

by  the  Standing Orders.  I especially remember reading in  the

papers  some  years  back  when an hon.  Member  of  this  House

criticised  somebody outside this House and Members  took  great

exception.   I  think we should re-express the  same  sentiments

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we examine the Budget presented by the Minister

for  Finance with the background of the turmoil that  is  facing

many South East Asian countries, we can say that this has been a

Budget without pain.  The Budget is positive, prudent and, if  I

may say so, promising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priorities are right. Defence and education have been

given  top  priority and they should be so.  I am glad  that  no

Member so far, either opposition or from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  backbenchers or the NMPs,  has  questioned  the

spending on defence and it is important because we are living in

a  turbulent world.  Defence and stability cannot be  taken  for

granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a very pragmatic budget. This did not come

about  because  of the planning just of last year.   It  is  the

result  of  careful  finance balancing  and  planning  that  the

Government has taken over the years.  Some Singaporeans take  it

for  granted that this is a natural process.  Some believe  that

there will always be some surpluses.  Sir, while talking of  the

surplus, I am a little disappointed that the Minister could have

been  a bit more charitable by giving less surplus and the money

could  have been channelled to areas which I am going to discuss

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a stable, open, transparent, honest Government which

is  committed  to improving the life of the people  has  brought

about  this Budget.  Even the Government's worst critics  cannot

deny  the  Government's sound fiscal policy.   In  any  economic

development, the people have a pivotal role to play. So  is  the

case  of  our  economy and our people.  The people must  undergo

some  sacrifice  now  for a better future.   All  of  us  should

upgrade  our  skills  even if it may mean  some  change  in  our

lifestyle.  Here, I agree with Mr Seng Han Thong that we  should

all,  irrespective of what our position in economic life,  train

ourselves.  Some temporary loss would yield gain in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to share some concerns shown by the

private property owners.  They are concerned that the prices are

falling, distressed sales are on the rise.  The bottom  line  is

yet  to come.  It is reassuring to note that the glut in private

property  would not increase as the Government will control  the

release  of  land.  I urge the Minister to review  the  position

from  time to time to see that the property market does not fall

dramatically.   I  believe a long slump in the  property  market

will not be good for the economy.  But having said that, let  me

add  a  word  of  caution, Sir.  I share the  sentiments  of  Mr

Inderjit Singh.  We must not allow the free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



market  forces  to  be  stifled.  While we  must  see  that  the

property market is protected, we must not allow the free  market

to be flouted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a little disappointed, and I

share the sentiments by some Members of this House, that despite

the  urgent need for skills training, the Minister has not  been

very  generous in this area.  No special fund has been allocated

from the Budget to train the workers.  All we have is a previous

set-up  under the Skills Development Fund.  I urge the employers

to  take  more interest in skills training.  Wherever  possible,

they   should  not  wait  for  retrenchment  or  wait  for   the

Government's  call  for  skills training.   They  on  their  own

initiatives  should  try  to  find  out  which  area  of  skills

development will help them.  The Government could in some  cases

offer financial assistance to small enterprises so that they can

take  full  advantage of the workers' training.  I  believe  the

present system is not adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging that our

financial  sector  is being reorganised and I  congratulate  the

Minister for the various tax incentives in this area.  I am sure

this area will further grow, and let us hope that we will become

the best financial sector in the Far East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage more fund managers and financial

experts  to  settle  down in Singapore.  Therefore,  I  have  no

hesitation in supporting the Government's move to allow talented

people  to  come  and work here.  Singapore would  benefit  from

these people.  Our diplomatic missions abroad should promote the

policy as other countries are equally interested in wooing these

people.  They are in short supply.  We must not miss them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt that the Government will not allow

these  talented personnel who have come here to take  away  jobs

from  our people.  The simple truth is that we do not have  such

people  in  our midst.  Even developed countries are  trying  to

attract  these talents.  We need them more than they.   This  is

why even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



USA,  with  a  highly successful workforce,  is  trying  to  get

computer  engineers  from Asia.  Similarly, medical  specialists

are  in  high demand both in USA and UK.  I support, and I  hope

every Singaporean support this move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, where we do not have any natural resources,

we  are  depending  on  our manpower and our  location.   It  is

therefore very vital that we attract top talented people.   They

will  enrich  our workforce.  They will add high  value  to  our

economy  in  the end.  The whole economy will benefit.   And  we

must  not  be  shortsighted,  as  some  people  think  that  the

Government  is  neglecting its own people.  The  truth  is  that

Government  is concerned about Singapore citizens  and  we  will

always be concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in allowing these people to settle is going

to  help  the  workforce.  However, Sir, I have one caveat,  and

this  is  an  important caveat.  We must try to  persuade  these

skilled  people  to  train our workforce, to  train  our  senior

echelon in the area of speciality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make an extra effort and sell to these people our

sound  fundamentals and sound educational system.  We have  very

good  local  as well as international schools.  We  are  a  safe

haven where they can come and work and settle here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members are disappointed that the tax rebate has

not  been increased.  I am one of the minority who says that the

Minister  has  been  very prudent.  The 5%  is  a  fair  figure,

bearing in mind that the people who are going to pay these taxes

are  those  who are in a higher bracket.  However, I would  have

been  happier if some of the savings from the 5% could have been

allocated  to  skills training.  I am hopeful that the  Minister

would look into this area when reviewing this, and when the need

arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we look at the totality of the

picture  and  not some areas, we are in a better  position  than

many  countries  of the world.  There seems to be  a  fear  that

because  of the problems facing our neighbours, we may be  in  a

long  period  of economic recession.  I agree with the  Minister

that there will be no recession



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



as  our  fundamentals are very strong.  Our growth may be  slow,

but there will be some growth.  It is better to have a period of

cooling-off.   An overheated economy can burn our  pockets.   We

have  overcome worse economic conditions.  We can do so provided

we are united in our resolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, some Members have said that the

Minister  has  failed  to  stimulate  the  economy.   Artificial

stimulation,   whether  in  the  economy   or   in   any   human

organisation,  can  never  be  satisfactory.   Let  the  natural

process  take  its place, and only when we have  a  need  do  we

introduce stimulative measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from

the Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Nominated Member says in his

speech  that  he  is glad to note that no Member of  Parliament,

including   Opposition   MPs,  raised   questions   on   defence

expenditure.   I  would  like  to ask  him:  what  is  wrong  in

questioning defence expenditure and whether the Budget debate is

not  for  the purpose of questioning and scrutinising Government

expenditure, be it defence or any other Ministry?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I was

trying to state is that we all support the defence policy.  I am

not questioning the right of Members to debate this issue.  I am

saying  that so far the Members, who have spoken, are in support

of   the  Government's  defence  policy.   We  know  where   our

priorities   lie.   I  am  not  checking  for   a   moment   the

constitutional  right  of  the Members  to  question  either  in

Committee  stage  or  now.  I hope this will  satisfy  the  hon.

Member from the Opposition.  I am saying our priority on defence

and education is right.  We are not saying: why are you spending

more  on  education  and  defence?  I hope  he  understands  the

position.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the economic turmoil in the region has brought to  us  the

realisation that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  may  not  be  the master of  its  own  destiny.   The

economies  of  the  region are interlinked  and  interdependent.

Prosperity or misery felt by one may equally be felt by  others,

although  the  dosage of bitter medicine may differ.   For  many

young  Singaporeans  who  have known only  prosperity  in  their

working  lives,  the crisis is surprising and frightening.   The

usual response is: We are doing well.  Why are we affected?  The

Minister for Finance is to be complimented for giving a detailed

account  of  the crisis, although we may need an update  as  the

situation changes even as we speak, such as the delay by the IMF

in   paying   the  next  tranche  to  Indonesia,  and  Indonesia

responding    by   saying   that   the   IMF's    demands    are

unconstitutional.   The  Minister  has  presented   a   careful,

restrained   Budget,  recognising  the  need  to   help   ailing

businesses to promote certain desirable businesses and the  need

to  continue  to  strengthen  the infrastructure  of  Singapore.

There is no doubt that in terms of macro-economic planning,  the

measures  introduced in the Budget would go some way to  meeting

the challenges posed by the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young working population, however, the crisis

translates  itself  not in terms of the IMF,  Central  Bank,  or

macro-economic policies.  To these young workers, the  questions

are:   Does the wife have to go back to work?  Where can we  put

the  children, if she does that?  And what else  can  we  do  to

service  the  debts that we have accumulated.  Every  last  cent

counts.   This is typified by one young constituent who said  to

me: Why only 5% rebate when we need every cent we can earn?   He

knows  about the crisis.  He knows that one needs to be  prudent

but  he nonetheless is concerned that he cannot make ends  meet.

It is in this context that I have to ask whether the measures of

relief  to taxpayers, the 5% rebate, and the rebate on  HDB  S&C

charges,  are  sufficient to cater to the needs  of  many  young

families who are facing a year of uncertain wage policies.   The

spectre  of retrenchment, of bankruptcy also may loom large  for

some.   Paradoxically,  at a time when  there  are  fewer  jobs,

housewives who did not contemplate an early return to work now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



may  have  to in order to buttress the family income.  But  they

are  constrained by factors such as the lack of child  care  and

pre-school  facilities.   This  is  an  issue  that  should   be

addressed in the current Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key pillars of Government policy is to invest in

the  young.  There is no doubt that much has been done  in  this

regard,  especially in relation to the building of  schools  and

the  roll  out  of  the IT Master Plan for schools.   But  I  am

talking  about  the care for the very young - the pre-schoolers.

At the moment, the provision of child care centres is within the

aegis  of the Ministry of Community Development while pre-school

facilities  are  undertaken by the PAP Community Foundation  and

other  private agencies.  There is an acute shortage of  trained

minders  and teachers in relation to the provision of facilities

for  the  pre-schoolers.  We do not have the quantity,  and  the

quality  can  always be improved.  It seems  to  me  that  there

should be provision in the Budget for several measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to provide for institutions to train more child

minders  and teachers for the pre-schoolers.  Second, to provide

concessions  or  subsidies  to  those  who  are  providing  such

services  so  that they can employ better teachers and  minders.

And  third, to provide incentives or subsidies for the  training

and  retraining  of teachers and minders for the  pre-schoolers.

There  is no provision for such measures in the current  Budget.

The  provision for child care in the MCD budget is a small  one,

relatively speaking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care services and pre-schooling are taken very

seriously in advanced countries.  For example, in France,  98.8%

of  three-year olds and 100% of four-year olds are enrolled  for

pre-primary schooling.  In West Germany, the figures  are  30.8%

and  68.5%  respectively.  In the US, the figures are 28.5%  for

the  three-year olds and 53% for the four-year olds.  The source

is from the OECD: `Education At A Glance', published in 1995.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the industrialised economies

move  from  brawn  to  brains, it is never too  early  to  start

cultivating the minds of our young.  The Minister has  mentioned

the  excellent  achievements of our  students  in  international

surveys.   That is a cause for happiness and congratulations  to

our educators.  I believe, however, that studies have also shown

the  importance  of  child care and pre-schooling  in  the  pre-primary  years.  A study in the United States that  took  nearly

three  decades to complete revealed that the group under  review

who  participated in pre-primary schooling had excellent results

in terms of social discipline, in avoiding undesirable behaviour

and  in  doing  well  in college.  This motivated  in  fact  the

Federal  Government to spend about $3 billion  a  year  on  such

programmes.   Admittedly, of course, the situation is  different

in  Singapore  but  it certainly deserves more  attention.   We,

unfortunately, do not have figures for Singapore which in itself

is  a cause for concern.  As Singapore moves towards its goal of

becoming a developed country, such facilities grow in importance

and should be provided on a larger scale.  It is hoped that such

measures may be considered in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in these times of economic turmoil, all of us

would do well to remember that when times are hard, the need  to

show  character and regard for others is paramount.   No  doubt,

the  need to earn a comfortable wage is always uppermost but one

must be careful not to sacrifice principle for pay.  One of  the

most unfortunate incidents that has been mentioned in this House

that has come to light is the conduct of scholars in relation to

their bonds, that is, the so-called bond-breakers.  Scholars are

role  models  for their younger counterparts who  are  still  in

school.  They shoulder not just legal obligations but moral ones

as well.  Now these scholars have redeemed their bonds, have not

committed  any  offence  or  civil wrong.   However,  the  moral

responsibility rests on them to fulfil what they promise to  do.

Moral  responsibility  and a good sense  of  long-term  interest

should guide these scholars who are role models for our young.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has provided us with a Budget

that  seeks to fuel investment confidence at a time of  economic

uncertainty.  It is to be especially welcomed in this regard and

I  hope  that the Minister will consider more measures  for  the

young families that may face hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I strongly support the Minister in his

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  speak in support of the motion standing in the name  of  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the region in the last 10 months went

through  a crisis that proved to be most challenging and perhaps

the  most  unnerving since the Second World War.   Never  before

have  we  seen  such relentless pressures on our  economy.   The

regional currencies lost much value because of the sell down  by

those  who  lost  confidence.  Companies simply went  under  and

unemployment  ballooned.  The mood soon  became  despondent  for

many.   This  proved to be the right recipe for  social  unrest.

The  disaffected and hungry took to the streets in violent anger

while  governments most affected tried desperately to  stem  the

tide  of  events.   The problems soon shifted from  an  economic

dimension  to a political one in some cases, which  resulted  in

the erosion of confidence in government leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, stable as it may be, by no means escaped

from  the forces that affected the region.  As the Minister  has

pointed  out,  the  region's financial crisis  had  a  contagion

effect  and  put a damper on the economic outlook for Singapore.

The  growth  prospect for the economy seems  less  promising  as

businessmen  began to brace themselves for a tough  year  ahead.

Indeed  the  growth  estimate  of our  GDP  for  financial  year

1998/1999  at approximately 2.5% to 4.5% from our GDP growth  of

about  7.8% in financial year 1997 projects a cautious  mood  on

our  part  in  assessing the future.  In real terms,  all  major

business sectors, with the exception perhaps of some sectors  in

manufacturing and construction, would see some weakening of  the

business conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rightly, therefore, in view of the poor economic

outlook  for the region and Singapore, in particular, that  this

year's  Budget  should  be  a prudent one.   Public  expenditure

should  be  trimmed  when necessary and Singaporeans  should  be

encouraged  where  possible  to be  constantly  mindful  of  the

difficult times that loom ahead.  While most people would accept

the  underlying  basis of our Budget this year, there  are  also

many  who  feel  that  this Budget does not  go  far  enough  to

adequately  prepare  them for the conditions  ahead.   In  fact,

looking  at  the present Budget, it was felt that more  can  and

should  be  done to help the citizens in coping with the  rising

cost  of living brought upon to some extent by the weakening  of

our  currency.   There  are many who are disappointed  that  the

rebate given is pegged at 5%, and not 10%.  It is arguable  that

the  rebate of 10% should be given to taxpayers to cope with the

difficult  conditions.  Even if the majority of Singaporeans  do

not pay taxes, maintaining a tax rebate at 10% would have sent a

strong signal support to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the majority of Singaporeans who do not pay taxes,

which  speaks a lot about their annual income, I would urge  the

Government  to  consider a greater rebate  on  the  service  and

conservancy  charges  and utilities.  A greater  rebate  on  the

service and conservancy charges and utilities will go a long way

in helping these citizens cope with the pressures of rising cost

of  living in Singapore.  For the businessmen who have  invested

in  the region, they are, I am told, disappointed that there  is

no  additional  assistance from the Government  in  the  present

Budget.   The  current financial crisis has  had  a  significant

impact on the operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, going regional is to a large extent

encouraged and initiated by the Government.  To the extent  that

our  businessmen  have responded to the call to  invest  in  the

region, the Government should actively assist these companies to

cope with the present difficulties.  Additional tax reliefs  for

these  companies  in respect of their regional operations  would

provide the much needed moral support required at this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



stage.   In the current financial crisis, the systemic  weakness

of the business and financial institutions has often been blamed

as  one  of  the  causes.   It  is often  said  that  the  close

relationship  enjoyed between the private  business  sector  and

those  closely  linked  with the establishment  is  one  of  the

reasons  why  some economies in the region went into difficulty.

Such  companies were extremely influential and as a  consequence

were  able  to  leverage on the connection which they  enjoy  to

procure financial institutions to lend monies on very soft terms

and often not adequately securitised.  There was often no proper

assessment  of  creditworthiness of  the  project  being  funded

through the loans.  The banks found themselves in a position  of

not  being  able  to  recall  the loans  when  economic  weather

changed.  There was a lack of transparency in the system and  it

resulted    in   much   institutional   weakness   and    hidden

inefficiencies in the affected economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through it all, the regional crisis has also paid much

credence  to  a  cardinal principle that  government  should  be

transparent   as   far   as   possible.    Transparency   begets

accountability which in turn controls the conduct of  those  who

are  held  to  account.   In  every government,  the  degree  of

transparency  is  a  matter of calibration.   It  is  a  balance

between  the  need to maintain confidentiality because  national

interest demands it and the need to keep the people informed  so

that  they  can  better exercise their right to vote.   How  the

calibration is to be made is dependent on the Government of  the

day  who  enjoys  the  mandate of  the  people.   In  the  final

analysis, there is an increasing expectation these days  towards

greater transparency and accountability, where possible,  rather

than to have less of it.  How is this applicable to us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, we have come to accept Government-linked

companies  (GLCs) as playing a strategic role in developing  our

economy.  As the Minister has said at the last sitting, the GLCs

have  moved into areas which are of strategic interest and where

entrepreneurs in Singapore have limited resources to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



venture  into  or have no knowledge of.  In recent  years,  GLCs

have grown, both in number and size.  Today, there are few areas

of  business  the  GLCs  have  not gone  into.   Their  business

interests  range from telecommunication, banking and finance  to

aerospace  and  property development.  The market capitalisation

of these companies runs into hundreds of millions of dollars and

one  would  not  be wrong to say that the performance  of  these

companies is a barometer of the state of the Singapore economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, GLCs, the way in which they are owned, managed and

run,  are  often  distinguished from ordinary  companies  for  a

number  of  reasons.  Firstly, these are companies  wherein  the

Government  has sizable equity interest in, either  directly  or

indirectly, through such holding companies as Temasek  or  GSIC.

Secondly,  a  substantial  number  of  officers  who  run  these

companies  came  from the civil service.  And  thirdly,  a  good

number  of  these companies have substantial business  relations

with the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any measure, the GLCs have contributed in no small

way  to  Singapore's profile as an industrial economy  and  they

have  given  us a place in the world economy that we  would  not

have  otherwise  got if we had just allowed the economy  develop

its  own course without the GLCs.  However, as the GLCs grow  in

size and number and the value of the equity holding expands over

the  years, we must ensure that there is an adequate  system  in

place to provide for the accountability for the conduct of these

companies.  At the moment, the scope of public accountability of

these  companies, both in relation to corporate  disclosure  and

governance,   is   limited.   Presently,   officers   of   these

corporations  are  accountable under law to shareholders.   They

owe a duty principally to the company.  However, in the case  of

ordinary  shareholders  who  own  shares  in  listed  companies,

participation  at shareholders' meeting is often given  a  miss.

Even if they are inclined to do so, the ordinary shareholders do

not  have  the necessary technical expertise to analyse  reports

and hold directors to account by asking relevant questions.   In

other words, there is usually very little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



known   beyond  the  audited  accounts  about  these  companies.

Control  of  these  companies is  often  in  the  hands  of  the

managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, GLCs by virtue of the status, have very strong

bargaining power in business dealings.  In a government that  is

as  disciplined  as ours, we can be assured that  the  GLCs  are

tightly  run and managed and that they are not likely  to  abuse

their  privileged  position.  However, we cannot  always  assume

that  our system of Government and political culture will remain

unchanged.  In a weak government, control over the GLCs may  not

be  firm.   There  will  always be a  danger  of   mismanagement

without  a  proper system of control.  The consequences  may  be

similar  to  that  which confront the countries  in  the  region

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, GLCs essentially provide a

corporate   vehicle   for  Government  to  go   into   business.

Accordingly, because the Government is in business, there is  an

expectation that the forum of accountability of these  companies

should be wider than just a shareholders' meeting.  I share  the

sentiment expressed by my colleague earlier wherein he said  the

GLCs  perform essential functions within the economy.  In  these

days,  we  can  expect corporatised entities to provide  utility

services,  services  to  people  who  are  users,  who  are  not

necessarily  shareholders in a company.  And in the  context  of

these people who have to depend on these companies for services,

I  think  there  is  something to be said  about  holding  these

companies to some extent accountable to the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Accounts Committee feels, and I agree, that

it  is important to ensure that public money invested in GLCs is

well  spent and decisions are made under the best circumstances.

The  call  is for greater accountability and through appropriate

disclosure,  information may be given as to the  performance  of

these  companies.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  the

Government,  in addition to the measures which we  have  at  the

moment,  is  considering other measures to provide  for  greater

transparency and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



disclosure in the GLCs.  Such a move, Sir, would strengthen  the

confidence of the public in the management of our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the financial policy of the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, when the Finance Minister was formulating the  new

Budget  for  this year, many countries in Asia were  facing  the

financial  crisis and Singapore, to a certain extent,  has  been

affected by this.  Therefore, in formulating the new Budget  the

Government is bound to be prudent in its attitude.  When the new

Budget  was disclosed, we knew that the Minister was adopting  a

moderate and prudent strategy to cope with the financial crisis,

and   to   make   adequate  preparation  in  case  the   turmoil

deteriorates so as to cope with the difficult years ahead.   The

Minister also ensures that we have a balanced budget in order to

maintain   our   long-term  economic  competitiveness   and   to

accumulate massive surplus so that we will move forward when the

financial  turmoil subsides.  I believe this is  a  correct  and

farsighted Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when our neighbouring countries are

urging their people to donate money and other valuables to  help

their countries weather the economic crisis,  our Government has

been  able  to  provide  tax rebates  and  rebates  on  S&C  and

utilities  charges to the people so as to lighten the burden  of

the  people.   During this critical period, the  Government  has

been able to provide assistance to the people.  Although this is

not  a big red packet, it nevertheless is something we are happy

about.   There are some taxpayers who say that the  tax  rebates

have  been reduced from 10% to the present 5% and they are quite

disappointed.   Tax rebate is normally given  only  during  good

times.   It  is  a measure to return some of the wealth  to  the

people.   But because of this year's economic slowdown  and  the

tightening of our monetary policy, the budget has been  reduced.

This  is  to  be  expected.  But taxpayers feel that  their  tax

return  was  based on 1997 income and yet they have to  pay  tax

from  this  year's  income.   This year,  they  are  faced  with

economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



recession and there will be a reduction in their income.   Hence

this  is  an  increased burden on them.  So they hope  that  the

Government, during this economic slowdown, would give them  more

tax  rebates in order to lighten their burden, especially  those

businessmen who fail in their business or those workers who have

been  retrenched.   I  hope the Minister would  explain  to  the

people  why  such tax rebate has been reduced  by  5%.   If  the

taxpayers  understand the rationale for such a  reduction,  they

will support the Government's policy and be more united in order

to work for a better future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a commercial and

financial centre.  Our Government's policy has been to encourage

our  local  enterprises to be more enterprising.   At  the  same

time,  we  attract  foreign investors to come here  and  invest.

These  are  the  twin engines for our growth.   This  year,  our

budget  has  provided  for certain beneficial  measures  to  the

financial   and  property  sectors,  so  that  they   can   grow

satisfactorily  even  in  the  midst  of  a  financial   crisis.

However,  there  is  little assistance for  the  industrial  and

commercial  enterprises.   Because  of  the  regional  financial

turmoil  and  the slowdown in the economy, many  companies  have

received  less orders from the region.  However, their  cost  of

business  has  not come down.  Therefore, these   companies  are

faced with dwindling orders and they have cash flow problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce's survey,

about  54%  of the companies said that their business  has  been

affected and about 45% of the companies said that they are faced

with  cash flow problems.  In order to help these businesses  to

tide over this period, I would recommend certain measures to the

Government.   First, the JTC and HDB should consider  curtailing

their rental on land and factories to reduce their cost of doing

business.  At present, JTC and HDB rental is based on the rental

they  formulated three years ago when times were good,  the  so-called  market rental.  But in the present situation, the market

rental has gone down.  For example, the tender



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



prices  for the two pieces of land offered for sale by URA  have

gone   down  by  many  times  as  compared  to  those  in  1996.

Therefore,  during  this critical period, the Government  should

adjust  the rental for land and factory spaces, so that  a  more

reasonable rental could be formulated.  I suggest that  JTC  and

HDB  should consider reducing rental by 10% for two  years.   In

this  way, they could directly help to bring down business  cost

in order to enhance their competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they should liberalise the subletting of factory

space.   During an economic recession, many tenants need  lesser

factory  space.    Therefore,  the authorities  should  consider

letting  these tenants to have more flexibility to sublet  their

factory  spaces in order that the usage of their  factory  space

could  be  maximised.   This will also  reduce  their  operating

expenses, and more optimum use can be made use of such space and

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I suggest that JTC and HDB should consider

increasing the ratio for subletting from 50% to 75%.   This will

effectively help the tenants to tide over this period  and  also

help those who want to launch new businesses to find the factory

space.  This will provide good opportunities for those  who  are

interested in entering  the manufacturing industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Finance would consider my

suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much

has  been  said  about the regional currency  turmoil  that  has

resulted in the slowdown of economic growth in virtually all the

countries  in South East Asia.  The Finance Minister is  prudent

to  refrain from forecasting growth for Singapore or,  for  that

matter, for other countries in the region.  We are, I think,  in

general  agreement, save for a few other Members in this  House,

that, at best, things are likely to remain bad and they may  get

worse.  There is little doubt in my mind that we are heading for

very  difficult  times for at least the  next  1-2  years.   The

question is not so much whether there is going to be a recession

now, but how deep it will be and what our responses should be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time we had a recession was in 1985. At that

time,  the  regional economies were growing well.  We  ourselves

were  plagued by high costs caused partly by the necessary  move

to  higher technology industries and a tight labour force.  Once

we  have  improved our competitiveness and set the  fundamentals

right,  we  were  able  to get out of the  recession  relatively

unscathed.  There were no drastic retrenchments and no  loss  in

real income.  For the next decade, we were able to capitalise on

the  boom times in the region, especially with the emergence  of

China as an economic power and the revival of Vietnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, the issues are different. The currency

turmoil  and  other difficulties have caused a loss of  investor

confidence  that has affected investment flows  into  the  whole

region.  Countries have to battle against the difficult task  of

reviving  their  economies to create jobs.  They  also  have  to

tackle  the  prospect  of  increasing  inflation  and  for  some

countries,  even shortages of essential foodstuff and materials.

In  other  words, we cannot depend on the region as  we  did  in

1985.   Even  if we manage to retain and sharpen our fundamental

strengths, we cannot escape the adverse effects of recession  in

the region.  Take the simple example of tourism.  A great number

of tourists originate from the other ASEAN countries.  We should

be  lucky if half the number who visited Singapore show up  this

year.   With  recession in these countries and their depreciated

currencies, we cannot really blame them for not coming.  Tourist

arrivals are likely to fall sharply this year, maybe as much  as

double  digit.  And if the haze comes a bit earlier  this  year,

the  drop  may be more precipitous.  This will have  a  rippling

effect  on  the retail sector that depends on tourism, including

hotels,  restaurants, shopping centres and  transport  services.

Taxi drivers are going to find fewer fares.  This fall in demand

is  not  likely to be compensated by Singaporeans who will  also

tighten  their belts.  Even if we cut prices for these services,

there  may  not  be sufficient customers.  The effects  of  this

slowdown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



will  permeate to a wide cross-section of our economy.  Everyone

will in one way or another be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response then? It is fair to say that

we  in Singapore have been having it good for many years.   High

economic  growth has translated into rapid rise in  real  income

and  better  well-being for everyone.  The Government  has  been

able  to  record surpluses every year in the past  decade.   The

times  are so good that many Members in this House have remarked

that  we  are  making too much money.  Our people's expectations

have also soared at the same time. HDB flats have now given  way

to  Executive Condominiums and private condominiums in districts

9,  10 and 11.  IUPs are not quite enough.  Our people want more

MUPs.   On  the  whole, our people's tolerance  level  has  also

lowered.   At  the  slightest  inconvenience,  there   will   be

complaints  to  the  MPs  and to the press.   Increasingly,  our

people  are  beginning to think of themselves  rather  than  the

community as a whole.  Many of our young and successful citizens

are  coming  to the view that it is their right to be  rich  and

powerful,  without  realising that  their  ascent  to  fame  and

fortune  has been helped by the nation's progress with  everyone

pitching in their effort.  More important, just as dinners  will

not  last  forever,  good times too would  not  last.   We  must

prepare  ourselves  for the ups and downs that  will  inevitably

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should first look at what we ourselves can do

rather  than just asking the Government for more hand-outs.   It

would  be reasonable for us to do so if we have been responsible

for   the  slowdown  as  in  1985.   The  present  problems  are

externally  generated  and  in many instances  are  out  of  our

control.   It  comes with the ups and downs of business  cycles,

although much of the present problems are man made.  There is  a

Chinese  saying  that "when the horse dies, get off  and  walk."

There  is nothing we can do if we  stay on the horse, especially

if it is a dead one.  If we look back the last 30 years, this is

precisely  what the Government and our people did  when  we  got

into  trouble.  We did not ask for charity.  Instead, we adapted

ourselves to the situation at hand and made adjustments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



There  is  no  running  away  from  the  painful  effects  of  a

recession.   This  time  round, the recession  is  going  to  be

painful.   Those  of  us who lived through some  recessions  can

vouch  for  the  fact that in certain cases,  the  pain  can  be

considerable.   However,  if we are strong  and  have  a  higher

threshold  of  pain,  we  will be able  to  survive  and  become

stronger.  The question now before us is: are we prepared?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sustained economic growth for the past two decades,

allowing  for  the minor setback in 1985, may  have  lulled  our

citizens,  especially the younger ones among  us  who  have  not

lived   through   recessions,  into  believing   that   economic

prosperity will go on forever.  The good times that we have been

having   have   lowered  the  threshold  of  pain  considerably.

Continued success has also bred individualism, selfishness  and,

worse,  greed.   We  can find examples of these  traits  in  the

working  places,  restaurants, shopping centres  and  even  golf

courses.   The  arrogance with which some young  and  successful

people flaunt their wealth and power is evident in the way  they

spend  and the way they treat those who serve them.  I was  told

of an incident in which a member of an exclusive golf club, when

he  failed to get satisfactory service from the waiter, reminded

the latter in no uncertain terms that he had paid a princely sum

to  join  the  golf club and expected that he should  be  served

properly.   In  another incident, a member of a golf  club  took

legal action to intimidate the club on a very minor disagreement

because he thought that it was a "matter of principle."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower threshold of pain will see our people yelling for

blue  murder  when  conditions deteriorate just  a  little  bit.

Worse,  it may lead to panic and recourse to expedient  measures

that  will  not solve the longer term problems. The attitude  of

"every man for himself" will erode community's ability to  fight

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to brace ourselves for the difficult times ahead.

We  must  increase our threshold of pain to ensure that  we  can

pull through and become fitter and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



trimmer  at  the  end  of  these bad  times.   Given  our  sound

fundamentals,  we  should be able to achieve  this  target.   By

working  together, we can face the problems  head  on  and  seek

strength through unity of purpose.  In doing so, there  will  be

those  amongst us who are weaker and will need help.  We  should

extend  all  possible  assistance to help them  tide  over  this

difficult  period.   This help should not  only  come  from  the

Government  but also come from those of us who are in  a  better

position  to  help.    I  would  especially  urge  our   younger

Singaporeans,  those successful ones, to help our  country  sail

through  these difficulties.  For those who may be afflicted  by

the symptoms I have mentioned, I hope there will be a change  of

mindset  so  that  they  can  work together  with  their  fellow

countrymen.  For those who are not, I can only appeal to them to

continue  their good work and reinforce their fine efforts.   In

the coming months, we will need to work even closer together and

survive  the  storms that will surely and inevitably  sweep  our

shores.  I appeal once again to all our fellow citizens, let  us

stay tight together and overcome.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Finance  Minister  has allowed companies  to  claim  double  tax

deduction  for  approved  relocation  and  recruitment  expenses

incurred  in  the hiring of talents from abroad so  as  to  help

offset the extra costs which these companies will have to  incur

in  employing  such  talent to supplement our  local  workforce.

Such  a policy move is indeed encouraging.  As mentioned by  the

Prime  Minister at last year's National Day Rally, human talent,

whether  in  the form of new immigrants or foreign nationals  on

work-stints  of a few years, will be the key factor in  ensuring

that Singapore stays economically competitive and successful  in

this  information  age.  While I do believe that  the  budgetary

initiative  will undoubtedly strengthen the positive factors  in

attracting foreign talent, I would like to put forward, for  the

Minister's consideration, a few additional points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of the double tax deduction scheme primarily

accrue to companies which recruit overseas talents, I would like

to suggest that assistance should also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



rendered  to the talents themselves.  As such, I would  propose,

firstly, that a unit, known as Foreign Talent Unit, be set up in

the  newly  named  Ministry of Manpower to centralise,  develop,

implement  and  oversee Government policies  pertaining  to  the

recruitment  of  overseas  talent.   This  unit  should   gather

information  and  feedback  from  foreign  nationals   currently

working  in  Singapore so that we can tap upon their experience,

and  understand  from  them  the particularistic  problems  that

nationals from particular countries face when working and living

in  Singapore.   This  unit will serve  as  a  nerve  centre  to

coordinate what I believe must be a multi-pronged approach,  and

which  will  necessarily involve both Governmental institutions,

such  as  HDB  and  our  schools,  and  private  companies   and

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major difficulties faced by foreign nationals working

in  Singapore  are  most  importantly  housing,  and  thereafter

schooling  for their children.  Housing is expensive  here,  and

rentals  high.  The Government has already worked out  a  scheme

for  JTC to buy and own a stock of HDB flats which are to be let

out  entirely to foreigners.  This will certainly alleviate  the

housing problem to some extent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to schooling, the problem has not been totally

solved.    High-ranking  expatriate  staff  have  the  schooling

expenses  of  their  children paid  on  their  behalf  by  their

employers.   However,  middle management expatriate  staff  will

have to bear such expenses themselves, and many are not able  to

afford   the   fees  charged  by  international  schools.    The

Government should, through assistance offered by the Ministry of

Education,  encourage them to send their  children  to  a  local

school  instead, and special arrangements can then be  made  for

their  children to continue learning their own languages, be  it

German,  French  or Tamil. Moreover, a small number  of  foreign

children  studying  in  our schools will  also  promote  greater

understanding  of  foreign cultures and  facilitate  interaction

between our students and those from other countries.  This  will

be beneficial in broadening the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



contacts  and  outlook  of  both parties,  and  in  the  process

enriching the educational experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Talent Unit should also selectively screen and

entice qualified expatriates and skilled labour from overseas to

become  immigrants.  This will add to the pool  of  skilled  and

professional  labour here, a favourable development  which  will

enhance the quality of our workforce and strengthen our economic

fundamentals  on  a  permanent basis.  However,  the  successful

integration of new immigrants into our society will  be  a  pre-requisite  before  their inherent potential  can  be  unleashed.

Therefore,  the Government should tap on the resources  of  both

Governmental  institutions  and private  enterprises  to  render

adequate assistance to immigrants to enable them to adapt better

to   local  working  conditions  and,  more  generally,  to  the

Singapore way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are trying to attract foreign nationals to work in

Singapore,  we  should  not lose sight of Singaporeans  who  are

staying  overseas.  For one reason or another, some Singaporeans

may  choose to work overseas and they form a part of our  useful

overseas  network.  However, some of them may wish to return  in

the future, and we should attempt to make it easier for them  to

reintegrate  into  our  community.  In this  instance,  suitable

initiatives that can be considered include special assistance to

enable  them  to purchase HDB flats and efforts  to  ease  their

children back into the Singapore education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware that a high quality workforce is the only

tangible  resource Singapore possesses.  Hence, we  have  to  do

manpower  planning  carefully to satisfy our  future  needs.   I

therefore  support  the  Minister's proposal  to  introduce  the

double tax deduction scheme in connection with the recruiting of

overseas  talent and hope that the Government will  consider  as

well the suggestions that have been put forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion moved by the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  would first like to compliment the Finance Minister  on

the prudence with which the Budget was assembled. There is merit

in  conservatism in times of uncertainty and there is  merit  in

ensuring the Budget reflects consistency at the policy level.  I

fully   support  the  measures  introduced  to  facilitate   the

development  of  the financial services sector as  well  as  the

range  of  rebates to help lower income families.  However,  the

market  reacted unenthusiastically in the following  days  after

the  Budget announcement.  The corporate world appears to  think

that  the  Budget is insufficient for these trying times.   Many

individuals  are  also disappointed in that the  current  Budget

offers  only  5%  personal  income tax  rebate  across-the-board

compared  to  last year's 10% in the face of the most  turbulent

years since confrontation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to reason out why the public reacted this

way.  I would think that since the Budget has to be presented in

late  February,  it is understandable that the Finance  Ministry

would  have  used information that was good up  to  the  end  of

December.   But  if  it is so, it happens that  the  significant

economic events that affected our economy took place in  January

and  February this year.  So the important question is:  is  the

Budget catering to our current needs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I would like to raise today correlates to

the questions I posed in the last two parliamentary sittings  on

the  loan  exposures  of  local  institutions  to  the  regional

economies.   In his reply to my query in January, DPM  Lee  said

that the local banks' exposure to the region was small.  Then in

February, we were updated with the report that the local  banks'

exposure  to the region has increased and that had not  affected

our  banking system much.   Yet, in the last few days, barely  a

month  from  the  second report, Tat Lee  Bank  announced  heavy

losses  to the point that an unprecedented move by the  MAS  was

needed  to allow Tat Lee Bank to re-value its assets in order to

shore  up its balance sheets.  Most of the other big four  banks

have  also reported huge provision for losses.  To top that,  we

have heard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



financial  reports  of  banks  across  the  causeway  sustaining

massive losses.  All these reports show that local banks with an

exposure of more than $20 billion to Malaysian businesses may go

on to suffer more and more losses in the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sums up my concern for the timeliness of information

used  in  these fast changing economic times.  It is  only  with

timely and accurate information that we can react fast.  Perhaps

the  public's  lack-lustre response to the  Budget  announcement

sends  the  message  that the Government is  not  reacting  fast

enough  and  not  providing the leadership that the  people  are

yearning for in this crisis.  I think the Government can do more

this  time  by  stimulating the economy with a more expansionary

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reported by many Members of this House that a

survey  conducted by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce shows  that

more  than  50% of its members have been affected badly  by  the

crisis.  Many complained about credit squeeze and the high  cost

of  running business.  Yet other than the LEFS Scheme, no  other

significant  measures have been introduced in  this  regard.   I

would  like to call on the Government to work closely  with  the

various  trade associations to feel the pulse and the health  of

the  local enterprises and, at this point, I would like to  echo

Mr  Leong's call for the pre-Budget consultations to take  place

in the next Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the House that for years the Ministry of

Finance  in  Japan has reacted slowly to their growing  economic

problems.    Now  it  seems  that  it  has  become  increasingly

difficult for Japan to propel itself to full recovery.   I  only

hope that we would not go the same way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to allow the current economic

difficulties to deflect our long term infrastructure development

plans  and,  hopefully, it would not affect the construction  of

our  underground road system and the facilities needed  to  push

our vital economic sectors.

less than the number of 23,252 in 1996 (see Table 1).  The lower

slightly  in  recent  years, the total  number  of  company  and

However, as the turmoil exerts its full impact this year, we can

expect the number to rise.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) how

many  patient visits were made at outpatient specialist  clinics

of  government hospitals in 1996 and 1997; and (b) what  is  the

patient load of doctors at these clinics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 the total number of patient attendances in the

specialist   outpatient  clinics  (SOCs)  of  government   acute

hospitals,  including restructured hospitals, was 2,092,751,  of

which  459,438  were new cases.  In 1997, the  numbers  rose  to

2,197,280 and 489,891 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, the number of patients seen by doctors on duty

at  SOC  clinics of the larger restructured hospitals is between

130 and 200 cases per day per clinic.

<div align="center"><b>RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether his

Ministry will consider making sub-contractors solely responsible

for  the foreign workers whom they employ instead of the current

practice  of  making  main contractors jointly  responsible  for

these  foreign workers who are beyond the control  of  the  main

contractors.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Permits are issued to subcontractors on the support of

main  contractors for their projects.  The main contractors  are

thus partially responsible for the foreign workers brought in by

their subcontractors to work on their projects.  However, in the

past,  some main contractors had not exercised vigilance in  the

support  of  their  subcontractors'  work  permit  applications.

Their  careless endorsement of the subcontractors'  work  permit

applications allowed some unscrupulous subcontractors to  either

inflate their foreign worker needs, or submit applications using

false  contracts.  As a result, they operate as labour suppliers

and  bring  in foreign workers, receive commission,  default  on

levy  payments and even abandon the workers, resulting in a host

of social problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stem this abuse, the Ministry had decided in December

1997  to refer subcontractors' work permit applications to  main

contractors  for verification and hold main contractors  jointly

responsible  for  any workers abandoned by their subcontractors.

This   encouraged   main   contractors   to   scrutinise   their

subcontractors'  work permit applications.  It  also  emphasised

the  important  role of main contractors to  ensure  the  proper

employment   of   foreign   construction   workers   by    their

subcontractors.  The measure has met with some  success.   Since

its  implementation,  approximately 25% of  the  subcontractors'

applications  had  not been endorsed by main  contractors.   The

main contractors' involvement has helped to reduce the incidence

of abuse to some extent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once foreign workers are brought in by the subcontractors

on  the support of main contractors, the subcontractors and main

contractors  would  be  accountable for  the  accommodation  and

placements  of  foreign  workers  should  they  be  subsequently

displaced.  Main contractors have the resources to house workers

abandoned  by their subcontractors, or transfer their employment

to  other  subcontractors within the same project  or  in  other

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus not true that main contractors have no control over

the  foreign  workers  employed by  the  subcontractors.   These

foreign workers were brought in to work on their projects in the

first  instance.  Therefore, requiring main contractors to share

the  responsibility with their subcontractors  is  necessary  to

avoid abuses and illegal practices.

<div align="center"><b>SWIMMING AND LIFE-SAVING LESSONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how

many  schools conduct swimming and life-saving lessons for their

pupils; (b) how frequent these lessons are conducted and what is

the duration of each lesson; and (c) whether there are any tests

of proficiency for these lessons.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming is not a compulsory component of the Physical

Education  (PE)  syllabus.  However, schools are  encouraged  to

conduct various forms of swimming programmes for their pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently only six schools (one junior college, four

secondary  schools and one primary school) have swimming  pools.

These  schools conduct swimming lessons during the  PE  lessons.

Schools   situated  near  public  swimming  pools  also  conduct

swimming lessons.  Simple rescue techniques, but not lifesaving,

is taught as part of the swimming programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These swimming lessons are usually conducted once a week

for  10 weeks.  Each lesson is of about 45 minutes' duration and

pupils may take a proficiency test at the end of the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the primary level, most schools conduct the Learn-to-Swim programme for their P4 and P6 pupils after the P4 streaming

examination and after the PSLE respectively.  This programme  is

for beginners and consists of 12 swimming lessons.  Each lesson,

which  is conducted during curriculum time, lasts for  about  45

minutes. Pupils generally take a proficiency test at the end  of

the programme.  From 1994 to 1997, a total of 44,800 pupils took

part  in the programme. The number of schools involved each year

ranges from 90 to 124.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from swimming done as an element in the PE

lessons, swimming is also promoted in the school ECA  programme.

Presently,  145  primary school (74%) and 70  secondary  schools

(43%)  have swimming in their ECA.  In 1997 alone,  about 20,000

pupils  received the National Swimming Survival Award  conducted

by  the Singapore Sports Council. While pupils are taught simple

rescue techniques as part of the PE programme, lifesaving is not

included in the syllabus.

<div align="center"><b>TERTIARY COURSES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education whether

his   Ministry   has  any  accreditation  system  or   licensing

requirements to control the quality of full-time, part-time  and

distance   learning  tertiary  courses  (diploma,   degree   and

postgraduate  programmes) conducted by private  institutions  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different overseas tertiary institutions

offering a wide variety of courses of study in Singapore. It  is

not  possible  for  the Ministry of Education  to  evaluate  the

quality   of   the  programmes  and  the  teaching.    This   is

particularly  so for distance-learning programmes. The  Ministry

of  Education therefore does not have an accreditation system to

control the standard and quality of these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tertiary institutions offering the courses and their

local  agents are responsible for all aspects of the  programme.

It  is advisable for students considering taking up such courses

to  first check out their worthiness before enrolling in any  of

them.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOL IN SIN MING AVENUE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether his Ministry will build a primary school in the Sin Ming

Avenue area, in view of the increasing demand for primary school

places from residents in that locality.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has no immediate plans to build a new primary

school  in  the  Sin Ming Avenue area. There are currently  four

primary schools in the Bishan DGP, which covers Sin Ming Avenue.

The  schools  are  Ai  Tong  School, Catholic  High,  Kuo  Chuan

Presbyterian  and  Guangyang Primary. The overall  provision  of

primary  schools  is sufficient to meet the  demand  for  school

places.  In  the 1997 P1 Registration Exercise, the  three  most

popular schools were filled up while Guangyang Primary still had

vacancies at the end of the exercise.
