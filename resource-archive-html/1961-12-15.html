<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D32 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, yesterday I stated that one of the  more

important tasks of the Economic Development Board is to

issue  pioneer  status certificates to  industrialists.

The   Minister  for  Finance  has  issued   many   such

certificates to industrialists investing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pioneer status certificate was issued to the Shell

Company  with a capital of about $10 million.  This  is

quite  a  large  investment. As I said yesterday,  this

company has employed only one new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>



worker. In principle, we do not oppose the Minister for

Finance  and  the Economic Development Board  in  their

effort  to promote industrialisation in Singapore,  but

we  are  doubtful about its success because  the  Shell

Company has only engaged one new worker. In view of the

fact  that  the Assembly has been asked to approve  $20

million  for 1962, we must be very careful to ascertain

whether  the  desired  results  can  be  achieved.  The

Minister  for  Finance has given pioneer status  for  a

period of five years to promote new industries. Let  us

take  the  example of Shell Company which  has  engaged

only  one  new worker after the investment of  the  so-called  $10  million. This shows that the  unemployment

situation  in Singapore has not been improved  and  the

problem has not been solved. The company invested  such

a  large sum of capital and it obtained pioneer  status

for  five  years.  This has been a great  loss  to  the

people  of  Singapore  because  the  company  has   not

contributed   anything   to   the   solution   of   the

unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether other new

industrialists  seeking investment and  pioneer  status

for their industries will be allowed to follow the same

footsteps  of the Shell Company. If such is  the  case,

then it is very regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment of $10 million by the Shell Company

has   not   contributed  anything  to  the  people   of

Singapore.  From this fact alone, we can see  that  the

Government  will  not receive any taxation  from  these

industries for some time and, generally speaking,  this

is  a  great loss to our country. I will use a  Chinese

saying  to  describe  what  advantages  the  people  of

Singapore  will derive from such industries.  It  is  a

double  loss.  Not only do you lose your wife  but  you

also incur defeat through a military manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into this question and

review  its policy so that pioneer industries  and  new

investments will help solve the unemployment problem in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for 2 ½

years, we have been listening to the Government talking

about economic development and industrialisation. What

has the Government done? Almost nothing. What it has

done is to change the name of the Industrial Promotion

Board to the Economic Development Board. What is the

use of a change in name? The people want jobs and not a

change of name. The failure of the Government in its so-called industrialisation plan is partly due to a lack

of personnel with practical experience. If the Ministry

of Finance and the Industrial Promotion Board had been

staffed with people of practical experience instead of

armchair economists and paper-flappers, I think the

position today would have been much better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not depend entirely on foreign

industrial missions. They are sometimes useful, but how

can we expect them to do marvelous things by spending a

few weeks here?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I trust the Member for Aljunied is not

reading from a script.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> He is

reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can form industrial

advisory   boards  composed  of  local   industrialists

instead of depending on foreign industrial missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main emphasis on

industrialisation should be on medium and  small  scale

industries.  The  Government should undertake  research

into the types of products that can be manufactured  in

Singapore  and  readily  supply  such  information   to

interested   parties.  The  Government   should   relax

immigration    controls   and   allow    people    with

manufacturing experience to come in and invest or  work

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to make a ministerial statement at

some future date on his industrial programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, after

the debate on the last Budget, I remember reading in

the newspapers of Government's plan to start a steel

mill with a capital of $50 million. What I want to ask

the Minister is this. Of the $50 million authorised on

nominal capital, how much would be paid up? It would

not be useful if only $500,000 or $5 million of the $50

million is paid up. It strikes me that this so-called

steel mill is not a steel mill. It is just like one of

those factories which pull out steel bars and steel

plates; from local scrap iron. We have such a factory

in Bukit Timah Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the particular person who is

going to form this supposed steel mill has already  got

another concession from the Government by obtaining $ ½

million loan. From what I see of the activities, of the

Industrial Promotion Board and the Economic Development

Board,  it  seems  they  are all  centred  around  this

person.  Is  it because there are no other  persons  in

Singapore who have applied for similar loans,  or  that

their  applications were not substantiated with  enough

facts  to  obtain  the loans, or is  it  because  their

schemes  were  not  practicable?  But  what  I   cannot

understand is that two schemes - I have only  been  able

to  see  two schemes - have been taken over by  the  same

person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are doubts in my mind

which I hope the Minister will be able to clarify.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang  made the point that  since  the  Shell

refinery at Pulau Bukom could give employment  to  only

one  new  employee, that project, into which more  than

$10 million worth of capital has been sunk, did nothing

to  solve the unemployment problem in Singapore.  I  do

not   know  from  this  whether  one  could  infer  the

conclusion  that  this  project should  not  have  been

proceeded with.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>



I  do  not think that is the point that the Member  was

trying  to  make. If indeed it was,  I  say  it  is  an

extremely foolish conclusion to come to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the refining industry is what the economists

call   a  "capital  intensive"  industry,  indeed  most

industries   connected  with  any  form   of   chemical

operations  require a lot of capital as  compared  with

labour.  In  the  nature of things,  that  is  the  way

production  processes  are made.  It  is  not  correct,

however, to say that the oil refinery just gives a  job

to  one  person. That is a completely distorted way  of

representing the position. The refinery gives  jobs  to

more than 70 persons, most of whom were already in  the

employment  of  Shell Company. But the  Shell  Company,

through  modernisation of its organisation,  has  found

that  there may be some 200 workers redundant. And this

is in the nature of things. Every industry is trying to

improve  its  methods of production;  productivity  per

worker  increases.  And., therefore,  unless  there  is

scope for expansion, you will find the labour force  of

your existing industry getting smaller and smaller.  By

establishing this oil refinery, the Shell  Company  has

been  able  to  give jobs to more than 70  workers  who

otherwise  might have been retrenched.  Further,  as  a

result  of  refining operations, they will  branch  out

into  other lines. I believe they are now contemplating

the  manufacture of pitch tar, which will require  them

to  start a new factory to make drums for the packaging

of  this product. So once you have a major industry, it

generates  employment by creating a secondary  industry

linked  up  with it. That is why, when we  discuss  the

total effects of any new industrial project, we have to

take  into  account  all  the  repercussions  that  the

project leads to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied claims that the Economic

Development  Board  is merely the Industrial  Promotion

Board  under  a  new  name. Sir,  I  have  on  previous

occasions dealt at great length with the steps taken to

start  the  Economic.  Development  Board;  the  expert

personnel recruited from abroad,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>



the  extra  new  staff of economic engineers  recruited

from  local  sources,  and the additional  $40  million

worth  of capital which the Economic Development  Board

has  and  which the Industrial Promotion Board did  not

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I recapitulate some of the things said of the

Economic   Development  Board?  We  have  recruited   a

director who is a top-ranking economic planner  in  the

Government  of  Israel.  We  have  a  former  Permanent

Secretary  in my Ministry as Chairman of the Board.  We

have  two  young  civil servants and  one  young  local

engineer  to be in the promotion and technical branches

of  this Board. We are also recruiting some five to six

experts  through the United Nations and they should  be

here by about April next year at the latest. These  are

experts   in   various   fields,   such   as   chemical

engineering, industrial cost accounting, and so on.  At

the same time, the Industrial Research Unit will be set

up by the first quarter of next year. This Unit will be

able  to give technical and production advice to  small

and medium scale local industries. To say that this is

just the Industrial Promotion Board under a new name is

absolute nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that we are facing - let me repeat - is a

most  dangerous  one.  The Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang

brought  up the point which allows me to bring out  the

fact  that  if  in Singapore there is no  expansion  of

industrial  output, that does not mean that the  number

of  workers  will remain at the present level,  because

techniques  of  production are always  improving.  With

improved methods, more machines are used and the labour

force  becomes smaller. And that is going  on  all  the

time. The United Nations mission calculated that within

the  next  ten years some 12,000 workers would  not  be

required  in  existing industries because of  increased

productivity   and   because  of  better   methods   of

production;  just  to maintain the  existing  level  of

output,  quite  apart from giving new  jobs  to  people

looking  for work. We have to find jobs for people  who

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>



be  redundant because improved techniques of production

are introduced in our industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members did say that we have announced our

industrialisation  plans in general  terms.  They  say,

"Well,  what  are  the actual industries  the  Economic

Development  Board  has  in  mind  to  assist  and   to

promote?"  This is the final test. It is no use  saying

chemical  industries or metal industries or  what  have

you.  The United Nations industrial mission has made  a

number     of    specific    recommendations.     These

recommendations are being studied by the staff  of  the

Economic  Development Board. Contacts  are  being  made

with local and foreign industrialists interested in pro

ducing  the goods recommended. There are to date  three

major  fields that have been examined by this  mission.

They  are, briefly, metal and engineering, where it  is

expected that an investment of $5 million could be made

in  Singapore in various industries which  will  create

jobs   for   200   people.  The   specific   industries

recommended   are   as   follows:   under   metal   and

engineering - production    of    abrasives,    bicycles,

building, hardware, galvanishing of iron sheets,  metal

furniture  for  home use, steel bolts and  nuts,  steel

wire rods, steel wire nails, steel wire netting, welded

steel tubing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under electrical equipment and appliances, 32

products have been recommended for immediate production

in  Singapore.  They  involve an  investment  of  $13.5

million  and  would create employment for  about  1,400

persons in the initial stages. The products recommended

are  as  follows: - fluorescent light fittings,  domestic

plugs  and socket outlets, switch gears and flat irons,

motors  and  fans, accumulators, chokes,  transformers,

refrigerators,  cookers, radios, television,  insulated

cables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the chemical industries, a $26 million

investment  would  be justified in creating  employment

for  some  3,000  people. The products  that  could  be

produced in Singapore, according to the mission, are as

follows:-   insecticides  and   disinfectants,   rubber

processing,    plastics   industries,    paints,    oil

processing, pineapple industry, soya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>



bean  processing,  wheat mix, urban  garbage  disposal,

sulphuric   acid   and  aluminium   sulphate,   storage

batteries,   fire   extinguishers,  ceramics,   certain

categories of pharmaceuticals, cement, calcium carbide,

alcohol  distillation  plant,  foam  plastics,  washing

powders, detergents and blues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are a number of priority industries

which  the  Economic Development Board  is  anxious  to

promote. These have been studied in some detail and the

Board, as I have stated before, is making contact  with

local and foreign manufacturers who may want to produce

them.   The   Board   is  prepared  to   assist   these

industrialists with all the resources at its  disposal.

The industries are, of course, first, the rolling steel

mill which is in the course of construction; production

of  window  panes, pans, rattan furniture, noodles  and

beehoon,  woodwaste  utilisation,  reinforced  plastics

workshop,  oil  refining, sulphuric  acid,  detergents,

matches,   wheat   mix,  fruit  juice  canning,   jams,

sausages,  and  fish  curing.  So,  you  can  see,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that we have moved away from the stage of

just  framing a general policy and are going  into  the

realm  of  actual project evaluation,  actual  work  in

promoting  specific  industries for  which  details  of

marketing  costs, techniques of production and  so  on,

have been worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the steel mill, the Member for Hong Lim

thinks  that the Economic Development Board is  staffed

by  people  whose  only experience is  selling  kachang

puteh.  I  think  I  should inform  the  House  of  the

progress   to   date.  The  United  Nations   Technical

Assistance   Board  despatched  a  steel   mission   to

Singapore, and this mission recommended that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan :</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> When I raised the question of the

steel  mill  today, I was asking about the steel  mill

which  the  Government announced in  the  papers  last

week,  not  about the United Nations report - which  can

come as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>



separate  paper in the form of a ministerial  statement

to  be  made later perhaps. We want to know the details

of what the steel mill is.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> On a point of order,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. I am anxious to get on with this

business.  The steel mill will come tinder  subhead  4.

Could all this be discussed then, Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Subhead 4 is "Industrial Estates

including Jurong Project". I am completely in the  dark

as  to  what  could  be discussed under  any  of  these

subheads,  but if the Minister says that  this  is  the

proper subhead, then this should be the proper subhead.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will be very brief then. The

reason  why I brought up the United Nations mission  is

that  this  steel mill which we are putting  up  is  in

accordance  with  their recommendation.  Briefly,  they

recommended that a steel industry could be developed in

three   stages.   The   first  stage   would   be   the

establishment  of  a mill for smelting  scrap,  rolling

steel  ingots, re-rolling of ship scrap, with an output

of  30,000  tons  a year which could  be  increased  to

60,000  tons eventually. This is the industrial project

which  is  now  being carried out by a group  of  local

businessmen and the Economic Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim made certain statements which

hinted   rather  darkly  that  the  Board  is   showing

favouritism  to a particular person. For  instance,  we

are  lending this person half a million dollars for the

steel project. I can assure you, Mr Speaker. Sir, that

this is completely untrue. I do not know whether he has

in  mind  the loan for ship-breakers. The ship-breaking

firm,  or  the  person interested in ship-breaking  who

carries  out  ship-breaking, who has a  loan  from  the

Economic Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>



Board, is also a partner in the steel mill. But  he  is

by  no  means  a  major partner. He is rather  a  minor

partner in the project. The main capital comes  from  a

group  of  wealthy  businessmen who are  putting  their

money  into it. The paid-up capital in the first  stage

is $6.5 million. This is a considerable sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what we

are trying to drive at. The Government should announce,

with  regard  to last year's project, that the  nominal

capital is $50 million but that the paid-up capital  is

$6.5 million.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is exactly what the

Minister   is   telling  the   House.   There   is   no

clarification. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is all I have to say about

the  Economic  Development Board. Only  one  concluding

word,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in view of the ignorance  and

malicious attack made on the Members and staff  of  the

Board. I say that we have a fine team of men working on

it and it deserves the full support of every citizen in

this country. We cannot get a better team to tackle the

problem ahead of us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, since the Minister has said that one

could  probably discuss the Jurong project  under  this

item -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The item discussed, I think, is

the steel mill only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want  to use very simple language to bring up my point.

The  Government has issued a pioneer status certificate

to  an  enterprise with a capital of $10  million.  But

that enterprise employs only one extra worker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang

brought  up  this  point.  He  repeated  the  statement

yesterday that Government gave $10 million to the Shell

Company. This is completely untrue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is due to a

mistake in interpretation. What I said is that

Government has given a five-year tax holiday to that

enterprise. I do not mean that the Government has given

a loan of $10 million to that firm.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the Member for Choa Chu

Kang should always blame the interpreter. I do not know

what the report in today's Press has about this matter.

But  the  interpretation that has come through all  the

time is that the hon. Member has stated that a loan  of

$10 million has been given to an enterprise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is exemption under

pioneer  status. If we were to follow what  the  Member

for Choa Chu Kang recommends, then we would not have  a

Shell   refinery  here.  We  would  find  it   in   the

Federation. That is the effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not oppose the setting up of the oil refinery.  But

my point is that the Government has given tax exemption

for five years to a firm with a capital of $10 million.

But  that firm employs only one extra worker. That does

not solve the employment situation in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is repetition. The Minister has

answered  the point. All the Minister has to do  is  to

give the same answer. That is repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will give my

view  on  this oil refinery. The Shell Company have  to

establish  an  oil  refinery  in  Singapore  because  a

Japanese  oil  refinery has been  established.  If  the

Shell  Company  do not establish one, they  are  in  no

position to compete with the Marusan Toyo Company which

has  established one at Telok Blangah. Sir, my view  is

that  there is no need to give tax exemption  for  five

years  to  this Shell Refinery. If we want to give  tax

exemption,   we   should  give  it   to   more   worthy

enterprises. I am sure there are many who have  applied

for pioneer status and tax exemption, because they have

to come into the market here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>



Otherwise, they are in no position to compete. Once  we

give  tax  exemption  to the Shell Refinery,  they  can

negotiate  or arrange among themselves. I do  not  mean

that they necessarily did. But I say they can have made

arrangements among the Shell Group. There are three  or

four Shell companies in Singapore. One is exempted from

tax; the profits are exempted from tax. The others  are

not.  They  can sell at the highest price. Suppose  the

oil refinery produces oil at $10 per ton and the market

price  is $30 per ton. This refinery can sell at $29.99

to  the  Company which has to pay tax, for  the  simple

reason  that  the  refinery which makes  $19.99  a  ton

profit  does not have to pay income tax for five years.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think that is what the Member  for

Choa  Chu  Kang was trying to drive at and the Minister

for Finance should clarify this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, that was not the

point  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang  was  driving  at.

although  he  nodded  his  head  very  wisely  when  an

accountant  made  the point, which is  supposed  to  be

quite telling. The answer is quite simple, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Surely  we  are not suckers. The  Government  has

income  tax  experts and accountants. In the  agreement

which we signed with the Shell Company, this point  was

described  in  minute detail, not merely  the  cost  of

production  and  selling  cost  but  also  finally  the

distributing services. Also more important,  the  price

at  which they buy from outside and the price at, which

they   sell   to  their  distributing  agents   outside

Singapore.  All these matters have been  gone  into  in

great  detail.  There are no loopholes for  Shell.  The

answer  is  quite simple. If you say you  do  not  give

pioneer status to Shell, there is a bigger refinery in

the Federation if you do not have one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Just one line, Sir. I

do not want waste the time of the House any furl I want

to refer to one rather deceptive and twisted report

from Radio Singapore last night. Radio. P.A.P. reported

that Dr Goh said that a Member Barisan Sosialis had

complained the Economic Development Board not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>



having  used  $40 million. Therefore, he said,  if  he

thought that the Board could spend $40 million  within

a  short  time, then Dr Lee was talking  through  his

hat.  Well, I think the News Division of Radio  P.A.P.

is  here.  They did take this down very  cleverly  and

clearly -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There must be no direct

reference to any stranger in the Strangers' Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to have this point

clarified, Sir. The point that we have made, and which

we  are still making, is that the Minister for Finance

has  practised a deception on the House by giving  the

impression that $40 million will be spent by  the  end

of  this year. If the sum put down there is $5,000  or

$10,000, we would not have minded so much. As  it  is,

it   is  $40  million,  and  we  have  been  given  to

understand that $40 million will be spent, whereas not

a single cent has been spent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I explain this thing in simple

terms?  These  are the Estimates of the Government  of

the  State  of  Singapore.  We  deal  with  the  money

estimated  to  be  spent  by  the  Government.  It  is

incorrect  to say that the money would not  be  spent.

The  $40 million has been spent by the Government.  It

has been given to the Economic Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to be clear enough.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To continue. What the Economic

Development Board does with this money will  come  out

in the report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Industrial Estates including Jurong Project...

$45,000,000." Sir, in the first column on page  29  of

the  Development Estimates, 1962, for the Ministry  of

Finance, under Head D32, item 4, Plan cost is given as

$45  million. In the second column, Revised Plan  Cost

is $45 million. If I may refer to the Development Plan

for 1961/64, at page 73, paragraph 7.62:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The total cost of the new town can only be estimated

after   detailed  geological  and  other  surveys.   A

provisional  sum  of  $45 million has  been  allocated

which will be supplemented as development progresses."



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the total cost of these estates is not

yet  known to the Government, that this is merely  the

first   instalment  in  the  project,  and  that   the

Government's  revised  plan on  the  first  instalment

still  remains the same at $45 million, of  which  the

Government hopes to spend $600,000 by the end of  this

year.  The  estimated expenditure for  1962  is  $20.4

million  and  the  amount  required  to  complete  the

project,  i.e., the first phase of it, is another  $24

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Hon, the Minister for

Finance  first  spoke to the House  about  the  Jurong

project, I get the impression from him that the  whole

of  this scheme was attuned to the steel mill that was

to  be  established in that area, that the steel  mill

was   going  to  be  the  focal  point  around   which

subsidiary industries were to be established, and that

this  $45  million  which the Government  proposes  to

spend initially is to be spent on items which normally

a  government or a State would spend in order  to  put

the  site ready for private enterprise to come in  and

develop it. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>



take  it  that it is correct this $45 million does  not

include the cost of establishing the steel mill itself.

Could the Minister tell us whether the Government still

holds  the  view that the focal point of the industrial

estates in the Jurong project is still the steel  mill,

and whether Government hopes that private industry will

then   cluster  around  this  steel  mill  on   objects

subsidiary to it? That is the first point, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is whether the Government has made

any progress in the establishment of the steel mill and

what  aid  the Economic Development Board is  going  to

give  to  any  person or persons who wish to  establish

this steel mill; and whether the Minister is now in the

position to give definite information to this House  as

to  what  exactly is going on in Jurong? The Government

has  estimated that they will spend $600,000 at the end

of  this  year under subhead 4. Under subhead  6,  Sir,

land  acquisition for industrialisation  at  Jurong,  I

take it, is $5 million of which $4.3 million has already

been  spent.  So by that, I assume that  all  the  land

which  the Government hopes to acquire in that vicinity

has  been acquired and possibly' paid for. So that over

and  above  that they are now hoping lb spend $600,000.

Could  the Minister tell the House exactly on  what  he

has spent this sum .of money whether it is on levelling

the hills and filling the land there? The Minister also

made  a  statement,  Sir, a few minutes  ago  that  the

Jurong  steel project is in the course of  erection.  I

definitely heard him say that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Construction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Construction. Did the Minister mean by

that  that  the walls of the steel mill are  going  up;

that  the  site  is being filled in, and  did  he  mean

construction  by that? Or was it just  a  slip  of  the

tongue?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The point has already been raised,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Dealing with the last point first.

When  I  said  the steel mill is under construction,  I

meant two things. First, the site has now been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>



levelled;  second,  members of the Board  of  Directors

have gone abroad to order the equipment. The design  of

the  mill  itself has been made by the  United  Nations

Mission.   If  all  goes  well,  the  mill  should   be

established either at the end of next year or early  in

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the steel mill will be the focal point of the

whole Jurong industrial project is something of which I

am  afraid we have to make a reappraisal. Our  original

plan was to start a mill on a very substantial scale in

conjunction  with  Japanese steel mill  interests.  But

both  the United Nations Steel Mission and the Japanese

experts themselves formed the view that we could do  it

in three stages, starting with a small smelting rolling

mill,  and  it production problems have been  overcome,

markets  established,  then the  question  of  eventual

extension to the real thing, i.e., the mill, plant  and

furnaces. That could be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, aid to the mill. As I have said, this venture is

a  venture  of  local  businessmen.  They  put  up  the

capital. The Economic Development Board itself is  just

providing,  I think, a small minority share,  something

like  15  to  20 per cent of the capital - no  more  than

that.  They  are just appointing some two Directors  to

the Board of Directors of this enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the works in Jurong at present - I think I

reported  this  rather briefly in my Budget  Statement;

perhaps   there   could  be  just   some   repetition - a

considerable amount of earthworks are in progress. That

part of Jurong is fairly hilly and hills have just been

levelled;  swamps have to be filled; roads have  to  be

constructed.  So at present, the works currently  going

on   are   levelling  of  hills,  filling  of   swamps,

construction  of roads and also the construction  of  a

culvert on the eastern shore of the Jurong River.  This

is  necessary because a causeway will be built over the

Jurong River which will dam the northern reaches of the

river  and  turn  it  into a reservoir  for  industrial

water. Then that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>



causeway will, at the same time, provide communications

between  the Jurong industrial estates and the port  of

Singapore  through Ayer Rajah Road. That  part  of  the

work  of building roads and the causeway together  with

the  industrial  water reservoir is in  progress.  Also

electrical supplies are being stepped up. We hope  also

to  provide an adequate supply of water. But this is in

some  doubt  now.  I  am  not sure  whether  the  Water

Department could move fast enough to provide sufficient

water, at any rate, by the first half of next year. The

position of electricity seems to be all right.  But  as

regards  piped water, I think they are somewhat  behind

time. Now, if Members are interested in seeing what  is

going on in Jurong, the Government will be very pleased

to  arrange touring parties for them to have a look.  I

think it is worth a visit because the amount of work in

progress  there  is quite substantial and  will  go  on

increasing in the next year or two.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister did say that the

participation of the Economic Development Board in this

project is, I believe, to the extent of 20 per cent  of

the shares. It is difficult for us to know how much the

quantum  is unless the Minister tells us what  the  100

per cent



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> $6.5 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you, Sir. The other point which I

wish to impress upon the Minister is that he should use

his  utmost endeavours with the Water Department to get

on  with the water project, otherwise, I am afraid - and

I  mentioned  this before in this House,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, - the whole of the Jurong project will be stymied.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajah?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D32 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 5 - Kallang Land Reclamation.

This seems to be in a more difficult condition than the

Jurong  project. The Jurong project seems to be  fairly

healthy.  If we could only get water, I think  we  will

get  it  squeaking  and  squawking.  But  Kallang  Land

Reclamation,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, seems  to  be  in  the

doldrums.  In the original scheme, as you  will  notice

from col. 1, it was $43.124 million, and if you will be

good  enough to look again at the 1961-1964 Development

Plan,  page  70, paragraph 7.44, we have a split-up  of

the $43.124 million:

<pre>

                                               $

Construction of approach road from quarry   2,130,000

Preparation of polders and pumping          1,984,000

Filling                                    30,000,000

Dredging Channels                           1,660,000

Sheet piles and river walls for channels    7,000,000

Surveys, Supervison and Clerical              350,000



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, what is more interesting is paragraph 7.45, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the total is taken as $50 million, so as to include contingencies. .'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the people who planned this felt that $43 million would not be

enough to be on the safe side to include contingencies. They thought that $50

million was nearer the mark. That was when this plan was published sometime in April or May

this year. But within six months Kallang Land Reclamation has dropped from near $50 million

to $28.50 million. Perhaps the Minister might tell us how this reduction in cost has been affected;

whether the area of development is going to be reduced from 1,035 acres to half, or what the

position there is. So far as this year is concerned, Sir, there is no expenditure of money.

But for the year 1962, they estimate that they will be spending half a million dollars. Now,

under either of these headings, it seems to me that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>



only  thing  they  are going to do there next year would appear  to  be  on

Surveys, Supervision and Clerical, and nothing more.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Kallang Land Reclamation project has indeed

hit  a  number of snags. Altogether we have been most unfortunate  in  this

business.  As  regards the change from $50 million to some $28  million,  I

think  there were two schemes to fill up this swamp. One is by moving earth

from  Paya  Lebar, and the other is by pumping mud from the  sea.  And  the

cheaper  one  is  this one. As regards progress, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  did

report  to the House that we have written to the Government of West Germany

for  technical assistance. We have not had any reply. In the  meantime,  we

have  asked the United Nations to despatch an expert on polders. The United

Nations was good enough to get us one, but unfortunately the man fell  sick

and  he  could  not pass the medical test. So I am afraid that  is  another

trough  in  the Kallang Land Reclamation project. However, I do  not  think

there  is such urgency in getting going with it, and I hope that in  future

years our luck will be better with this one.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> May I say something,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir? The Kallang area is of some value to  the  Ministry  of

Health,  because  it  provides the city with its  only  controlled  tipping

ground.  I  am  advised  that  it  is uneconomic  to  operate  the  present

incinerator,  which is 35 years old and has outlived its  useful  life.  So

that,  Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Farrer Park will be patient,  we

will in the course of the next five years produce a reclamation there which

will  be  more or less comparable to the reclamation along Beach Road,  now

known as the Nicoll Highway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to bring up a few points for

clarification concerning the Singapore Conference Hall-cum-Trade Union

House. When will this Hall be completed? Will it be completed during the

lifetime of this Government or of the next government? Will this Trade

Union House be used by trade unions under one leadership or under the

leadership of the various trade unions existing in Singapore? I fear that

all the community centres in Singapore are under the influence of the

Party in power. If the Singapore Conference Hall is to be subjected in the

same way as the community centres have been subjected, then it will be

bad. I know that $1,150,000 will be spent on the Trade Union House, with

another $3 million required for its completion. The important question is,

whether this House will engender a spirit that is pro-Communist, anti.

Communist, or Communist in nature because I know that there are two

opposing factions who will fight each other to the end. So, Mr Speaker,

Sir what will happen to the unions who remain neutral? Will the non-aligned trade unions become the victims? Will restrictions be put on the

use of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>

House? I fear that tape-recorders may be planted and pictures may be taken

by hidden photographers in the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed Trade Union House was one of our

election  pledges and there is no doubt that this Government  will  redeem

this pledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last year, the present Minister for Health and Law, with the

assistance  of  a  few  other trade unionists, formed  themselves  into  a

Committee  with  a  view to implementing this pledge.  The  Committee  has

studied this project very carefully and it has located a site somewhere in

Shenton Way. A design competition is now on and it will be closed on  30th

December,  1961.  The winning design will be selected by the  Cabinet.  So

there is no doubt that this project will be completed as soon as all these

preliminary procedures are completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being a Trade Union House, it will also have a Conference

Hall.  The Trade Union House will be used for any international conference

held  in  Singapore. The purpose of building this House is to  assist  the

trade unions in Singapore to consolidate themselves into a strong unit  to

meet  the  employers. Of course, facilities will be provided to  help  the

workers  of  Singapore  to  protect their  interests.  There  will  be  no

discrimination between workers of this or that union.

House.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Government policy on this is very  clear,

and  there is no doubt that no facilities in the State will be  provided

for use by any force for a pro-Communist or a Communist cause.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also have an amendment* on the same Head which amounts to the same thing. May I speak now

so that we can dispose of the two amendments at the same time?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The amendment, also standing in the name of Mr S. T. Bani, reads as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D44 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the first question I would like to ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary is, who are the present  occupiers  of  Nantina

Home  in Queen Street? When the Government mooted the project of a Trade

Union  House, it decided to place one of its houses in Queen  Street  at

the disposal of the T.U.C. In fact it was occupied by the T.U.C. and  it

became known as a sort of Trade Union House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on every occasion when the subject of a Trade Union House was

brought up, I objected to it on the ground that the P.A.P. was trying to

offer a sop to the workers of Singapore. The workers of Singapore do not

require  such a sop. Events have proved that so long as the workers  are

not  with  the  Government,  they can be  branded  as  Communists,  pro-Communists, Communist sympathisers, etc. If it is the intention  of  the

Government to help the workers to own a house, then the proper thing  is

for  it  to  lease a piece of land at a very nominal rent to  the  trade

unions  so that they can build a house of their own and not be  indebted

to  the P.A.P. for a house which they themselves can afford to build.  A

dollar  from each worker in Singapore will bring in enough money to  put

up  a  Trade Union House of their own. But land is difficult to  get  in

Singapore, and if the Government is really keen on wanting to  help  the

workers, then it should lease a piece of land to them at a nominal rent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us see what kind of a Trade Union House it is going to be. It is

not a Trade Union House. It is a Conference Hall. This building is going to

be  3,  4  or 5 storeys, and I think one storey will be given to the  trade

union  organisation  to be used as an office. It will  not  be  correct  to

describe that building as a Trade Union House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply just now said that it was the

intention of the Government to help the trade unionists so that they  could

consolidate themselves and get unified. But how can they get unified if the

law  providing for their unification has not been assented to? How can they

be unified if the Government encourages their particular group of unions to

go  out  fighting against other groups of trade unions? In fact,  Sir,  the

cause  of  the  present industrial unrest can be laid at the  door  of  the

political struggle that is being waged in the trade union field. There  are

unions  under  the  control of the P.A.P. trying to  prove  that  they  are

better,  and  there are unions belonging to another group trying  to  prove

that  they  are  better too. Therefore, we have all this industrial  unrest

that  is  going  on.  If  the Government means to  unify  the  trade  union

movement,  then it should reintroduce the law to see that the trade  unions

are  unified, otherwise they cannot be unified as there is no law providing

for their unification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Trade Union House will be used more as a Conference

Hall.  In  the  light of the constitutional advance, foreign relations  and

external  affairs  will  be  in the hands of the  Central  Government.  The

Central  Government  already had a Conference Hall  known  as  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Hall.  How  are  we  going  to arrange  international  meetings  in

Singapore  when  we  are going to lose our identity? At the  present  time,

Singapore  still  has  some  identity in the international  field,  because

although  its foreign relations are in the hands of the British, its  trade

and  cultural relations are in the hands of the Singapore Government. There

fore,  United Nations missions and delegations of a commerical  or  trading

character can hold their conferences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>

here and Singapore can be a member. But once we are in closer relationship

with  the  Federation  in  1963,  we will  have  lost  our  identity.  All

representations  will have to be made through the Central  Government.  So

why should we go to the extent of spending $4 million or $5 million to put

up a building that may not be used for the purposes it is intended for? It

should  not  be  done,  because  Singapore would  then  have  no  standing

whatsoever in the international field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I am more concerned about is this claim of the P.A.P. that this

is  one  of  its pledges which it is going to fulfil. There  are  so  many

pledges  of  the P.A.P. that are never fulfilled and it does not  want  to

talk  about them. Why does the Government say that it is going  to  fulfil

this pledge? Is it just because it wants to get the workers on its side by

giving  them a little bit of sugar? The workers of Singapore are no longer

that  foolish. At one time, they could have been foolish, when the  P.A.P.

with its wonderful propaganda could proclaim militantly in the trade union

field  that it was the champion of the workers. In fact, the champions  of

the civil service were the ones to effect the pay cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I object to the Trade Union House on principle. If the Government is

very  sincere, it should lease to the workers a piece of land at a nominal

fee  and let them build their own trade union house. If in this particular

building you are going to have international conferences, the use of  that

floor  may  be  restricted. Suppose the unions go on strike - a  Government-controlled union may go on strike because we have read in the papers  that

the  Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for Culture  has  said  that

Government has said that Government staff may go on strike: you  may  even

have  a P.A.P. union saying that it is going on strike - then the particular

floor  allotted  for the use of the T.U.C. will be full of activities  and

if,  at  the  same time, there is to be an international conference,  then

there will be a mix up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if you are going to give one floor to the T.U.C. in a building

which  is under Government control, I do not know what kind of gadgets  may

be  put  in  by  the Government in order to find out what the  workers  are

doing. Surely that is not the intention of the Government. But it can  lead

to  suspicion, and the suspicion is justifiable in the light  of  what  has

been happening in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not the serious

intention  of  the Government to build this Singapore Conference  Hall-cum-Trade  Union  House.  I  think  it has been put  here  in  the  Development

Estimates - the figure $4 million appears there - purely for the purposes of

making  political  propaganda.  Sir, as  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  has

pointed out, the building of a Trade Union House was an election pledge  of

the  P.A.P.  I believe they said then that they wanted to put  up  a  Trade

Union  House  at  a  cost  of $2 million. Then about  one  year  after  the

elections,  sometime last year, I think the former Minister for Labour  and

Law  told  us  that  the Minister for Finance said he  could  not  give  $2

million. So it had to be somewhere around $1 million. And, the next thing I

see, Sir, is $4,150,000. The Parliamentary Secretary says it is going to be

a  Conference  Hall-cum-Trade Union House. I do  not  know  what  Singapore

Conference  Hall  the  Government has in mind. I  do  not  think  they  are

seriously suggesting that if the International Animal Lovers' League  wants

to  hold  a conference, they want the hall in the Trade Union House  to  be

used. Anyway, I do not know for what particular

purpose  this  Conference Hall is supposed to be used.  May  I  venture  to

suggest, Sir, that the main purpose of putting this vote in is to  build  a

Trade  Union House? I am not like the Member for Cairnhill, Sir. I  do  not

look upon this Trade Union House as a bribe to the workers. I associated my

self with the election pledge that the Government made, and I think I can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>

safely  say  that the majority of the workers and the unions  do  not  mind

getting  a big Trade Union House - ten storeys, air-conditioned perhaps  from

the  ground floor to the roof top, comfortable chairs, and so on. They will

be happy to accept such a house from the Government, so long as -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Under Barisan control!

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - there are no political strings attached. Sir, it is like

accepting  a  gift - financial aid from the Soviet Union or from  the  United

States  of America. There is nothing wrong in the gift itself. It  is  the

motive  behind the person who makes that gift. One can accept the gift  and

still  make  certain that the one who gives it does not get away  with  his

motive.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ask the Soviet Union to give you a Trade Union House!

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I want to suggest here that -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems to

me that the Leader of the House is not setting a very good example. Mr

Bani.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I can quite well understand why the Leader of the House is

thrilled  at  the  idea  of receiving American aid.  Perhaps  he  has  been

dreaming  of  American  aid  for the last few days.  Anyway,  that  is  his

business.  But  quite seriously, I think the important  thing  we  have  to

realise is this - what the labour movement in Singapore needs is not  a  huge

structure like the Cathay Building or the Asia Insurance Building. That  is

unimportant.  It  is  only  secondary. I do not  say  the  workers  or  the

unionists  would  not like to sit in an air-conditioned office  with  press

buttons,  and  all  you  have to do is to press a button  and  secretaries,

typists  and  stenographers come running round. No trade unionist  dislikes

this,  and  I  am  sure no worker dislikes having a really comfortable  and

convenient  Trade Union House. But this is not the motive for it.  You  can

put  up a Trade Union House without there being a trade union movement, but

it becomes a waste of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>

public  money.  I  was  really disturbed to listen  to  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  suggesting that this Trade Union House is going to be  used  by

what  he  said  only those unions that are within the camp of  the  P.A.P.

group of unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make this point quite clear here. S.A.T.U. has been mention

ed  so  many times. In the first place, S.A.T.U. is not registered and  we

have  stated quite clearly that so long as it is not registered, it  shall

refrain  from  participation  in  any trade  dispute.  But,  nevertheless,

S.A.T.U. has been smeared and I am not going to defend it or say anything

in favour of it or against the N.T.U.C. That is not my purpose now. But  I

want to make this quite clear - that when the previous T.U.C. was dissolved,

82 trade unions representing -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That, I think, is going rather far away from what we

are debating. We are now debating the

Trade Union House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is directly connected with the Trade Union House. The fact is

that  whatever  it is, S.A.T.U. or not, the conference that  was  held  was

attended by 82 trade unions representing a -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Did they discuss the Trade Union House?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am coming to the Trade Union House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must rule very strictly on this. Time is

passing.  Let  us  deal with the Trade Union House.  The  Member  is  quite

correct, in passing, in defending S.A.T.U., but if he goes into details, he

is going very far away from the

item.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not my intention now to defend S.A.T.U. But the point

that  I  want to make is: if you build a Trade Union House with $4 million,

and if that is to be used by some cronies who lead the National Trade Union

Centre,  which is a 14-man body, it is no use wasting $4 million of  public

money  to build a Trade Union House for the exclusive use of a small  group

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>

unions.  In  that  context, I say that if you seek to, exclude  the  large

group of unions that are outside the control of the P.A.P., then you might

as  well  not build the Trade Union House. As I have said, what the  trade

union  movement today needs is not a building structure but assistance  in

any  form  to strengthen its collective bargaining position. All that  the

Parliamentary Secretary said was just that the building was  going  to  be

put  up for the purposes of strengthening the trade union movement so that

they  can  fight  the employers harder. I do not see  how  it  can  happen

especially  if the structure is merely going to accommodate a  handful  of

unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I say this: that a Trade Union House, without a plan

to  unify  the  trade union movement, consolidate and  strengthen  it,  is

useless. As the Member for Cairnhill has pointed out, the Bill to  provide

for  a  unified  trade  union movement is still in cold  storage.  And  it

appears  it  is  not the intention of the Government to  provide  for  the

unification of the trade union movement. If that is the case, then  I  say

there is no point in having your $4 million Conference Hall for the Animal

Lovers' League.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there a ministerial reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson is never more

entertaining and less persuasive than when he speaks with his tongue in his

cheek. He knows this: that when the building of this Trade Union House  was

mooted,  an  invitation was sent from the Ministry to  the  T.U.C. and  we

sought  their  participation in the planning of this project. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, as a result of that invitation, the T.U.C., which was then constituted

by

the Ten Tall Men, appointed -

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Minister state the time? I do not deny the fact that

an invitation was sent out and we

participated in the Committee. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>

only  point that I wanted to make is that the Trade Union House was thought

of in the context of a unified trade union movement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the charge was made that this Trade Union

House  project  was  just a camouflage; that we were  trying  to  bamboozle

everybody; that we were never in dead earnest about what we had said  about

unifying  the  trade union movement and about providing  facilities  for  a

unified trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the first plan was to build a Trade Union House in the

city.  We  selected  the site of the old St. Andrew's  School  in  Armenian

Street.  But the grounds were not sufficient. For that reason, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  had to consider moving this project to Shenton Way, opposite  the

Polytechnic.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, a lot of planning  for  this  project  was

required.  The members of the Planning Committee consisted of  myself,  Mr

Woodhull, Mr Jamit Singh, who was always absent, and Mr Kandasamy.  After

considerable  thought had been given to this project and  to  the  detailed

planning, Mr Speaker, Sir, we associated the Board of Architects  in  this

project,  and  we put out a design competition. The design competition  was

announced and the closing date is

the 31st January, 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is intended to be an expensive building, and the

cost  of  maintenance is going to be considerable. We  do  not  expect  the

T.U.C. to be able to afford maintaining a building of this size on its own.

For  that  reason  we  incorporated in this Trade  Union  House  project  a

Singapore  Conference  Hall  as well. It will  be  possible  then  for  the

Government to maintain this building and to lease floors to the T.U.C.  The

control will still be in the hands of the Government and the T.U.C. will be

leased floors for offices. It is unfortunate, Mr Speaker, Sir, that whilst

the  planning  was  in progress, there was this rift  in  the  trade  union

movement.  But  it does not follow, that just because there has  been  this

rift, we should abandon this scheme. It is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



worthwhile scheme and we should continue with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point made by the Member for Cairnhill, Mr Speaker, Sir, he

says  that  we  will lose our identity when we are merged  into  a  greater

Federation.  But Singapore will still be a great emporium, and  it  is  the

biggest  emporium in South-East Asia. There is no reason why we should  not

have a proper Conference Hall here in Singapore. We have no place which can

serve  as a conference hall. When we build the Trade Union House,  why  not

associate with it a Conference Hall?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for 1962 to build parks and children's playgrounds and other

works  amounting to $80,000. I would ask Government to consider  increasing

playgrounds in the rural areas and not concentrating them in the city. Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This must be the strain of the last few days or

nights.  We  are now on amendment (1) to Head D47. An amendment  has  been

moved by the Member for the Southern Islands. Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Katong Park is already existing,

and within half a mile or so we have Kallang Park. In front of Kallang Park

we  have  the  People's  Association, which is also a  sort  of  recreation

ground.  All  that is on one side of Merdeka Bridge. At the  other  end  of

Merdeka  Bridge - Merdeka  Bridge is about one  mile,  I  think - we  have  the

Crawford  Children's Playground. I was just wondering  why  in  that  area,

which  the  Prime  Minister, I think, said a few days  ago  does  not  have

sufficient  density of population to occupy the Kallang Park and  which  he

calls  a  white elephant, we need so many "lungs". There are four  or  five

lungs  all  within that little area which is said to be not  of  sufficient

density.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is on children's playgrounds, not on lungs.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, children's playgrounds are known

as lungs for the children to breathe through.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum provided in the Estimates

under  these  items is meant for the development of children's playgrounds

in  Lim  Chew  Chye, Jalan Ampat - that is what the Member  for  Mountbatten

wants - Chancellor Road, Liang Siah Street and Bukit Ho Swee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, about two years ago, Kallang

Park was built by the former Minister for National Development, the Member

what is the reason?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is now going away from the

amendment,  as the Member for Mountbatten went away. We are now  discussing

children's  playgrounds  as such. If there is time,  parks  in  general,  I

suppose,  could be discussed under either subhead 3 or the whole  Head  D47

itself. We are now on children's playgrounds. Mr Lingam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before .I speak in general about

children's playgrounds, I would like to cite Kallang Park as an example.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is talking on parks, he will have

to  wait until we come to subhead 3 or the whole Head D47. We are  now  on

children's playgrounds as such - just children's playgrounds. Does  the  Mem

ber wish to speak on children's playgrounds now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, during the past two and a half

years, the Government has established playgrounds in certain constituencies

only. They have not been constructed in all constituencies. My constituency

is  an  example.  There are no facilities there for  people  to  spend  the

evening  hours  with  their children. There are no  playgrounds  available.

Other  Members  also  have  a  similar  situation  in  their  constituency.

Therefore,  I  wish to take this opportunity to bring this  matter  to  the

attention of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to  children's playgrounds, if we look at the 1962 Budget, we can see  that

the Government has only spent $5,000 in 1961. If we look at the development

project  for  1961,  on  page 522, we can see  under  this  item  that  the

Government is going to spend $20,000 in the town areas. In the rural areas,

the Government is going to spend $10,000. In other words, the Government is

going  to  spend  $60,000. But on this item the Government has  spent  only

$5,000 for this year. What is the reason for this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member was interpreted as having said that only

$10,000 was to be spent in 1961 for the rural areas. It is really $40,000,

is it not?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Not exactly, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On page 522.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Page 522, yes. The item on children's playgrounds. In

the  city  area the Government is going to spend $20,000 and in the  rural

area  $40,000.  But  in  the  1962 Development  Estimates,  the  estimated

expenditure up to the end of the year is only $5,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, we have concentrated our efforts in building

playgrounds  in the congested areas of the city. It is very  hard  to  find

suitable open spaces in the city itself. For that reason, we have developed

the  Crawford  playground and park for children. We have tried  to  develop

every  available piece of open land that we could find in the city  into  a

suitable  playground for children. There is one piece  of  land  in  Manila

Street,  off  Queen Street, in very heavily built-up area  which  has  been

converted  into  a  children's playground. We have gone round  looking  for

these  places  and  have put up seesaws, swings and  round-abouts  for  the

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands asked why we do not concentrate our

efforts also in the rural areas. But in the rural areas, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

there  are more open spaces. They are not heavily built up. In the kampongs

there are plenty of places for the children to run about. The concentration

of effort

must  obviously be in the city area. As far as the question by  the  Member

for Mountbatten is concerned, we have or,

the  water-front  tried  to  link stretches of open  ground,  for  example,

Kallang Park with Elizabeth Walk. You will notice that you can walk on that

waterfront -

grounds?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, children's playground and parks are

connected subjects and I am now talking about the Kallang Park area. There

is  the  safety  first children's playground in the park  itself  and  the

Crawford playing ground which are linked up with Elizabeth Walk. So it  is

very  hard to discuss this vote in isolation from the other votes relating

to  parks  and open spaces. I have touched on this because the Member  for

Mountbatten raised this point.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am trying to save time for the Opposition Members. It

seems to me that we should now concentrate on children's playgrounds,  and

then  we can develop this discussion under subhead 3. Anything further  on

children's  playgrounds. The Member for Havelock raised a question.  Would

the Minister like to answer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As I have already indicated one of the reasons is that we have

opened children's playing grounds on all the land that we can possibly lay

our  hands on. If he can show me other places in the city which the Govern

ment could take over, we will be only too glad to take them over as play

grounds for children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks and Open Spaces - the provision for 1962, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

$340,000.  In  the 1961 Development Estimates on page 522,  the  provisior

last year for parks and open spaces was $175,000, spilt up into two heads:

(1)  Safety  First  Playground, Kallang; (2)  Other  Projects - $175,000.  I

notice iron Head D47, that only $51,700 has been spent. Could the Minister

tell us how it is that where a vote of $175,000 was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>

provided, only less than a third of it has been spent? Could the  Minister

also  tell us where he hopes to establish these parks and open spaces  for

the sum of $340,000, and how many of them?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> indicated dissent.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not speaking. The Member for Aljunied if he wishes to add

anything further on parks?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, about two years ago, the former

Minister  for National Development of the P.A.P. Government constructed  a

number  of parks. Kallang Park was one of those constructed at that  time,

but  it still remains in the same state. There has been no improvement and

no  new construction. It was intended originally that the National Theatre

should be constructed on that site. But that scheme was later changed  and

the  new  site selected is on King George V Park. I do not understand  the

reason for this change.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to some of the money

which  has  not been spent in the 1961 Budget, firstly, it is  because  the

Parks  Department was under the City Council and it took some time for  the

City  Council  to be integrated into the various Government departments.  I

think this department was quite lately integrated into the Labour Ministry.

That  partly, is the cause of the delay in implementing the 1961 programme.

However,  as far as 1961 is concerned, the Ministry has submitted  all  its

development programmes to the Development Planning Committee in conjunction

with  the  Government's Four-Year Development Plan. I  understand  from  my

officer  that  the  Development Planning Committee  has  approved  all  the

programmes submitted by the Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full programme for development is contained in the Four-Year Develop

ment  Plan. As far as 1961 and 1962 are concerned, the programmes proposed

are   for  large  parks  in  the  Queenstown  neighbourhood,  Beach   Road

Reclamation. Farrer Park, that is, for resurfacing and parking bay, Farrer

Park  Athletic  Centre and Jalan Besar Stadium, repairing the  spectators'

stand.  Also  out  of  this total sum $100,000 is for the  development  of

Kallang Park and $20,000 for the extension of King George V Park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments made by the Member for Aljunied, Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is the usual habit of Members from the U.P.P. to remind the people

of  Singapore what wonderful things the ex-Mayor of the City of  Singapore

did  when  he was the Mayor. On Kallang Park, Mr Speaker, Sir, the  other

day the Prime Minister pointed out that, from statistics, the Park has not

been put to full use. So the Park officer has proposed a scheme to develop

it.  More  facilities will be provided and the Park will be put to  proper

use, such as providing for a football pitch, a tennis court and so forth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I must clarify what the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour has said just now.  When

Kallang  Park was built, there was no intention to show posterity that  the

Park  was built by Ong Eng Guan. There was no bronze plate put up  to  show

that  it  was  opened on such and such a day by the Minister  for  National

Development,  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan, as we  see  in  the  community  centres.

recreation  centres, the National Theatre, and I am sure, the  Trade  Union

House and Conference Hall. The main purpose of most of these projects is to

leave  something  to posterity to show that "my great grandfather  built  a

Trade Union House and Conference Hall".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in Kallang Park was this. When the Prime Minister took over

the  City  Council, he stopped all work, all extensions,  all  improvements

and other phases to complete Kallang Park.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>

That  is why some people are still inquiring why Kallang Park is half done,

just  as  Changi  Beach  was half done. We started  one  phase;  money  was

stopped; it was taken over. They did not want to complete the whole project

because  the  theory was, "If the Member for Hong Lim started it,  we  must

stop it." But, Sir, rest assured that in all the construction I did in  the

City Council and during the time I was a Minister, I never left my name  to

posterity.  It  was meant for the benefit of the people,  not  for  myself.

Yesterday  I  heard from the Prime Minister that he is now going  to  build

houses  at  Kallang Park. We have investigated the possibilities before  we

built  Kallang  Park. We found that it was a swamp before and  that  if  we

built  houses in that particular site, the rent would be so expensive  that

nobody would be able to afford it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member has made his point. He is now a

hit irrelevant. Mr Low?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, all the development

projects  by  the  P.A.P. look very fine. But if we look at  the  Four-Year

Development  Plan  on page 126, the question of Parks and  Open  Spaces  is

clearly  mentioned here. In 1961, the sum estimated was $175,000;  in  1962

it  is  $340,000. According to the Development Plan, we must put  in  this

amount of money in the first year, but whether we can carry out the project

is  another  question. In the second year, 1962, we put in that  amount  of

money,  but  whether we can carry out the projects or not does not  matter.

Therefore,  I say that all these plans are only paper plans to mislead  the

people  and  give  them  the impression that the  Government  wants  to  do

something  about all this. If we look clearly at these items  we  will  see

that  there  was  $175,000  in 1961 for the Government  to  carry  out  its

project. But in the 1961 Budget, only one-third of the whole vote will have

been spent. This is just to bamboozle the people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, the Member for Havelock knows that this is not true. He

knows  that in the old railway sidings in Tanjong Pagar, there  is  now  a

children's  park. He knows that in Manila Street, off Queen Street,  there

is a park for children. He also knows that in the Telok Ayer area there is

a  park  for children. We have been building little playgrounds and  parks

for  children  on  every piece of vacant land that we can  find.  We  have

entered sufficient provision in this vote for our purposes. All this  work

has been completed, including the park at Beach Road for children. We have

linked  up Kallang Park with Elizabeth Walk through the grass verge  along

the  Nicoll  Highway. Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot of planning  has  gone  into

this.  I have been out of touch for sometime now. But I have visited sites

in the Queenstown area for development as a big park. All this takes a lot

of planning and a lot of time, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have no doubt this work

is  now  in hand and there will be further extensions made with the  money

that is being provided.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Labour mention that within the $340,000 vote, some of it  was

hoped  to  be  spent on Farrer Park. Whether he said Farrer  Park  running

track  or just Farrer Park I am not quite sure. But whatever it may be,  I

would  like  to draw his attention to the condition in which  Farrer  Park

finds  itself  today.  Sir,  Farrer Park is probably  the  biggest  single

playing area which the Government provides for Singaporeans. It is a place

which  is  used not only by people who live in the vicinity,  but  by  all

football teams that find themselves scattered all over the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Farrer Park?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Farrer Park. A good place, Farrer Park. A very sensible ward!

Sir, the position prewar was that the football pitches at Farrer Park were

very good. During the war, what happened was that the Japanese confiscated

all sorts of vehicles and used Farrer Park as a dumping ground for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>

these  vehicles, with the result that the drainage of Farrer Park  suffered

thereby. This drainage has not been restored to its fullest capacity  since

the  war. As a result, flooding takes place on the pitches. If there  is  a

heavy  downpour of rain, it is not possible to play off these  games.  From

that  point of view, Jalan Besar Stadium is well looked after, because even

after the heaviest downpour, it is possible to play a football match there.

But  in  Farrer  Park, which is used by Second Division and Third  Division

teams, if a heavy downpour takes place, say, within half an hour of a  game

starting, it becomes almost impossible to play the matches there. So I  ask

the Government to look into that matter and see what they can do to put the

matter right.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must apologise. Just now I was

discussing a matter with the Member for Tanglin. That was why I  was  taken

by surprise. I did originally intend to point out to you that the two items - children's  playgrounds and parks - could not be separated because  in  every

park   .there  are  children's  playgrounds.  Both  parks  and   children's

playgrounds,  whether with or without a park, serve the same  purpose,  for

children to play in and for them to have a breath of fresh air. What I  was

trying  to point out just now is that with all these open spaces,  be  they

parks  or  playing  grounds,  there is a congestion  of  parks  and  not  a

congestion of people in a small area.

<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Health and Law pointed out, they are meant to join

up with Elizabeth Park on the seaside. Sir, .that is the place which needs

the least numbers of parks because of the sea air and the open space. This

is in my area, and I am glad the Government is making the Mountbatten Ward

as  healthy  as possible, with as much fresh air as possible. But  what  I

would  like  to point out is that while these parks exist for the  people

going  there  to  have fresh air, the air is polluted by the  ikan  belis

spread out all over the place - in, outside and around the parks. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>

the  empty spaces meant for the people going there to have fresh  air  are

giving out foul air.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is in the daytime that some ikan belis is

dried  on  the promenade and not in the parks. [Interruption].  I  do  not

think anybody can be blamed for the obnoxious smell produced by the drying

of this fish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten says there is no need for any development on

the  seafront because the people have a lot of sea breeze to  inhale.  Mr

Speaker, the Member for Hong Lim tidied up the piece of land fronting  the

sea  all  along  Nicoll  Highway. He had  it  paved  and  developed  as  a

promenade. It is a place which the public of Singapore use every  evening.

I do not know whether the Member for Mountbatten goes out at night, but if

she  does, she will see that the crowds flow over Nicoll Highway on to the

promenade.  You can see them every night. It just shows that  she  is  not

nocturnal in her habits.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to find out one

thing.  The  Minister says he could not be blamed for the  smell  of  ikan

belis.  But are those side paths meant for that purposes? They  are  meant

for the people to use. Why should ikan belis be spread out on them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question has been bothering me

for  quite  a while. I am assured by experts that it is just the treatment

of ikan belis that gives it that special

flavour. I have two solutions to this problem. One, of course, is for  the

residents  of the area who object to this practice to rear a lot  of  cats

and to let

them  go,  all  over the pavements. The other solution is to  devise  some

system of mechanical drying of ikan belis.

that when he revises his Development Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the same position prevails here. Although a fair sum of

money running into six figures was voted for the year 1961, only $1,500 is

expected to be spent. Perhaps it is no use crying over spilt milk  at  the

moment.  But I notice that the Government has put in $950,000 for swimming

pools for the year 1962. From my own experience, I think it costs about $4

million  to  put up a pool. So am I right in assuming that the  Government

intends to put up four pools for the year 1962? If that is correct,  where

are the sites going to be?

the  other in Queenstown. But we are now coming to the end of 1961  and  we

still  do  not  know whether these two swimming pools are to  be  built.  I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1,500 in the Development Estimates has been expended in making test

borings. It is proposed to build a big swimming pool in the park. As  you

know,  it is an area in which the ground is very soft and we are  getting

engineering advice on how best to build a swimming pool on such ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in the Ministry of Labour an advisory council on sports. They

have looked into this programme of building a swimming pool in the Kallang

Park in great detail, and have taken the advice of engineering experts.  I

think this project will be under way very soon.

beauty  of fish in a well-decorated aquarium. But the Prime Minister  does

entertain  guests and important people from overseas, and while  they  are

of subhead 6.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> indicated dissent.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (5)*. Dr Thio.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D48 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 7.*

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see here an item given as "Rural Settlement", and in the Develop

ment  Plan  it is described as a settlement for the aged. That  is  a  good

object  and  I  think we are all for it. But I wonder if  the  Minister  in

charge  would not also consider a rural settlement for those who are  tired

of  living in the slums, who are, unemployed and whose future in  the  slum

areas  is  bleak,  and whether, if they want to resettle as  farmers,  that

could  be provided. At the moment, there is only a resettlement scheme  for

those possibly evicted, but for those who voluntarily want to get away from

the  slums  there is no provision. I wonder whether the Minister in  charge

will consider a possibility like this in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Of course, what the Member for Tanglin proposes is

very  praiseworthy if only we have the money and only if we have the  land.

Unfortunately money must be spent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>

other  more  urgent tasks, and the, total area of Singapore is  just  over

215 square miles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to what the

Minister  for  Finance  has said, the Government's Development  Plan  then

should  be  thrown  into the waste-paper basket. In the  Development  Plan

there is an item for social welfare development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Havelock has mis

understood what the Minister for Finance said just now. He was replying to

a proposal by the Member for Tanglin that we should try, from these funds,

to  resettle  people  in the city who are unemployed.  The  reply  of  the

Minister for Finance was that we would like to do all these things  if  we

had the land and the money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that vote relates to the resettlement of the aged

poor.  Mr Speaker, Sir, you know there are two homes for the aged  poor;

one  is at Woodstock in the Tanglin area, and the other is at Bushey  Park

in the Chinatown area. It is proposed to move the aged to a new habitation

in  the Mount Vernon area. There is a site available for that purpose.  We

hope  to build small houses for them and get these people to live  not  in

barracks  or  dormitories but in detached buildings where  they  can  keep

their  own poultry and do a little bit of farming. That is the project  we

have in mind. It will have to be paid for from this vote if approved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D48 be reduced by $100.+

<hr size="2" noshade>

+The amendment also stood in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for my amendment is that for the year 1961 we approved a vote

of  $360,000  for  the Development Plan. $6,000 has been spent  on  social

welfare  from  the  estimated expenditure. Mr  Speaker,  in  this  year's

expenditure on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>

social welfare, the Government proposes to build at least three creches. In

the  1959  election campaign the P.A.P. said they were going to  fight  for

women's  rights. If the Government could build more creches, then it  would

be  very helpful to women. Women then could ,go out to work and leave their

children in the care of those in charge of the creches, so that they  could

work  without any worry. The three creches are to be built at Tanah Street,

Bukit Ho Swee and Geylang Serai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to answer a question raised by the Member for Delta.

There  are no creches there. There is also no creche in the Stamford  area.

The  Government are going to improve themselves. I am not going to say  any

thing about the good relationship with U.M.N.O.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There seems to be a very interesting conversation

going  on between the Member for Stamford, the Member for Delta, the Member

for  Bras  Basah  and the Minister for Finance! I would  suggest  that  the

Member  for Stamford address her remarks to me and ignore what is  said  on

the other side.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am talking to you but

since they asked, I have to answer. If they had not asked, I would not have

answered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the other items, I think that if the Government is not sincere

about  them then I propose that the money should be used to build more  and

more  creches  and not community centres in order to allow women  to  leave

their children in the creches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is this. If the Government does not build

more  creches,  then I hope it will build more homes to  provide  amenities

for the old people.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Stamford rather grudges the small

creche  in  Kreta Ayer, Sir. I would willingly exchange this creche  for  a

swimming pool or for the National Theatre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Stamford has

accused  the Government of having made a provision in the 1961 Budget  but

not  spending it. The simple reason is this, Mr Speaker, Sir.  The  major

items in the Budget, you will see, are the Junior Approved School and  the

Rural  Settlement.  The  difficulty is  to  locate  sites  for  these  two

projects.  That  accounts for the delay and why the  money  could  not  be

spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I need your guidance, Sir. The Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour mentioned the two items in the 1961 Budget as

the Junior Approved School and the Rural Settlement. In fact, they are the

Girls' Hostel, the Junior Approved School and the Muslim Welfare Home.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will repeat what he has

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Just now, I explained that in 1961 the major items

budgetted for were the Junior Approved School and the Rural Settlement.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Rural Settlement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> That is the last subhead in this Budget: Rural

Settlement.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In 1961 nothing was provided for Rural Settlement. I think that is, the Member for Havelock's point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Anyway, all these are institutions and we require

sites  to  build, them. There is difficult in finding  sites  and  so

there  is  a  delay.  And, of course, this money  will  be  required  for

construction purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Stamford does not seem to under

stand this point: The Government is spending over $1 million to build  a

home for those old people who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>

homeless. These people are at the moment confined in Outram Road Prison and

will be transferred to the new home when it is completed. In fact, this  is

the recommendation of the Prisons Inquiry Commission.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think this is a convenient time to suspend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair

of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $755,700 for Head D48 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D49 be reduced by $10 in respect of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 1 - Academy of Arts. The total plan cost is

$500,000.  I see from the Estimates that the Minister has put  in  a  token

vote.  Could the Minister inform the House what exactly he has in mind  and

what he expects of the Academy of Arts?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will take amendment (3)* as well.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*Amendment (3), standing in the name of Mr Rajah, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D49 be reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 7.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. We propose to start a National Art Gallery sometime

next  year. The purpose of it is  to exhibit paintings and works  of  art

acquired  by  the  Government, and also to provide a gallery  where  local

artists  can  dispose of their paintings for sale. When the  National  Art

Gallery  gets  going,  it is proposed eventually to develop  in  the  same

building  an  Academy  of  Arts  where, in  addition  to  just  exhibiting

paintings  and so on, there will be courses teaching painting,  music  and

dancing.  At  the  moment, this is no more than  a  conception.  For  that

reason,  we are just putting in a token vote of $10. Probably the  Academy

of Arts will not get going until perhaps in 1963.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now the National Art Gallery. I see that the Government has

put in a vote of $500,000 for next year. Will that expenditure be incurred

in  the purchase of pictures by local artists, or is a part of that, money

intended to be spent on building and furnishing of the Art Gallery?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is expenditure both for the building, for which we

have acquired a site near the National Library, and also for equipping the

building for exhibiting works of art.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to, move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D49 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (5) of subhead 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item (5) is in respect of replacement of seven studio doors.

The  vote  asked  for is $8,200. I am wondering what kind of  studio  doors

those could be costing more than $1,000 each.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I understand that these doors, unlike the front door

of  my  house  or that of the Member for Cairnhill, are studio  doors.  If

anybody  has  gone to one of the studios of Radio Singapore, he  will  find

that  these  doors  are not the kind that they can  enter,  for  they  are

specially constructed. They are "accoustic" doors, one side of which faces

an  air-conditioned  room and the other side faces  outside,  which  is  of

ordinary room temperature. I understand from the engineers that under  such

conditions a door of this kind will be subjected to considerable stress and

.strain on account of the differences in temperature, and will have  to  be

specially  constructed  to  be  able  to  stand  both  the  differences  of

temperature inside of the door as well as to be accoustically sound.  These

costs  have  been worked out by the engineers. That is why it costs  $8,200

for seven doors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is in connection with television. The vote asked for is

$1.8  million. Would the Minister be good enough to give us more  details?

Where

is  it going to be, and where is it hoped that television will be shown  in

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It will be convenient to take both these matters together,

unless we deal with some different principle, such as equipment or

building.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no amendment in regard to equipment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But the Minister may speak on this as well. He may speak on

both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The preparation for setting up a television station has

proceeded to the extent of our having started negotiations with the Marconi

Wireless  Telegraph Company and the Japanese firm of Marubeni-Iida Company,

Limited,  to  provide us with equipment for television. In fact,  the  work

will  be  shared out between these two firms. We also intend to purchase  a

piece  of  land  next to Radio Singapore because the present  site  is  not

sufficient to accommodate both the Radio Singapore building as well as  the

new  television  studio.  The moment the land  has  been  acquired,  it  is

proposed  to  start building the studio itself. But I am  told  the  studio

would take about two years to complete, because it is a specialised type of

building. But during this period it is possible to have a sort of temporary

television service from a semi-permanent building or a reconditioned  Radio

Singapore  studio  building.  I am told the target  date  for  broadcasting

television would be sometime in September or October next year.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see there is, in fact, an amendment to the whole of

subhead  10 standing in the names of the Member for Tanglin and the  Member

for Mountbatten. Dr Thio, perhaps we could deal with it now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that, according to the 1961-1964 Development Plan, there should already be one channel of television

functioning. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1961 a one channel television station with film unit will be completed ...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently there has been a delay of one year. Sir, television is

something  new  to  us here. I hope the Minister will not  just  transplant

everything  that  goes on in other temperate regions to Singapore,  because

some  of  our surroundings are different. In a temperate country one  could

easily pack a dozen or 20 or 50 people in a small room. But here, we do not

want to encourage such a large group to view one television set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this, Sir. There is always a fear on the Opposition

side - especially the Barisan Sosialis, but sometimes we also share with them

their  fears - that when the Government organises something, it  is  thinking

not  of  the  educational  or cultural value  of  the  new  thing  but  its

propaganda and political value. In order to -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If my recollection is correct, I think we have

discussed  the  principle of television and television programmes  when  we

discussed the Estimates. If I am right, then I would suggest to the  Member

for  Tanglin that we should not go back or, that discussion. But  if  I  am

wrong -

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> We have not.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have not. Sorry. Dr Thio, please continue.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I would suggest, Sir, that he take the same approach

as the Minister for Education in dealing with his 4:2 and 3:3 controversial

educational  issue. He refers it to a so-called body of experts.  If  there

could  be appointed an advisory committee on television, that would help  a

great  deal.  Parents  may want to know what sort  of  programmes  will  be

provided,  because  I see here a statement that there  will  be  commercial

programmes,  and  that it is, hoped the fees will meet all  running  costs.

Sir, we know that television is going to be very expensive but if, for  the

sake  of  meeting  all the running costs, we, sacrifice ,  the  educational

value of television and instead suffer, something that is injurious to  the

progress of our younger generation, then it will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>

good  to  introduce television. So an advisory committee will be  a  great

help.  I  would suggest also that if all Party representatives be on  that

committee;  then that would prevent suspicious ideas being entertained  by

Opposition Members.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no doubt the Minister for

Culture must have contacted technical experts before he mooted the idea of

television  in  Singapore.  I  do not pretend  to  know  anything  of  the

technical  side  of television. But there is, I would suggest,  the  other

side  of  any project, and that is the effect of television on the people,

especially the youth, and how it is going to be accepted by the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have no technical knowledge but I was fortunate enough,

when  going  through different countries, to be able to put  up  in  homes

where there were television sets. My special interest being in the welfare

of  women  and  youth, I have had discussions with those people  who  used

television  sets  and with mothers about the effect of television  on  the

children. We have also had round-table discussions whenever subjects  such

as  vice  and television and their effect on children come up. Apart  from

that,  Sir, my interest in this subject has taken me through Melbourne.  I

saw  the  Director  of the Audio Visual Department of  the  University  of

Melbourne. Apart from discussions with him when going round his University

and  seeing the things connected with audio vision we discussed  it  again

recently  when  he  visited Singapore on his way back from  America  after

having studied the educational use of television. After he left Singapore,

we  still  correspond, and I have very valuable suggestions made  by  this

expert,  who  has made it a special study when going round  the  different

parts of the world to see how television can be used for education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these discussions and experiences of mine, there is, one

prominent  feature on which everybody seems to agree - that  television,  if

handled  the  wrong  way,  can be a curse to the nation;  but  if  handled

properly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>

right from the beginning, can be a very very important arm of the education

system.  I  would  like  to quote just a few lines  of  the  correspondence

between this Melbourne University expert and myself on this. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Television could either help solve the problem of teacher shortage,

swollen classrooms.

more knowledge in less time; or it can be a serious competitor with all

existing educational and communal welfare efforts.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In undeveloped countries [meaning the developing countries, I suppose]

where the governments are using every possible means

to focus education on national construction for the national future, urging

its citizens to help even to the point of self-sacrifice, it

seems incongruous to me to waste funds and efforts in establishing an

instrument which

will have the very opposite effect.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also learnt that once television has been accepted as mere

entertainment (the countries that have made that mistake are regretting  it

now  and  they  feel  that  any  country that is  beginning,  to  introduce

television  should be very careful), it is very difficult indeed  to  bring

education into it. That is the opinion of most experts, mothers and  others

that I have met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Entertainment television as opposed to instructional television is

acknowledged  everywhere  as, at best, one of  the  most  successful  time

consumers ever invented.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Undeveloped countries can use the new television medium ...'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the most important part -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could the hon. Member indicate what document she is

reading from?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, these are some suggestions given by this man

who has gone to study television and, if you like, I could hand this over.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a private document?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. What the hon. Member should do is not to read from a

private  document,  but  to paraphrase it and say that  she  has  the  same

views.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, Sir,It just shows television with all its

novelty and glamour and attractiveness as something new being introduced.

This  quality  can be used very successfully to introduce education  into

it.  Television has been known to have the quality of holding  people  to

the  set. As I have said, that can be a curse or an advantage. Now,  Sir,

this  is  a  private document, but if the Minister would like  documents,

which  are  not  private,  on articles such as  "Automation  coming  into

School"  and telling how television has been very successful  in  certain

schools in America and has been a failure in others, and "T.V. finds  its

place  in  U.S. schools", I can assure him that they are very useful  and

are  the  results of study made 'by an expert on the matter. I  do  hope,

Sir,  that the Minister for Culture will give this very serious  thought,

because  I  have,  as  I  have said, come across people  who  think  that

television is a curse to their nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With regard to what the Member for Mountbatten has said,

I  could  not  agree  more.  Definitely, any instrument,  whether  it  is

television,  radio or cinema, if badly used, becomes a curse.  If  it  is

well used, it becomes valuable. In designing programmes for television we

have  borne in mind both its entertainment and instructional value, i.e.,

we want to make a success of television, so as to entertain as well as to

instruct.  We  have  an expert from Australia who is helping  us  in  our

programming, and we also had valuable suggestions from the N.H.K., Japan,

as  regards programming and the extent to which television could be  used

for  school broadcasts. In the formulation of school programmes, we  will

naturally  consult and get the advice of teachers on how best  television

could be used to assist

teachers in their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when I was in Japan last year, I went to see some of the school

programmes. They told me that, as a result of introducing television, the

powers  of  comprehension of a child have increased by  about  100  per

cent, when a child begins to understand what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>

things are which he only reads in books. So I certainly agree with what has

been said by the Member for Mountbatten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with what the Member for Tanglin has to say. We must use

television to good effect, and to beware of its social effects. As  regards

the role the Opposition can play in making television a success, if anybody

is  interested and can play musical instruments, dance and sing, I shall be

glad to consider any suggestions they have to offer in that respect.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister mentions experts. Can

I  ask  him  whether they are all technical experts, or  are  any  of  them

educationists?  He  did  mention getting teachers.  Could  I  suggest  that

teachers  who know nothing about television and teachers who have not  even

seen  television  are not likely to be very helpful in the subject,  unless

they  have made a study of how television can help the children.  When  the

Minister  mentions the Opposition doing some dances and music, he may  have

meant it as a joke. But that is exactly what we are warning him against - the

wrong type of culture, which is thought to be culture when it is not really

culture.  When you talk about it, it is not so bad, but when  you  actually

see it, Sir, it becomes worse than yellow culture. I do not know what

colour to call it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At least for the next five years, our television will be

in black and white. So there will be no particular colour attached to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the role teachers play, it is not so much on the technical

side. As we are going to have school programmes, the teachers should let us

know  what exactly they want. It is no use, say, in a particular year, they

have, as part of the literature textbooks, some famous novel and if we have

films  depicting scenes from some other world, it may not be valuable.  For

example, this year, we are playing King Henry V.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>

That  is a textbook. So we make it into a film where scenes from the  play

are enacted. So the teachers' role is not to help actually in devising the

programme  but  to give their suggestions and to say what value  such  and

such  a  programme has, and how they think it could be  put  over  to  the

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general content of what is good culture and what is bad

culture,  I  am  quite  contented that so far the  radio  programmes  have

Managed to avoid rather deplorable examples of yellow culture. The nearest

we  got  to, I think, was when the Member for Hong Lim said we had a  song

about  "I  am  my own Grandpa", and I am told since then,  we  have  never

exceeded the bounds of decency.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, from the Minister's answer, I realise he still

does  not  quite catch what I mean by the potentialities of television  in

education.  Probably not being an educationalist and  not  having  studied

television  enough,  he does not understand. But  can  I  suggest  to  the

Minister  that he get an expert on the subject? Evidently it is  difficult

for  me to explain to him here. I would try in the C.P.A. Room if he would

like to talk to me. I am not such an expert in the technical part, but  in

the social part of it, I can tell him quite a lot of things. But would he,

before  he really launches on the subject, make up his mind that an expert

on the educational side of television be consulted?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D49 be reduced by $100.+

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The amendment standing in the names of Dr Thio Chan Bee and Mrs Seow Peck Leng, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D49 be reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 10.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because there is only 15 minutes left, I therefore

intend  to cut short my speech. In the whole estimates we can see  clearly

here  that the Government is very interested in and concerned with Malayan

culture  and its early conception. Therefore, this House also  feels  that

the  development  of  a  Malayan culture is very important  to  the  whole

nation,  and  that it is necessary that we must have Malayan  culture  as

soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, last year, when a meeting took place in this House, we approved

a sum of $4 million for the development of the Ministry of Culture. But the

Ministry  of Culture has spent only about $1 million this year. That  means

only  one-quarter  of  the estimated expenditure.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

Ministry of Culture, since its inception, has carried out a great  deal  of

cultural  activities.  It has disseminated its efforts  and  has  tried  to

encourage cultural organisations in their activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there is no central organisation in the Ministry of Culture

to  co-ordinate  all  the cultural activities in Singapore.  Therefore,  at

present,  all  the  cultural activities in Singapore  are  carried  out  by

amateur organisations such as the Old Boys' Associations, the trade  unions

and  the rural organisations. If these organisations do not make an  effort

to  carry out cultural activities, then the so-called Malayan culture  will

not  take  shape, because the Ministry of Culture itself does not encourage

cultural activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that almost every cultural body in

Singapore was invited to take part in the National Day celebrations and  in

the Cultural Festival. Unless these cultural organisations are prepared  to

contribute  items  and talent, then the results of these celebrations  will

not  be  so very good, and this is not conducive to an early conception  of

Malayan culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture expresses doubts in respect of the items contri

buted  by the people's organisations. They are invited to contribute  items

for the celebrations, and when they apply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>

for their performances to be approved, they are always turned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture and his Parliamentary Secretary have publicly

appealed  to  the people of Singapore to take part in cultural  activities

and  to  contribute literary works, dances and music. But the Ministry  of

Culture  takes a doubtful attitude and sometimes it even looks  down  upon

the  works  of local artistes. These people are therefore discouraged  and

they are unable to present their works to the people of Singapore. If this

state  of  affairs is to continue, then I think the establishment  of  the

Ministry  of Culture is nothing but a propaganda organisation  which  just

disseminates the policies of the Government, and the whole significance of

such  a  Ministry  will then be lost. The main objective of  the  Ministry

should be the encouragement of local cultural activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, we heard the Yang di-Pertuan Negara saying

that  the  Government would establish a Cultural Brigade and the  Minister

for  Culture  also spoke on this subject. At that sitting of the  House  I

asked  the  Minister  for  Culture when  the  Cultural  Brigade  would  be

established  in  order  to put more life into the cultural  activities  in

Singapore.  I  am  asking  him again when the  Cultural  Brigade  will  be

established.  Could  it  be  that  the  Cultural  Brigade  has  not   been

established  up  to now because of political reasons? At  that  time,  the

Minister said he had nothing to do with politics. Mr Speaker, Sir, we can

see no provision for the Cultural Brigade in the present Estimates. We can

only see provision for the establishment of the National Theatre. It is  a

good  thing  to have such a theatre. But if we do not have more programmes

and  more  cultural  activities, what is the use of  having  the  National

Theatre?  From the speeches of the Minister and of Government Members,  we

can see clearly that the Ministry of

Culture  is not sincere in establishing the Cultural Brigade. I  feel  the

Government should establish the Cultural Brigade. It is a good idea and it

will put more life into the cultural activities in Singapore. The attitude

of the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>

towards  cultural  activities is decided by its  political  views.  Sir,  I

understand  many workers interested in cultural activities are not  allowed

to  participate  in  the  Cultural Brigade because,  in  the  eyes  of  the

Government, they are Communists or pro-Communists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a man interested in cultural matters must take an

active part in cultural activities, but in the view of the Government he is

a  doubtful  character  because he is taking a  very  active  part  in  the

promotion of culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel the Ministry of Culture must re-consider its

attitude towards the establishment of the Cultural Brigade and it must  not

doubt the character of the cultural workers. Those people who are active in

the  cultural field must be absorbed into the Ministry of Culture so  that

culture may be actively promoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past two years, the Ministry of Culture and the

Government  have been talking about the people's attendance  at  the  Aneka

Ragam  and  so  on, but this year the attendance at these performances  has

dropped.  The attitude of the Government towards cultural organisations  is

one of suspicion. The Government is rather superficial in its dealings with

the local cultural organisations. This goes to show that the Government  is

not sincere in the promotion of culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister for Culture will realise that, in

order  to have more cultural activities and more enthusiastic work in  the

field  of  culture,  those who are now engaged in cultural  work  must  be

encouraged  to  take a more important part and be given more opportunities

to present their works and to express their artistic abilities. It is only

in this way that we can build a true Malayan culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that next week the Minister for Culture may go

to  Kuching. It is reported that he is going to lead a cultural mission to

Kuching.  I do not know whether he is going to treat the members  of  this

mission as the future pillars of the Cultural Brigade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministry of Culture will try its best to

encourage  local artistes and it should not in \any way try  to  interfere

with  their  work.  It  should not be suspicious of  the  works  of  local

artistes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all that I can gather is this. The Mem

ber  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  feels that some local artistes  are  not  being

encouraged as they should be, because when he talks of local artistes  and

local  cultural organisations being let down, he is not referring  to  all

local  artistes and local cultural organisations. There are certain  types

of  organisations  which  have  tried to introduce  politics  into,  their

cultural activities; they have tried to introduce programmes which do  not

conform  with  our  intention  to build a  culture  which  is  Malayan  in

character  and in orientation. Of course, the Government has been  careful

not  to  allow  itself to be used by them. Although it has  been  repeated

before that the Government itself cannot create Malayan culture, all  that

it  can do is to encourage cultural activities and hope that, as a result,

of doing so, something worthwhile can come out of it all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has said just now that we have prevented local artistes

or  local cultural workers from expressing themselves. But he knows  that

the songs that have been banned and the dances that have not been allowed

to  be  performed  are  Communist items and songs which  everybody  knows

about.  The tunes are there. They come at the last minute and give  us  a

play  which  they  all  know has been banned before,  because  it  is  of

Communist  origin - not necessarily because it is of  a  Communist  nature;

there are some good Communist plays which we allow people to perform. But

where  you  find a certain Communist play, poem or music is  in  conflict

with  our  intention  to  create a Malayan  loyalty  and  a  Malayan  con

sciousness, we have prevented it. In  each case where we prevent them  or

say, "You cannot play this," they try to smuggle it in. They then go  and

see a few Assemblymen and say -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> There are certain types of cultural organisations which

have  primarily political motives that are detrimental to the country,  and

they  will  certainly get no encouragement from this Government. But  where

cultural workers are interested in culture and in promoting Malayan culture

and  Malayan loyalty in conformity with what is accepted even in theory  by

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis - the creation of a non-Communist, Socialist

Malaya - they will get every encouragement they need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for culture not flourishing, I am told, Sir, that the Victoria Theatre

has been fully booked next year. To that extent, the Member cannot say that

culture  is  not  flourishing. Obviously it is flourishing very  well,  but

perhaps not in the direction some of his friends would like it to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Police Radio Equipment, as far as we know, was recommended to be

changed  since  "1960.  According to the Four-Year Development  Plan,  the

Director of Telecommunications had suggested an overall change of all  net

works  in  a three-year phased programme starting from 1960. The  networks

that were supposed to have been changed were 3 for the Combined Operations

Room  and 3 for the Divisions, and in toto about $600,000 was expected  to

be  spent  in  1961. We just cannot understand why the  Minister  has  not

sanctioned this, and also why the whole programme has been deferred.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad  the  Member for Queenstown thinks it is time this radio  network  is

changed so that the efficiency of the police is improved. I thought he had

all along developed a kind of phobia against the police, and I am glad  to

hear  from  him  that  he thinks that the work of  the  police  should  be

improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1961 we provided a sum of nearly $600,000 for this

item.  But we thought it was quite an expensive item and perhaps it  would

be  better  if  we  got  a second expert opinion on this  subject,  hoping

thereby to save the State a considerable sum of money. But in the  end  we

found  it  was not possible, and a complete overhaul is necessary  because

spare  parts for the existing equipment are no longer available. It  is

intended that the work should be completed by the middle of 1963.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, far from having a phobia against the police, we

on  our  side would like the efficiency of the police to be improved.  But

what  we  object to, Sir, is the wrong use of the police. The  P.A.P. has

been  making  use  of  the  police as their own  private  organ.  A  State

department is being used as a private P.A.P. organ - and is being  asked  to

look  after P.A.P. branches, and to tail their ex-colleagues, using  young

girls who look like I-do-not-know-what as decoys. The police is also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>

being  used  against the strikers. That is not the way to use the  police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for the Special Branch, and the whole amount is $2

million.  The  vote for 1962 is only $200,000. Sir, in view  of  the  fact

that  in the light of constitutional advance, internal security is  to  be

in  hands  of  the Central Government, do the Government now  consider  it

advisable  that  they should go ahead with their plans to  put  up  a  new

headquarters for the Special Branch?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Special Branch building, Mr Speaker, just as the Member for

Cairnhill  has  said, it is because internal security will come  under  the

discussing the question of the Annual Estimates, I believe I had  occasion

to  answer the Member for Changi in respect of capital aid for schools.  I

did say that the main difficulty about giving aid to schools was that such

aided schools normally did not have free unencumbered title to the land on

which the school was built. Because of that, even though approval to  give

aid had been given to schools subject to their being able to produce title

to  the land, they were unable to take on the grant which had already been

allotted  for them. I have already stated that we are attempting to  relax

rules for the granting of aid, but not without conditions as suggested  by

the  Member for Changi. I hope to be able to pass the amended rules  after

which it will prove easier for such aid to be given. On the other hand, it

will  be  noted that if the Ministry had paid out only more than a quarter

of  a  million  dollars for 1961, the balance of the year's allocation  is

being  revoted  so  that  the sum involved will  still  be  available  for

distribution. That is why for subhead 1, we have a total of  $3.3  million

for 1962, which really consists of a $1 million vote for 1962 and a revote

amounting $2.3 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be reduced by $10 in respect of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see here, Sir, only an item - "Contribution to the Development of

happening to Nanyang University?

discuss  it  under "Contribution to Nanyang University" in  the  Estimates.

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question because I have noted in the estimates that in 1961

the  Government  has  not  spent a single cent on the  development  of  the

Singapore  Polytechnic. If you look at the Development Estimates for  1961,

on  page 530, the vote is $778,930 for the year 1961. But not a single cent

of that amount has been spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that in the Five-Year Plan, it was stated that the

Government  wanted  to train people. There is a scheme for  training  local

people. But the Government has not spent a single cent on this. I hope  the

Minister concerned can explain to us about this question.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Havelock will look at the 1961 Estimates,

$778,930  appears  to be for Phase I, whereas the 1962  Estimates  are  for

Phases II and III. Perhaps he has not noticed that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have overlooked the

figures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> In that case, I withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member withdraws his comments on the $778,930, is that

right?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is on the second point. The Member for Havelock

has another point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Government has

fulfilled the Phase I project, then I will speak on other  items.  I

wish to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4). Dr Lee Siew Choh.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My colleague will be moving.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low Por Tuck.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this item, the provision is for Equipment for Technical

Schools.  I  have  noticed that on page 530 of the  1961  Development

Estimates,  we approved $556,880 for equipment for technical  schools

under  five  items. But in the 1962 Development Estimates, Queenstown

Secondary  School  is to spend $48,000, and Tanjong Katong  Secondary

School  is  to spend $53,070. But the other schools do  not  spend  a

single  cent. On the other hand, for Queenstown Secondary  School  we

have allocated $128,000, and for Tanjong Katong Secondary School, the

sum allocated is $128,880. But the sum already spent is only $53,070.

On  Queenstown Secondary School, it has spent only $48,000.  In  this

connection, I would ask the Minister why the provision has  not  been

spent.  In regard to some other schools the provisions are not  going

to  be  spent at all. In certain schools, only a small sum  is  being

spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if the Member for

Havelock,  who  was  formerly  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Finance, is rather anxious to know why the Government is

not spending money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>

fast  enough. He has asked why, after having been provided with  a  sum  of

$128,000  for  two schools - Queenstown Secondary School and  Tanjong  Katong

Secondary  School - we have managed to spend about $50,000,  and,  therefore,

the  balance  of  $75,000-odd has not been spent.  I  thought  I  explained

sometime  back  that Queenstown and Tanjong Katong Secondary  Schools  were

called  technical  schools a few years ago when they  were  opened  by  the

previous  Government. But they were no different from  any  other  ordinary

academic  secondary  school. So it was necessary for us  to  convert  these

schools  into  really  technical schools by purchasing expensive  technical

equipment,  which takes time even after the order has been placed.  Perhaps

it  takes  six  to  eight months before the equipment can arrive.  That  is

partly  the  explanation. It is true that although there is provision  this

year for the purchase of equipment amounting to $100,000 each for the three

technical schools - at Serangoon

Garden Estate, Dunearn Road and Ngee Ann Kongsi - these schools will probably

take  till  the end of 1962 before they will be established. So  I  do  not

think  it is wise to order equipment even before the schools are available.

That  is why we have to provide similar sums for 1962 so that by the  time

these  technical  schools are really in existence  the  equipment  will  be

available to go into the schools for 1963.

<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the reply

given  by the Minister, the three schools, namely, Serangoon Garden Estate

School,  Tanjong Katong School and Ngee Ann Kongsi School,  will  only  be

completed by the end of 1962. But the question is, if it is the case,  why

then  should we in the 1962 Development Estimates provide these provisions

for  these  three  schools, namely, the provision  of  $100,000  for  each

school, since no school is going to be completed within this year?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  debate  on the last item, you were kind enough to  assist  me  by

referring  the  Member for Havelock to another section of the  Development

Estimates. To answer the Member for Havelock, may I request him to be kind

enough  to turn to page 43, at the bottom of the page, where he  will  see

that  work has been going on at the Secondary Technical Schools at Dunearn

Road,  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi and Serangoon Gardens. For  this  year,  $40,000,

$40,000  and  $120,000  respectively have been  spent.  In  1962,  another

$600,000  each will be spent. So that, as I have stated, we hope  to  have

these  schools  ready by the end of 1962. The $100,000-odd  for  equipment

will  have  to  be placed, so that by the time that equipment  arrives  in

Singapore, it can go into the schools and be ready for 1963.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Minister has referred

to  page  43.  If  we look at page 43, these three schools  will  not  be

completed  in 1962, because the estimated expenditure in 1962 is  just  a

part of the original plans for these three schools, and there are sum  of

money required for a further year to complete these three schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It looks as if we will now be discussing not only the 1962 Estimates but also 1963. To really provide a secondary technical

school with full equipment, it will be necessary to have equipment  worth

$150,000. But for the first stage, we think that $100,000 should suffice,

because machines and fitting equipment would amount to $63,000, woodcraft

equipment $20,000, metal craft $11,000, foundry equipment nearly  $7,000,

and  building  equipment $3,000 - a total of $100,000. That  is  the  first

stage. When the workshops have been equipped with this $100,000 worth  of

equipment,  then perhaps we will have to make provision for an additional

$50,000  per  school to make it a really first-class secondary  technical

school.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, withdraw?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same question arises from this item. Last year's Budget

providing furniture and equipment for these three types of schools are: (1)

Primary  schools  $25,000, but $22,000 has been  spent;  (2)  Post  Primary

Schools $243,000 voted for this year's expenditure, but not a cent has been

spent;  and (3) Secondary Schools, $822,100 was provided, but only  $47,600

has  been  spent. Can the Minister kindly explain to us why all this  money

has not been spent?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it will not be necessary

really to answer the first part of the question - Primary Schools' allocation

$25,000  and  only $22,000 has been spent. As regards the item  of  $243,000

meant for furniture and equipment for post primary schools, may I say  that

Government  wants to be careful with its expenditure, and not just  because

there  is  a vote, therefore, we should spend it wildly. The Commission  of

Inquiry's  Report  on  Vocational and Technical Education  which  has  been

tabled  in  the Assembly does give an indication of the repercussions  that

will take place in the education system of Singapore Whereby it is intended

that one half of primary school leavers would be given vocational education

in  secondary schools; so that for the time being, although we  call  these

schools post primary schools, this is only a transitional arrangement. When

the Government publishes its White Paper to indicate how far it is prepared

to  accept  the recommendations of this Commission of Inquiry's Report,  we

will  be  in  a position to go full steam ahead. That is why for  the  post

primary schools - or to be more up to date, the secondary vocational schools - we  shall not actually spend the sum of $243,000 until we have decided  how

far  we  are prepared to purchase the equipment for these schools  for  the

future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the furniture and equipment for secondary schools this year,

where there was a vote of $822,000 and only $47,000 has been spent, here

again  the building programme has not progressed as fast as we had hoped,

and  unless there are new secondary schools available for which we  would

have  to supply furniture and equipment, there is no reason why we should

just  use the money to buy furniture and equipment and keep it in storage

until the buildings are available. So we may as well defer spending  this

money  and  push it on to next year when, as the Member for  Havelock  is

aware,  we  will have reached a stage where the Government is practically

opening  one new school every month. So I think late in 1962, I hope  the

Member  for Havelock will not complain that the Ministry of Education  is

spending money too quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one small point that I have

left out. That is in the 1961 budget, on page 530, there is under subhead

5,  item  (4),  the Teachers' Training College. It seems that  this  item

provided for a vote of $37,000 for the Teachers' Training College, but  I

could not find it in the 1962 Budget. Can the Minister be kind enough  to

point out where it is, and is it the intention of the Government to scrap

this item?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have you solved the mystery, Mr Yong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is like trying to

look  for a needle in the haystack. I shall try and find it and  let  the

Member for Havelock know later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I withdraw.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be reduced by $10 in respect

of item (1) of subhead 6.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this item, that is, the Singapore Polytechnic, in the estimate for

1961, a provision of about $1 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>

was  allocated to the Singapore Polytechnic for its expansion, but  in  the

result,  only $300,000 has been spent. So I hope the Minister will give  an

explanation  for this. That is my first point. Since the Government  is  em

phasising the raising of the standard of technical education of the  people

of  Singapore, how much work has the Government done in this respect? It is

useless  to talk about how to raise the standard and how to train technical

personnel and not do anything about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, Phase I - Workshop building at the Singapore

Polytechnic - it would appear that, according to the Public Works Department,

this workshop will not be completed until well into 1962. They have spent a

sum of $300,000, and therefore .there is this revote of $700,000 to make it

a full $1 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question raised by 1h Member for Havelock regarding the

training  of  technical  staff,  the  lack  of  technical  staff  and  what

Government proposes to do to remedy this deficiency, Sir, this is a  world-wide problem. Every country is seeking the services of technical men and it

takes  time to train people to become technical men. I suppose we  have  to

try  somehow to make do; exhaust all possibilities; sometimes import people

from outside. I suppose we have to consider paying them reasonable salaries

to  attract them to work in this country and just make the best we  can  in

the circumstances.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are raising, this

question  because  the  Government is always saying that  the  shortage  of

technical  personnel is a world-wide problem in order to evade the  answer.

This is not enough. The main thing is that we must make efforts to overcome

this  problem.  If  all  the time we say there is a shortage  of  technical

personnel and scientists and it is a world-wide problem, it is no  solution

to  the  question itself. But at least we must do something about it.  From

these Development Estimates we can see that the Government is not doing its

part well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sure the Government, of which the Member for

Havelock  was  a  member  until recently, will be  very  pleased  to  hear

constructive proposals from the Member for Havelock as to how to meet this

situation. If he can put up proposals, we will be very glad to  take  heed

of them and even adopt them.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard

my colleague, the Member for Havelock, asking the Minister for Education a

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $1 million provided, the Government has spent only $300,000. Now

what  we are concerned about is whether the number of new students  to  be

recruited for the technical schools next year will be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point we are concerned about is whether the students who have

passed out can meet the requirements in the practical field. If we do  not

have  a  good workshop, then I believe that the students passing out  will

not  be  able to meet the requirements in the technical field.  Since  the

Government has a provision of $1 million, it already has a good plan. That

is why it is shown in these Estimates for the approval of the House. It is

up to the Government to have a plan and the Member for Havelock should not

have  been  asked  to  make proposals. If the hon.  Member  were  to  make

proposals, the Government may say, "The proposals suggested by the  Member

are  not  the  same as those we have in mind." So I feel that  it  is  the

responsibility  of the Ministry of Education to find a way  to  build  the

workshop  as  soon  as  possible in order to help  ease  the  shortage  of

technical  personnel. We know that technical schools are  very  important.

The  establishment  of the Singapore Polytechnic is also  very  important.

That is the main reason why the question has been raised by the Member for

Havelock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want the Minister to assure us that this workshop will be completed

as scheduled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it is surprising how people on the Barisan

Sosialis side expect things to be done by just waving a magic wand. Perhaps

we  may  explain to the Member for Choa Chu Kang that when we rear poultry,

the  laying  of  eggs is not done overnight. It takes  time  to  put  up  a

building or a workshop. You do not just stand up and shout. Plans  have  to

be  drawn up and it takes months to do the necessary things. It is not just

like erecting an attap shed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Minister that it is not as easy as laying eggs. I know that it takes  time.

But  if  the Government expects 10,000 eggs to be laid next year,  then  it

should  ensure that it has the right number of egg-layers for the  required

number of eggs. Now if you have a plan but you do not carry it out,  it  is

useless. What is the point of having figures!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel that the Minister's reply is not sincere. In all sincerity, we

have  raised  this question in the hope that the Government  will  complete

this  work  as  scheduled.  We are not trying  to  be  difficult  with  the

Government. We only hope that Government will try to do the work as soon as

possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister

for Education gave a reply which was very discouraging and disappointing to

me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his logic, the blue book of the Minister for Finance is

useless. It would seem that the Development Plan contained in the blue book

of  the  Minister for Finance- is just a plan. Time is required to  do  the

work.  So that means, according to the logic of the Minister for Education,

that the 1961-1964 Development Plan will not be completed until 1971.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not think we need any lessons on logic from

Members of the Barisan Sosialis. They can reserve all such lessons on logic

for themselves. But I say, as regards the development performance by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  of Education, the test is this. Is it providing enough  schools

for  students  who  want to go to school? I say that the  performance  in

regard  to development expenditure by the Ministry of Education has  been

eminently satisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing the Development Plan for the Ministry of Education, we had to

work  on  past  lessons  to a great extent because  this  Plan  had  been

prepared  for  some  time.  What  happened  was  this.  When  the  P.A.P.

Government came into power, the long-term scheme for school building  was

at that time already several years in arrears.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are talking about the Singapore Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, schools in general. Both the Member for Havelock

and  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang were making the point that,, generally

speaking,  there  was under fulfilment of the development  plans  of  the

Ministry  of  Education. I was just making a reply to rebut this  general

statement.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think now we had better concentrate on the Singapore

Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As you wish, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, we were talking about the building of schools. Under item (1),

the land required for 1960 Schools was estimated at a cost of $364,200. I

wonder  how the expenditure for this year has been put to use. As regards

the  land  required for 1961 Schools, the Government  has  only  spent  a

quarter  of  the  provision. In the case of the 1962, schools,  there  is

nothing much to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter cannot be camouflaged by a very

beautiful  blue book or by empty talk which may appear to be  interesting.

But  in  actual  fact,  as  regards  the  building  of  schools  and  land

acquisition, the Government has not gone all out to carry out  its  duties

and plans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not speaking on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think it is getting somewhat monotonous to hear the

Member for Havelock on the same old refrain about our having been provided

with  money  and  not having used it to purchase land. I suppose  what  he

wants  to  see is some sort of land grabbing - here is the money,  just  buy

every  vacant  piece  of land available and say you  want  to  build  your

schools. The idea of making a provision is that if you can do it, you have

the  money  and  the means to purchase land, plans can be  drawn  and  the

buildings can be erected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not see how I can go on answering the Member for Havelock if he keeps on asking the same questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards the pro

vision  of  money,  we know there is no question about  it.  In  the  1961

Development Estimates, we have already approved a great sum for the Government to carry out its work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the plan, the Minister for Finance says that he already has a

plan  but that he has not carried it out yet. So what is the point of  the

Minister for Education talking about money and plans? We already have  the

plans  and the money. How is it that the plans have not been carried  out?

The Minister cannot evade his responsibility by making excuses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the Member for

Havelock  is  really  complaining about. I only said that  the  development

performance  by the Ministry of Education was quite adequate. I  explained

in my Budget Statement that schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>

completed this year would give places to more than 10,000 new pupils,  and

those  schools to be completed shortly would give places to another 10,000

pupils.  So long as the completion of school buildings can keep pace  with

the  demand  for new places, I would say that the responsibility  of   the

Ministry of Education has been fully discharged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, all this goes to show that the

Government  has not carried out its development plan. In the case  of  the

Ministry  of  Education, an examination will show that the  plan  for  the

building of schools in 1960 was not carried out.. The development plan  on

education  has consumed only less than 30 per cent of the estimate.  That

is why I am pointing out that the Government has not done enough. There is

no point in talking about propaganda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1962, we have facts and figures and we can tell from them that in

the  course  of  the last 2½ years, the Government has not done  anything

about the Development Plan. If we carefully review the whole situation in

the  light of the 1962 Estimates, then more than half of the work has not

been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been accused of repeating the same questions.

I  have done so because I want it to be known that the Government has  not

discharged its duty with regard to the Development, Plan. We have  given

the  money  to  the  Government but it is clear that it  has    not  done

anything.  If  anybody looks at the Development Estimates carefully,  this

state  of  affairs  cannot  be denied. We are  not  trying  to  carry  out

propaganda  work. It is all very obvious. The facts and  figures  are  in

the  Estimates. The Minister for Finance is a Doctor of Economics and  I

was nothing but a middle school student; therefore, it can be said that  I

do  not know very much about these things. This has been the attitude of

the  Government all along. If the Government had accepted the views of the

people,  then it would not have been in its present position with only  26

Members in the Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

of item (1) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these two items concern the construction of bridges.

According  to  the  Development  Estimates,  the  House  has   approved

$1,500,000. Can the Minister for National Development explain why there

has been a delay in the work and whether it can be started this year?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be reduced by $10 in

respect of item (1) of subhead 1."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over item (2) of subhead 1*, i.e. two bridges:

Bukit Timah and Adam Road, and Jambatan Merah. Mr Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, which also stood in the name of Mr A. P. Rajah, reads as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be reduced by $10 in

respect of item (2) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I move it, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I think the problems

involved from my point of view are different.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well then, we will reserve that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, for Head

D58, subhead 1, item (1) - Bukit Timah and Adam Road - the provision is for

the  construction  of five bridges; three bridges  across  Bukit  Timah

Canal,  and two across Adam Road. The three bridges across Bukit  Timah

Canal are required to provide crossings at suitable intervals when  the

one-way traffic system at both Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road is put

into effect. Bridges of 40 ft. span will be built similar to the one at

the  6th milestone. Plans for the work are nearing completion, and  the

work will be put in hand as soon as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other two bridges at Adam Road, they are to carry a

traffic  island  along Adam Road and Farrer Road joining Dunearn  Road  and

Bukit  Timah  Road.  These  projects are to be deferred  for  the  present,

pending finalisation of the Bukit Timah flood alleviation scheme. There  is

now  an  alternative proposal for this - to turn the flood  waters  of  Bukit

Timah  Canal  across  to Ulu Pandan at the 6½ milestone.  It  will  not  be

necessary  to  construct  this  project at Adam  Road  if  the  alternative

proposal for flood alleviation in Bukit Timah is implemented, and,  instead

of bridges, possibly a culvert will be built at a very much reduced cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the same Head, I have also given notice of an

amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (4) of subhead 26,

<br><br>which  is  shown  in  page 55 of the Development Estimates - Jambatan  Merah

Gyratory System (Thomson/ Norfolk/Kampong Java Roads). Mr Speaker, may  I

speak on that too, as I think they are linked together?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a very great need to introduce a

gyratory  system at that particular junction. If one gets to  that  point,

Sir,  at,  say, between half-past seven and eight o'clock in the  morning,

there  is  absolute pandemonium there. The whole system of roads there  is

such  that  it is very difficult to control traffic. Unless  one  has  two

traffic policemen spaced at, I think, literally 20 yards, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>

Speaker,  Sir, it is just impossible to do anything with the  traffic  in

that  area. The roads in that area have been built up in such a way  that

with the housing development along Thomson Road (Sembawang Hills Estate),

that  road  carries  a lot of traffic. Just when it  is  about  time  for

school,  it is impossible to do anything about that place unless one  has

two or three traffic policemen controlling two or three points - one on one

side of the bridge, the other on the other side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Government's suggestion to improve Jambatan Merah in

1962 - the  vote is $180,000. But I do suggest to the Government  that  the

problem  of  the  expansion of the bridge is intimately linked  with  the

gyratory  system at that place. It seems pointless to expand  the  bridge

without  doing something about the gyratory system. I do ask the Minister

to  consider  the  widening of Jambatan Merah  in  conjunction  with  the

installation  of  a gyratory system at that place. Just  to  enlarge  the

bridge without doing something about the gyratory system is, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I think a waste of time and money. So I do ask the Minister whether

he  will give consideration to the construction at Jambatan Merah in 1962

for the sum allocated and ask his officers whether they will not propound

a  scheme for the gyratory system at Thomson/Norfolk/Kampong Java  Roads.

If  the  Minister  will look at some of the old files  of  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust, I think he will find plans in connection with this.  I

am aware of these plans.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be reduced by $10 in respect

of item (2) of subhead 1."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated, the debate may range over item (4) of subhead 26 at page 55.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member for Farrer Park that in

this  area - Jambatan  Merah - traffic is almost at a standstill  during  the

busy  hours,  and traffic policemen have to be stationed there  at  these

hours to ease the flow of traffic. The provision under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>

subhead  1,  item (2) is to build a new bridge. This new bridge  is  to  be

part  of  a  proposed  gyratory system at the very  congested  junction  of

Thomson  Road,  Kampong  Java Road, Keng Lee Road, and  Norfolk  Road.  The

proposal  includes  two traffic islands and a central dividing  strip.  The

existing  bridge  will carry traffic going north, and the new  bridge  will

carry  traffic travelling in a southerly direction. Work on the bridge  has

already started and the contract is due for completion on 5th September, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards item (4) of subhead 26, this is a provision to build road

works. Road works will commence when all the bridges are completed in 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am happy to hear the explanation, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have

just  one other request for the Minister. After this new bridge at Jambatan

Merah  has been erected, I do hope that the officials in charge of erecting

and  painting  this  bridge will paint it red. Because the  name  for  that

bridge in that locality, Mr Speaker, Sir - and I know it as it is in my ward - has  always been Jambatan Merah. Once upon a time there was a move  in  the

City  Council  to  paint ft green, Mr Speaker, Sir, and the  City  Council

stopped it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, this bridge will definitely be painted red,

otherwise it will not be called Jambatan Merah.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we see that from the Development Plan of the Govern

ment  that  only  about  33  per cent of its  provision  has  been  used,

particularly in respect of the P.W.D. where only some work has been done.

The  other  point  I  want  to raise is that the  Minister  for  National

Development must take note that all construction work, especially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>

flood alleviation works, must be considered in respect of the interests of

the people's livelihood. But the P. W. D.

seems  to  be  more  concerned with air conditioners and air  conditioning

plants.  But  this is of minor importance. What we want is to give  better

benefits to more people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on the general principle is, to range over item (3) of subhead

11, item (7) of subhead 11, item (6) of subhead  12,  and item (7) of subhead 12. The general principle is  that  not

enough of drainage work has been carried out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will use the same

words. I say the same thing to the Minister concerned. That is to say,  in

the  1961  Budget,  there  was such a provision  for  this  use,  but  the

Government has not made use of it. For instance, there was $200,000  voted

for certain items. For Geylang Serai, there was a

provision  of  $800,000. At Circular Road, $20,000 has been  provided  for

flood alleviation work. But then only $10,000 was spent. And this sum  was

spent  only during the Hong Lim by-election. When the P.A.P. was defeated,

the  remaining work to the value of $15,000 was not carried  out.  It  was

cancelled.  If I were to enumerate every item; then this would  dishearten

everybody,  because this will only show that the Government has  not  done

its work well.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is all on the point that the Government has not enough

of work. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Havelock was for

nearly two years my Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is something!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If he had, during his two years, bothered to learn the

simple  elements of financial procedure, he would not have drawn inferences

from  the  Estimates in the way that he did. The fact that the whole  of  a

certain vote has not been spent in that year is no indication at all  about

the  state  of  completion  of this particular work.  For  one  thing,  the

financial  accounts  had not been closed at the time these  Estimates  were

prepared. A lot of the figures entered there were very likely in the nature

of  estimates of what the vote condition would be by the end of  the  year.

Before  we  could  draw  any  inference  from  any  particular  development

expenditure, we must take into account the amount revoted. I have  gene  to

great lengths to explain that development expenditure is less easy to  fore

cast  in  advance than ordinary estimates, because the date  of  completion

cannot  be estimated so accurately in advance. It depends on how you deploy

your  engineers; how quickly tenders are put out; and how fast the work  is

completed.  Sometimes work is held up because of the weather. Sometimes  it

is  because  the  originating Ministries or departments put in  last-minute

changes in designs and so forth. Therefore, merely to draw an inference, as

the  Member for Havelock has been doing during the whole of the  two  days'

debate  on the Estimates, from the figure put in under the amount estimated

to  be  spent in 1961, is completely erroneous. Anyone with a knowledge  of

the  simple  elements of financial procedure will know that the  Member  is

just doing the wrong thing, a thing he would not have done if he had learnt

his job properly when he was Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (3) of subhead 14.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these five items are all about flood alleviation

schemes.  In 1961 the Government asked the House to approve $3  million  on

these  flood  alleviation  schemes.  But  the  Government  has  only  spent

$1,400,000  on  these  schemes. Mr Speaker, Sir, the flood  situation  has

become more and more serious in Singapore. At present we in Singapore  have

water  rationing.  But  when there is a little  rainfall  many  places  are

flooded. Perhaps when your car comes from Bukit Timah, it will not be  able

to pass certain areas because of the flood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Government must double its efforts to carry

out  these flood alleviation schemes, because if there are no such  schemes

there are many farmers and people whose property will be swept away by  the

floods.  Therefore, I hope the Government will expedite  its  efforts  this

year  to  carry out this work so as to alleviate or stop the flooding,  and

thus  prevent loss of property. Their livelihood will be protected and they

will not suffer any loss.

connection  with  the  farming  areas. In  fact,  as  far  as  the  flood

alleviation  schemes are concerned, when , they are major schemes,  plans

have to be made. In the case of the Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme,

as  I  mentioned just now, an alternative scheme has been devised.  Under

the  new  proposal, the water of the Bukit Timah Canal will be  diverted.

Instead of allowing it to come down to the city, it is now to be diverted

at the 6½ milestone to the Ulu Pandan Canal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> When will that be built?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> You can ask that question later on.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have enough of questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> About the Geylang Flood Alleviation Scheme, we have met

with some snap speakers. This area, in which a flood canal will be dug from

a  point south of Airport Road to Geylang Serai and connecting finally with

Geylang River near Geylang Road, is a very congested area, and negotiations

will  have  to take place to move out the settlers. It will take some  time

before the plan could be carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another flood alleviation scheme in which we have to do some

concrete  lining of the Geylang River. Part of this has been  finished  and

the  other part will be done next year. In the Nelson Road/Radin Mas  area,

the  first part of the scheme was completed in 1960. The second part of the

work  was  started in April this year and will be completed  in  June  next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government took office in 1959, it has been paying attention to

flood  alleviation, and in various areas flooding is a matter of the  past.

For  instance, Sir, in the Kampong Bahru area two big canals have been dug,

costing over $1 million. Work has been completed and flooding is no  longer

a  curse  there.  In  Orchard Road and Scotts Road, the  flood  alleviation

scheme  has been finalised and there is no longer any flooding. In  certain

parts  of Geylang Serai or Geylang area and Aljunied, the flood alleviation

scheme  has been carried out and such areas are no longer flooded. I cannot

see  why  Members  opposite  should worry about  Government  pursuing  this

subject. We will do all we can to accomplish this scheme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can we ask the Minister when the flooding at Bukit

Timah and along Dunearn Road will be alleviated?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Minister for National Development answer that? Mr

Minister for Finance, can you answer that?

<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was wondering whether the Member for Queenstown has

bought or is contemplating buying properties in this area. [Laughter]
