<div align="center"><b>(Issue of Defence Bonds)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether the Government will  consider  the

issue  of  Defence Bonds to obtain loans  from  the

private  sector to meet the additional  expenditure

for defence.

offering $75 million in loans of varying maturities

and  on attractive terms. Part of the proceeds will

go  to meet our mounting defence costs. In view  of

the  current loan offer, no purpose would be served

by  an  issue of Defence Bonds now, though an issue

may  be considered at an appropriate moment in  the

future.

<div align="center"><b>EXPORT CREDIT INSURANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Establishment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  the  Government  has  decided  to

proceed  with  the setting up of the Export  Credit

Insurance Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in May 1967, the Government

appointed    a   Working   Party   consisting    of

representatives  of  banks,  insurance   companies,

manufacturers and the Ministry of Finance to report

on  the  feasibility of an Export Credit  Insurance

Scheme.  The Working Party submitted its report  in

May 1968.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Working Party's Report is now under

consideration. No decision has yet been arrived  at

as  to  whether  an Export Credit Insurance  Scheme

should be introduced in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>LOCALLY-PRODUCED GOODS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Regulation of standard)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   whether  he  will  consider  setting   up

machinery  to  regulate the  standard  of  locally-produced   goods,   so  that   they   can   compete

successfully with foreign goods in the overseas and

local markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government exercises

continuous vigilance over the quality of industrial

products.  The  Industrial  Research  Unit  of  the

Economic  Development Board, which is a  member  of

the  International Standards Organisation, provides

a  wide range of information on major international

standards and has facilities for testing  to  these

standards.  Local manufacturers are  encouraged  to

make maximum use of these facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to standards. One of these

is  to  ensure protection of consumers particularly

in  matters  of  food products,  drugs  and  safety

equipment.  In  these matters,  there  is  existing

machinery for quality control, for example, control

over    quality   specifications   for   monosodium

glutamate (commonly known as gourmet's powder)  and

the  compulsory  testing of safety helmets  and  of

flourescent lamp ballast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is that of quality excellence.

This  depends  on  the  aims  of  manufacturers  to

achieve  the highest quality possible in excellence

regardless  of the minimum standards acceptable  to

others. Thus, the standards imposed upon themselves

by  certain  companies have  come  to  be  accepted

internationally as household words for  excellence,

such  as "Rolls Royce" quality. Such high standards

cannot  be  legislated for but must be desired  and

worked towards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful competition does not depend on this

alone.  Appropriate price, quality value  for  that

price  and assurance that this quality is regularly

met,  are  important.  Promptness  in  delivery  is

equally  important.  But even  more  important  for

success at home and abroad is aggressive marketing.

This  demands extreme alertness to changing  market

conditions  and  to  consumer  tastes,  a  constant

search for new markets and dynamism and courage  in

the capture of such markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's pre-eminence as a trading centre now

rapidly moving towards industrialisation gives us a

wide  market  and  equally  wide  opportunities  to

satisfy  a wide range of demands both in price  and

quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the same qualities of flexibility, agility

and  dynamism with which our trading community  has

succeeded in the past to adjust to changing trading

patterns,  there  is no reason why  our  industrial

community   cannot  also  succeed   with   made-in-Singapore goods locally and in export markets.

<div align="center"><b>TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TRAINING CENTRES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Provision for unemployed school certificate holders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  the  Government  will  consider

setting  up  a  special  Technical  and  Vocational

Training  Centre  to train those School-Certificate

holders who are unemployed, so as to enable them to

find jobs in the industrial or commercial sector.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of

Education  is  considering the establishment  of  a

National Technical Institute which will train trade

technicians who require more craft and manipulative

skills rather than an extensive knowledge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



of  science  and  technology. This  institute  will

provide  special  courses  for  School  Certificate

holders from the general education stream who  wish

to be trained for blue-collar jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, two new Vocational Institutes and a

number  of  Industrial  Training  Centres  will  be

established   in  1969.  These  institutions   will

increase further the intake of students who wish to

pursue  technical education and training programmes

to  fit themselves for employment in the industrial

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board is also reorganising some

of   its  courses  to  give  greater  emphasis   on

technical,  industrial and commercial  subjects  in

their evening classes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL INSPECTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Courses by visiting inspectors from U.K.)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) what courses had been  conducted  by

the  two  visiting Inspectors of Schools  from  the

British Ministry of Education during their visit to

Singapore  recently; (b) whether they had submitted

a  report  and recommendations to him; (c) whether,

as  a  result of the report and recommendations,  a

reorganisation of the Inspectorate of the  Ministry

is  intended;  and (d) what is the  nature  of  the

reorganisation intended.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the two visiting

Inspectors  of  Schools from  the  United  Kingdom,

whose  services were made available by the  British

Government   at   the  request  of  the   Singapore

Government, were asked to conduct courses on school

inspection  and  supervision of  teaching  for  our

Inspectors  and T.T.C. supervisors, and courses  on

school  administration  for primary  and  secondary

school  principals. Altogether  four  such  courses

were  conducted between 1st April, 1968,  and  18th

May,   1968.  Each  course  comprised  20  one-hour

lectures  and  each  lecture  was  followed  by   a

discussion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference of the two visiting

inspectors did not call for a report. However, they

did  submit a 20-page report entitled A  Report  on

Education  in  Singapore  at  the  end   of   their

assignment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intention of reorganising the

Inspectorate as a result of this report.

<div align="center"><b>(Administrative work)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  what administrative work is required  of

(a) a head of school; and (b) a teacher.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect to

the  Member for Serangoon Gardens, I must point out

that   it   is  not  possible  to  list   all   the

administrative  duties of a school principal,  just

as  it is impossible to make an exhaustive list  of

the  work  expected of a Member of  Parliament.  In

general  terms,  I would say that  a  principal  is

expected to do whatever is necessary to ensure that

his school functions efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, a teacher is expected to carry out

administrative duties related to the administration

of   his   own   class   and  the  extra-curricular

activities of which he is in charge.

allegations  were against advertising  agencies  or

the employees of advertising agencies; and (d) what

action   was   taken  in  connection   with   these

complaints and allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, between 1st

January and 15th July, 1968, only one complaint was

made to the police of an alleged offence under  the

<div align="center"><b>OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Inche Rahmat bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Culture whether the Government will consider taking

more stringent measures to curb the publication  of

obscene  articles in certain books,  magazines  and

newspapers, as such publications are detrimental to

the minds and morals of our youths.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin) (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the measures

currently  taken  by  the Ministry  of  Culture  to

control  obscene publications printed  locally  are

sufficiently  stringent. All  publications  printed

locally  require  a permit from my Ministry  before

printing   is   allowed.  In  issuing   a   permit,

sufficient  attention has been paid to ensure  that

the   publications   conform   to   the   generally

acceptable standards of decency and decorum.  If  a

publisher,  having obtained the permit, resorts  to

sexy  or  obscene articles or photographs to  boost

sales,  he is either warned and in the more  severe

cases   his  permit  under  the  Printing   Presses

Ordinance is revoked or suspended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai perhaps refers to

obscene  articles in certain books,  magazines  and

newspapers.  It is possible that such articles  can

be  found  in periodicals smuggled into  Singapore.

Publications  imported  regularly  are  subject  to

close   scrutiny   in  the  same   way   as   local

publications  before importation  is  allowed.  But

Singapore     is    a    telecommunications     and

transportation centre in the Far East and is one of

the  greatest sea-ports and airports in the  world.

As such, the volume of goods and people entering or

passing  through Singapore is enormous. Under  such

circumstances,  it  is possible that  some  obscene

periodicals have been smuggled into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that some booksellers and

magazine vendors in the Republic are more conscious

of profits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



derived   from  purveying  filth  rather  than   in

protecting the morals of our people, especially  of

our  young.  The Ministry of Culture in  close  co-operation with the police, frequently conduct raids

on  notorious bookshops and book-stalls, and owners

or   possessors   of   obscene   publications   are

prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But raids and suppression of obscene periodicals

are   only  one  aspect  of  the  problem.  A  more

effective answer is to be found in the education of

our  young people to the basic values of a sane and

healthy society.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, why has the Ministry of

Culture  so  far  allowed obscene  articles  to  be

printed in the Mingguan Malaysia which is published

weekly  when these articles are detrimental to  the

minds  and  morals of our youths? I  have  received

complaints  from  the residents of  Geylang  Serai,

some of whom have come to me with cuttings from the

newspaper.  I have with me here newspaper  cuttings

from issues for over six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You appear to be going beyond the

bounds   of  a  supplementary  question.  Can   you

indicate what your supplementary question  is?  You

seem to have made a speech instead. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  not satisfied with the  reply  of  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  that  his   Ministry   is

looking after this matter. If, as the Parliamentary

Secretary  says,  the matter has been  looked  into

very  strictly,  why  is it that  articles  in  the

weekly  Mingguan Malaysia contain obscene pictures?

I  have with me here pictures in this paper of  men

and  women in compromising positions? I bring  this

up  for the information of Members. It I may  quote

here ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the hon.

Member's supplementary question is: is the Minister

for   Culture  prepared  to  take  action  on  such

publications?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Yes. Will the

Parliamentary Secretary state whether he has looked

into  this matter and, if so, why such articles  in

the  Mingguan  Malaysia are  still  allowed  to  be

printed?



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, it must be admitted that there are a number of

local   magazines,  as  well  as  certain   foreign

newspapers,  which  indulge  in  the  printing   of

obscene  articles with the aim of sexually arousing

their   readers.  They  belong  to   a   class   of

irresponsible  publishers and book-sellers  who  do

have  neither a sense of responsibility nor a  high

standard of moral conduct. I agree with the  Member

for  Geylang Serai that such obscene articles  are,

in fact, detrimental to the minds and morals of our

youth.  Equally,  they undermine  the  Government's

efforts in building a vigorous and robust society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that the Mingguan

Malaysia has continued to publish such articles,  I

wish to assure the House that the Mingguan Malaysia

has  already been warned on two occasions to  cease

printing  obscene pictures. I also wish  to  assure

the  House  that the Ministry of Culture has  given

ample   warning  to  those  responsible   for   the

publication  of those newspapers and  magazines  to

desist   from   publishing  and  circulating   such

unhealthy literature in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government believes in

persuasion. However, when this method fails to have

the  desired  effect, may I assure the  Member  for

Geylang  Serai  that severe action  will  he  taken

against  unscrupulous publishers and  book-sellers.

Stringent measures must be taken to prevent the few

irresponsible  persons from  exploiting  the  young

people who form a large section of our population.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



whether he is aware that unpleasant  odour

from  the sewerage disposal works at Kim Chuan Road

is  affecting  the atmosphere around the  Singapore

International Airport, and whether and  what  steps

will be taken to eliminate or minimise the odour so

as not to give a bad impression of Singapore to new

arrivals.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, occasionally

an unpleasant odour comes from the sewage treatment

works  at  Kim  Chuan Road. Though unpleasant,  the

odour  is  certainly not harmful nor  injurious  to

health. The smell is caused by the treatment  works

being  heavily  overloaded  because  of  increasing

development in the eastern sector of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new extensions to the treatment

works,  costing about $13 million, are now  nearing

completion  and  when the new units  are  fully  in

operation, the incidence of this nuisance  will  be

greatly reduced, if not completely abated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will mention here that the

treatment  works were first built in 1940  and  the

Airport was built more than 20 years later, in  the

1960s.

<div align="center"><b>OF SINGAPORE, 1967</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  set  out  the  views of the Government  on  the

Report  of  the Salaries Commission  which  is  now

tabled  before  Parliament. The Government  accepts

most  of  the  principal  recommendations  of   the

Commission.   It   also   accepts   most   of   the

recommendations  in  regard  to  less   significant

matters. But before I set out the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



Government's  position  in  detail  in  regard   to

recommendations of the Commission, may I first deal

with  the  general  background  against  which  the

recommendations   of  the  Commission   have   been

considered by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is clear that the present time is not

the  appropriate  moment  to  introduce  a  general

increase   of  emoluments  payable  to  the   civil

service.  Nor  has the Commission attempted  to  do

this  except for Division I posts. There are  grave

problems  ahead  for all of us following  upon  the

withdrawal of the British military presence planned

for  the  end  of 1971. My colleagues  and  I  have

commented  on this subject on innumerable occasions

in  the past, but because of the crucial nature and

the  magnitude  of these problems, they  will  bear

repetition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first impact of British military withdrawal

will  be  a  substantial increase in the volume  of

unemployment. This is known to everybody, but  what

has  not  been emphasised is that it is not  merely

the  number  of unemployed that will go  up.  There

will  also  be  a change in the nature  of  persons

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the bulk of unemployed - in fact, more

than three-quarters - are teenagers or youths of 20

or  21  looking for their first jobs. It cannot  be

said  that  extensive unemployment among  teenagers

and  youths,  however regrettable it  may  be  from

other  viewpoints, imposes acute hardship on  these

unemployed,  for  they will be  living  with  their

parents  and  at  least  will  have  their  regular

supplies  of  the  necessities  of  life  -   food,

clothing, shelter and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of unemployment of laid-off base

workers, the majority will be the prinicipal bread-winners  of  their families. Prolonged unemployment

will  cause  distress not only to  the  unemployed;

such  distress  will  extend to  their  dependants,

including, of course, their children. This gives  a

new twist to the problem of unemployment, grave and

difficult though it already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



is. In recognition of this fact, the Government has

introduced  legislation whereby lump  sum  benefits

payable  to  laid-off workers will be paid  into  a

Central  Fund from which monthly payments  will  be

made  to  ensure that the imprudent do not squander

the  capital sum in a spending spree. But these are

palliatives. The solution is to get them  new  jobs

and if need be, to train them for new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the steps which Government

is  taking in various fields to meet this challenge

to  our  economic stability. I need only  emphasise

what my colleagues and I have been saying all these

months.  The  crucial years ahead will demand  from

everyone a considerable degree of exertion and even

sacrifice. It will be a long and difficult  period,

but  if we can see through the years up to 1973  or

1974, with our economy on an even keel, we can then

look   forward  to  a  resurgence  of  growth   and

prosperity after that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These difficulties were not foreseen in 1967 when

the Commission under the chairmanship of Mr G.  J.

Harvey entered into their lengthy deliberations  on

the  salary structure and conditions of service  in

the  civil service. This, of course, was not  their

fault, but nevertheless their recommendations  must

be    considered   in   the   light   of    changed

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and perhaps the most valuable work

of  the  Commission relates to variable allowances.

The  Commission has recommended that the  time  has

arrived   to   abolish  variable  allowances.   The

Commission arrived at this view on the basis of two

considerations.  First, the  permanent  pensionable

pay  of civil servants should be based on long-term

considerations, but in times of instability, it  is

necessary  to  add  a  temporary,  non-pensionable,

addition  to  this pay. Second, wages and  salaries

should  depend on services rendered and not on  the

marital status of the employee. In other words, the

rate for the job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, taking into account the stability

in  the cost of living since 1961, considered  that

retention  of variable allowances is not justified,

nor  should marital status of an officer decide how

much pay he or she should get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the

whole  of variable allowances be consolidated  into

basic  pay.  This  would mean an  increase  in  the

pensionable emoluments of civil servants.  It  will

also  mean  an  increase  in  the  annual  cost  of

pensions which is estimated at $1.3 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation of the

Salaries  Commission. I want to stress that  it  is

not  an  exercise  in general pay increase  but  of

consolidating a temporary allowance into total pay.

The  Salaries  Commission further  recommends  that

officers transfer into the new salary scales on the

basis  of  their present total pay. The  Government

does  not accept this recommendation. No doubt  the

Commission  was moved by considerations of  economy

in  requiring  that  officers of different  marital

status should enter at different points in the  new

salary  scales. The Government is of the view  that

in  this  consolidation exercise, since the purpose

is to remove anomalies arising from marital status,

conversion   should  be  calculated   without   the

limitations  imposed by marital status.  This  will

result  in an increase in total emoluments  payable

to  women officers, bachelors, and married officers

without  children. The additional cost is estimated

at $¼ million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the consolidation exercise, the

Commission  has  streamlined  the  general   salary

structure.  The  number of salary scales  has  been

reduced.  For instance in Division I, the  existing

34  salary  scales have been replaced by six  basic

scales and 22 scales which are segments or parts of

the  basic scales. In Division II, the existing  44

salary scales are replaced by 14 basic scales  plus

13  scales  which are segments or  parts  of  basic

salary scales. A similar tidying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



up  takes  place  in respect of  Division  III  and

Division  IV salary scales. In the case of Division

IV  salary  scales, the process of tidying  up  has

benefited,   perhaps   quite  adventitiously,   the

holders  of a large number of pasts. I shall  refer

to this subject at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the general replacement of

existing scales in the new salary structure subject

to  modifications  in respect of particular  salary

scales with which I will deal in detail when I come

to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission made recommendations in respect of

salaries.  These  recommendations fall  into  three

groups.   First,  the  Commission,  after  weighing

representations made by staff associations or staff

representatives,  recommended increases  in  salary

scales  of  specific posts. Second, the  Commission

recommended a general increase in Division I salary

scales   and  in  all  Superscale  posts  in   that

Division.  Third,  the  Salaries  Commission   drew

attention to the inadequacy of salary scales of the

technical grades, though it made no recommendations

in  this  respect. I will deal with each  group  of

recommendations in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first deals with certain specific salary

scales. These relate to the following: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Medical Ancillary Service and the Nursing Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Library Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Honours and Pass Graduates in the Education Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Guard and Escort Unit, the Airport Auxiliary Police;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Fire service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Medical Ancillary Service,

which  comprises Almoners, Dieticians, Occupational

Therapists  and  Radiographers, the Commission  did

not  consider the Executive Officers salary  scale,

on  which  they are now placed, the right  one  and

recommended an improved scale. The maximum  of  the

recommended salary scale, which is $925 p.m., is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



higher by about $40 than the all-in salary scale at

the  maximum  of the present scale. Similarly,  the

Commission did not consider that the Nurses  salary

scale  should  be  related to the salary  scale  of

Clerical Officers, and also recommended an improved

scale.  In  the case of Nurses the maximum  on  the

scale  is  about  $48  per month  higher  than  the

present  all-in maximum. An increase at the maximum

of  $36 has also been recommended by the Commission

for  Assistant Nurses and Midwives. The  Government

accepts  in  full the recommendations  on  improved

salary  scales  for the Medical Ancillary  Service,

Nurses, Assistant Nurses and Midwives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to accept the improved

gradings  for the posts of the Library  Service  of

Director,  Deputy  Director and Librarian  and  the

improved  salary scales for Higher Library Officers

and   Library  Officers  as  recommended   by   the

Commission.  The salaries payable to the  Director,

Deputy   Director  and  Librarian  will  be   those

appropriate  to  the  grades as recommended,  which

will  be different from that actually shown in  the

Report in view of the decision of Government not to

increase salaries in Division I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that the salary scales

of  Honours  and  Pass graduates in  the  Education

Service be improved. They recommended a new  salary

scale  for each of the grades of graduates  on  the

basis  that  Division  I  salary  scales  will   be

improved. The Government accepts the recommendation

of  the  Salaries  Commission for  improvements  in

salary scales of Honours and Pass graduates in  the

Education  Service relative to the general  run  of

salary  scales. Since Government is  not  accepting

the  recommendation of the Commission for a general

increase   in   Division  I  salary   scales,   the

improvement  in  salary  scales  in  the  Education

Service will take this into account. A differential

of  $150 a month is observed throughout the  length

of  the scales of Honours and Pass graduates in the

Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



Service. For Honours graduates  the  salary

scale will be as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$700x50-800/850x50-l,250/

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,300x50-1,500



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pass graduates the salary scale will be

$550x50-650/700x50-1,150/1,200x50-1,350.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salaries Commission recommends the following

salaries  for  Teachers-in-Training  who  are  Non-Graduates.  For  four  categories  of  Teachers-in-

Training, that is, the School Certificate Teachers-in-Training,     Technical    Teachers-in-Training,

Domestic  Science  Teachers-in-Training  and  Mixed

Farming Teachers-in-Training, for these four grades

they  recommend  a pay of $l90xl0-2l0.  For  Higher

School Certificate Teachers-in-Training $295: $315;

for  Craft  Trainee Teachers-in-Training $335;  for

Teachers-in-Training  with  a  Technician   Diploma

$425: $445: $465. For Trained Teachers, who are Non-graduates,  the  Commission  recommends  a   common

salary  scale of $295x20-335/385x20-505/560x25-660/750x35-925 p.m. into which all non-graduate

trained  teachers would be offered  the  option  to

convert. This new salary scale is based on the  new

Teachers' Training College trained teacher's  scale

with   an   additional  increment.  The  Government

accepts this recommendation. Where teachers  refuse

the  option offered they will be allowed to  remain

on  the  existing salaries with variable  allowance

personal to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is of the view that there should

be  no distinction between members of the rank  and

file  of  the Regular Police Force, the  Guard  and

Escort Unit and the Airport Auxiliary Police Force,

and  recommends  that  the three  Units  should  be

placed  on  the same salary scales and they  should

receive  the  same training. These  recommendations

are  not  accepted. The whole object  of  having  a

Guard  and  Escort Unit is to have a less expensive

force  to  perform  simpler  duties  which  require

simpler  training. The same is true of the  Airport

Auxiliary Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Fire Service, the Commission

recommended that so far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



as  the  subordinate  staff  are  concerned,  i.e.,

Leading Firemen and Firemen, those employed in  the

Singapore  Fire  Brigade and their counterparts  in

the  Airport  Fire Section should be  on  the  same

salary   scale.   The   Government   accepts   this

recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending a review of salary scales by a future

Salaries  Commission,  which  it  recommended,  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court made certain  interim

awards  in respect of outstanding cases before  it.

The awards are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Midwives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Pupil Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $6 p.m. after the first year of training;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Staff Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $12 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Senior Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Timescale Clerks in the Postal and Telecommunications Department: Interim Allowance of $15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Customs Officers:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Customs Officers: Interim Allowance of $10 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Customs Officers: Interim Allowance of $15 p.m. Senior Grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these interim allowances were awarded

pending the establishment of new salary scales  for

the grades concerned by the Salaries Commission, it

is  logical that these allowances should  disappear

as  and when the new salary scales are implemented.

In  respect of Midwives and Timescale Clerks in the

Postal   and  Telecommunications  Department,   the

Commission  made  this clear, when  it  recommended

that  these  officers should transfer  to  the  new

salary  scales  recommended for  them  without  the

addition  of  this interim allowance. Although  the

Commission   is  silent  in  respect   of   Customs

Officers,  it  is logical to infer  that  the  same

principle of conversion should apply to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



Where   officers  prefer  to  retain  the   interim

allowance, they will be permitted to do so but they

will  have  to remain on the unrevised scales  with

variable allowance personal to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission found the present schemes of

service  for the Technical Grades to be  inadequate

and  unsatisfactory and recommended an  examination

and   re-organisation  of  these   services.   This

recommendation is accepted and it is proposed  that

this  review  be conducted by an ad  hoc  Committee

comprising the Deputy Secretary (Establishment)  as

Chairman,    and    representatives    from     the

Telecommunications   Department,    Public    Works

Department and the Broadcasting Department, all  of

whom  should  be technical personnel,  as  members.

This  Committee  could  be  asked  to  examine  and

recommend  a  suitable structure for the  technical

grades and the appropriate salary scales for  these

grades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred a moment ago to Division IV grades.

The Commission considered the existing scales which

have annual increments varying from $2 per month to

$8  per  month  to be unrealistic.  The  Commission

considered  that  increments on the  salary  scales

should  be of meaningful size and in the new scales

for  Division IV, the increments range from  $5  to

$15.  Most  of  the recommended salary  scales  for

Division IV show some increases at the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation of

the Salaries Commission. The Government proposes to

go  further than the Salaries Commission in respect

of  Division  IV salary scales. Hon.  Members  know

that  contributors  to the Central  Provident  Fund

will,  in the course of the next few years, receive

additional    benefits   by   way    of    enhanced

contributions  to  the Fund  by  the  employer.  In

effect,  this  means  that the Government's  daily-rated  workers  as  compared with the  monthly-paid

pensionable   employees   will   enjoy   additional

benefits, which will total 5 per cent of their pay.

Employees of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



private firms contributing to the Central Provident

Fund   will   also  receive  these  benefits.   The

Government considers that pensionable employees  in

Division  IV  salary  scales  and  promotion  posts

attached  to  Division  IV  salary  scales,  should

receive   an   increase   of   approximately   this

proportion,  in instances where the revised  salary

scales have not given these increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the recommendations for general

increase  in  Division  I  salary  scales  and   in

Superscale posts. The Commission reported that  "it

was  the  general view of both private and official

witnesses  that  the current level of  remuneration

and other service conditions relating to Division I

Superscale     Officers,    including     Permanent

Secretaries,  Heads of Departments  and  Specialist

Officers  at  these  levels were  not  sufficiently

competitive in relation to salary and conditions of

service  obtaining  in  the  private  sector".  The

Commission  were satisfied that this  general  view

was  correct,  and  taking all  the  evidence  into

account, they were satisfied that there was a  case

for  an  increase  in the pay of the  higher  civil

servants,  and  recommended  salary  increases  for

officers in the Superscale grades as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade C: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,350 a month to $2,750.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade D: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,170 a month to $2,500



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade E: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,070 a month to $2,350.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade F: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,020 a month to $2,250.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade G: an increase in existing all-in pay of $1,920 a month to $2,150.



<br><br>This represents increases ranging from $230 p.m. to

$400 p.m. at the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission commented that most of the

witnesses who appeared before the Commission stated

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



fringe  benefits, such as free cars, interest-free

loans for certain specific purposes, entertainment

allowances,  etc.,  for  senior  staff  were  more

favourable  in the private sector. The  Commission

had   no   doubt   that   fringe   benefits   were

considerable and attractive in the private sector,

but  felt that the present differences between the

civil  service  and  the private  sector  in  this

matter had to be accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Administrative Service, the

Commission reported as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The evidence we received from the private

sector  on  salary  scales paid  to  their  middle

Executive  Grades  covering  a  wide  variety   of

occupations  indicated that the salaries  paid  to

Administrative Officers in Government  during  the

first  3  years of their career compare favourably

with  those  of their counterparts in the  private

sector,  but  that  thereafter  salaries  in   the

private  sector  are bigger than  those  paid  for

Administrative Service Officers.'



<br><br>Also,  most  witnesses "agreed that industry  and

commerce   nowadays   offer   better   and    more

opportunities for advancement for a  good  Honours

Degree  graduate than exist in the Civil Service".

In  the  light  of this evidence,  the  Commission

recommended  additional increments at the  maximum

to the salary scale for Administrative Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with regret that I have to inform the

House  that  the recommendations of  the  Salaries

Commission  in respect of Superscale Officers  and

Division  I  Officers are not  acceptable  to  the

Government.  Salaries  of Superscale  Grades  will

remain  the  same  as  at  present,  except   that

variable  allowances  will  be  consolidated  into

pensionable  pay.  For the Administrative  Service

the Commission recommended a scale as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$800 x 50 - 900/950 x 50 - 1,050/1,200 x 50 - 2,000 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes the following scale : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$900 x 50 - 1,000/1,050 x 50 - 1,400/1,450 x 50 - 1,850 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related salary scales in Division I will follow a

similar pattern maintaining approximately the same

differential with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



the  Administrative Service Scale. Details of  all

salary scales and method of conversion will be set

out  in a forthcoming Treasury Circular. When  the

whole   country  is  being  enjoined  to  put   in

additional  effort without thought of  recompense,

this  is  not  the proper moment  to  introduce  a

general increase in the pay of top civil servants,

however  much  they may deserve it.  At  the  same

time,  it  is necessary that the Government  takes

certain action to ensure that there is no drift of

the  best talent in the civil service into private

enterprise. Government proposes to achieve this by

two  measures.  First, to carry out more  frequent

promotion  exercises. There is a large  number  of

posts in the civil service establishment which are

not substantively filled in the upper echelons  of

the  service. This is because of the policy of the

Public Service Commission to promote only officers

of  outstanding  merit. Everyone will  agree  that

this policy of the Public Service Commission is  a

sound  one.  Nevertheless, nearly  10  years  have

passed  since  the Malayanisation  exercises  were

completed. University graduates recruited into the

civil service since then and others promoted  from

the ranks into the Administrative Service have  by

now  ample  time  and opportunity  to  demonstrate

their  worth. This may be the appropriate occasion

to  carry out an extensive promotion exercise.  In

this way, the meritorious will be rewarded without

recourse  to a general increase in salaries  which

will  benefit both the outstanding officer as well

as those not deserving of reward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy has its limitations. Officers on the

top   ladder,  i.e.,  the  Permanent  Secretaries,

occupying  substantive  posts  on  Superscale  'C'

cannot  climb further. Therefore, it is  necessary

to  revise  the  structure of the  top  Superscale

posts.  The  Government proposes to introduce  two

Superscale posts. Superscale 'B' with a total  pay

of  $2,700 a month and Superscale 'A' at $3,000  a

month.  Substantive  holders  of  Superscale   'C'

appointments will be considered in the forthcoming

promotion  exercise for promotion to Superscale  B

and A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of these Superscales B and A

would  mean that the salary structures of  the  top

echelons  of  other  services,  for  example,   the

Judicial   Service  and  some  senior  appointments

outside the normal ranks of the civil service, such

as  the  Chairman of the Public Service Commission,

will have to be revised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of Medical and Dental Officers, the

Commission recommended as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While it is reasonable in our view to have some

regard  to the standard of remuneration of  general

practitioners and consultants in private  practice,

we  think  that the type of work and conditions  of

employment  of  those in the private sector  differ

materially  from  most  of those  employed  in  the

Government service. The pattern of the working life

of  a  private  practitioner is entirely  different

from  those  performed  by Government  Medical  and

Dental Officers.'



<br><br>Nevertheless,   it   was  the   opinion   of   the

Commission  that "there is considerable  weight  in

the  arguments mentioned above for improved  salary

scales for Medical and Dental Officers in order  to

attract  and  retain officers in the Service".  For

these  officers, the Commission recommended  salary

scales  which provide for a substantial jump  after

the bar in the third year of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government does not accept this recommendation of

the   Commission.  The  shortage  of  doctors   and

dentists     which    doubtless    induced     this

recommendation  of the Commission has  come  to  an

end,  and  doctors and dentists in  the  Government

service  will convert in the normal way to the  new

salary scale of $1,100x50-1,400/1,450x50-1,850 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission expressed the opinion that the

present  quantum of Specialist Allowance  fixed  in

1958 needed revision. Specialists in the Government

medical   service  represent  a  group  of   highly

qualified   and  experienced  personnel   who   are

responsible  for the maintenance of high  standards

of  medical practice not only in Government service

but   outside  it.  Evidence  was  given   to   the

Commission that the personal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



emoluments  did not provide a sufficient  incentive

for  these  officers to remain  in  the  Government

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that the existing

rates  of  Specialist  Allowance  for  Medical  and

Dental Specialist should be increased. They further

recommended  that  the existing  classification  of

Specialist  into the categories of  Clinical.  Non-Clinical  and Administrative Specialist be  reduced

to  two categories of Clinical Specialists with the

same allowance and Administrative Specialists.  For

Superscale  G  Specialists, the allowance  of  $250

p.m. for Clinical Specialist and $200 p.m. for Non-Clinical  Specialist should be raised to $500  p.m.

In  respect of Superscale E, the allowance of  $500

for  Clinical  Specialist and $350 for Non-Clinical

Specialist  should  be  raised  to  $750  p.m.   No

increases  were  recommended for the Administrative

Specialist in Grades G and E, but the allowance for

the  Administrative Specialist in Superscale C  has

been  recommended to be raised from  $200  to  $500

p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government accepts this recommendation except in

respect  of  Administrative  Specialist  posts   in

Superscale  C. The question of Specialist  pay  for

Administrative Specialists in Superscale  Grades  G

and   E   needs  to  be  further  considered.   The

Commission   has   made   no  recommendations   for

increases  in  these  grades.  This  may  lead   to

difficulties in that a. Specialist on posting to an

Administrative  position will suffer  reduction  in

pay.  As  a  result of this policy,  Administrative

positions in the Medical Service may be held by the

less  meritorious  so  far  as  medical  skill   is

concerned.  Of  course,  no  one  will  argue  that

Administrative skills and Medical Specialist skills

go together. Nevertheless, the virtual exclusion of

best specialist skills from making any contribution

to administrative efficacy is disturbing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the added complication that if doctors

performing administrative functions in Grade G  and

E posts were to get very substantial allowances, as

compared with their counterparts in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



the Administrative Service, they would, in fact, be

getting more pay for doing the same type of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of

Health  are  working together to  find  a  mutually

satisfactory solution to this very tricky problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that where an officer

is  acting in a post because it is vacant  and  not

because  the incumbent is on leave, he should  draw

acting  allowance of the full difference in  salary

up  to  a  maximum of $250 a month. The  Government

accepts  that acting allowances should be increased

to  two-thirds of the difference in salary up to  a

maximum  of  $250  a  month  as  against  half  the

difference  and a maximum of $200 p.m, at  present.

It does not agree to the full difference being paid

on the grounds that if an officer is considered fit

to  receive the full difference he should have been

promoted substantively. Another reason is that many

officers  act in higher posts as a result  of  pure

chance simply because they happen to be on the spot

and not because of proven merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not accept the recommendation

of  the  Commission that an officer with 20  years'

pensionable  service should not  lose  his  pension

entirely if he were to be dismissed on disciplinary

grounds.  The Government accepts the recommendation

that  an  officer  retired in the  public  interest

should  retain  some  of his  pension  rights.  The

Government also accepts the recommendation  of  the

Commission  that  benefits payable  in  respect  of

injury  or  death  arising in the  course  of  duty

should be improved. Government does not accept  the

recommendation  of a scheme to provide  for  widows

and  dependants of pensioners in view of  the  fact

that  the Widows and Orphans Pension Scheme,  which

provided  for this, was unpopular and was abolished

as a result of representations from staff unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards retirement benefits, the Commission

made far-reaching recommendations on changes to the

Pensions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



Rules. It noted that it would not be practicable to

offer  provident fund benefits in addition  to  the

pension  scheme. The Commission also expressed  the

opinion that the quantum of pensions payable  under

present regulations is adequate. However, the terms

of  eligibility,  in its opinion, are  too  rigidly

determined  by  the present Pensions Ordinance.  It

recommended  a more flexible system. In particular,

it  recommended  that  a  pensionable  officer  who

leaves  the  service after 20 years of  pensionable

service should not lose his entire pension, even if

he  has not reached the age of optional retirement.

Government accepts the need for more flexibility in

the  present Pensions Ordinance. It does not accept

the  recommendation that officers  with  20  years'

service  should  retain  some  pension  rights   on

leaving the service prematurely. The Commission has

not  made any recommendations in respect of quantum

of pensions to he retained in such instances, it is

difficult  to  decide on this. If the quantum  were

fixed at too low a level, the new benefits may well

be  regarded  as derisory. On the other  hand,  any

substantial concession on this point may lead to an

undesirable   exodus  of  talent  from   Government

employment into the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Government has decided that,

subject to the approval of the President acting  on

the  advice of the Cabinet, officers with 20  years

of  pensionable  service may  be  retired  on  full

pension  rights  without recourse  to  disciplinary

proceedings  as administered by the Public  Service

Commission in the case of retirement in the  public

interest.  This  will enable Government  to  retire

officers whose continued employment would be of  no

advantage  to  the  service  without  reducing  the

market  value  of  the officer in  his  search  for

employment in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission covered a wide field and made

recommendations  on  a  large  number  of  detailed

points.  For instance, it recommended  that  a  Pay

Research   Unit  be  established  to  undertake   a

continuous study of relative pay in jobs within the

government service and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



between  government service and the private sector.

It   made  recommendations  on  translators   fees,

medical   benefits,  rentals  paid  by   government

employees, privileges of free supply of electricity

and water and on numerous other matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be appropriate for me to enter into

each  and  every  recommendation.  These  will   be

described in a Treasury paper which will be  issued

shortly. In most instances, the recommendations  of

the Commission have been accepted. In some, further

studies are needed before a decision can finally be

made, and in a few instances the recommendation  of

the Commission has not been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general review of pay and conditions of service

of  the whole civil service is a complex and  major

undertaking,  bearing in mind that  the  Government

employs  more than 50,000 employees. Implementation

of  these  proposals  or amendments  of  them  will

constitute a major administrative exercise. I  have

indicated  the Government's position in respect  of

the major recommendations of the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the Government has not

accepted   any   salary  increases   except   those

recommended  for a few specific grades,  i.e.,  the

Medical  Ancillary  Service, the  Nursing  Service,

Midwives  and  Graduate  Teachers.  The  Government

agrees  to  the recommended improvements for  these

officers  because  they  have  been  made  by   the

Commission  after  a  very careful  study  and  are

considered  justifiable based on their relationship

with  other grades in the civil service. Where  the

Commission's recommendations are accepted, I do not

expect much difficulty in having them implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Government has decided at present not to

accept  the  recommendation of the  Commission,  an

opportunity  will be given to trade  unions,  staff

associations   and   others   affected   to    make

representations   to  the  Treasury   or   to   the

appropriate Ministry before a final



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



decision  is  taken. All representations  will,  of

course, be given due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final review of the position will be made later

this  year.  When this review has been made  and  a

final   decision  taken,  implementation  will   be

proceeded   with.   It   is   proposed   that   all

recommendations accepted by the Government and  all

proposals  confirmed or amended  subsequently  will

take effect as from the 1st January, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not covered by the Report of the Salaries

Commission,  it  will be necessary  to  revise  the

salaries  and pay structure of the Armed Forces  in

view  of  the  intention to accept the  new  salary

structure for the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 21, line 37, to leave out "twenty-eight"

and insert "sixty".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we have already said in

this  House  at  the  last  sitting,  I  move  this

amendment  for the simple reason that 28  days  for

sick  leave, including hospitalisation,  is  rather

inadequate.  I am quite sure that persons  admitted

to   hospital   must  be  suffering  from   serious

illnesses, otherwise they will not be admitted.  In

order  to assist a patient to regain his health  so

that he can carry on with his work efficiently.  It

is   necessary  that  the  period  of  sick  leave,

including  hospitalisation,  should  be   60   days

instead of 28 days only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 21, line 42, to leave out "fourteen" and

insert "forty-six".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second amendment is just to regularise the

provision. The purpose of my amendment is that if a

person is paid sick leave for 14 days, it is  quite

natural that the remaining number of days should be

46. So the total for the paid sick leave will be 14

days'  sick  leave and 46 days for hospitalisation,

making a total of 60 days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 22, line 36, to leave out "seven" and

insert "five".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common practice that most

employers in Singapore pay retirement benefits when

an  employee  has  completed five  years'  service.

Therefore,  it is quite logical that  my  amendment

should  be  accepted  by  the  Government  so  that

retirement  benefits will be paid when an  employee

has completed five years' service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that it is common practice that

most employers in Singapore do pay an annual bonus.

workers  of  their annual bonus,  as  it  will  not

achieve the purpose of increasing productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very necessary that

workers in Singapore be given a chance to negotiate

with  employers for the annual bonus. The  National

Trades  Union Congress is most reasonable,  and  it

did recommend that bonus should be negotiable up to

a  maximum  of one month. Anything more  than  that

should  be  for  mutual  negotiation  or  agreement

between employer and employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, the payment of annual

bonus  is  very  important to the workers,  because

they  require money especially at the  end  of  the

year  for  expenses  incurred  during  the  various

religious  festivals. In addition, if  the  workers

have  families, they will need extra money  to  buy

school  uniforms,  school  books,  etc, for  their

children.  In  this  respect, we therefore  request

that  (a) bonus should be negotiable (b) it  should

be  up  to  a limit of one month, and (c)  anything

more  than that should be by mutual consent between

the  employer  and employees. It is  quite  natural

that  the workers will definitely know how to  save

any surplus money after incurring various expenses.

Unless  they get their annual bonus, their  chances

of saving money are almost negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to ratify the

Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes

between States and Nationals of Other States, which

Singapore signed on 2nd February, 1968, so that the

Instrument of Ratification of the Convention can be

deposited with the World Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention is a code of international conduct

which   Singapore,   trying  to   attract   foreign

investment,  should adopt as it is an assurance  to

foreign   investors  that  disputes   about   their

investments  here would be submitted to arbitration

by  the  International  Centre  for  Settlement  of

Investment  Disputes, which has  its  seat  in  the

World Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre has jurisdiction over any legal

disputes  arising  directly out  of  an  investment

between  a  contracting state  and  a  national  of

another contracting state, which the parties to the

Convention  consent in writing  to  submit  to  the

Centre. However, any contracting state may  at  the

time  of ratification of the Convention or  at  any

time  thereafter notify the Centre of the class  or

classes  of  disputes which it would or  would  not

consider  submitting  to the  jurisdiction  of  the

Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, therefore, be necessary to enact

legislation  to  enable  Singapore  to  ratify  the

Convention. In order to implement the provisions of

the  Convention  relating to  the  recognition  and

enforcement of an arbitral award rendered  pursuant

to  the  Convention, the Bill accordingly  provides

for  the registration of such an award in the  High

Court under clause 4 of the Bill. As provided under

clause 5 of the Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



the  award,  on registration, shall have  the  same

force  and  effect as if it had been a judgment  of

the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure of the Centre for the Settlement

of  Investment Disputes is met out of  the  charges

for  use of its facilities and any deficit is borne

by  the contracting states which are members of the

World Bank in proportion to their subscriptions  to

the  World Bank. The Bill therefore provides  under

clause 7 for any expenses which may be incurred  by

the  Government under the Convention to be  charged

on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to implement the

International  Convention  on  the  Settlement   of

Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other  States.  By the Convention, the  contracting

parties  may voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction

of the tribunal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my approach to this is simply that

submitting  to the jurisdiction of an international

tribunal  means  a  derogation of our  sovereignty.

This  Convention goes further. It provides for  the

settlement of disputes between a contracting  state

party  like Singapore and a national of  a  foreign

state.  This,  one  may even say,  derogates  still

further from the sovereignty of Singapore.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention also provides for agreement

between the parties involved in the disputes as  to

the   laws   which   may  be  applicable   in   the

adjudication of this dispute. In the absence of any

agreement as to what laws should apply to a dispute

before  the  tribunal, the laws of the  contracting

state  party would apply. As I understand  it,  the

purpose  of  this Bill, it appears,  is  to  accord

confidence to foreign states



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



which hope to invest in Singapore. That being  so,

whatever disputes arise with a foreign state would

normally have to be adjudicated in Singapore  and,

therefore, the laws of Singapore would apply. That

being so, why subscribe to this Convention at all,

because   our  courts,  I  think,  are   certainly

credible  enough  and capable enough  of  settling

such disputes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, the

procedure  that  is intended to  be  adopted  with

regard to the registration of awards would be  the

procedure that is at the moment being carried  out

in  our  High Court. There again the procedure  of

our  courts is being adopted. That being the case,

I  do  not  see  why we should subscribe  to  this

Convention  in  the first place.  Apart  from  the

question  that it derogates from our  sovereignty,

the  Convention also provides for the  utilisation

of  a  substantial  part of the procedure  of  our

courts and, therefore, our courts. I think,  would

be   sufficiently  equipped  to  accommodate   any

dispute.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of the Arbitration

(International Investment Disputes) Bill is to  be

welcomed  as  it  comes up  at  a  time  when  the

Republic   is  sparing  no  effort  to  create   a

favourable  image abroad, that we  are  a  society

following the principles of law and order. I think

the  labour  movement would associate itself  with

such  a  timely  act  to gain  the  confidence  of

prospective international financial investors. The

Republic  has  already established  for  itself  a

reputation for respect for law and order, and  the

move  to give legal protection to investors  is  a

move  in the right direction. The adoption of  the

Bill  will definitely strengthen the image of  the

Republic and its people. We have all witnessed  on

not  too few occasions when other governments have

ruled without any respect for the agreements  they

have entered into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Arbitration (International

Investment  Disputes)  Bill  into  law   and   its

enforcement    will    necessarily    mean     the

implementation of the International Convention  on

the  Settlement  of  Investment  Disputes  between

States  and  Nationals  of Other  States  and  the

registration by the Republic's High Court  of  the

award   of  the  International  Centre   for   the

Settlement  of  Investment  Disputes.  The  direct

effect of accepting the Convention will mean  that

the Republic does not live by arbitrary rules. The

Arbitration  (International  Investment  Disputes)

Bill   does   not  necessarily  imply   that   the

Government  of Singapore expects to have  disputes

with foreign investors. It is, however, vital that

there   must   be   the  international   machinery

available  to settle the disputes. The Arbitration

(International  Investment  Disputes)  Bill   will

offer  the machinery. Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I

beg to support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, may I allay the doubts

raised by the Member for Serangoon Gardens?  While

I  appreciate his concern about derogation of  our

sovereignty, may I assure him that this Bill  does

not  in  any way derogate from the sovereignty  of

our State?



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it means is that by being a party to the

Convention,   we   are  merely  transferring   the

jurisdiction   of   our  local   courts   to   the

International  Centre for Investment  Disputes  in

cases   where   the   disputes   have   not   been

satisfactorily resolved in our local courts.  This

is  provided  by  Article 26  of  the  Convention.

Incidentally,  the Articles are  attached  to  the

Bill as a Schedule. Article 26 reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Consent of the parties to arbitration under

this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be

deemed   consent  to  such  arbitration   to   the

exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State

may require the exhaustion of local administrative

or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent

to arbitration under this Convention.'



<br><br>Therefore,  Sir,  this is not a derogation  of  our

sovereignty but only the delegation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



of  some  of  our judicial functions  to  the

international Centre for Investment Disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when a dispute is referred to the

Centre  for  arbitration, the law to be applied  is

the  law  agreed between the parties,  and  if  the

parties  do  not  so  agree, the arbitral  tribunal

would  apply  the  law of the State  party  to  the

dispute; that is, it would apply municipal  law  as

well  as such rules of international law as may  be

applicable.   While  we  ourselves  have   complete

confidence  in  our judicial system  in  Singapore,

foreign   investors,   however,   may   prefer   an

international  tribunal. That is  the  whole  point

here.  We want to assure foreign investors that  we

are  all  above-board that any investment  disputes

with   us  will  be  decided  by  an  international

tribunal who is unprejudiced and unbiased. This  is

an   effort   on   our  part  to  attract   foreign

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to hear from the Member for

Kallang of his support and also the support of  the

labour movement for this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House envisages a number

of  amendments  to  the  existing   Property   Tax

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Land Titles (Strata) Act was enacted in

1967,  it is advisable to provide specifically  for

owners   of  flats  to  be  subject  to  assessment

annually under the Property Tax Ordinance. That Act

introduced  a  new concept of ownership,  and  flat

owners registered under that Act may have doubts as

to  what their property tax position is, since they

are  owners of property situated "in the  air"  and

thus  somewhat  different from the  usual  type  of

ownership attached to the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, a new paragraph (e) is added to the

proviso to section 2 of the Property Tax Ordinance.

The  new paragraph seeks to ascertain, firstly, who

the owner of each such lot or flat "in the air" is.

Secondly,  it states that the annual value  of  the

flat  is to be assessed in the same manner  as  any

other  freehold  estate in land. And,  thirdly,  it

excludes the land on which the flats are built from

assessment  when the flats are already individually

assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of property comprised in a statutory

land  grant  or lease of State land or a  lease  of

property  for a period exceeding three years  by  a

public  authority,  another  paragraph  2  (f)   is

inserted.  Firstly, it deems the grantee or  lessee

of  such  land  to  be the owner  for  purposes  of

assessing  annual value. Secondly, it provides  for

the  assessment of property to be conducted in  the

same  way as if they are freehold estates in  land.

And thirdly, it disallows deductions for premium or

rent   payable  to  the  Government  so  that  full

property tax may be levied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation is that when such lands are

leased with a prohibition against sub-letting,  the

lessee is not regarded as the owner for purposes of

the  Property Tax Ordinance and so no tax is  paid.

Where  there is no prohibition against sub-letting,

the  lessee is regarded as the owner and pays  tax.

But  the law at present allows the lessee to deduct

the proportionate amount of the tax paid or (in the

case of Government leases) the rent payable to  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable difficulty in

collecting  property tax in such cases  and  it  is

hoped   that   with  the  introduction   of   these

amendments, full property tax will be collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public authority for this purpose is then

accordingly defined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next amendment affects section 17 of the

Ordinance.  At  the  moment,  when  a  building  is

demolished  or removed, the owner of such  property

is  required to give written notice of such changes

to   his  property  to  the  Chief  Assessor.   The

amendment  now  requires this notice  to  be  given

within  15  days  from the date  of  completion  of

demolition or removal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same section, the Comptroller is empowered

to  tax the owner of such property according to the

existing  annual  value ascribed to  the  property,

even  though  it is demolished or removed.  In  the

amendment,  he  is given the option of  taxing  the

owner according to a revised annual value instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 (7) is next amended in view of the

delays encountered in the collection of the amounts

payable  in  lieu  of  property  tax  from   public

authorities  and  bodies corporate.  To  discourage

undue lateness in payment of such contributions, it

is  now  stipulated that should  payments  be  made

later  than the third week from the end of  January

or  July  of  each year, the unpaid  sum  shall  be

regarded  as  arrears of property tax that  can  be

recovered  with  interest at  the  prevailing  bank

rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, an amendment is made to transfer the

power  of  appointing officers under the  Ordinance

from the President to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

the Bill be now read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to enable Singapore to become a

member  of  the  International Finance  Corporation

(I.F.C.), which is an affiliate organisation of the

World  Bank.  The International Finance Corporation

provides  capital  in the form  of  loans  to,  and

equity  participation in private enterprises  which

do  not  fall  within the scope of the  World  Bank

activities. The World Bank lends only to government

and   semi-government  bodies.  The   I.F.C. also

undertakes standby and underwriting operations  and

provides  financial  and  technical  assistance  to

privately    controlled    development    financial

companies. Its activities are therefore similar  in

many  respects  to  those of an investment  banker.

Furthermore, the I.F.C. does not require government

guarantees in its operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By becoming a member of I.F.C., Singapore will

give  her  private enterprises access to a  further

source of capital from abroad. I.F.C. participation

in our private enterprises will further enhance the

standing  and viability of our private  development

projects and, indirectly, the economic viability of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to benefit from I.F.C.'s operations.

Singapore  must  become a member by subscribing  to

US$177,000 at par, which is Singapore's  quota,  to

the  capital  stock  of  the Corporation.  This  is

provided under clause (4) (a) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two big projects which we can

immediately  submit to I.F.C. for participation  is

our proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Development Bank whose main operations

will be to undertake development financing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big project which we can get I.F.C, to

participate is in the hotel industry which  is  now

entering a boom. This is an enterprise relating  to

tourism in which I.F.C, is prepared to invest.  The

bigger hotel projects in Singapore will be eligible

to  obtain this additional source of funds from the

Corporation, once we become a member.

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends various Articles to the

Constitution  relating to citizenship  rights.  The

first  amendment relates to Article 55. As amended,

Article 55 would allow citizenship by descent to  a

child who is born outside Singapore of a father who

is  a  Singapore citizen, whether by  birth  or  by

registration.  In the case where the  father  is  a

Singapore citizen by birth, Article 55, as amended,

would  allow  his  child  the  right  of  Singapore

citizenship  by  descent, In  the  case  where  the

father is a Singapore citizen by registration,  his

child  may claim citizenship by descent only if  he

does not acquire the citizenship of that country in

which he was actually born by reason of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



birth  there.  In  both  cases,  the  parents   are

required to register the child within one  year  of

its birth with the Government or with the Singapore

Mission  in  the  country  of  the  child's  birth.

However,  the  Government reserves  to  itself  the

right  to  grant  permission to a  person  claiming

citizenship by descent to register his birth, where

this  has  not  been  done,  within  the  one  year

prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to Article 60 (3) of the

Constitution is purely a technical one in  that  it

would  extend the operation of the present  Article

60   (3)  to  cover  cases  of  citizens  obtaining

Singapore citizenship by registration under section

13 of the repealed Singapore Citizenship Ordinance,

1957.   This   section   in  the   1957   Ordinance

corresponds to Article 58 of the Constitution. Both

the provisions require a citizen who is a minor  to

take  the  oath  of  renunciation,  allegiance  and

loyalty  within  twelve  months  of  his  attaining

majority.  Failure  to do so  will  result  in  the

subject losing his citizenship status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there is a Committee of Inquiry which

consists of a Chairman and two members appointed to

hear  all  appeals  from citizens  who  are  to  be

deprived  of their citizenship. It has  been  found

from  practical experience that it  would  be  more

desirable  to have a panel from whom may be  chosen

two  members  to form such a Committee of  Inquiry.

This  will  expedite the hearing  of  appeals.  The

amendment  to  Article  63  (2)  would  enable  the

Government to appoint such a panel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to Article 66 would now empower the

Government  to  cancel certificates that  have  ben

obtained under this Article in circumstances  where

such  certificates have been obtained  fraudulently

or  by  mistake. The national registration exercise

has  brought to light a number of cases of  persons

who   had   used   other  persons   unnamed   birth

certificates  to claim Singapore citizenship  under

this  Article.  With this amendment the  Government

would   now  be  empowered  to  cancel  citizenship

certificates under Article 66



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



where  such certificates were obtained by means  of

fraud  or  concealment  of  material  facts  or  by

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, like the Employment Bill, is an

attempt     to     rationalise    employer-employee

relationship   with  a  view  to   attracting   new

investments  and increasing the efficiency  of  our

trading  and  industrial  enterprises.  This  Bill,

unlike  the Employment Bill, deals with the  rights

and  responsibilities of management. Efficiency  of

an enterprise depends on effective management, more

so  as  our  commercial and industrial  enterprises

become more modernised, more complex and bigger  as

they  must  if  they are to hold their  own  in  an

increasingly  competitive world.  The  more  highly

organised our economy becomes, the more up-to-date,

resourceful   and  imaginative  must   become   our

management methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions have never questioned the rights

of  management  to manage, first, as  a  matter  of

common-sense and, second, because these rights  are

common  law  rights. But whatever  the  theory  the

rights  of  management have  over  the  years  been

eroded, perhaps not as a conscious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



policy,  by trade unions. What this Bill seeks  to

do  is to restore these rights of management to the

employers by making common law rights into  statute

law.  No  rights  are  being taken  away  from  the

workers  because  the workers never  claimed  these

rights,  even though some of these rights have,  in

practice, been denied to management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not restoring these rights to management

merely out of a sense of justice and fair play, but

because   we  are  convinced  that  unless   proper

management  functions are allowed to  be  performed

unhampered  there would be little  or  no  economic

expansion  or  fresh investments.  No  investor  or

entrepreneur is going to risk millions  of  dollars

if  he has not the final say and the responsibility

to  decide how the enterprise should be run.  I  am

not  saying  that unions have deliberately  claimed

the  rights  of management because then they  would

also  have to take on the responsibilities that  go

with  it. But unwittingly they have trespassed into

this sphere by querying the right of management  to

hire,  fire,  promote and transfer employees  where

these  are  necessary to enhance the efficiency  of

the  enterprise. Yet the essence of  management  is

the  ability of the management to deploy its labour

resources and skills in the most effective and most

rational way - and central to this is to be able to

recruit  the most qualified worker, to promote  the

most  able,  to get rid of the inefficient  and  to

transfer  a worker where he is most needed.  These,

to  a certain extent, involve judgment but, by  and

large, the judgment of the management should be the

decisive one because if its judgment is erratic and

ill-informed  the enterprise sooner or  later  goes

bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that management rights cannot be

abused  or  improperly or unintelligently exercised

by  management. We have, therefore,  in  this  Bill

provided such safeguards as we can against flagrant

abuse  of  management rights, but laws have  to  be

designed for normal behaviour. It is reasonable  to

assume that most employers are interested, as  most

workers are, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



efficiently   managed   and  therefore   profitable

enterprises. One cannot make laws on the assumption

that  employers  are going into business  with  the

primary  objective of hiring, firing and  promoting

workers arbitrarily and unfairly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuses and malpractices there will always be, and

inroads  into rights and privileges will always  be

made  by  one  party  or the other  which,  in  the

ultimate,  can  become detrimental  to  the  public

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Ordinance, which was

enacted  in  1960, gives expression to Government's

declared  policy of industrial peace with  justice.

Though the law has worked satisfactorily generally,

experience   in  working  it  has  shown   that   a

reappraisal  is  necessary  to  eliminate   certain

fundamental  areas  of latent  dispute  which  have

caused  serious concern to us, because in  a  large

number  of  cases this has resulted  in  shattering

confidence  in  Singapore's ability to  create  the

necessary    conditions    to    attract    foreign

investments, encourage industrial development,  and

generate  much-needed employment opportunities  for

our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some figures of work stoppages

from  1960 to 1967, that is, during the last  seven

years.  The  total number of stoppages during  this

period  of  some eight years was 389,  involving  a

loss  in man-days of 1,284,029; the peak years were

of course 1961, 1962 and 1963. It will be seen that

the  number of man-days lost is colossal. It  is  a

loss  which  could have crippled a country  of  our

size  and in our position, but fortunately  because

we  in Singapore are made of sterner stuff, we have

managed  to  survive. What is even more interesting

is  a study of the causes of these disputes. Of the

total  of  389 disputes, 106 or about 27  per  cent

arose  out of dismissals while another 120 or about

30 per cent were due to a number of other reasons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



which  included  demotion, discontinuance  of  life

insurance   scheme,   discrimination   in   filling

vacancy,  grading of staff, recruitment of workers,

reorganisation, transfer of company doctor, warning

letters, and not least of all, a union's demand for

dismissal  of an employee. These disputes  indicate

that   there   is  no  clear  demarcation   between

management functions and trade union functions. One

can  seriously  ask  whether in  such  a  state  of

affairs any new employer would set up factories  in

Singapore  if  there  is  no  clear  dividing  line

between   the  functions  of  management  and   the

functions of trade unions. This Bill is therefore a

bid  to create the necessary framework within which

certain industrial matters between the employer and

worker  can  find  a new basis for  a  new  working

relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the major clauses of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 16 of

the  Ordinance by providing that a trade  union  of

employees, the majority of whose members consist of

employees working in subordinate positions, may not

seek recognition in respect of employees who are in

managerial  or  executive positions.  The  existing

provisions of subsection (2) of section  6  of  the

Ordinance  merely stipulate that a trade  union  of

employees,  whose  constitution and  rules  do  not

permit  it  to  admit  as  members  any  class   of

employees,  may not seek recognition in respect  of

that  class of employees. But the constitution  and

rules of a trade union may be drafted so widely  as

to  embrace all grades and categories of  employees

from the office boy up to the managing director. In

any   commercial  or  industrial  undertaking,  the

supervisory  category  of employees  constitutes  a

minority of the total number of employees. A  trade

union  ostensibly works on the democratic principle

that  the  will  of  the  majority  prevails,   but

sometimes  this principle cuts across the interests

of  the minority. As the minority of employees  are

in supervisory or executive grades, one often finds

that  such  a  principle is incompatible  with  the

enforcement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



discipline.   And  discipline  is   undeniably   a

necessary  prerequisite for effective and efficient

management.  Separate representation  of  different

categories  of  employees is  nothing  new  and  is

accepted in the highly industrialised countries  of

Europe  and  America.  Further,  it  has  been  our

experience  that  the provisions  of  the  existing

section  16  of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

have not been effective in minimising the incidence

of   disputes  on  the  question  of  trade   union

representation  which,  in practice,  attempted  to

embrace  managerial or executive  employees.  There

is,  therefore, a need for legislative intervention

in this regard to regularise the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 17 of the

Ordinance  and a new subsection is now included  to

provide   that   certain   fundamental   management

functions  are not negotiable. These functions  are

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the promotion of an employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the internal transfer of an employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the recruitment of staff;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the retrenchment of an employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the dismissal or reinstatement of an employee;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the assignment or allocation of duties or

specific tasks to an employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undoubtedly true that such functions are

common  law  rights and that, therefore,  it  would

appear unnecessary to give further legal effect  to

such  rights.  However, as I said,  experience  has

shown  that  the line between management  functions

and  trade union functions becomes blurred  in  the

process  of heated negotiations, with neither  side

knowing  where one's right begins or ends.  It  is,

therefore,   necessary  to  define   clearly   what

management  functions are, just as it is  important

to  delineate trade union functions to eliminate an

area  of  dispute  which  has  caused  considerable

concern in regard to the industrial progress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore. But unfettered  rights  there

cannot be, because rights also beget obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are subject to human failings just as

trade unions are, and these human failings can lead

to  aberrations.  It  is, therefore,  necessary  to

build   in   certain  safeguards  to  protect   the

employees.  For instance, the right of an  employer

to   transfer  an  employee  is  subject   to   the

requirement that the exercise of such a right  does

not entail a change to the detriment of an employee

in regard to his terms of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the right of an employer to terminate

the  services of an employee can only be  exercised

on  the grounds of redundancy or reorganisation  of

the employer's profession, business, trade or work.

The  trade  unions, however, have apprehensions  in

this  regard. In view of the fact that retrenchment

can   only  be  carried  out  on  the  grounds   of

redundancy  or  reorganisation, the  employer  will

have in fact to show that this is so. What the Bill

intends  to  achieve is merely  that  the  employer

should have the prerogative to decide which of  his

employees  should go, not just on the principle  of

"last in, first out", but more on the principle  of

"least efficient, first out".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer would naturally want to retain

efficient workers if be wants to run his enterprise

successfully. The principle of "last in, first out"

prevents him from retaining useful employees  in  a

redundancy  or reorganisation exercise.  The  fears

expressed  in this regard are, therefore,  somewhat

exaggerated  because in any case of  abuse  by  the

employers,  remedial  measures  can  be  instituted

under  section 72 if the circumstances warrant  the

appointment of a Board of Inquiry.

<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the right of an employer to dismiss an

employee  is  subject  to  certain  restraints   as

provided for in an amendment to section 34  of  the

Ordinance as embodied in paragraph



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



(d) of clause 8. An employee dismissed without just

cause  or  excuse  by an employer may,  within  one

month  of  his  dismissal, make through  his  trade

union,  representations in writing to the  Minister

to  be  reinstated  in his former  employment.  The

purpose  of  directing  dismissal  cases   to   the

Minister is to provide for more speedy machinery to

deal  with  individual cases of  dismissal  and  to

prevent the Industrial Arbitration Court from being

bogged  down  by prolonged arguments over  isolated

cases. If the objective of the Bill is achieved and

high  employment created, we can expect the  supply

of  jobs  to  outrun the demand for  jobs.  Such  a

situation  would  be  a natural  bar  to  employers

wanting  to  terminate  the services  of  employees

because employees will be able to choose jobs  from

several alternatives that are open to them. In  any

case,  the more efficient and useful a worker,  the

less are the chances of his losing employment,  and

improved performance and productivity will become a

natural deterrent to unjust dismissals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, whilst the employer is given the right

to  assign or allocate duties or specific tasks  to

an  employee, this right is qualified by  the  fact

that  such  assignment or allocation  must  be  con

sistent or compatible with the terms of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 24 of the

Ordinance  to  provide  that  the  duration  of   a

collective  agreement should be for  a  minimum  of

three  years and a maximum of five years as against

the  existing provisions for a minimum of 18 months

and  a maximum of three years. The reason for  this

extension  is to enable stability to be  maintained

in the level of terms and conditions of service for

a longer period. This would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



lead to more effective and efficient administration

of  an undertaking and enable entrepreneurs to plan

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that under section  53  of

the Employment Act, no collective agreement entered

into  after the coming into operation of  this  Act

shall  contain provisions more favourable than  the

terms  and  conditions of service provided  for  in

Part IV, except in respect of sick leave and annual

leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide added inducement for new

investors  to come to Singapore, clause  7  of  the

Bill   provides  that  all  industrial  and   other

approved     undertakings,    including     pioneer

industries, which commenced operation on  or  after

the  1st day of January, 1968, shall comply  wholly

with  the  provisions of Part IV of the  Employment

Act,  1968.  In  other words,  all  the  terms  and

conditions of employment, including sick leave  and

annual  leave, of these new industrial undertakings

will constitute the maximum terms of service for  a

period   of   five  years  from   the   date   such

undertakings  commence operation in Singapore.  The

Minister,  however, may extend the  period  at  his

discretion.
