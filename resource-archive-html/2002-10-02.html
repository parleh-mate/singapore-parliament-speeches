<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  (a) what proportion of the  13.4%  foreign

direct investments (FDIs) pulled in by ASEAN has come  to

Singapore  and  in  what forms; and (b)  how  will  these

investments help to create jobs and what are the types in

the immediate and the near future.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe Mdm Ho is

referring to the figure reported by the ASEAN Secretariat

that  foreign direct investment into ASEAN has  increased

by  13.4%  to US$13 billion last year.  The figure  comes

from the World Investment Report 2002 published by UNTAD.

In that report, Singapore attracted US$8.6 billion or 65%

of the total FDI into ASEAN.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures, which show international capital

flows,  do  not have breakdown by industry.  To  see  the

breakdown  by  industry  and  gauge  the  impact  on  job

creation,  it  is  better for us to  look  at  investment

commitments in the data compiled by EDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore attracted fixed asset

investment   commitments  of   S$9.2   billion   in   the

manufacturing sector.  50% of the commitments were in the

electronics industry.  Another 21% were in the  chemicals

industry.   The other commitments were in the  petroleum,

precision  engineering,  transport  equipment  and  other

industries.   In  the services sector, S$1.8  billion  in

total  business spending was committed last  year.   This

was  largely  in  projects  for the  info-communications,

media, logistics and transport clusters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investment commitments are expected to create

17,000  jobs in manufacturing and 7,500 jobs in  services

over  the next two to three years, when the projects  are

fully   realised.   Professionals  and  skilled   workers

account for about 70% of the total jobs created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target this year is to attract investment

commitments of S$9.2 billion in manufacturing, and  total

business  spending of S$2 billion in services.   Most  of

these  investments will continue to be in the electronics

and  chemicals clusters.  If achieved, this would further

create more than 20,000 jobs in the coming three to  four

years.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [1st

October 2002],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, noting the concern of Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong as highlighted in his National Day

Rally  Speech on "stayers" and "quitters" and in view  of

the  increased mobility of third-generation Singaporeans,

urges   the   Government  to  review  its  policies   and

programmes  thoroughly  and to take  meaningful  measures

that will help to strengthen their sense of belonging  to

Singapore.". - [Mr Gan Kim Yong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon. Member, Mr Gan, and his

team for moving the motion for this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I recognise that this issue has been

thoroughly debated in the public media and in  the  House

yesterday.   But this issue must be clearly addressed  in

this  House, because policies passed by this  House  will

affect  how many Singaporeans ultimately decide to become

stayers  or quitters, or, more importantly, contributors.

Thus,  it  is  crucial that this debate gets  its  proper

airtime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has presented Singaporeans with a

stark  question:   "Are  you  a  quitter  or  a  stayer?"

Several  MPs tried to clarify the distinction  yesterday.

But  I  find the distinction irrelevant.  It is something

that  changes with time and individual circumstances.   A

quitter  then, maybe 20 years ago, can be a returner  now

and contributing, like Mr Hsieh, the Chairman of McKinsey

Asia, or Mr David Gerald, the President of the Securities

Investors  Association, Singapore, whereas a  stayer  now

can become a quitter when the crucial time comes.  No one

can  predict  and we will never know.  Some citizens  may

quit Singapore for various reasons, but still will be our

country's  spokespersons, ambassadors or  business  links

while remaining overseas, and Singapore is better off for

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to elaborate on the more

important term "contributors".  What is important are not

people  who  stay  back or quit Singapore  physically  or

emotionally.  The crux is people who contribute, so  long

as  they are willing to contribute, whether based locally

or  overseas.  This then should be the question:  Are you

contributing  in any way to Singapore - to  the  country,

economy  or  society?  All Singaporeans -  whether  based

locally  or  overseas;  whether  working,  unemployed  or

retired;  whether speaking out for or against  Government

policies  -  so long as their words and actions  promote,

build and improve the image, standing and welfare of  our

multi-cultural  Singapore,  they  are  all  contributors.

Whether one is a cleaner or a CEO, one has a part in  the

growth and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

success  of  our small beloved Singapore, and  should  be

recognised  and respected for this.  Only a few  radicals

who  plan to bomb installations or crash into the  Changi

Airport  control tower are not contributors, and  we  are

better off without them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, almost all Singaporeans, regardless of age and

other factors, such as education or social mobility,  are

contributors to the success of Singapore.   Thus,  it  is

not  correct  for this motion to urge the  Government  to

review  its policies and programmes in view of the  third

generation of Singaporeans only.  Yes, we may  have  many

concerns with the younger generation and may want to give

them  greater  attention.  But, Sir, all  Singaporeans  - whether   young   or   old,  past,  present   or   future

contributors - should be treated with equal concern,  and

serious  steps  should  be  taken  to  strengthen   every

Singaporean's sense of belonging to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move an

amendment to the original motion:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out the words "third-generation".

The  Clerk  will  have copies of the proposed  amendment.

[Copies of amendment distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amended motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, noting the concerns of Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong as highlighted in his National Day

Rally  Speech on "stayers" and "quitters" and in view  of

the   increased  mobility  of  Singaporeans,  urges   the

Government   to   review  its  policies  and   programmes

thoroughly and to take meaningful measures that will help

to strengthen their sense of belonging to Singapore.".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a Straits Times survey, the reasons

that  cause people to consider leaving include children's

education,  high  cost  of  living,  lack  of   emotional

attachments  and  the  high stress  of  keeping  up  with

society.   These  are  factors experienced  by  everyone,

every single Singaporean, not just the young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans are mobile these days, not just

the 3G.  So, any programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

and  policy  review must be wide-reaching and  responsive

enough to cater to the changing needs of citizens of  all

age groups, not just the 3G.  As Ms Chua Lee Hoong of the

Straits Times (ST) rightly pointed out in today's ST, the

chatter is loudest still in the educated middle and upper-middle  classes,  for whom quitting  is  a  real  option.

Thus,  the  Government  needs  to  seriously  review  its

thinking  and role to encourage Singaporeans to  be  more

than stayers, ie, be active contributors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than this small amendment, I give full support

to  this  motion  to urge the Government  to  review  its

policies and attitudes, so that it can take bold and more

meaningful measures to strengthen our residents' sense of

belonging to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is still a young nation. Despite

being  the  most  economically successful  among  younger

nations,  it  is  still a small child when  it  comes  to

nation-building.  We are in the pioneering stage,  trying

to  find and evolve our own uniqueness.  We will take  at

least a few more generations before we can even start  to

consolidate and define what we are about.  We have  taken

three  decades to move from Third-World to First.  It  is

high  time  now for us to spend more effort and resources

to  discuss,  define and build up our own unique  culture

and  values.   When  that  is established,  everyone  who

identifies  with this culture and cherishes these  values

will naturally be drawn to participate and contribute  to

this society and call it home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the time is here now. As the hon. Member,

Mr  Gan,  has also pointed out, the Government  needs  to

give more focus on building our heartware and EQ, and not

simply  hardware.   In  this respect,  I  would  like  to

suggest  four  measures to help strengthen  Singaporeans'

sense of belonging.  They are the four Rs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, redefine the definition of success. The

current path to success is too narrowly defined.  Do well

in school, get a scholarship, gain admission to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

prestigious university, get a good job, own a car and buy

a nice house.  In themselves, there is nothing wrong with

this path.  But problems arise when individuals choose to

deviate from this narrow path.  Success is now framed  in

terms  of  economic  wealth and prosperity,  and  parents

expect and demand their children to strictly follow  this

narrow path towards success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, success must not be so narrowly defined. A

person  should have the assurance from society that  that

society  respects whatever it is he or  she  does  for  a

living and recognises their contributions, be it in arts,

sports, civil society or even opposition politics.  As an

example, are we able to redefine success to include a low

income  social  worker who enjoys  working  with  a  drug

addict, or a factory worker who has built a loving family

and  lives  happily  in  a small  flat?   Unless  society

broadens  its views of success and respects  the  various

kinds  of  contributors, there will always be people  who

will feel no sense of belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, review the Government's action and role in

leading  and directing society.  As citizens  are  always

observing and modelling the behaviours of their  leaders,

the  kiasu  and  kiasi attitudes of Singaporeans  can  be

traced  straight  back to Government  leaders  and  their

attitudes.   Its hard-nosed social and economic  policies

and its push for excellence have created wealth, but they

have  also contributed to the ugly Singaporean who  lacks

culture,  grace  and identity.  Also, the  Government  is

always trying to lead and direct society in the way  that

it  desires.  But is that also where the rest of  society

wants to head?  And at that pace?  Are Government leaders

pushing  our  citizens  too hard?   Will  the  Government

consider slowing down and take the time to listen to what

the  people  really want instead of constantly  directing

and  telling  Singaporeans what is best  for  them.   The

Government  may have made some correct decisions  in  the

past, but it does not mean that all future decisions will

be wise and correct ones.  The Government has no monopoly

on wisdom.  More

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

discussions are needed to bring the citizens on board and

along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, recognise the efforts of contributors, even

those  whose  contributions the Ministers  may  disagree.

While  the Government or a Minister accepts or  adopts  a

suggestion,  it  is  always  a  good  practice  to   give

recognition,  praise or even a pat on  the  back  of  the

contributors and say, "Good work".  Everyone likes to  be

recognised  and praised for good work.  So such  positive

reinforcements will help to promote active citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Government disagrees with an idea, it is

not  necessary for the Government leaders to tear it down

immediately   and  harshly  at  times.    Such   negative

responses  from  the top leaders only help  to  associate

being  engaged  and speaking up with pain, not  pleasure.

This  ultimately  leads  to the conditioned  response  of

being  disengaged,  not contributing,  and  no  sense  of

emotional attachment to the issues concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, reduce the high cost

of  living  here  in  Singapore and  lower  the  indirect

contributions  to  the coffers of  the  Government.   All

Singaporeans  work hard to earn a good living,  build  up

their  nest-egg to start a family, get out  of  that  and

hope  to retire peacefully.  However, with the Government

and  its  linked agencies constantly taking the  lead  in

raising  the  cost  of goods and services  and  depleting

whatever  limited savings one may have, is it any  wonder

then  that  Singaporeans are complaining and planning  to

call it quits, citing high cost as a reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should take a more considerate

approach,  and  not  ruthlessly and relentlessly  try  to

recover  cost  and  expenses in this period  of  economic

difficulty.   When  times  are good,  these  corporations

spend  the  huge  profits  on big  acquisitions  and  big

buildings, incurring high expenses.  But when the economy

turns  bad,  they start looking to the public to  recover

cost.   This is not the way to service and care  for  the

people.  If the Government will learn to take care of the

interests of the people in this difficult

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

period, there will be more appreciative stayers who  will

be  willing to contribute more than their fair  share  to

the  nation, without more carrots or more sticks from the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, to quote our former Speaker, "When it

comes  to the next election, the people will not forget",

and  I  believe that this time round, they will  not,  no

matter how many New Singapore Shares will be given out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, as the

dominant  force in society, should take a  stock-take  of

all  its  actions over the years and determine how  these

have  contributed to our current situation.  Be it little

acts, measures or comments, these can send out more wrong

signals and attitudes than the most massive campaigns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be more tolerant of differences in views, ideas and

expressions.    We,  Singapore,  are  not  a   homogenous

society.   The Government needs to learn -  to  agree  to

disagree, and yet make efforts to work together with  the

detractors.   The Government also needs to free  up  more

space  for civil society to flourish, while allowing  the

citizens   to  learn  how  to  exercise  greater   social

responsibility.  Consider reducing the role and influence

of   the   Government,  which  indirectly  require   less

expenditure  and less funding and thus, less  taxes  from

the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful economy may be built with the right

investment decisions.  But a successful society can  only

be  built by a Government forging a good partnership with

the  people.  It cannot be the case where the  Government

does  all the dictating and ordering and the people doing

all the obeying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a creative, prosperous and vibrant society

is  most evident in an open and mature democracy.  Is the

Singapore Government prepared to give this a try?  I  and

many others hope so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the support of the House on the proposed

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed as an amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out the words "third-generation".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind hon. Members that they should restrict

their speeches to the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to seek your  indulgence  to

allow me to respond to Mr Chia's proposed amendment to my

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the original motion was very carefully crafted

to focus on the key issues at hand, and I went through at

great  length  yesterday in this  House  to  explain  the

wordings  and why the motion was moved.  I also explained

why  we  need  to take into consideration the  challenges

facing  particularly  our third generation  Singaporeans.

And  with your indulgence, Sir, I would like to reiterate

and  elaborate for the benefit of Mr Chia.  Mr  Chia,  in

his  speech, although he proposed the amendment, did  not

go into detail why the amendment was necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain our position. Firstly, we must look

at  the  historical  factor.  I said yesterday  that  the

first  and second generation Singaporeans fought shoulder

to  shoulder against the threat of communist infiltration

and  they  have built amongst themselves a  mutual  trust

that will bind them together. They also went through  the

anguish  of  separation  from  Malaysia  and  they   have

struggled  together  to  find  a  way  for  Singapore  to

survive.    Having  gone  through  the  difficult   times

together as a people, they will stand united as a people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the third generation Singaporeans

grew up in relative peace and prosperity.  We are blessed

with  the  fruits of our forerunners.  There  is  nothing

wrong  in  that, Sir.  We too would want our children  to

have  peace and prosperity.  But the question is  whether

we can replicate the same kind of bonding and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

commitment as our earlier generations while we enjoy  the

peace and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present factor. I also explained

yesterday  that  more and more Singaporeans  have  to  go

overseas  to  work.   This is part of  the  globalisation

policy of the Government and our companies.  The majority

of  these are likely to be the younger generation or  the

third generation Singaporeans.  On top of that, they  are

better  educated.  They are more  mobile  and  they  have

greater exposure to the opportunities that await them  in

other  countries.   On the other hand,  we  are  remaking

Singapore  today for the benefit of this third generation

which will inherit whatever we create.  Should we not  be

concerned of their views and perceptions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the future factor. The third generation

Singaporeans will be our future leaders.   They  will  be

our  future  people.  In fact, they will  be  our  future

hope.   I  would therefore suggest that we cannot  ignore

the   aspirations  and  the  concerns  of   these   third

generation  Singaporeans.  For a motion to be  vague  and

too  broadly-based will be meaningless.  I would like  to

suggest  therefore that we remain focused in this  motion

to   deal   with  our  people  in  the  third  generation

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reference to the third

generation  is an integral part of the motion.   I  would

therefore  like to urge the House to reject the amendment

proposed by Mr Chia.  I would like to move that the House

now takes a vote on the proposed amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out", put and negatived.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment therefore falls and we

return to the original Question that is before the House.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Prime  Minister's National Day message was for the  young

Singaporeans  to  reflect and make a  reality  check  for

themselves.  Sir, how should the 3G Singaporeans respond?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to this call, the 3Gs must be given

opportunities to be involved and to understand issues  at

large.   At the same time, the 3Gs should take an  active

role  in  activities and developments around them.   More

importantly, we need a mindset change, where people  will

provide alternative suggestions and viewpoints and engage

in constructive criticism.  This will add value and allow

views to take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate on this motion should not just

revolve around Government policies and measures that will

keep  quitters  from quitting.  To answer  our  NCMP,  Mr

Steve  Chia, we worry that our 3Gs lack a sense of crisis

and resilience as they practically grew up in the era  of

prosperity, as mentioned earlier by the hon.  Member,  Mr

Gan  Kim  Yong.   Proceeding into  the  future,  what  is

evolving  around them will throw them directly  into  the

global market place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their competitors are no longer local and regional.

Today,  the  global  village is their  competitor.   That

being the case, how tough can current local pressures  be

compared  to  what they would have to face  with  in  the

global village?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge really is how can we facilitate them

to develop the coping mechanisms to cushion the so-called

crisis  of  life.  If they could handle that, they  would

have  developed  this  sense of  crisis  management.   We

should  put  in  place  measures that  would  enable  and

facilitate their adaptation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to incorporate practical learning

into the academic syllabus?  For instance, to educate our

3Gs  on  the  realities of the commercial world  and  the

issues   in  society,  can  we  consider  some  form   of

apprenticeship  in  these fields?   Such  exposure  would

serve  to  mature them through the experience  that  they

will face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no apology needed for Darwin's theory of

the  survival  of  the fittest.  Since  time  immemorial,

societies  had  always  been  made  up  of  stayers   and

quitters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>

This  is not a new phenomenon and not necessarily  a  bad

thing to happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stock and flow process is healthy to a certain

extent   because  it  provides  a  mechanism  that   will

calibrate an eco-system balance in the environment  where

those who remain or come in to join us do so because they

can  find their own comfort level and have found a reason

for  staying.   In  other words, a  small  percentage  of

attrition may not necessarily be bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to us is how can we retain the

different talents across the strata of society to hang on

and play their part for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that the issue before us

today centres around the angst that we all feel about the

Singaporean identity, as articulated by various hon. MPs.

Is there such a thing as a Singaporean identity?   Is the

Singaporean  identity slowly taking shape as  the  nation

becomes  more  rooted to its soil?  Have we cultivated  a

strong  enough and deeply-rooted enough sense of identity

to  provide  ourselves with enough  cultural  ballast  to

withstand  times of stress and tensions in  our  national

fabric?   Perhaps  it  is  timely  that  we  take   every

opportunity to reinforce our cohesiveness as a people, so

that  we feel, we talk and we act as Singaporeans in  the

midst  of the multi-cultural and multi-religious  setting

that we are in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started 10 years ago with the concept of self-help groups which saw the spawning of the CDAC, SINDA,

Mendaki,  Eurasian self-help groups.  These  groups  have

served  their roles well.  Going forward, in view of  the

potentially divisive factors that could arise from the JI

developments, perhaps we should review the model  of  the

self-help  grouping and consider amalgamating them  under

an  umbrella body without disrupting the individuality of

the  self-help  groups.  We can do  more,  for  instance,

within the resource sharing areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is Singapore just merely a nation of

opportunistic mercenaries, populated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

by  people  with  a grab-and-go mentality?   Some  recent

surveys  published  in  the  newspapers  would  seem   to

indicate  that  Singaporeans,  especially  the  3Gs,  are

especially  prone to the notion of seeking better  climes

for  themselves  elsewhere.  Our younger ones  are  able,

educated,  talented,  and they have  a  good  command  of

English.   As such, opportunities abound for  our  people

who want to carve out a niche for themselves elsewhere in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, amid the rounds of speeches and

reactions  to the stayer-versus-quitter debate,  I  would

like to bring a value added dimension for the stayers and

quitters.   Whether  stayers or quitters,  they  all  are

boosters for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean? Well, boosters are Singaporeans who

may  be  working or studying overseas.  Some of them  may

even  have  migrated  to another  country  and  taken  on

citizenship elsewhere.  However, boosters are people with

a  heart  to  do  things  that will  benefit  Singapore's

society  and  economic well-being.   For example   -  and

this  is  to assure Mr Steve Chia  -  that we  are  still

connected   with  our  overseas  so-called  Singaporeans.

There  are  some  Singaporeans in the United  States  and

elsewhere  who have taken on jobs as research scientists,

engineers  and business people.  These Singaporeans  have

"made  it"  in their adopted country.  However,  many  of

them  still maintain ties with Singapore.  These boosters

have  forged  close  economic and business  ties  between

companies  in  the  US   and  those  operating   out   of

Singapore.   So, rather than harp on the fact that  these

Singaporeans   have  found  life  too   disagreeable   in

Singapore  to  prompt  them to move  overseas,  we  could

leverage  upon  the expertise, talents,  connections  and

business potential of the booster population all over the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Overseas Networks (SONs) and the

Singapore  Contact are strategic bridges in  linking  the

boosters to Singapore.  What we must continue to do is to

provide  the  boosters  with  an  easy  passage  back  to

Singapore, even if it is just for a stint.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet and globalisation have brought the world to

our  doorstep.  Singapore may just be a transit hotel  to

many  Singaporeans  who are moving beyond  the  Singapore

shores to seek employment and opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there will arise new 3G boosters whom we will

cultivate  for  contribution each time  they  transit  in

Singapore.   The challenge is how can we lure  them  back

for these intermittent contributions.  It must surely  be

their  family  and  their friends as  well  as  the  easy

access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is concerned with the mobility of the

3Gs.   We are concerned that 3Gs are vulnerable to become

quitters  because  of  Government policies  to  date.   I

support the notion that we can put in place measures  and

programmes  that will inculcate values and encourage  our

3Gs to take ownership of their stake.  These measures can

perhaps commit them to stay in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two weeks ago, upon my return from the AIPO

meeting,  I had an interesting encounter with  a  15-year

old  boy  who  told me that he was not  pleased  with  an

article  entitled  "The 911 overload"  published  in  the

Today  newspaper of 12th September 2002.  He had  written

on  his own volition to the editor of Today to offer  his

views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to seek the Speaker's

permission to circulate a copy of the letter by this boy,

that  was published in the Forum page of Today newspaper,

dated  16th  September.  I would also  like  to  seek  Mr

Speaker's permission to circulate the original full  text

of  the  boy's letter to the Editor.  [Copies of  letters

distributed  to  hon.  Members.]  It  contains  the  full

details  of  his  thoughts.  I have  obtained  the  boy's

permission for this.  And I would like to declare at this

point that this boy is my son.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am recounting would give an interesting

insight  of what goes on in the mind of a 3G 15-year  old

on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

911   tragedy  and  deducing  from  his  letter  and  his

thoughts,  I think there is hope in our 3Gs.   There  are

thinking 3G individuals who would not hesitate to  defend

Singapore  when  it  comes to issues of  sovereignty  and

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the text of the letter, it would seem that

when  this  boy's sense of right or wrong was  put  to  a

judgment  call, when he felt that it was  time  to  speak

out,  surely after some internal reflection of the tragic

events  which took away many innocent lives, he  did  not

hesitate to join in the discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article, "The 911 overload", was published at a

time of mourning when the whole world was remembering the

tragic  loss  of  lives on 911, 2001 with the  Americans.

In  a balanced response to the article, the boy described

the  terrorist  act  as a cruel attack  on  humanity  and

freedom, and disagreed with the author's view that we are

"putting Americans on the pedestal".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reminded that we should remember "the victims of

the  international  community, not just  Americans".   He

then  condemned  the terrorist acts and chided  "peoples'

indifference," and asked, "Do we just sit  on  the  fence

and do nothing and just watch the events unfolding around

us?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this 15-year old can stand in front of a mirror,

reflect  and take on a stand for what he believes  in,  I

think  our  3G  Singaporeans offer hope.  They  do  care.

What  struck me more in the letter he sent to the  Editor

was  his subtle realisation and a reminder of sorts about

Singapore's   vulnerability  and   obligations   in   its

international relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore is a small nation, and we have to

contribute  and  play our part in order to  survive.   We

have  diplomatic ties with the US, and thus it  would  be

right  to  offer  our  condolences  and  support  from  a

political viewpoint.  We cannot isolate ourselves and say

we do not care about what is happening around us.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this 15-year old, like many of his peers,

has inherited that sense of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

urgency  and  survivality from his  forefathers  who  had

laboured  and stayed on in this island state despite  the

early  years of difficulties, because of their  sense  of

rootedness  and their wanting to carve out  a  stake  for

themselves in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we similarly cultivate "stayers" who are

committed  to  Singapore, and will fight for  Singapore's

survival?  In the article, I also detected several facets

of  a  3G Singaporean's value system and views.  He wrote

about  terrorism as an act against our national  security

and  terrorists  as a common enemy of  the  world;  about

standing  up for patriotism, being brave and putting  our

foot  down  instead  of trying to appease  others;  about

denial  of one's country.  To quote him, "I am unable  to

contemplate  on  what  has driven  some  Singaporeans  to

actually plot with Al Qaeda."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's print media and world of connectivity and

relatedness have imprinted powerful images on  the  young

minds.   3G Singaporeans have and will continue  to  have

wider  and  deeper access to a wide array of  information

about  the  world,  values and  peoples.   Together  with

technology  innovations  and a  dearth  of  distance,  3G

Singaporeans,   with  their  increased   mobility,   will

continue  to live in a tighter and closely knitted  world

with all its inherent risks and opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is important that 3G Singaporeans

continue   to   develop  their  critical   thinking   and

analytical  skills  and  examine  hard  their  stakes  in

Singapore,  not  just  for  themselves,  but  for   their

families and fellow Singaporeans.  Whether  "stayers"  or

"quitters", they must have their stakes in Singapore!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no lack of suggestions to

address  the stayer/quitter comment from PM, but we  need

to  move  on.  There was a time when we placed  too  much

emphasis  on the Singapore Dream of the 5Cs.   The  Asian

financial  crisis  and  the  persisting  recession   have

dissipated the Singapore Dream somewhat.  While it is all

right  to  have dreams, it is also a timely wake-up  call

for  Singaporeans  to examine how we should  realise  our

dreams.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more important to create the sort of vision or

stake  that  Singaporeans  can  hold  onto,  not  in  the

materialistic   sense,   but   in   the   emotional   and

psychological  spheres  where  permanent  bonds  to   the

country  can  be established.  Thus, what stakes  can  we

create for the 3G Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the 15-year old boy, if his views and

sentiments may represent the up and coming 3Gs, then  not

all  is  lost  where  the  3Gs are  concerned.   The  two

generations ahead have not laboured in vain for Singapore

and its people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that well connected branches to the vine and

regular   pruning   of  the  fruits  will   ensure   good

offsprings.   So  parenting plays an important  role,  in

nurturing loyalty.  Our concern over quitters may just be

transient  and  their  sense of  disenchantment  may  not

necessarily   trigger  their  mobility  if  they   remain

connected to their vine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I agree that the quitters need managing

and  there still remain the expectations of people to  be

fulfilled.  But alas, expectations vary and are relative.

This  begs  the question of responsibility ownership.   I

would  like  to ask Mr Steve Chia whether it must  always

end up on the Government's lap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really look carefully into the profile of

people who have come back to Singapore and are willing to

speak  about  it, we would see one common  denominator  - they  already  have  a  job  waiting  for  them,  or  are

successful businessmen or professionals who can  relocate

their  offices anytime or move back without  difficulties

or those who are financially very stable where being with

or without a job would not make any difference to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is, of course, the other group of

Singaporeans  who have quit on Singapore, but  have  come

back  as  they cannot make it on the other side as  well.

Do  you see them coming out and tell it as it is and,  if

so,  how many of them?  Does that make them a booster  or

quitter?   I  think  if  they have another  chance,  they

probably would leave again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may want to consider using good slogans and

catchy words with good PR campaign on TV and newspaper to

aggressively  change  the younger  generation's  mindset,

which  seems pretty negative judging from the  number  of

people   commenting  on  the  issues  and  those   silent

observers as well who really do not want to say too much!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the boy's letter, there will be 'fence-sitters' in our midst. Where Singapore is concerned, we

must try to swing the 'fence-sitters' from being quitters

and  influence  both  the  stayers  and  quitters  to  be

boosters for Singapore.  Deducing from the boy's views, a

comforting  point  is that there is an  indication  of  a

sense  of awareness amongst some of our 15-year  olds  of

what  is  happening around us and an ability to  discern,

evaluate and form opinions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most reassuringly is that there is care and concern

for  Singapore amongst some of the 3G 15-year  olds.   We

would   like  our  3G  Singaporeans  to  be  articulating

confidently and candidly, so that our leadership would be

able to take cue from such expressions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that, in reality, not all 15-year olds

would  have the opportunity to do that, but many  of  our

schools  can  do  more  to  encourage  and  nurture   the

awareness and interests of our 3G on events around  them.

For  example,  we  could encourage the schools  to  allow

their  students  space to express their views  and  grant

them  a  say in policies affecting their performance  and

participation.   We should extend the feedback  mechanism

to the students as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact is that we do have caring and thinking

Singaporeans  in our midst.  In January  this  year,  the

grassroots   leaders  and  residents,  comprising   three

generations  of a multi-racial cast of 80 people  of  the

Boon  Lay  Division of West Coast GRC,  got  together  to

produce a musical production for Boon Lay's National  Day

celebration on 10th August.  The theme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

and  title  of this production was "My Heart is  still  @

Home: Boon Lay.com.sg"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message of this production was that as Singapore

globalises, our children might leave our shores  to  seek

opportunities elsewhere, but they would still  come  home

because  their roots are in Singapore and  they  want  to

return  to  their family and friends.  This is where  the

emotional  bond of the family and friends  would  play  a

crucial part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Boon Lay is a real heartlander constituency

and,  in  its midst, is this awareness among the old  and

young  that  we  want  our  children  to  sink  roots  in

Singapore, ie, the branches will remain connected to  the

vine.  How can the family partner Government's efforts to

make this happen?  Is the Government forthcoming in this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, I am happy to note and share with the

Members  of  this  House that the  Government  agency  is

beginning  to  support families in their efforts.   There

was a MPS case which I handled, where a quitter, who is a

professional,  gave  up  his citizenship  to  migrate  to

Australia some 12 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided that he wanted to quit Australia in

November  last year and to return to Singapore where  his

family is.  After at least seven times of meeting up with

myself  and appeals to MOM, he succeeded in returning  on

employment pass.  Today, he works for a business  venture

that  he  has established in Singapore whilst he  was  in

Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an interesting case study of why a

quitter  who is a professional wishes to return home  and

how accommodating Government agency makes it possible for

him  and  his family.  Sir, he has remained connected  to

his family in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to advocate for a one-stop Check and Chat Centre to be set up, to help those in

crisis,  to  counsel those who wish  to  quit  to  remain

connected to the family and, in this instance, Singapore,

and  to  learn more from those who have decided to return

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  This supports what hon. MP Gan Kim  Yong  had

talked about when he mentioned helping those in crisis by

having more connected Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have one-stop centres of all sorts to assist

with  economic  and commercial matters.  It  is  just  as

necessary  that  we  provide  such  support  intervention

centres to assist before these potential quitters call it

quits.   The  soft aspect of dealing with  human  capital

must be quickly put in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we wish for our 3G to stay on, we must not

spare    helping   the   many   retrenched    middle-aged

Singaporeans  return  to the workforce.   Many  of  their

children who constitute the 3G would take cue from  their

parents'  employability and fortunes  to  decide  whether

there is hope for them to stay or they should quit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the WSTP has been well responded to but funds

are drying up and I understand that there is a long queue

for  enrolment.  Lest this turn into a long march, I urge

MOM  to  review the continual financing of this programme

as  the  retrenched middle-aged group  still  needs  that

emotional support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to reiterate that at this time, the real

issues facing Singapore and the world at large are  about

our  sovereignty  and security in  the  wake  of  the  JI

arrests and the looming war in Iraq.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the home scene is the question of employment and

the  ability to be flexible, to be ready and prepared for

new economic fronts that Singapore would be engaged in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be stress on teaching family values to

the  3G  for  after all, society at large is made  up  of

individual  family units.  In this, I urge the Government

to  initiate a yearly family value campaign on "My  Heart

Is  Still At Home", reminding Singaporeans of their roots

and   the   need  to  remain  connected  to  the  family,

especially in the midst of the recent JI developments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be carried under the banner of the Public

Education for Family Committee.  At the same time, Parent

Groups  can  be  trained and equipped with the  necessary

skills  to deliver programmes on family values.   Such  a

subject  complements the National Education programme  in

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I stress that we want

Singaporeans and our 3G to be boosters for Singapore.  To

engage  the  young,  the game will no  longer  be  solely

direct  control through policies.  Rather we have to  win

the hearts and minds of our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young 3G appreciates a story quite different

from  the  well-worn hard sell.  Is there a  tune  around

which  our 3G can be engaged in a romantic song and dance

with the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the frequent economic rhetoric, the

3G  must be engaged from the heart.  I would like to  end

with a phrase that has stood the test of time.  A phrase,

which upon reflection, makes me recall the many instances

of  how  the  old  guard truly reached  out  with  hearts

convicted  by a desire to bring about a better  life  for

all:  "People do not care about what you know until  they

know  you care."  In this, the family structure  and  the

Government have never failed us.  Perhaps, now, it is the

3G to also show that they care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, I would like to thank

Members  for their contributions and suggestions  on  how

the Ministry of Education can help build desirable values

in  our students.  I agree with them generally.  The fact

is  that  our schools are already attempting  to  instill

such   values   and   characters  through   co-curricular

activities  and other activities like the celebration  of

festivals  of  the various races and communities  by  our

students and for our students.  But we all know  that  it

takes time to build that strong character that we want to

see  in  our students and in the younger generation,  and

this is not just the job of our schools or our teachers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested that schools organise

activities  that  encourage teamwork  and  inculcate  the

sense of accountability and responsibility and develop  a

strong  character  in  them that can  accept  failure  of

others as well as their own.  Mr Gan and Mr Chan Soo  Sen

have proposed the inclusion of more stories on patriotism

and  loyalty  in the textbooks.  I thank them  for  their

suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools today place good emphasis on developing

the  character  of their students.  This is  carried  out

through  a wide range of activities and programmes,  both

within  the class and outside.  There is thus no need  to

cut  down the curriculum time for Mathematics and Science

to emphasise character development in our schools.  Apart

from the teaching of civics and moral education in class,

participation  in co-curricular activities  or  the  CCA,

such  as uniformed groups, sports or games, would  enable

students to imbibe sound moral values like accountability

and responsibility.  CCAs like band, choir, orchestra and

dance,  where pupils need to work together as a  team  to

produce  that harmonious synchronisation, teach  students

the  importance  of  teamwork.   Our  students  are  also

actively  encouraged in Community Involvement  Programmes

(CIP)  that give them an opportunity to contribute  their

efforts  to  the  good of others.  These  projects  could

include  taking care of a school gardening plot, sprucing

up  the  void  deck  of a neighbouring  apartment  block,

spending time with the aged and even building a school in

a  neighbouring  country.  Through the CIP,  we  help  to

instill  in  our students a sense of obligation  to  give

back   to   society  and  develop  them   into   socially

responsible adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan suggested introducing programmes to develop

our  students' tolerance for failures.  In schools today,

students  learn  about dealing with  failures  and  other

lessons  in  life  not  only in the  classroom  but  also

through  their participation in co-curricular  activities

and  lifeskills  programmes.   Coaches  and  teachers  in

charge of CCAs also impart

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

values like perseverance and determination.  That is  why

MOE  places high emphasis on CCA programmes and  students

are required to participate in at least one of them.   To

illustrate  the  importance placed in  CCAs,  from  2003,

bonus  points  for CCA participation will also  be  taken

into consideration for university admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Soo Sen and Mr Gan Kim Yong also suggested

using  stories  to  transmit the desired  values  to  our

students.   Teachers are encouraged to use a  variety  of

teaching strategies to inculcate desirable values in  our

students today, including story-telling.  Such values  as

patriotism,  sacrifice  and  responsibility  are  brought

through  the  use  of stories, poems and  proverbs.   For

example,  at  the  primary level where civics  and  moral

education (CME) is taught in the mother tongue languages,

local  heroes like Lim Bo Seng and Lieutenant  Adnan  are

featured  to illustrate personal sacrifice and  love  for

the   country.   Teachers  are  also  encouraged  to  use

traditional cultural stories, poems and proverbs to teach

the  value of patriotism.  For example, Chinese  students

are  introduced to stories of heroes like Su Wu, Yue  Fei

and  Wen  Tian Siang.  A poem about a warrior,  Laksamana

Bentan, who was willing to sacrifice himself for his king

and  country is taught to Malay students.  Examples  from

Sangam  literature  also inculcate  patriotism  in  Tamil

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said earlier, schools alone cannot do

the  job.  A child's education is a responsibility shared

by  the  school and the family as well as the  community.

Schools can only succeed in developing good character and

instilling  sound  values if parents  and  the  community

reinforce the same values imparted in school.   This  was

the  reason why MOE set up COMPASS (Community and Parents

in  Support  of  Schools) in December  1998  to  actively

encourage parents and the community to work together with

schools to help children learn better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to thank Mr Ahmad Khalis for

highlighting  the successful partnership between  schools

and their stakeholders, like the Parents Support

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

Groups, Parent-Teacher Associations, and the old boys' or

old  students' associations.  Mr Ahmad Khalis  knows  the

success and the value of COMPASS very well because he has

been a member of COMPASS for some years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education is a responsibility shared by the

school,  community and also the family.   Here,  I  would

like  to  thank  Members who give their comments  on  the

National Education programme and how the programme can be

improved.   But  schools can only succeed  in  developing

good   and  responsible  citizens  if  parents  and   the

community reinforce the same values imparted in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of MOE, we are aware that an effective

National Education programme must enable our students not

only  to  understand but also to internalise the National

Education  values as well.  That is why MOE  has  put  in

place  programmes in the curriculum and  in  the  CCA  to

promote   National  Education.   National  Education   is

infused  in  subjects  such  as  social  studies,   where

students learn about Singapore's road to nationhood,  the

principles of good governance and, through case  studies,

understand  the  dangers of racial and religious  divide,

and  appreciate  the importance of racial  and  religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the imparting of National Education

knowledge through classroom lessons, schools also conduct

a  wide  variety  of  programmes such  as  the  Community

Involvement   Programme  (CIP)  to  enable  students   to

internalise  the National Education values.   Implemented

since  1998,  the CIP nurtures our pupils to be  socially

responsible   and  helps  them  understand   that   every

Singaporean  has  a role to play in enhancing  the  well-being of the community and the neighbourhood we live  in.

All students do a minimum of six hours of CIP a year.  In

some schools, students have done more than that.  And  in

one school that I have visited personally, many students,

working  with community organisations, have clocked  more

than 20 hours this year alone.  This is commendable.  So,

I would like to encourage Members of Parliament, who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

are  also advisers of grassroots organisations,  to  work

with  schools to encourage our students to do  their  bit

for the community that they belong to, developing in them

the sense of responsibility and common partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since year 2000, schools have also been introduced

to  the concept of service learning.  Service learning is

an approach where the CIP participants not only serve the

community  but also learn to identify the  needs  of  the

community  and  to  reflect on the community  involvement

process, so that they can better appreciate their service

and  the community that they serve.  In addition, schools

actively  enhance pupils' awareness and understanding  of

mulit-racialism, and it is important by  celebrating  the

different festivals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education has also been infused into the

uniformed groups' training programmes in varying degrees.

Those  of  you who were involved in uniformed  groups  in

schools  can  appreciate that sense  of  camaraderie  and

sense  of  purpose among the cadets and  members  of  the

uniformed  groups.   And we have  also  included  in  the

uniformed  groups'  programmes the  infusion  of  various

training that can help them understand their role in  the

community much better.  For example, the formal  training

programmes  include  topics  and  activities   aimed   at

teaching  and instilling in members the values  of  being

responsible and caring Singaporeans.  So they do not just

learn  about how to march or how to perform their  duties

as  cadets  better, but they also learn how  to  be  more

responsible and caring Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of National Education, the Learning Journey

Programme  was  launched in 1998 for school  students  to

visit  relevant places in Singapore, so as  to  sensitise

our students to our history, reasons for our success, and

our  constraints  and vulnerabilities.  For  example,  by

visiting  places, such as Jurong Island, which they  have

now  learned to have been targetted by members of the JI,

students  get  first-hand glimpse of  how  Singapore  has

managed to succeed, despite her constraints of size

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

and limited resources.  So they have also learned why we,

as  Singaporeans, have to continually find  new  ways  to

survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students in our junior colleges and centralised

institutes   are  also  exposed  to  the   thinking   and

principles behind Government policies and actions through

dialogue  sessions  with senior  civil  servants.   These

sessions not only give the students a chance to hear from

the senior civil servants themselves their experiences in

policy  formulation and implementation, but also  provide

them with an opportunity to ask questions and voice their

opinions and concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Gan said that National Education indeed is a

subject of the heart.  It was formally introduced to  our

schools  five years ago, and we should not expect results

quickly.   It  is  also  important  that  the  dosage  of

National Education be calibrated and appropriate for  our

students.  Excessive dosage of National Education may  be

seen  as  overbearing by all students and  undermine  the

National Education effort.  So far, the response received

from  teachers  and students has been  encouraging.   MOE

will   continue  to  work  with  parents  and   community

organisations to inculcate the desired national values in

our students.  We will continue to welcome Members' views

on  how  we can improve our National Education Programme.

But  I would, as I said earlier, also welcome Members  to

work  more closely with our schools so that our  students

can  benefit more from the service that they give to  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng also asked about citizenship education.

Civic  education is a major component in civics and moral

education.   Students at the secondary level  are  taught

that citizenship is more than just legal status.  It also

involves   rights   and   responsibilities.    They   are

introduced  to  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic   of

Singapore   and  how  it  safeguards  their   fundamental

liberties.    Students   also   understand   the   shared

responsibilities    and    inter-relationship     between

Government  and people.  They learn about  the  electoral

process,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

their  responsibilities  as  voters,  the  roles  of  the

President and Members of Parliament.  The goal of  civics

and  moral  education  is also to  nurture  a  person  of

integrity  who  acts  responsibly  to  the  welfare   and

interest  of others and nation in mind.  The syllabus  is

based  on our Shared Values, Singapore family values  and

universal  values.  It emphasises commitment  in  serving

community  and  nation, respect for people  of  different

races,  cultures and religions, and care for  others  and

the  environment.  Students are taught to understand that

putting the interest of society above individual needs is

a major factor responsible for Singapore's success.  They

are encouraged to explore the need to develop a sense  of

emotional  rootedness to Singapore so as  to  ensure  our

survival as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude my remarks on this point by

thanking   all  MPs  who  have  spoken  on  the  National

Education Programme and the character development in  our

schools.   I  would  like to encourage  Members  to  work

closely  with schools again so that they can help develop

in our children and our pupils good character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn very briefly, Sir, to another point

raised  by  Ms Irene Ng.  She wondered why we  should  be

dealing  with  the Malay community more  and  more  as  a

separate  group,  to  be  led  by  the  Muslim  political

leaders.   She  argued  for a more inclusive  and  multi-racial  approach  in  helping  the  different  groups  in

Singapore.   Sir, I appreciate her views, but  we  should

also acknowledge the fact that the different communities,

just  like  different  groups in  Singapore,  have  their

peculiarities and their different aspirations.  Where  we

can help them aspire for the common goals, we should work

together.  I appreciate Ms Irene Ng's offer of assistance

to the Malay community, if I were to consider myself as a

political  leader  of the Malay community,  so  that  the

Malay  community can raise their level of performance  as

other  communities in Singapore.  But, as I said earlier,

we  must also acknowledge at the same time that different

communities  have different issues, different aspirations

and  different  problems, just like different  groups  in

Singapore - the better off and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

the poor, male and female, young and old.  We all have to

help  the different groups in Singapore, as we are trying

to do in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to tell Ms Ng that the Minister-in-charge

of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, has plans to inform

and  brief  Members of Parliament about his  concept  and

vision  for a Community of Excellence.  I think in  time,

you  will know what it means and how you can play a  role

in  helping the Malay community improve on par  with  the

others in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stayers" and "quitters" have been talked and

written  about  by  our citizenry more  frequently  since

August  this year.  And it would appear that these  words

have  brought  about unhappiness and  uneasiness  in  our

Singapore  society generally since they were  highlighted

on  18th August 2002 at the National Day Rally speech  by

our  hon. Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong. I am sure  he

was  sad  and concerned when he said it, and  our  people

were sad when they felt some of them were being labelled,

in some ways, unfairly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure our Prime Minister meant well. However,

on  hindsight, it could be argued that such a topic  need

not be raised, especially at a National Day Rally speech.

It  does  not  help our people at this  stage,  when  the

spirit  of the nation is down and not shining as it  used

to in yesteryears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was careful in his speech when he

restricted  the  ambit  of "quitters"  by  saying  "fair-weather  Singaporeans will run away whenever the  country

runs  into  stormy  weather.   I  call  them  "quitters".

Fortunately,   "quitters"  are  in  the  minority.    The

majority  of  Singaporeans are "stayers".  "Stayers"  are

committed to Singapore.  Rain or shine, they will be with

Singapore."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this topic, having been raised and

discussed, might give us some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

insights into our citizens' hopes and aspirations  whilst

staying in Singapore.  Thus far, from information readily

available  to  the  public,  that  is,  from  the  press,

television,  radio,  Internet  websites  and   Government

statements, it does not appear to be a problem or a major

problem.  If it is a problem faced by the Government,  it

has  not  been  felt too strongly by  the  people.   More

transparent evidence is required to convince the  man  or

woman  in  the  street that there are many quitters  -  a

percentage that is too large for the nation's good.   The

public should be given more information and statistics of

people  migrating from Singapore, in terms of race,  sex,

age  groups, educational level, income level, those  with

relatives  who  are  already  abroad,  where   they   are

migrating to and why they wish to migrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, there seems to be more "quitters"

from abroad coming to Singapore to work and live and  try

and  apply  to be "stayers" - even permanent  stayers  by

trying  to  be  permanent residents  or  applying  to  be

citizens   of   Singapore  under  the   Constitution   of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stayers" from Singapore, or abroad, are a good

thing  for Singapore as a whole.  "Quitters" are, we  are

told,  bad  for  Singapore.  Is the basis for  "good"  or

"bad"  measured  mainly by "economic"  yardsticks?   Some

people  may  argue  that,  in  certain  quarters,  it  is

perceived  as  an insult to Singapore and our  Government

leadership for any citizen to leave Singapore because the

Government cannot understand why some of our citizens  do

leave  Singapore to go abroad temporarily or permanently,

although  the Government has put in so much of hard  work

to   make   Singapore  a  success,  and   internationally

recognised as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best to leave human beings alone on this

matter  -  let  them decide what to do with their  lives.

Quitters  may  not  be  disloyal to  the  nation.   Also,

stayers  may  not  be  the greatest  of  loyal  citizens.

Quitters may want to leave Singapore for various  reasons

-  and the reasons are very personal and subjective.  And

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

Government need not and should not decide for  them,  nor

should  they judge them.  The Government should  be  less

interventionist  in  their  approach  towards   governing

Singapore in this context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred way to ensure that not too many caring

Singaporeans  leave Singapore permanently or  temporarily

is to ensure that our Government (the Executive and civil

service),  the  Legislature and  the  Judiciary  run  the

country  and  our  national institutions fairly,  justly,

equitably,  compassionately and democratically  -  giving

space  and choices wherever possible to all our  citizens

and  residents in Singapore.  And therefore, there  would

be  less  opportunity for complaints amongst  disgruntled

citizens.   A  government that is  self-disciplined  with

responsibility  towards  the  nation  and  its  citizens,

having compassion and kindness, doing their level best to

give  as much happiness and peace of mind as possible  to

its  people,  creating friendship between government  and

its   people  (whether  PAP  or  opposition  supporting),

encourage better work, respect and dignity given to  each

worker  and improved wages for them, spreading of  wealth

amongst  citizens  more  equitably,  having  a  sense  of

honesty and loyalty to citizens, creating space for  non-politicians  -  these are the areas the  Government  must

review  and  improve  upon - and more  citizens  who  are

thinking  of migrating, may decide to stay in  Singapore.

Generally,  they want more political space and  that  the

Government  should have less power and control  of  their

lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, most people will accept that our

Government  has  done  well in  bringing  about  economic

prosperity,  security  and  a comfortable  life  to  most

people  in  Singapore compared to ASEAN  countries  as  a

whole.    How  about  other  sectors  of  activities   in

Singapore?   Will  the way Singapore is run  and  managed

make  its  people truly happy and contented?  What  about

culturally,  in  terms  of liberalisation  of  the  arts,

theatre,  plays, films, forums, seminars, night life  and

leisure-related activities;  what about political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

freedom,  removal of OB markers, less fear of  defamation

suits by Ministers against opposition politicians.  There

may  be  more complaints in these fields.  The Government

may  need to be more enlightened and more liberal so that

our  citizens  are exposed to and allowed  to  experiment

more.   They  need  to  be given that  choice.   Citizens

should  not be made to feel restricted, disorientated  or

alienated.  Further, there should be less stress in life.

The  sector  that feels so may want to leave the  country

for good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a major decision to leave one's country for

another.   It is preferable if he or she is not labelled.

Ask  ourselves why they are leaving.  Very  personal  and

subjective reasons will be given - for greener  pastures,

perception  that  there is too much of  stress  at  home,

school and workplace, greater opportunities for them  and

especially  their children's future, get away  from  high

cost  of living, high cost of medical care, no social  or

welfare care compared to other countries, like Australia,

Canada,   England  or  United  States  of  America,   too

competitive to get to tertiary institutions, no space for

different forms of liberal recreation, get away from over-regulation,  over-governance, too much  of  paternalistic

governing, too rigid laws and too harsh punishments,  too

much  or  overzealous  prosecution  in  court,  perceived

unfairness in treatment of opponents, opposition parties,

non-political    party   individuals,    non-governmental

organisations,  school system and ranking system  causing

trauma,   tension   and  unhappiness  amongst   children,

parents,  teachers, principals, etc.  All these and  many

more  reasons are subjective and very personal (and  they

may  be  real or perceived) - and the Government may  not

have  all the expertise to resolve these issues,  or  the

moral  or  legal  authority to stop  these  thoughts  and

therefore  movements  or  migration  from  Singapore   to

especially Western, ASEAN or Asian countries.  Just  like

so  many foreign citizens from these other countries  are

coming  to  Singapore  to  make  it  their  temporary  or

permanent home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should just leave these people to decide

whether to leave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

temporarily  or to migrate permanently.   We  should  not

have  double  standards  - on  the  one  hand  to  invite

foreigners  to  come to Singapore and not be  happy  when

Singaporeans leave Singapore.  One might guess that it is

the  better off citizens (financially and education-wise)

who are leaving and therefore the Government is concerned

and  unhappy.   It  is part of the fear  of  brain  drain

syndrome.  These people may also be, relatively speaking,

more  critical  and cynical citizens who  have  exercised

their  own  preference.  And unless  the  above-mentioned

complaints  are  addressed  and  remedied,  migration  by

Singaporeans might not diminish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can do to try and attempt to

minimise  the  outward flow, if really necessary,  is  to

review   the   mindset   of  the  political   and   other

leaderships,  to  see if they are able  to  accept  these

facts  of  life.   And if the people give  feedback  that

there must be changes and the powers-that-be do not  wish

to  make  changes, then there is an impasse.  The problem

would then remain and it would be sad for the nation as a

whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many citizens, especially our younger people, are

more   internationalised,  having  been  better  educated

beyond O-levels, A-levels, polytechnics and universities,

having  studied locally and abroad.  They have more  open

and  liberal  minds.   They  want  political  and  social

freedoms.   And they want politicians to open up  and  be

less  powerful  and  paternalistic.   They  have  greater

options.  They are more mobile and are more confident and

ambitious.   Their parents are wealthier and  have  fewer

children  to  support - two or three today,  compared  to

larger  numbers in the 1950s and 60s.  Most  of  our  top

civil   servants  and  Government  officials,   Ministers

included,  studied  abroad.   They  may  have   been   on

scholarships and, therefore, bonded and had to come home.

I  would like to think they came back to serve our nation

besides  their  own families.  All our  citizens  who  go

abroad  temporarily or permanently should be  treated  as

Singapore's  "ambassadors", and they can serve  Singapore

as our external friends, both in the region and globally.

They will be Singaporeans at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

heart.  Treat them well.  It is never too late.  Keep  in

touch with them.  Help them where possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current exercise of remaking Singapore must be

carried  out across-the-board in all sectors of Singapore

society.   In  discussing remaking  Singapore,  citizens,

residents  in  Singapore,  senior  civil  servants,   the

Cabinet, legislature and judiciary must all come  to  one

level  playing  field and toss their ideas and  long-held

beliefs  to be tested by others.  The top echelon  should

not  only receive reports from the various main and  sub-committees  of  the Remaking Singapore Committee.   Their

ideas  must  be tested and approved also.   If  not,  the

result  may not be very effective for Singapore  for  the

next lap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Remaking Singapore dialogue sessions have seen

many  good  and  innovative suggestions  which,  in  many

instances,  have  been  voiced  by  citizens,   including

professionals,  non-governmental  organisations,   think-tanks  and grassroots leaders in the last decade or  even

longer.  These ideas must now be seriously considered  by

the  top  and elite Government leaders fairly and  justly

with  an open mind.  A national debate for, say,  one  or

two  months,  on television, radio, newspapers,  seminars

and  conferences, with all sectors participating, without

exception,  might  do good for the  soul  and  spirit  of

Singapore.    It   will  create  a   greater   sense   of

togetherness, comradeship, camaraderie, gelling of  minds

and consensual style of life in Singapore henceforth, and

anyone who is against proper discussion and debate should

be  enlightened  and  led  to see  the  light  in  proper

dialogue  sessions.  It must not be a top-down system  of

accepting  views  and suggestions.  Singaporeans  may  be

tired  of  this  style of government and want  a  change,

preferably a more liberal, democratic way of governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also review and, if thought fit in today's

context,  amend the relevant legislation in Singapore  to

create the right spirit and way of life in Singapore,  so

that  people  who are thinking of leaving  Singapore  for

good could be persuaded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

to  change  their minds, and stay and contribute  towards

the well-being of Singapore.  These include, inter alia:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore,

especially  Articles touching on fundamental  rights  and

citizenship;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) the Societies Act, to liberalise activities of

our   more   than   5,000   civic  and   non-governmental

organisations, sports organisations, religious bodies and

voluntary   organisations,  and  less  control   of   and

sanctions against them;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the Internal Security Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) the Vandalism Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) the Penal Code and other criminal laws;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) the Criminal Procedure Code, and review of

Singapore   society's   need  to  adopt   the   preferred

principles    of   sentencing,   such   as    deterrence,

rehabilitation and reformation, and modes  of  punishment

like imprisonment, fines, caning, probation, etc; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Statutes governing the press and mass-media and

the  need  to liberalise these and have less governmental

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider the merits of introducing

the  equivalent  of  the  Race  Relations  Act,  the  Sex

Discrimination  Act,  a  Human  Rights  Act,  Freedom  of

Information   Act,  and  amend  the  various   "stifling"

legislation touching on life in Singapore as a whole,  so

that  we  will have a more fair, just, compassionate  and

more  participative society, where citizens and residents

are  given  more say and power in deciding the future  of

our lives in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it may be prudent to set up a

machinery  to  interview citizens who are migrating  from

Singapore in order to obtain frank disclosure and genuine

feedback  from  them  as to why they  are  leaving.   The

Government  can then take remedial measures  to  minimise

this perceived problem.  This would, in some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

way,  reflect  the  compassionate side of  our  Singapore

Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I seek a clarification from the hon.

Nominated  Member  of  Parliament when  he  said  in  his

opening remarks - I think the word used was unfortunate - to bring up this phrase on stayers and quitters?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Did he mean to imply that it was

wrong  for  the  Prime  Minister to  talk  about  rooting

Singaporeans to Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Not at all. I think it

was unfortunate in terms of the timing.  It was a mood in

which  the country was progressing, and when a term  like

"quitter"  is  used and some people are affected  by  it,

they get a bit concerned and disappointed.  But I am sure

the  Prime  Minister, when he addressed Singaporeans,  he

meant well, and that is what I have stated in my speech.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of

the debate, a number of Members have elaborated on issues

related  to  education as a push factor that  could  turn

Singaporeans  from stayers to quitters.  I  am  not  sure

what the hon. Nominated Member of Parliament, despite his

answer,  means.  I am not sure whether there  is  ever  a

best time to discuss when one should stay or quit.  And I

had originally intended to be an appreciative listener in

this  debate.   But  I  find so much  rubble  thrown  and

accumulated at my feet in the Ministry of Education  that

I  feel  compelled to join in the fray, lest I get buried

in  the rubble.  Not that this feeling of being buried is

novel.   Since  day one at the Ministry of  Education,  I

have  been  subjected to an avalanche  of  feedback  from

family,  friends,  Singaporeans and foreigners  in  every

committee that I sit - CEOs, technicians, line operators,

all sectors of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safe to assume that there are at least twice

as many views as there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

people  in  Singapore on the Ministry of  Education.   In

fact, if you ever wanted to start a conversation, all you

have to do is utter the eight magical words: what do  you

think of our education system?  You will excuse me  if  I

do  not use that line often.  Well, Minister of State for

Education, what are you going to do about it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, first, listen carefully. And I want to

assure  Members that I do listen, as do the Ministers  in

Government, Permanent Secretaries, directors and, more or

less, 24,000 teachers that we have in the system, many of

whom also have children within the school system.  We are

not   impervious  or  blind  to  the  current  system   - unaffected   nor   detached  -   because   we   too   are

stakeholders.   And  I  assure  you  my  stakes  give  me

feedback every dinner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this angst among Singaporeans about our

education  system is healthy.  It implies  a  measure  of

ownership,  that  Singaporeans  see  themselves  as   co-travellers   and  co-builders  in  our  great   education

enterprise - our investment and legacy for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat in this House yesterday and today, this is

what  I  heard.  Despite all the good in the system,  the

hon.  MPs said our education system is too stressful.   I

think  most of them said that - not holistic, not focused

enough  on  academic  attainments,  too  narrow  in   its

definition  of success, too prescriptive,  it  gives  too

little  choice - whether it is in the choice of a  second

language  or even in the choice of schools - that  we  do

not  allow mainstream Singaporeans to enter international

schools;  not  inclusive enough  to  address  those  with

special needs and learning disabilities; our system  does

not  endear our students because we make them feel second

or, even worse, third-class; too elitist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us will remember the ITE debate in this

House.    Make   people  feel  good,  they   say,   about

themselves;  discover  and play up their  strengths,  not

their  weaknesses;  create more  opportunities  to  allow

people  to progress, especially the polytechnic  students

to enter the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

universities, the ITE students into polytechnics, and the

like.    All   these  recommendations  seek   to   enrich

Singaporeans.  So let us ask the obvious:  why  would  we

not  want  these  egalitarian  outcomes?   If  it  is  so

obviously good, why has it not already happened?  Indeed,

why not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that the new MPs, who spoke so

passionately on this subject, are not so arrogant  as  to

think  that enlightenment has only been endowed on  their

vintage, and that the past leadership was myopic  in  its

policies.     After   all,   the   World   Yearbook    on

Competitiveness repeatedly ranks the Government  and  the

infrastructure that it has built as first in  the  world.

So why have we not approached an educational utopia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can forget ourselves; who we are. By

dint of geography and a capricious twist of history,  all

we  landed up with were 640 square kilometres of land and

each other.  Dr Ong Seh Hong's point bears repeating: who

owes  Singaporeans a living?  Indeed, we are an  economic

anomaly.   Nothing  in  our  constellation  projected  or

predestined us to enjoy prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now spend about 4% of our GDP on education.

About   25%  of  total  Government  spending  goes   into

education,  the largest component, somewhat on  par  with

defence.   In  absolute  dollar  terms,  we  spend  equal

amounts on our tertiary students, as do countries in  the

OECD.   How  is  this possible for a small  country?   We

could do so because we took extremely hard choices in our

educational   policies,  to  survive  economically   and,

indeed,  socially.   Can we afford to  continue  spending

vast  amounts  in education?  Is it a given?   Many  hon.

Members  here, including us new ones, experienced  first-hand  the  effects of this recent economic downturn.   If

the  recession stretched longer, would we  have  had  the

luxury  of  this debate on education and,  indeed,  would

people care?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as much as we malign our economic underpinnings

in  our educational system, it has served us well.   With

limited resources, we focused on educational

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>

fundamentals.  We said let us build great schools in  all

sectors  and  across  the island.   So,  whether  it  was

primary, secondary, junior college, ITEs, polytechnics or

universities, they had to strive to be the  best  in  the

world,  teaching not some Singaporeans,  but  all  to  be

literate  and numerate.  Stated so glibly, but  think  of

what  the  realisation  of  that  vision  entails  -  the

thousands of teachers we have to attract and train,  made

no  easier  by  an increasingly fractious  and  demanding

public;  the schools we have to build and the  curriculum

we have to devise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we succeeded? Unequivocally, yes. This very

debate  is  symptomatic  of  that  success.   Many  other

countries debate for generations how to arrive at what we

have  achieved,  and then some more.  Let me  illustrate.

Let  us  look  at  our PSLE results - the  percentage  of

students  who get an "A" or "A+".  More than 40%  get  an

"A"  or  "A+"  in English, Mathematics and Science.   And

despite the furore over our mother tongue, 80% get "A" or

"A+"  in Chinese.  It is because we have managed to raise

the tide across the island, giving opportunities and good

teaching to heartlanders and cosmopolitans alike, that we

now have a problem of what we call "stress".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our system school-proof. What do I

mean?   It  means  that if we have the aptitude  and  are

willing  to work at it, any school in Singapore will  get

you  there.  That is what creates the pressure.  This  is

the  pressure-head.  So when I do my  walkabouts  in  Toa

Payoh, or at Pei Chun School, which is one of the leading

schools  in  my constituency, and see the drive  of  some

students  and  their parents, I shudder for  my  children

because  of the competition.  Is this drive to excel  and

compete counter-productive?  Should we try to equalise it

and  distort  educational objectives  to  reduce  stress?

How?   If  I  lower the bar, more just clear  it.   If  I

introduce more subjects or events, can I be sure that the

same  driven students, who excelled previously, will  not

try  to  excel  in those new subjects and add  even  more

pressure for themselves and others?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>

Should  we do away with examinations?  It is a rhetorical

question.   How  do you and should you stop  parents  and

students wanting to do well and get ahead of others?  Can

we,  for instance, legislate limits to studying hours  or

outlaw or close down all tuition centres?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the education system is a lightning

rod  for  stress but the tensions emanate  from  society.

Society  filters what it deems important.  MOE  routinely

publishes  information  on  schools  that  have  achieved

awards  in  CCA  as well as academic results.   But  more

attention is paid to the latter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our assessment of schools using the School

Excellence Model, academic results only count for 15%  of

the evaluation.  As much as our processes are aligned  to

do  what many of the MPs have called for, society  steers

itself  towards a preferred direction.  Society places  a

high  premium  on certain jobs such as lawyers,  doctors,

etc.   And  it  is not a passive receiver.  Even  if  you

change  the system, it will respond.  It is a problem  of

success  and  should be seen as such, not certainly  with

the  angst, chest-beating and hair wrenching that we see.

In  fact,  we  get more praise about our  successes  from

foreigners than Singaporeans which, if we think about it,

must  discourage many of our teachers.  Some  Members  of

Parliament   have  encouraged  Government   to   say   to

Singaporeans  "Well  done" if they do.  I  wonder  how  a

teacher feels listening to this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this. In the Third International

Mathematics  and  Science  Study,  93%  and  80%  of  our

Secondary  Two students were above international  average

for  Mathematics  and  Science.  Schools  in  the  United

States are using our textbooks on Mathematics and Science

and MOE recently signed an MOU to facilitate transfer  of

expertise.  In my recent trips, the Deans of the top  USA

universities  said this, "There is only one  thing  wrong

with  the  Singapore students.  We do not get  enough  of

them."   I asked the programme director and lecturers  of

our  SMA  Alliance, which is the Singapore-MIT  alliance.

We met in MIT.  This is a programme that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>

teach  on  video,  so  it is cross-distance.   They  have

students  in  NUS  campus, NTU and MIT  -  same  lecturer

delivering to three different groups across the globe.  I

asked  the programme director in SMA, whom we met in  MIT

recently,  if the Singapore students they teach  were  on

par with their students in MIT.  I was not trying to fish

for  comments.  This was a serious question  and  it  was

asked  in  that  tone.   This  was  among  the  programme

director   and   the  MIT  lecturers.   The   reply   was

instantaneous  and  unanimous  -  definitely   so.    Our

students are on par with them and they want more of them.

MNC,  CEOs  in  Singapore tell us that we have  the  best

polytechnics  in  the  world  and  how  they  wish  their

government and electorate would follow our model.   These

are  not  CEOs from under-developed countries.  They  are

from developed countries like Germany and other parts  of

Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of their feedback is this. Our

educational system prepares the majority of our  students

to  succeed anywhere in the world.  We have been able  to

do  this  because  we focus on educational  fundamentals,

building  great  institutions and teachers,  rather  than

trying   to  satisfy  all  aspirations.   We   knew   our

limitations  and our constraints and we are  reaping  the

fruits  of  our success.  Unfortunately, some fruits  are

not  as  sweet as we like, which is this debate.   It  is

symptomatic of our success, as I said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung pointed out yesterday that what

was   enough  for  him  appears  inadequate  for  others,

something  which  he and I find inexplicable.   Take  the

example quoted by our MPs of the polytechnic student  who

is  able to get his degree overseas in a shorter time but

feels aggrieved towards Singapore because he cannot enter

public   universities.   Thankfully,  they  are  in   the

minority.   A lot of polytechnic alumni do recognise  the

academic  and  rigorous education  they  receive  at  the

polytechnic, help them get a degree and remain  committed

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do we progress having succeeded so far?

Firstly,  focus on the fundamentals that have  served  us

well and let us not get distracted.  Secondly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>

accommodate  diversity.  Yes, we  have  reached  a  point

where we should and must respond to individual needs  and

talents.   Thirdly,  involve partners  in  the  education

process.   Mr  Ahmad  Khalis and  Mr  Hawazi  alluded  to

COMPASS  where schools, parents and communities synergise

their  efforts and inputs to plot direction and pace.   I

agree  with  him  that this process of  engagement  is  a

winning formula and we could do more of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend at the outset to

answer  specific queries about the Ministry of Education,

or  issues  raised about education.  I do not think  that

this   debate   will  end  here.   Some  of   the   older

parliamentarians said they asked the same questions 15-20

years ago and we are asking them now.  And I suspect  15-20 years hence, they will be asking the same questions in

this House.  But let us see the debate as a positive one.

This engagement in the process where we contribute to the

building  of our educational institutions is in the  very

spirit  that the motion calls for, which is a process  of

engagement,  stakeholdership  and  ownership.   We   have

reached  a stage where there are no easy answers  and  we

will have to plot our future together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that spirit, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Point of clarification,

Sir.   Would the Minister of State not agree with me that

our  students  do well in examinations only because  they

prepare for examinations and it does not necessarily mean

that  our  students are well-trained and prepared  to  be

analytical and questioning?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, if helping to prepare them well

and  do  excellently in our Ivy League  colleges  is  not

considered analytical, or to have the ability to stand on

par  with the top institutions in the world, then I would

concede the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Minister of State not

agree  that  the people who qualify for these Ivy  League

universities  are not necessarily representative  of  the

majority of students in Singapore?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

would  be  pleasantly surprised if he saw the  number  of

Singaporean students that has entered these universities.

It  is  said that for Stanford and UPenn, Raffles College

sends the largest number of students in any school across

the world.  The truth is, even in our other institutions,

for example, the polytechnics, tracer surveys showed that

as many as 50-60% get degrees five years from the time of

graduation.   In  our educational system,  the  tide  has

risen so high that the majority of our students, not only

the  cream, can enter any educational system in the world

and succeed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the Minister of State to clarify his measure  of

success.  From what I have been hearing in his speech and

also from the questions that he had answered, his measure

of  success  is  entry into top universities  around  the

world.   But  my question is:  does the Ministry  measure

success  by  the  performance of  Singaporean  graduates,

whether  they  study  in Singapore or  overseas,  in  the

workplace and how do we compare our graduates with  those

from  the rest of the world?  Do we have examples of very

successful Singaporeans outside Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I rephrase the

question back to the hon. Member?  Is he suggesting  that

our students have not succeeded?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is:

what  is  the measure of successful graduates or students

out   of  the  Singapore  system?   Yes,  they  are  very

successful  when  they make it into universities  because

they  score very well in examinations.  But whether  they

are better off in their working life, I have my doubts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I would take offence to that

statement,  Mr  Speaker.   I  graduated  from   a   local

university.  I have been told I am quite successful and I

do quite well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister's National Day Rally Speech was a

call  to our people to huddle, to understand and to  find

ways  to  tackle the challenges that we have  identified.

It was a call to be on guard and to expect new challenges

that  will crop up as a result of situations that we have

no  control over.  It was meant as the occasion was  for,

to  rally  our people at a time when racial and religious

tensions could make a tear at our social fabric  that  we

have so painstakingly built over the last 30 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech was a call to have people come on board

and  for those who are already on board to stay on  board

for  the  Singapore  cause, and  that  is  the  continued

survival and success of our young nation.  Along the way,

the social contract between the Government and the people

will  ensure that we continue to create new opportunities

for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of labels of quitters and stayers sparked

off fiery debates in the press and touched on reasons why

some  Singaporeans think of emigrating.  We read of  many

testimonies of stressed Singaporeans, the cry for a  lack

of  space  for  individual expression, and the  demanding

education system all thrown in for good measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked a friend, a foreigner, who has since become

a  Singaporean,  what did he think  about  the  labels  - quitters  and  stayers.  He said  that  during  a  recent

crisis  in  this country, he had to push his cupboard  to

block  the window so that people could not break  in  and

loot.   Then, he went to a bedroom and an adjoining  wall

with  the house next door and used a metal mallet to hack

a  hole in the wall to go into the other house.  A family

member  peeped  out  and saw his neighbours  kneeling  in

front  of  the  house being whipped,  spray  painted  and

taunted.   He  said that he became a Singaporean  because

our Government spent the last 37 years thinking of such a

scene and thinking of such scenarios so that our citizens

do  not have to think about it every day for the last  37

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of labels, while I will not classify

Singaporeans broadly into quitters or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>

stayers, I cannot ignore the phenomenon revealed by  PM's

use of these two labels.  This is the crux of this motion

today. These are real concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that some Singaporeans are stressed

either  by  the pace of life or stressed by worrying  for

their children whom they feel are unnecessarily stressed.

Hence,  for  this group of Singaporeans, they  feel  that

migrating  to another country will resolve and take  care

of  these  problems. They are merely making  choices  and

deciding  that  they may not want to  keep  the  kind  of

frenetic pace at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may decide to earn less or they are at a point,

where they have enough savings and earning capacity,  for

them to make the move.  It may even be all right for them

to  pay  a  little bit more tax but have  their  children

learn at a more relaxed pace. They are not quitters,  but

merely  Singaporeans who ironically have  benefited  from

the  political  and  social stability  that  afforded  an

economic growth and an education system that helped  give

the same people that global mobility that they now wield.

They  may  become Australians or Canadians but they  will

still be Singaporeans at heart.  Our best wishes to  them

and  hope that they can afford to come back often  enough

to  keep the links.  Of course, there are those who  have

left  due  to  attractive job offers.  For that,  we  are

proud  that they are representing Singapore in a  foreign

land  and  hope  that they too will return  one  day  and

contribute  their wealth of experience they  have  gained

while being overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am also consoled by the fact that many

who  had  considered  migrating for  these  reasons  have

stayed  as  they felt that some of the difficulties  they

faced  at  a  point  in  time can  be  overcome  and  the

emotional  aspects  and  familial  ties  that  bind  them

existed.   And they are strong enough to keep them  home.

They  make adjustments and indeed work on reducing stress

on  both  themselves  and that of their  children.   They

ponder  about  how life would be like, as many  of  their

friends  and  family are here if they had emigrated.   As

Senior Minister of State, Mr Matthias Yao,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>

had  said in 1997, it is actually a good thing that these

Singaporeans  go through the mental process  in  deciding

whether to emigrate or not.  They would have become  more

aware  of  the benefits of life in Singapore  than  those

whom  the thought of leaving is furthest from even  their

wildest dreams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may even realise that the preparedness of their

children for the future can be best achieved here.   They

realise  that their children are not just competing  with

their  fellow classmates in Singapore, or for that matter

in  Australia.  But the time will come when they  may  be

competing  for  a job, say, in Shanghai, with  his  peers

named  Nguyen  from Vietnam, Minh from Myanmar  or  Zhang

from Beijing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stress faced by children, many have expressed the

uphill  task of tackling Chinese in school.  I wonder  if

the Education Ministry can entertain the possibility that

the  Chinese language education in lower primary be  more

focused on conversational than anything deeper.  Let  the

child  be  comfortable in conversing in the  language  so

that  he is not overwhelmed.  Many of the parents  citing

this  problem are probably English educated and find that

they  are unable to teach their children but to employ  a

tutor.  This adds to the stress level of both parent  and

child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleague, Mr Gan Kim Yong, mentioned in

his  speech  when  he  moved the motion  yesterday,  that

through stories, strong values and character building can

be  taught  to  our children.  Interest  in  the  Chinese

language would not be killed off in the process to master

a  higher standard of Chinese.  This can perhaps be later

developed  and achieved through the child taking  on  the

subject  as  an  elective perhaps  in  upper  primary  or

secondary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of creating an emotional bond to

Singapore,  I  hope that the Government can  continue  to

play a part in promoting family and community events that

bind  all  with  a common experience.  Many  of  us  will

remember outings with our family along Elizabeth Walk  in

the 1960s.  Our children will probably

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

remember  the surrounds of the Esplanade or the sound  of

the  shutters in the concert hall adjusting to  suit  the

next piece of music to be played by world-class musicians

performing  on our shores.  The experiences, the  senses,

the  images of an ever changing Singapore must find a way

into  the  hearts of our people.  This  is  the  kind  of

connection  and  engagement that my hon. colleagues  have

all  talked about.  I believe this will play  a  part  in

instilling some sense of belonging in our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that the 3G Singaporeans are born after

1965.   I  was born a few months before 1965 and I  would

classify  myself  as one.  Like my other  3G  Singaporean

parliamentary colleagues here, the 3Gs are used to almost

instant  responses, like e-mails, the SMS and,  in  time,

MMS.  The work environment mostly functions on a "you are

as  good as your last deal" framework.  We can be and are

often irked by some responses from Government departments

to  our  questions  and,  on  occasions,  by  Ministerial

responses in this House to our questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to many 3G and some 2G, they feel that they

have  no voice, no space to express their viewpoint,  and

when  told that they can join the many feedback channels,

they  feel that it is hopeless and they express disbelief

that it is of any efficacy.  The Government must work  at

changing this perspective of the 3Gs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do that is maybe through engagement and

the  participation of young Singaporeans in  the  policy-making   process.    That  way,  an  insight   into   the

constraints that policy makers are faced with,  will  let

the  3Gs understand what are the larger and other  stakes

that  are  involved  and  the concerns  that  are  to  be

considered.   Perhaps  we can consider  forming  a  youth

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the 1Gs and some 2G Singaporeans would

probably  say that we trust the Government  to  do  their

best  as  they  have done for the last  37  years,  going

forward,  I do not realistically think that the 3Gs  will

feel that same way.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that if more Singaporeans, particularly

younger  Singaporeans, or what we call the 3Gs, are  made

more acutely aware of the concerns of our country, we may

have more constructive participation and people will  not

feel  that  policies are dished out, and you just  follow

them,  because, as a matter of fact, you do not know  any

better.   That  way, the connectivity with these  younger

drivers  of  the Singapore cause will be  enhanced.   The

engagement or perhaps the social contract with them  will

thus be stronger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is interesting that my hon.

colleague, Mr Chandra Mohan, mentioned that our Ministers

and top civil servants went overseas to study and had  to

fulfil  their bond and come home.  I was not good  enough

to  have  that  Government scholarship.  I went  overseas

too, and I came home and my bond was with Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few of us students got together to put on a

Singapore  Night for our foreign students.   By  default,

because  of  skin  tone, I played the  role  of  Raffles.

There was a Mr Farquhar, and we found three gentlemen   - two  of them very tall with very pronounced foreheads   - to  play SM Lee and Dr Goh Keng Swee.  And the other,  we

found a person with very thick-rimmed glasses to play  Dr

Toh Chin Chye.  What happened was that the fire played by

these  three  characters made our American friends  very,

very  interested  and  impressed.  Back  stage,  I  asked

myself,  "After this play, what's my role for Singapore?"

My bond was to come home and to be engaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the journey and the task before us

are  long and arduous, but not insurmountable as long  as

Singaporeans have a heart to commit their time and  their

passion for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support

of  the motion proposed by my hon. colleague, Mr Gan  Kim

Yong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pose four questions to Members of

this  House  and,  in essence, to all Singaporeans.   The

four questions are the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Who are we? Do we have a sense of identity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What do we stand for, or what are our ideals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What do we owe Singapore? Or do we have a sense of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gratitude?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What role do we play in Singapore? And this is a

question  which perhaps is especially so for the younger,

3G Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the first question - identity.

Singapore  and Singaporeans are a 37-year  old  fluke  of

history and geography.  In the eyes of some people,  this

is  a  joke.   Are we just the southern tip of  Malaysia?

Are we just another island in the Riau Archipelago?  Look

around  this House, were all of us born here?  Do we  all

speak the same languages?  We do not even believe in  the

same God.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and our identity only exist because of an

act  of  will.   Singapore citizenship is  not  based  on

genetics, history or geography.  Singapore citizenship is

based  entirely upon allegiance to a set of ideals, which

brings me to the next question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our ideals, and what do we believe in?

Because,  if  we cannot answer that, then  we  cannot  be

Singaporeans.   The issue is do we have a set  of  ideals

that  we believe in? These are ideals which, in a  sense,

have  been  encapsulated  in the  Pledge  written  by  Mr

Rajaratnam  and our Senior Minister Lee  Kuan  Yew.   The

ideals   of   a  Singaporean  Singapore,  a  multi-racial

democratic  society, meritocracy, justice  and  equality.

And  all these in search of happiness first  -  for those

of  you  who are worried about us being too materialistic

-  happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.  It

is this set of ideals which defines Singaporeans.  And it

is  the belief and allegiance to this set of ideals which

has created a unique way of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

life and a common destiny for us, fellow Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, a lot has been said about

emigration.  Let me give Members a personal take  on  it.

Every Sunday, I see buses choked, full of people, foreign

workers, on their way out to enjoy their only day off  in

a  hard  week.   I remind my children when I  pass  these

buses,  or  when  I  pass certain parks  where  they  are

congregated,  that we are entirely of  the  same  genetic

stock as these foreign workers.  The only reason some  of

us   will   have   the  privilege  of  migrating   as   a

professional,  not  as a maid or as a  labourer,  is  not

because  of any inherent superiority in ourselves  or  in

our  genes.  It is due entirely to the fact that we  were

blessed to be born in this place called Singapore and  to

have  enjoyed  the environment which has shaped  us,  for

better or for worse.  And in our case, certainly, for the

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that I am and all that I have are due

entirely  to  the  Singapore system, and  the  fact  that

Singapore  exists.  So, for those who have considered  or

are  considering leaving, all I am asking is, leave  with

some gratitude in their hearts and we wish them well, and

we will continue to hope to be connected with them.  But,

as  my good friend, Ahmad Khalis, said yesterday, do  not

use  emigration as a threat to us.  And,  as  Mr  Chandra

Mohan  says, if indeed all the people who are considering

leaving  Singapore  are doing so because  of  unhappiness

with the PAP and the Government, and if indeed these  are

the same people who would be likely to vote against us at

the  next election, then if we were to be purely partisan

about it, we should say, "That's fine.  That improves  my

votes at the next election."  But Members know that  this

is not a game that we are playing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the issue is not how many people go, or

who  goes, or to get the details for their exact  reasons

that anybody makes such a heart-wrenching decision.   The

crux  of  the  issue for us, as a country,  is  how  many

Singaporeans  will willingly exercise  their  freedom  of

choice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

to  decide to commit themselves to their families,  their

friends  and fellow Singaporeans.  If we do  not  have  a

critical  mass of local committed Singaporeans, then  who

will be responsible for our collective destiny?  Who will

be  responsible for Singaporeans who do not even have  an

option  to migrate?  In fact, it is this unique  role  of

local  committed Singaporeans who cannot be  replaced  by

expatriates.   The survival of Singapore depends  on  the

quality   and   quantity   of   these   hardcore    local

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to the fourth question. What is the

role,  especially of younger Singaporeans  in  all  this?

There  is  one key difference between the first  and  the

third  generation of Singaporeans.  The first  generation

had to fight for independence.   They then had to unite a

potentially  explosive mix of disparate ethnic  enclaves.

They  had  to build an economy and they had to  create  a

first-world  country.  These are really big hairy  goals,

worth several lifetimes of effort.  These challenges  and

the very real prospect of failure and the consequences of

failure  enhance that sense of participation,  obligation

and,  ultimately, bonding in that pioneering  generation.

Now, we fast forward to today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that many young Singaporeans ask

themselves  is:  Do we collectively have any  big  worthy

goals  to  achieve  for ourselves and  for  our  country?

Because  if younger Singaporeans feel that they  have  no

role  to  play  in going after those big  goals  for  the

society,  then  the  only  thing  left  is  to  focus  on

themselves and look after number one.  So, I feel that in

order  to sharpen this sense of obligation in this  group

of  Singaporeans, we also need to enhance  our  sense  of

ownership,  belonging and participation.  Because  if  we

allow   younger  Singaporeans  to  feel  alienated   from

society, then they will lose that sense of obligation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if we can show young Singaporeans

that  they  are  needed and that there  are  avenues  for

participation,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

then  that natural deep-seated imperative to do something

worthwhile with their lives will surface.  And I think we

can  count  on them to continue this process  of  nation-building  and not let the past and the future generations

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept that there is a role, we then have to

decide  whether  this  role is in any  way  going  to  be

different  in the future.  And that perhaps  is  as  good

enough  an  excuse to discuss superficially some  of  the

aspects  of Remaking Singapore.  This is not the time  to

discuss the whole laundry list.  But I want to say a  few

things.   It  is  a  process.  As Ms Irene  Ng  yesterday

asked,   "Why  aren't  there  instant  answers,   instant

responses, from the Government?"  It is not so easy.   We

are  not  just deciding that we shall raise your  tax  on

loyalty by 3%.  It does not work that way.  It is  not  a

panacea  for all ills.  In any case, there are very  many

different  perspectives, and some of  these  perspectives

are contradictory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reassure Mr Chandra Mohan that we have

consulted  very, very widely, if you look and  count  the

number  of people we have met, if you look at the  number

of  emails, letters and telephone calls, which all of  us

and  the sub-committee members have been involved in.   I

have  stopped counting a long time ago, because it is  no

longer  a question of quantity.  We have consulted  local

voices.  The overseas Singaporeans have contributed  both

to the Economic Restructuring Committee as well as to us.

There is no question of lack of commitment.  It is not  a

question  of  geography.  It is not even  a  question  of

partisanship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, what are some of the signs or

signals  that have been transmitted to us?   Firstly,  we

have  heard  a  loud  reaffirmation of  one  of  the  key

taglines  from S21 that "Every Singaporean matters".   Mr

Gan Kim Yong yesterday said this was not a doctor-patient

relationship.    Nor   is   this   even   a    commercial

relationship.   He  said,  we are  a  family.   Singapore

cannot  be  a  corporation that just  recruits  the  best

members and retrenches everybody else.  Even if you  were

to take a business analogy, this is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

family-owned business.  Yes, we have said repeatedly that

there  is no free lunch.  Nobody owes Singapore a living.

But I would like to remind all of you that regardless  of

your  station in life, all Singaporeans have a  place  at

the   family   dinner  table.   This  is  something   the

Government  has  not forgotten.  Mr Low Thia  Khiang,  Mr

Steve Chia and some of the other Members have accused the

Government   of   being  materialistic,   single-mindedly

obsessed  with money.  You know, my mother used  to  tell

us,  "You  can't live on love and fresh  air."   We  need

money  to  buy food to keep body and soul together.   But

you  buy food for your family not for the sake of  buying

food  but because of love, and because you want  to  keep

the family intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are very careful with our economy. Yes, we

want  to  make a living.  We want to make a good  living.

But it is not an end in itself.  It is a means to an end.

And I would like to remind all Singaporeans that when the

Government  says, "I need to ensure a reasonable  surplus

at  the  end  of  the year", it is not for  the  sake  of

keeping score.  We run a system in which the economy  has

to  work.   The  Government budget has to be  reasonable.

And  we  need a surplus because without that surplus,  we

cannot look after the people who may fall behind in  this

race  of life.  So, yes, it is a hard-headed approach  to

life  and  in  making a living, but it is  one  based  on

heart,  compassion and love.  I think the  sooner  people

stop  treating the Government as a separate  agency,  and

that  the  Government's surplus is  somehow  money  which

otherwise  would belong to them, the better.  Because  we

are  all  on the same side.  We are all part of the  same

family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recurrent theme we have heard is - enlarge

space  for  individuals.  I hear that, and  I  sympathise

with  that.  Yes, we have to stop micromanaging  choices.

What  do  I  mean  by that?  We have this  temptation  to

manage, say, manpower planning, that we can look  in  the

crystal  ball  and tell you exactly how  many  engineers,

doctors and lawyers we need.  You and I know it is not so

straightforward.  In the name of distributing talent,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

we  even  have quotas on ensuring that not too  many  top

people enter one or two disciplines.  But, again, in  the

name of doing that, we affect people's freedom of choice.

We  affect,  in  their eyes, the whole  concept  of  free

competition.  Even yesterday, we talked about  the  quota

on women entering medical school.  Let me tell you that I

am  sympathetic to it, not because I am a  feminist,  but

because of the more important message behind that,  which

is that at an individual level, we are all of equal worth

and  that we will compete fairly and squarely for limited

resources and limited places which are available.  It  is

about  reaffirming the primacy of free  choice  and  free

competition in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corollary of increasing space for the individual

and giving more free choice is that you cannot expect the

Government  to guarantee success for you and say,  "Look!

You  told me to do this course.  And now that I have done

this course, you make sure I get a good job, and it is  a

good  living."   It is like the young student  who  says,

"Look!  Since you say art and music is now important, you

must  guarantee that when I graduate from the university,

I  will have a job as a musician or an artist, and I will

make  as  much as my engineer colleague."  This is  still

old thinking.  Young Singaporeans need to wake themselves

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guarantee for success. The role of the

Government  is  to  give  you as  many  opportunities  as

possible  to  maximise your interest and  potential,  and

then  you take your chances in the game of life,  and  we

wish  you  all  the best.  There will be  a  safety  net.

Nobody  in Singapore is going to starve, to be without  a

roof,  to be denied healthcare, or to be deprived of  any

educational opportunities for his children.   But  beyond

that basic, everything else, you have to make a go for it

yourself.  If you want to dance on a bar-top, some of  us

will  fall off that bar-top.  Some people will die  as  a

result  of liberalising bar-top dancing, not just because

they  have  fallen  off the bar-top.  Because  usually  a

young girl, with a short skirt, dancing on a bar-top, may

attract  some  insults  from  some  other  men,  and  the

boyfriend starts fighting.  Some people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>

will  die.   Blood  will  be shed for  liberalising  this

policy.   While  I  support  the  liberalisation  of  the

policy, I also want all of us to be aware that there is a

price  to be paid for liberty.  If we are convinced  that

our society is ready to pay that price, or that price  is

a  necessity, then let us go in, but go in with our  eyes

wide open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has expounded on the

educational  issues.   I do not want  to  go  into  that,

except  to  remind Members that the Ministry of Education

is  providing  more  choices.  There  will  be  a  sports

school.   There will be greater opportunities for  people

in art, music and so on.  We will look for your strengths

rather than your weaknesses, and we will try our best  to

give  you marketable, employable skills.  But, again,  do

not expect the Ministry to wave away competition.  Do not

expect  the Ministry to give equal pay and equal results,

regardless of talent, regardless of input.  If  you  want

such  a  system, it died a long time ago when the  Berlin

Wall came down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another theme we have heard - re-engage Singaporeans

in  public  life,  give greater franchise.   I  think  Mr

Chandra  Mohan just spoke about that as well.  Mr  Arthur

Fong  talked about a Youth Parliament.  We are not  going

to  have  a  Youth Parliament, but we are  considering  a

National  Youth  Forum  where  there  will  be  a  formal

platform for youths to engage themselves and their  minds

on  national  issues, provide them enough information  to

think  it through and work out solutions.  Regardless  of

whether  their solutions turn out to be superior or  not,

that is not the point.  The fact that they are engaged in

the process of dealing with national problems and finding

solutions, I think, will awaken them and remind them that

they  have  an  essential  role to  play  in  Singapore's

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much said about the Government's need

to   review   its  regulatory  approach  towards   public

expression.  Yes, I agree that we need to have  a  system

which   allows   expression  of  diverse   views.    Yes,

Singaporeans have a right to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>

heard.   Singaporeans need to develop that  capacity  for

dialogue to disagree and yet ultimately to agree to  move

along  as  a united whole.  We need all this in order  to

achieve our goals of a creative, entrepreneurial society.

Yes,  all  that is correct.  But let me put in  a  caveat

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say you want less shackling by OB markers, if

you  want  a  less  prescriptive pre-censorship  type  of

regime,  if you want to be able to say what you  want  to

say,  act  out  the  plays you want  to  act,  engage  in

performing art that you want to perform, and you  do  not

want   us  to  censor  it  beforehand  or  to  tell   you

beforehand,  then  you must also be prepared  to  have  a

system in which there are heavy penalties which will kick

in  if you engage in activities which are inimical to the

safety  and  stability of society.  Freedom of expression

must  come  with  responsibility.  And  you  cannot  say,

"Let's  take  away  defamation laws", and  suddenly,  the

debate  will  be  wonderful and  all  great  truths  will

emerge.   That is not the way life works.  You want  more

freedom,  yes,  there  will  be  more  freedom,  but  the

penalties must remain in place.  Because, at the  end  of

the day, the system and Singapore must still continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, in fact, I was pleasantly

surprised that there have been moves in some areas.   Let

me  give you an example.  Since January this year, and  I

suspect  most  of us are unaware of it, the  Registry  of

Societies  (ROS)  has  implemented  a  pilot  project  to

register  certain categories of societies on a fast-track

basis.   Under  this  pilot scheme,  societies,  such  as

alumni  associations, performing arts groups and  reading

clubs, would only need to fill in a registration form and

they  are deemed to be given in-principle approval.  They

can proceed to conduct their activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Societies is currently refining this

fast-track process to make it easier for other  types  of

societies  which pose minimal security considerations  to

also register on this fast-track basis.  So for those  of

you  who  said you want more freedom to be able  to  form

your  own societies, get on with it.  We have.  In  fact,

this avenue has been there since January

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>

this  year.   However,  in the light  of  the  heightened

security situation which we are in, I would also have  to

tell  you  categorically that, if  you  want  to  form  a

society that is of a religious or an ethnic nature, it is

still safer that we continue with the normal registration

process  for the time being and I think all of you  would

agree with me on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you another example, public entertainment.

Since  March  2000,  the Police have applied,  what  they

call,  a  "class exemption" approach to licensing  public

entertainment.   Under this approach,  certain  types  of

activities are exempted from having to apply for a Public

Entertainment  Licence.   For  instance,  organisers   of

Chinese  opera  or getai no longer need to  apply  for  a

Public  Entertainment Licence provided that  they  comply

with  certain conditions.  For those of us who have  been

attending  the Seventh Moon Festival, we will know.   You

have  got to pipe down at 10.30 pm.  As long as they stay

within  these guidelines and rules, we exempt  them  from

having  to apply for a Public Entertainment Licence.   So

you  can  see that we have made moves.  But we will  make

moves cautiously, deliberately in full cognizance of  the

potential  consequences  and in full  cognizance  of  the

potential benefits.  That should be our approach in  this

area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example we heard is, increase the

stakeholding  of  Singaporeans.   If  you  think  of  the

Community  Development  Councils, Residents'  Committees,

Neighbourhood  Committees  and  Residents'  Associations,

there  is  a whole plethora of committees which  we  have

created,  which we keep begging people to  join,  "Please

help out.  We want to devolve responsibility and decision

making."  For those of you who are involved in this  they

know  that  it  is  not so easy.  But  we  have  provided

avenues for people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end with emotional rootedness because, at

the  end  of  the  day,  it is one thing  to  talk  about

identity  and ideals.  But we also need to remember  that

it  is  a  matter of the heart.  As Mr Gan Kim Yong  said

yesterday,  yes, we have to look for avenues  to  provide

for more family time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>

family  opportunities, more avenues for alumni and  other

social  groups  to  get together to support  each  other.

Yes,  we want to have a familiar environment, and I agree

with   Mr  Chiam  yesterday.   Yes,  we  must  have  some

landmarks which will remind us of our past.  That is  why

we  have  set  up things, like the Conservation  Advisory

Panel,  that  is  why  we engage in  conserving  heritage

buildings  and,  last week, we inaugurated  the  Heritage

Trees  Scheme.   All these are attempts to  preserve  for

Singaporeans emotional signposts and landmarks for us  to

fall back on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, my take-home message to all

Singaporeans is that this is an artificial  nation  in  a

hurry,  built in a very short time.  Let us  not  be  too

harsh  on  ourselves.  Let us remind ourselves,  however,

that  we  only  exist because of an effort,  a  conscious

exercise  of  will.  And if our younger generation  loses

that  will, then we will perish.  So that is why  today's

Motion is relevant, and that is why I support it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  rise  to support the call  for  measures  to

strengthen Singaporeans' sense of belonging to Singapore.

I  do  realise that I am the last speaker and it must  be

quite a relief for all.  I am quite relieved to tell  you

frankly.  I am not 3G for sure, and I have listened  very

carefully to the definition for "3G".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by setting the issue in some

perspectives.  Firstly, on the one hand, it has been said

and  acknowledged that there is a problem.  For  whatever

reasons,  there  are  Singaporeans  who  have  left,  are

leaving  or, at least, are thinking of leaving Singapore,

and  this  has  caused concern and has caused  the  Prime

Minister to make certain remarks during his National  Day

Rally speech.  Indeed, his remarks have generated a great

deal   of   debate   and  some  strong   responses   from

Singaporeans,  especially those who are living  overseas.

Some  of  these  remarks or responses can  be  considered

quite emotional and whether or not they are justified  in

their reaction is beside the point.  What is important is

to understand why they feel that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the other hand, these few weeks have

really witnessed quite a revolution in our country.   And

almost  on  a  daily  basis,  we  read  about  some   new

recommendations made by the Economic Review Committee  as

well as the Remaking Singapore Committee.  And they cover

just  about  everything  and anything  ranging  from  our

economy to education, to laws and regulations as well  as

sports, and so on.  And some of these recommendations are

quite  radical, recognising that today's world cannot  be

remodelled based on yesterday's memories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would be fair to say that it is not as if the

Government  is  not doing anything.  On the  contrary,  a

great  number of people, as has been confirmed, had  been

involved in trying to think of ways and means to  improve

the  quality of life in Singapore.  So as we  talk  about

how  to review thoroughly our programmes and policies,  I

do believe that process is well underway.  Perhaps, there

should  be some focus, and this has been greatly  debated

upon,  on  this,  what you call, sense  of  belonging  of

Singaporeans  to  Singapore and how to create  the  bonds

within this great family about us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we should start by looking at mindsets and

attitudes, I think, not only of the Government but indeed

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans,  ourselves.  We should re-examine  our  own

attitudes  towards Government, towards our  country,  and

maybe  start  by not complaining so much.  I  think  both

sides, for sure, have to come together.  Both sides  have

got to be part of the solution together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of belonging, or a lack of it, has two

aspects  - the push factors as well as the pull  factors.

And,  invariably, these factors always come into play  as

one  considers or exits from a relationship, be it  one's

job, family, friends, social networks or country.  One of

the  most  major  push factors must be  this  feeling  of

alienation.   There is no doubt about it that  we  are  a

hard-driving and yet a high-achieving nation.   There  is

nothing  wrong with it.  The strategy that has helped  to

produce  this  state is correct and should be  continued.

But this strategy, this process, also produces on the one

hand the high achievers whom we want because they are the

drivers  and,  on the other hand, people  or  groups  who

might   just   feel   marginalised,  disenfranchised   or

disenchanted, as had been described.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, really, our challenge is to develop policies and

programmes which will accommodate this diverse  range  of

expectations and aspirations, ranging from high  rewards,

philosophical  expressions as well  as  just  mere  basic

needs.  We, therefore, need to create an environment  and

strive to create even a better environment which does not

label  people and which makes everybody feel  needed  and

welcomed.  That way, we avoid that feeling of alienation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is of course the most ideal situation to

achieve  and,  needless to say, we  must  always  try  to

achieve   it.   Everyone  counts  and  everyone  matters,

whatever their abilities and disabilities, whatever  they

have  done or not have done.  We must welcome,  as  done,

all  members  of our family, because they belong  to  our

family.   We should also embrace those who, for  whatever

reasons,  have left Singapore, and we must maintain  good

relationships and good ties with them because  we  are  a

small  country.  This way, we enlarge our virtual family.

And, it is an asset.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons why Singaporeans choose

sometimes  to  leave  the country - because  of  personal

reasons,  opportunities or survival, like in the business

world.  Businesses may take flight to low-cost regimes in

order  to stay competitive.  This way, we should  applaud

and  encourage them, because they have moved on,  seeking

that proverbial cheese, so to speak.  This is not to  say

that  we shall quit and seek cheese elsewhere because  we

have  got plenty of cheese in Singapore and we know  that

the  Government  is constantly trying  to  increase  that

cheese  supply.  What I am just trying to say is that  we

should   embrace  all  Singaporeans  who  have  left   us

temporarily  or  permanently, and include  them  in  this

family  of  ours.  And I would add that  we  should  also

include  new members or foreign talent, because  if  they

want  to,  are  willing to and are able  to  improve  our

lives, why not?  Why should we criticise them?  We should

welcome  them  because  they  are  part  of  this  global

intellectual capital - this is 3G - which is  so  mobile,

they  go  to where they are wanted, they stay where  they

are well treated and valued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my recent visit to the US. I am

reminded of how patriotic that country is.  The Americans

are  so  proud of themselves.  They loudly proclaim  they

are Americans, whatever their country of origin might be.

The  minute they receive their green cards, they announce

that  they are Americans.  Why is this so?  We  all  know

that  America is a very rich and prosperous country.   It

is  lauded  as the land of opportunity.  It is proclaimed

as  the  champion of human rights as well  as  democracy.

But  so  is  Singapore.  Singapore is a highly successful

country,  and there are a good number of reasons  why  we

should  also  be proud and loudly proclaim  ourselves  as

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Americans have a great symbol of

their country which they can relate to, and this is their

flag.   Americans  proudly display their  flag  on  every

occasion, not only on national occasions, not only during

community gatherings, but also during family as  well  as

business  gatherings.   Many  Americans  fly  their  flag

throughout the year in their homes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>

their  offices, not only on Independence Day.   And  they

also  wear  their flag literally - on hats,  clothes,  T-shirts,  mini-skirts, hot pants, mugs and so on.   It  is

not  disrespectful at all.  In fact, the flag is a strong

symbol of freedom, democracy, pride in their country,  as

well as loyalty to the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the strength of a country, or creed, lives

very  much in the true sense of loyalty it can arouse  in

the  hearts of its people.  And, therefore, the value  of

the  flag  is  so powerful in uniting a country  and  its

people,  making them believe in the country and  what  it

stands  for, I think we should develop a great  sense  of

loyalty  for  our country.  In that way, we promote  that

sense of belonging to our country as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sense of loyalty or a sense of belonging

must also be founded in the value of the family, and this

has  been  articulated  by a lot  of  hon.  Members  here

because,  however  the world changes, the  power  of  the

family  remains in shaping and nurturing the citizens  of

tomorrow.   It  is  within this family relationship  that

values  as diverse as love, responsibility, communication

and  respect for the authority gets forged.  It is within

the family that we learn about how to live to the fullest

of  our  potential,  how to do the right  things  and  do

things right as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can spend more time and more efforts in

developing   the  family  and  developing  policies   and

programmes  which are much more pro-family.  Already,  we

have  a  number of factors against us - the smallness  of

our  family  unit,  the  growing number  of  singles  and

childless couples.  So I think it is worth our  while  to

continue  to really put in all our efforts in making  and

developing pro-family policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also quite a few lessons which can be

learnt - or I learned it - from Rudy Guiliani, who is the

ex-Mayor of New York City.  He was the keynote speaker at

a recent event which I attended, and he was talking about

Managing  a  Crisis.   And  it was  not  just  about  the

September   11   crisis.   He  was  talking   about   the

difficulties he faced when he first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>

became the Mayor of New York and how difficult it was for

him to galvanise New Yorkers together.  So he carried out

a survey and was dismayed to find that 64% of New Yorkers

would rather quit New York, if given the chance.  That is

a  very  high  percentage.  New York is one of  the  most

successful  cities  in  the world  in  one  of  the  most

successful  countries in the world.  Yet, they  too  have

their  fair share of potential quitters.  So, we are  not

in this alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Guiliani changed that to a large extent. What he

did  was  to establish the reasons as to why New  Yorkers

were  unhappy.  Not surprisingly, one of the main reasons

is  the  high  rate of crime in New York.  Just  imagine,

there  is an official list of tips on "How not  to  be  a

victim  of crime" in New York!  One of it is not to  talk

to  strangers, and the other is not to have  eye  contact

with anyone.  This is much worse than our bo-chap policy;

it is bo-chap policy with fear, ie, walk around with your

eyes closed!  What Mr Guiliani did after identifying  the

problems  was really addressing the problems  with  great

vigour.   He  developed  a  strategy,  communicated   the

strategy,  fought  the  battles  with  great  focus   and

commitment  and,  as  he  said,  with  a  great  deal  of

optimism.  That way, he succeeded in achieving  what  was

thought to be impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we, too, can start by looking at the reasons

why  Singaporeans are unhappy, and much of it has already

been  articulated.  I say it again: we are a country with

a low rate of crime.  We are a city which is clean, safe,

efficient  as  well  as affluent.  We  have  great  food.

People  are  telling us that we are fun and an  enjoyable

place to live in, and yet Singaporeans are unhappy.   Why

is   this  so?   A  lot  of  reasons  have  already  been

articulated by many hon. Members here, but I  would  like

to dwell on three.  Is it due to our inherent complaining

nature,  to start with?  Or is it due to what  the  Prime

Minister  said, that we are a bo-chap, couldn't-care-less

society?  Or are we a kiasu society as well?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these attitudes are not desirable and, indeed,

they  should  be  reversed.  They should be  replaced  by

values  which  will make us a much happier society.   So,

instead of being kiasu, I think we too should have a good

dose  of optimism, because it is in optimism that we  see

solutions, and pessimism simply obscures solutions,  even

as  they  stare us in our faces.  I think we should  also

stop  complaining  and  become a much  more  self-reliant

society.   That way, we take greater pride in  our  work.

That  way, we become much more entrepreneurial  as  well.

As  for bo-chap, I think that is terrible.  We must chap.

We  must care.  That way, we will have a more caring  and

more  gracious  society, not only for ourselves  but  for

everybody  else as well, because democracy  is  not  just

about rights, it is also about respect and responsibility

for others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to conclude by saying

that  I  do  believe that as we remake  Singapore,  these

values    -    of    inclusiveness,   loyalty,    family,

responsibility and optimism - get woven into our policies

and programmes.

<br>3.28 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I set the

debate in context by sketching out the major issues which

are behind this debate about stayers and quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really talking about two distinct but related

issues  here.   One, rooting Singaporeans emotionally  to

Singapore,   in  other  words,  developing   a   national

identity,  patriotism, a sense of belonging, a  sense  of

pride  in being a Singaporean.  Two, getting Singaporeans

to  stay  physically in Singapore rather than emigrating,

working or living overseas.  The first is a crucial long-term issue; the second is an important medium-term one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooting citizens is a critical but very difficult

task  for many new countries, especially those which have

not  been born as nations to start off with.  A Professor

of Government in Harvard, Rupert Emerson,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>

gave  a definition of a nation which is relevant to this,

and I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A single people, traditionally fixed on a well-defined territory, speaking the same language and

preferably   a   language  all  its  own,  possessing   a

distinctive culture, and shaped to a common mould by many

generations of shared historical experience."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are many ingredients - a single people,

well-defined  territory, same language and  preferably  a

language  of  its own, possessing a distinctive  culture,

and  shaped  to  a  common mould by many  generations  of

shared  historical experience.  This definition by  Prof.

Rupert Emerson and was quoted by Prof. Robert Tilman from

the  University of North Carolina who wrote a book  about

"South  East  Asia  and  the  Enemy  Beyond"  which   was

published in 1987.  Prof. Tilman also pointed out that by

this  definition, Thailand is the only country  in  South

East  Asia which is a nation, and even then, only if  the

Thai Muslims in the South are excluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new countries which are not born nations have

this  problem.   Myanmar, with its  two  dozen  different

tribes;  Indonesia,  with its many  different  races  and

languages, spread over 10,000 or more islands;  Malaysia,

with  Malays, Indians, Chinese and others.   If  we  look

beyond  South  East  Asia, India has the  same  issue  of

identity, because India was never one country before  the

Raj.  And their separate local identities which had to be

blended  together and harmonised as one Indian  identity.

On  top of which, they had their religious divide between

the  Hindus  and the Muslims, because India has  a  large

Islamic minority - 100 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or take Pakistan. All Muslims, but West Pakistan

was  different from East Pakistan.  The Punjabis, Sindhis

and  others  in  West  Pakistan are  different  from  the

Bengalis  in  the East, and there was a civil  war  after

which  Bangladesh was born, and Pakistan was  split  into

two.   So many countries have this problem, and Singapore

too.   If you examine the definition, we did not get born

as a nation either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, how do you root people to the country?

That is the challenge.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>

has  this  Government done to do that?  We have  built  a

meritocratic, multi-racial society.  We have given  every

citizen  a  stake  in Singapore. Through home  ownership,

through HDB, 90% of Singaporeans now own their homes.  We

have  generated economic growth and prosperity, and given

every  Singaporean  a share in Singapore's  success.   We

emphasise  education  in national schools,  to  inculcate

values, to imbue students with knowledge of their  mother

tongue  and also to equip them with skills so  that  they

can  make  a  living  for themselves.   Therefore,  today

Singapore is a success, and we have a much stronger sense

of  nationhood today than we did in 1965.  So when Mr Low

Thia  Khiang made a rousing speech in Chinese saying that

it  is all the Government's fault, it sounds good but  it

is not so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, which is not rooting

Singaporeans, but the question of getting Singaporeans to

physically  stay  and  work here, is slightly  different.

There  was  no  issue  of  Singaporeans  leaving  in  the

previous generation. The question never arose because for

that  generation, which country to belong to  was  not  a

matter  of choice. Either they were born in Singapore  or

they  had come here out of economic necessity.   Many  of

them  did  not speak English and could not easily  uproot

themselves  and their families and go off to  some  other

country.   And even if they could have gone,  they  would

have  felt  out of place, uncomfortable and yearning  for

something more like home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, it is different. Today, Singa-poreans

have  many opportunities. There is globalisation.   Other

economies  have opened up.  There is a global market  for

talent.  Many  countries now emphasise  talent  and  open

their doors to welcome people who have skills and talent.

Because   we   have   given   them   education,   because

Singaporeans  speak  English,  because  Singaporeans  are

prosperous,  so  if they want to move, many  Singaporeans

will be welcomed in many places. So there is a choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pattern of emigration has changed. In the 70s

and  80s,  we used to worry about people who would  leave

Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>

as  mature adults in their 30s and 40s.  They have  grown

up,  they  have started working, they have a  family  and

they  have  bought a house.  Now, they  are  thinking  of

selling   their   house,  cashing  out,  bringing   their

families, and moving away to Canada or somewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are worrying about students going

overseas, studying overseas and not returning.  They have

found  a  job overseas. They are staying on.   It  is  so

exciting and they put off coming back till another  time.

It  is  a  real  problem.  We had  a  group  of  overseas

Singaporeans  who  came  to  brief  the  Economic  Review

Committee  a  few months ago from Hong Kong, Stanford  in

San  Francisco, and Harvard and MIT in Boston.  They told

us  that  they had done an informal survey of  themselves

and  their  predecessors  over the  last  10  years,  the

Singaporean students who had attended Stanford,  Harvard,

and  MIT.  What had happened to them?  How many had  come

back?  They said that, up to today, only about half  have

come  back, and that would have included the students  on

scholarship.   So many students are going overseas,  many

Singaporeans  are going overseas, and  we  have  to  ask:

will we have a problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge that not all Singaporeans will stay

here in a globalised world. Just as we welcome foreigners

to  come  to  Singapore,  so too other  countries  invite

Singaporeans,  and some will go. Apart from  that,  there

would be reasons why Singaporeans need to go overseas  to

work,  to learn, to be posted, to do a job.  In  fact,  I

would encourage Singaporeans who have this opportunity to

go  abroad,  to  take it up, to learn  about  the  world,

expand your horizons.  But, at the same time, I hope that

when  Singaporeans are overseas, they will maintain their

links  back home and after spending their time  overseas,

and after some time, come back to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford to lose too many people overseas,

whether  they are emotionally quitting or not.  It  could

be, as one of the MPs said yesterday, "sheng zai si

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>

fang,  xin  huai zu guo".  If everybody is  north,  east,

south  and west of Singapore and there is nobody  in  the

centre, then the centre is going to have a problem, which

is  like  Ireland which, for centuries, sent millions  of

people  overseas to the English-speaking world - America,

Britain,  Australia,  New Zealand, Canada.   Because  the

home  country  was poor, and there were no opportunities,

they  left.  There  are far bigger communities  of  Irish

prospering  overseas  than  there  are  Irish  living  in

Ireland.   The  home  country stayed poor,  the  daughter

communities abroad prospered.  It is only in the last  20

years, as Ireland, in the EU and benefiting from EU  aid,

started  taking  off, that now Irish are  returning,  and

Ireland has net immigration for the first time in a  very

long  time  in  its  history.  And  that  can  happen  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRC is in a different position. They have 1.2

billion  people, many, many talented ones, and they  have

been sending students overseas in big numbers - 20,000  a

year, and an estimated 380,000 since they opened up about

20 years ago.  So far, only one-third have returned.  But

they  are  still  allowing students to go abroad  because

they  need the students to go to learn, and some to  come

back and bring back the technology, the knowledge of  the

world,  that  instinct and feel for how modern  economies

and modern societies work, to modernise China and take it

forward.  Not only are they allowing the students to  go,

they  are facilitating the students to go. Because to  go

to  America to study, you need a bank guarantee to get  a

student  visa.  And a Chinese student from  China  cannot

get  a  US$  bank  guarantee.   But  the  Government  has

instructed the banks in China to give US$ bank guarantees

to Chinese students to go overseas, to America, to study.

Only  one-third will come back, and they are prepared  to

accept  that.   But if that happens to Singapore,  if  we

send 20,000 a year overseas and only one-third come back,

we will not be Singapore.  Therefore, we cannot afford to

lose too many. We must keep a hard core in Singapore  who

will  make  Singapore  work, as  Dr  Vivian  Balakrishnan

pointed out just now.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we acknowledge that the Singapore

diaspora  overseas is growing.  I do not know  how  many,

maybe  100,000 overseas now. We have to keep  links  with

this growing diaspora and make the most of them, tap them

for  what they know of the world, of the countries  which

they  are in, tap them for their networks, make  them  be

part  of  the Singapore family spread abroad. Of  course,

while  we  keep in touch with those who are overseas,  we

must look after those who have not left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more should the Government do to root

Singaporeans  here?  The MPs have given many constructive

ideas  on  how to improve policies and how to  strengthen

our  sense of belonging. The Government will consider all

of them, and in wherever they are workable and practical.

Mr  Hawazi  and  Dr  Ng  Eng Hen have  responded  on  the

education  issues, on how we have a good system,  but  we

can  improve it.  And particularly, I think  we  have  to

deal with the specific difficulties which caused this  to

be   one   of   the  push  factors,  which  caused   some

Singaporeans to leave the country.  We also have to think

about  our  overall  approach to  engaging  citizens  and

involving  those  who  want to be part  of  the  national

debate.   For  that,  we  have  the  Remaking   Singapore

Committee which Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has been  chairing

and which he told you about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to engage the energies of our citizens.

Singaporeans  say  they are not quite  satisfied  because

they do not have enough say in what goes on in Singapore.

I  think  we  can create more say but, most important  of

all, we will have to be realistic about it.  Singaporeans

can  have  more say here in Singapore than they can  have

anywhere else.  If you go to China and you want to change

the  system,  it  will take you several generations,  and

your  great-grandson may succeed.  If you go  to  America

and you want to change the system, it is not so easy.  It

is   a  very  complicated  and  large  society.   But  in

Singapore, if you have an idea, a dream, something  which

you want to achieve, you can make a difference.  It is  3

million  people.   However modest  your  intentions,  you

cannot hide your light under a bushel,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>

it  will be seen and if it makes sense, it will be  taken

up and implemented.  So in Singapore, we can do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea which we have developed, arising out of the

Economic  Review Committee's experience with the students

and the Singaporeans overseas, is to set up what we would

like to call the "Majulah Connection".  Our exercise with

the  students  in  America  and  Hong  Kong  involved,  I

suppose,  a  few dozen enthusiastic Singaporeans  working

overseas,   activating  their  friends  and   colleagues,

meeting late at night, discussing over the Internet. They

called themselves the Singapore Overseas Network (SON).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we find that it is working, we would like

to  institutionalise  this and  set  up  what  they  have

decided to call the "Majulah Connection".  The vision  is

for  the  "Majulah  Connection" to be a  global  business

network  of overseas Singaporeans.  It will also  include

the  friends  of  Singapore, which means expatriates  who

used  to  work  here  and  foreign  businessmen  who  are

friendly  to and want to help Singapore.  The  Government

will also participate as a member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are likely to start it off in seven cities where

there  are  many Singaporeans working - in Beijing,  Hong

Kong,  London,  New  York,  San Francisco,  Shanghai  and

Sydney.   We  will leverage and build upon  the  existing

Singapore   Clubs.  Our  idea  will  be   to   facilitate

networking and interactions among the members.   We  will

organise  events  and  activities,  including  an  annual

homecoming event here.  Through the network, we  hope  we

will  generate  business opportunities, share  ideas  and

knowledge    and    help    Singapore    companies     to

internationalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effort was a spontaneous one. Mr Khaw Boon Wan

suggested trying it, and I agreed.  It was a success.  It

demonstrated that it is both feasible and also worthwhile

and    valuable   to   maintain   links   with   overseas

Singaporeans.   It  also  shows that  for  many  overseas

Singaporeans, their hearts are still with Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, I would like to sound a note

of caution or realism.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>

is  a limit to how far modifying policies will solve  our

problem of rootedness, for several reasons.  First,  when

we  modify policies, there are trade-offs.  For  example,

in  education, even from the debate, you will  know  that

there  were  those  MPs who wanted  more  things  in  the

curriculum  such  as National Education, Moral  Education

and  Civics, and there are those who want less things  in

the   curriculum,  including  less  mother  tongue,  less

stress.   And we have to make a choice. There are  trade-offs  to make in the balance.  So, we cannot satisfy  all

requests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we cannot view all policies from the angle

of how they will affect Singaporeans' commitment; will it

cause  some  people to be unhappy; and if  they  are  not

happy, will they leave?  In other words, humour me, or  I

quit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis, yesterday, gave two vivid examples

of  meet-the-people session cases, constituents  who  had

personal  problems,  and  because  they  could  not   get

satisfaction from their MP, threatened to go.  I  do  not

know  how he dealt with them.  He must be a very  skilful

and  diplomatic MP by now.  But those are just  the  most

extreme examples of this problem.  There are many  issues

which we have to deal with.  We have to discuss them.  We

have to consult.  We have to involve people.  We have  to

take  views.   At the end of which we have to decide what

we have to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens then? Ideally, most people will agree

with the decision.  But if some do not, then if you are a

Singaporean,  you  should stay on and fight,  argue  your

case and persuade more people to believe you, and one day

change  the  policy, not opt out and leave.   Because  no

policy  is  set  in  stone forever,  no  consensus  lasts

permanently.  And if you think the Government  is  wrong,

argue it, pursue it, persuade others of it, take it up in

elections.  That is what a good Singaporean will do, even

the  Opposition  Members.  Even Mr J  B  Jeyaretnam  will

continue doing that, even though I think, in many  cases,

he is doing the wrong thing, but he believes in it and he

will fight for it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of rootedness is much deeper than having

favourable policies.  I point out one observation by Chen

Hwai  Liang in the Lianhe Zaobao this morning.   In  this

debate, there has been a clear difference in the views of

the  Chinese  educated MPs and the English educated  MPs.

Both made the same analysis of the problem of rootedness.

But  both came to diametrically opposite recommendations.

The  Chinese  educated MPs wanted more  moral  education,

Confucian  values  and  such  approaches.   The   English

educated MPs wanted more freedom of choice.  Therein lies

a  profound truth about Singapore society.  And the  fact

that this was noted by a Chinese journalist in the Zaobao

is  a  further  confirmation that that is  how  Singapore

society is.  So it is not an issue of policies.  It is an

issue of rootedness, of identification, of deep values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people want to stay in a country or in

Singapore, whether he is emotionally committed or whether

he  is  physically  here?  I think  there  are  different

levels  to  this.  One level is rational  reasons.   They

make  a  cost benefit calculation, it comes out positive.

We  can look for the rational reasons why it makes  sense

to  be  here, and then we can say, well, there is a  good

living,  I  have a chance, my children have a chance.   I

can  afford  a car or I cannot afford a car.   Check  the

bottom  line, and it all adds up.  And, indeed,  rational

reasons  are relevant, because if conditions  are  really

hard and life is miserable, if the family is starving and

there  is  no  future in the country,  then  people  will

leave, ideals, loyalty or patriotism notwithstanding. But

rational  calculations alone can only make  fair  weather

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: do we have a moral obligation

to  others?  We cannot leave.  Why?  Because we  grew  up

here.   We drew sustenance from this society.  We  gained

the  opportunities to advance ourselves, and to have  the

education and skills and the marketability to move and to

opt out.  Had we been born in almost any other country in

Asia,  we  would not have enjoyed the same  opportunities

and  our lives would have been quite different.  You  can

be  very talented.  If you are in some inner province  in

China or somewhere

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>

deep  in  Indochina, or elsewhere in South East  Asia,  I

think you would not have the opportunities that you  have

had.   You have made it.  This society has made you  what

you are.   It has given you what you have.  Therefore, we

have  an  obligation to the country and to the system  to

contribute  back  to  the society,  and  to  help  others

succeed as we have done.  It is a rational argument in  a

way,  but  it is an altruistic argument.  It is  also  an

abstract argument, which every individual has to consider

how it applies to himself.  Do I or do I not feel that  I

owe  Singapore this?  Or can I say, "Thank you very much.

Now, I am off.  Good luck to you."  I think we would like

to  bring  up Singaporeans who feel some moral  sense  of

pride when they look at themselves in the morning in  the

mirror and say, "Yes, I have not let others down."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the third and deepest level of motivation for

staying  are  the  emotional  ties   -  the  family,  the

friends, the places where you grew up, the memories, both

individual  and shared, of things you have  done,  things

which  your  society has experienced  together,  or  even

things  which  earlier generations of your  society  have

experienced together.  This is the fundamental glue which

binds  a people together  -  a deep emotional commitment.

And  this  is  the  fundamental  problem  for  Singapore,

because  of  our  short history and also because  of  our

ethnic diversity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare Singapore with other societies with long

histories  and strong senses of commitment and belonging.

Take  a  Japanese  -   maybe 3,000 years  since  the  sun

goddess  -  Amaterasu.  He is a Japanese wherever he goes

in  the world, the way he speaks, dresses, his attitudes,

he bears a life-long permanent imprint.  And if he leaves

Japan  permanently, he will feel deep  pain  cutting  his

ties  with all that it means to be Japanese, and all  the

things which he holds dear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at the Jews in Israel and all over the

world  with their powerful sense of shared history and  a

common  future, going back to Moses and the  Exodus,  the

Books of the Torah, the Holocaust.  If you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>

are  a Jew, you will never forget it.  And if there is  a

problem with another Jew somewhere else in the world, you

feel a sense of obligation and you will be there to help,

if  necessary,  with your life.  So, when  they  have  an

emergency   and  they  press  the  button  to   mount   a

mobilisation, Israelis from all over the world go back to

Israel in order to fight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have mobilisation exercises, but that is a test.

If the mobilisation is for real, if we ever go to war and

press  the button, will people come back, or will  people

leave?   But they have the Torah.  They have 5,000 years.

They  have  Masada.   When they dedicate  their  national

servicemen,  they bring their tank corps recruits  up  to

Masada and they hold a night-time ceremony with lamps and

present   rifles,  and  you  remember  Masada   and   the

sacrifices.  When we have national servicemen  dedication

ceremonies, we hold it in our camps.  We spread a blanket

over  the  table,  we put out some lamps.   What  is  the

resonance?   It is what we can do.  But it is  not  5,000

years old.  So, it is different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you take the Palestinian Arabs - refugee camps

scattered  all  over  the  Middle  East,  Jordan,  Syria,

Lebanon and the Gulf  -  scattered more than a generation

but  determined to go back to Palestine  - not  the  West

Bank of today, but the Palestine as they remembered it in

1947  before they were chased out when Israel was  formed

in  the  first Arab-Israeli war  -  to villages which  no

longer   exist.   But  that  ideal,  that   drive,   that

determination, that hatred for their enemies, that  holds

them together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are all of 37 years old.

Furthermore,  our loyalty has to be based  not  on  race,

language   or  religion,  which  are  the  most  powerful

loyalties, but on shared ideals and shared history.  That

takes  time.   We have history before independence,  yes.

But  they were separate histories before independence   - multiple   histories.    The   Malays   identified   with

nationalist  movements in Indonesia and  Malaya.   Before

the  war, and even after the war before independence,  it

was not uncommon to see pictures of Sukarno and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>

Hatta  -  Sukarno was the first Indonesian President  and

Hatta  was another freedom fighter  -   hung on the  wall

of  honour in the homes of those who originated from  the

Indonesian  islands.  They may be Javanese,  Boyanese  or

Sumatran,  but  they would have pictures of  Sukarno  and

Hatta.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi told me this. He lived in a pondok in

Crawford area.  And even as he was growing up in the 50s,

in the hall of honour, there were pictures of Sukarno and

Hatta.  They looked upon the brave Indonesians as  heroes

and  freedom fighters and idolised them.  Even the  Malay

intelligentsia who had no roots in the Indonesian islands

looked upon them as leaders who should be emulated.   And

it is not surprising, because these were freedom fighters

putting  themselves  on the line as anti-colonialists  to

fight the Dutch and gain independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Malayan side too, we were really one society.

The Jawi version of Utusan Melayu was first published not

in  the peninsula but in Singapore in 1939 by Ambo Sooloh

and Yusof Ishak.  They were members of Kesatuan Melayu, a

quasi  political party for the Malays  -  not  Malays  in

Singapore but Malays in Malaya including Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indians looked to India. Therefore, in 1942,

after the Japanese had come, the Indian National Army was

formed  in  Singapore to support the Indian  independence

struggle.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, can you please

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>STAYERS AND QUITTERS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Chinese in Singapore were

also  patriotic, but not to Singapore.  They either sided

with the Kuomintang or the CCP in China.  So, Sun Yat Sen

visited Singapore and Penang to raise funds for his  tong

meng  hui, for his revolutionary activities.  And so when

the  Japanese  took  over  and captured  Singapore,  they

massacred  the Chinese, not because of what  the  Chinese

did here, but because they saw these Singapore Chinese as

helping  the Chinese in China fight them, as indeed  they

did.   We  had  Mr  Tan Lark Sye, as Mr Low  Thia  Khiang

pointed  out,  but  Mr Tan Lark Sye  was  a  champion  of

Chinese culture and language, and he was motivated by the

success of Communist China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the different communities all had different

objectives  and loyalties, but none strove  for  or  were

loyal  to  an  independent multi-racial,  multi-religious

Republic  of  Singapore.  In fact, such an idea  did  not

exist and would have been dismissed as being ludicrous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have closed these chapters, more or less.

Those loyalties and struggles have all become part of our

history.   Yusof  Ishak became our first  President.   We

have an Indian National Army Memorial at Connaught Drive.

The  Sun  Yat Sen Villa has been restored by the  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry.  And in  the  Nanyang

Technological  University,  there  is  a  Tan  Lark   Sye

Professorship.   So, it is a phase of  our  history,  but

that was not Singapore yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go back beyond that, then we inherit from the

great Asian civilisations - the Chinese, the Indians, and

the  Malay civilisations - valuable and essential for us,

part  of  our being, but not a complete basis for nation-building.   For example, Mr Gan Kim Yong cited the  story

of  Yue  Fei  and Qin Hui.  I knew exactly  what  he  was

talking about.  He asked:  Is it still taught in schools?

I  checked with my children.  Yes, it is still taught  in

schools,  and to my relief, yes, they do know  about  the

story.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>

These  are events 900 years ago in China, a dynasty  long

gone  and  extinct, but still a powerful  impact  on  all

Chinese-educated  Chinese everywhere -  in  PRC,  Taiwan,

Hong Kong, Singapore, even, I am sure, in the West.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, I visited China. I had some MPs with me.

And  we visited Hangzhou.  Hangzhou was the Southern Song

capital.  At that time, they called it Lin An.  And  that

is  where  Yue Fei was murdered, and that was  where  his

temple is.  We visited his temple.  I wanted to visit it.

Outside his temple, there are two statues of Qin Hui  and

his   wife,   kneeling,  asking   for   atonement.    And

generations of Chinese have gone there to spit  on  these

two  statues  out of utter contempt.  And  they  put  out

signs  there saying, "Chinese Government says, `You shall

not  spit  down here anymore.'", to no effect whatsoever.

Mr  Chiam  was  with  me, and he will  remember.   I  had

Chinese-educated members in my delegation and, I can tell

you,  I could see the powerful influence it had on  them.

It  was  an  emotional moment.  In fact, it was  a  noble

ideal  which  makes Chinese-educated Singaporeans  better

citizens of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, when I was small, I used to have at home

a  statue  of Yue Fei, having the words "Jing  Zhong  Bao

Guo"  carved on his back by his mother.  It was given  to

the   Senior  Minister  by  an  admirer  on  one  of  his

constituency tours, and we had it at home for many years.

I  studied  in Chinese school, and we memorised  all  the

poems.  We  know the history, we know the story,  and  we

identify  with them.  We all did.  Liu Thai Ker, recently

reporting on arts, on behalf of the ERC, quoted "Ba  Qian

Li  Lu,  Yun  He Yue" - it comes back to the  same  root.

But,  unfortunately,  this is not  a  history  shared  by

Singaporeans  of  other races, or even by  most  English-educated Chinese.  So, it is valuable, but it does not go

far  enough.  Furthermore, regrettably, its impact on the

younger  generation will be less.  Yes, we  teach  it  in

school.  Yes, they know it.  I asked my children what did

they  know about it.  They said, "Well, the mother carved

some  words on his back."  What does it all mean?   Where

does it fit in?  Into what world view?  That is not the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>

same.   I discussed this with George Yeo.  George Yeo  is

more  optimistic.   He says, "Let them  learn  the  story

first.   Maybe the significance will sink in  later."   I

hope  so,  but I think that the generations are changing,

and  we  have to move. Inherit this, but we have to  move

forward and develop our own heroes over many, many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made English our common language. That is a

mixed  blessing.  On the one hand, we bring the different

communities  together; on the other hand, we  merge  into

the greater globalised world, the Internet world, and  we

lose  our moorings unless we have some knowledge  of  our

mother  tongues  and our roots.  It is  different.   Hong

Kong wants to keep Cantonese.  The Taiwanese want to keep

Min  Nan Wei, not Guo Yu (the standard Mandarin),  to  be

different from the mainland, to have a separate Hong Kong

and  separate  Taiwanese  identity.   We  sometimes  half

seriously  ask  ourselves,  should  we  learn  to   speak

Singlish?   But if we did, where is our future?   So,  we

are back to English, and back to this dilemma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our society is still evolving, still

progressing.  We are building something rare and precious

here.   It  is  a secure, stable society in an  uncertain

world.   It  is a harmonious, multi-racial society  in  a

global environment where race and religion are rising and

disruptive forces.  It is an honest, clean and  efficient

Government in a continent where corruption is an  endemic

problem.  It is a system based on equal opportunities and

open competition, and one which has delivered a high  and

rising  standard  of  living for 3 million  Singaporeans.

So,  I  think  it  is  precious and it offers  individual

Singaporeans something special.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, each one of us has the maximum

opportunity to develop ourselves to the fullest,  and  to

make  a  difference to society, much more  than  anywhere

else  in the world.  At the lower end, Singaporeans enjoy

a  standard  of  living  better  than  nearly  any  other

country, certainly better than China and India with their

billions, probably even better than the US with the  many

homeless

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>

and  destitute.  In Singapore, you can be poor,  but  the

chances  are  you have a roof over your head,  and  there

will  be  help available.  For all Singaporeans, rich  or

poor,  there are exceptional opportunities - through  the

education  system,  through  the  scholarships  we  give,

through  working with companies, big and  small,  through

public service, to develop ourselves and to be exposed to

what is going on in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our small talent pool, we go to great

lengths  to develop our people.  So, when we go overseas,

the  quality  of  our people is not in doubt.   Many  top

universities  in  the US and the UK have disproportionate

numbers of Singaporeans.  In fact, Stanford University in

their  intake, of all the high schools in the world,  the

one  which sends the most students to Stanford every year

is  Raffles Junior College (RJC).  So, our standards  are

high,  and the opportunities are there.  It is  not  just

for  the few.  Recently, A*STAR gave a scholarship  to  a

young  girl to do a PhD in the life sciences.  Her father

is  a butcher.  In Singapore, if you have talent, in  one

generation, you can make the leap, and "Li Yu  Tiao  Long

Men", become a dragon!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think this is a cause well worthwhile fighting

for.   We  are beginning to develop a national  identity,

but this is far from complete.  But you see the signs  of

it, sometimes in crisis, sometimes in moments that you do

not  notice.  When Michael Fay happened, Singaporeans  in

the  US were stout hearted.  They stood up, and they were

not  ashamed of themselves.  They were not afraid to say,

"I  am  a  Singaporean.  We are doing the  right  thing."

When  we  send  SAF and Police officers overseas,  on  UN

missions,  peacekeeping operations,  they  do  us  proud.

They  are  multi-racial contingents.  They all  wear  the

Singapore  flag  with pride, and they serve  with  pride.

And  people know that, when you have Singaporeans in  the

contingent,  they do real work!  When East  Timor  became

independent,  one of the soldiers lowering  the  UN  flag

before midnight, the man in front, blue beret,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>

blue  uniform, but red and white Singapore  flag  on  his

shoulder  patch.  Our hearts go with them, and they  mean

something to all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think we have a long journey. If you look up,

it  is  far and steep.  If you look back, we have come  a

long way.  So, let us work together, year by year, and as

we  do so, we will strengthen our sense of nationhood and

shared destiny.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, we tabled this

Motion with the intention to identify possible causes  of

people thinking of quitting Singapore, and an attempt  to

look  for  solutions.  As we prosper  and  excel  in  our

economic  development, we cannot afford to lose sight  of

the need to also develop a sense of belonging, a sense of

ownership, and a sense of responsibility.  The  issue  of

stayers and quitters cannot be resolved overnight.   Like

Mr  Lee has mentioned, it is a long process, and it  will

take  time.  I hope that we will not stop at this debate.

I  hope  that  this debate will serve as a road  sign,  a

guiding post, for us to work towards building a Singapore

for Singaporeans, a home that we can all call our own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, it leaves me to thank all the

MPs  who  have spoken on this Motion.  They  have  spoken

passionately because this is an issue that  is  close  to

their hearts.  Their participation has undoubtedly helped

clarify and crystallise the issues at hand.  Many of them

have  made specific and useful suggestions, all with  the

single  purpose  in  mind  -  to  root  Singaporeans   to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the Government for

responding to the Motion - Mr Hawazi, Dr Ng Eng  Hen,  Dr

Vivian  Balakrishnan.  I would also like to thank  Deputy

Prime  Minister  Lee, in particular, for  his  insightful

remarks.  Having heard his comments, I am heartened  that

the  Government  is  taking a  serious  view  and  making

serious efforts to look at this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Motion has

been thoroughly debated in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>

this  House.  Madam, we have achieved what we set out  to

do.   Finally, I would like to thank the Speaker and you,

Mdm  Deputy  Speaker, for giving us this  opportunity  to

table this Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, noting the concern of Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong as highlighted in his National Day

Rally  Speech on "stayers" and "quitters" and in view  of

the  increased mobility of third-generation Singaporeans,

urges   the   Government  to  review  its  policies   and

programmes thoroughly and to take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>

meaningful  measures that will help to  strengthen  their

sense of belonging to Singapore.
