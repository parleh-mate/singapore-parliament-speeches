<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TRANSPLANT OF HUMAN ORGANS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Legislation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Health if he

will  introduce  legislation to allow for the  transplant  of

human  organs from living persons to recipients who  are  not

related to one another.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  current  laws  governing organ  donation  are  the

Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA) and the

Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA).  MTERA provides for an opt-in  system for organ donations, whereas HOTA provides  for  a

presumed consent system covering only kidneys from accidental

deaths.   Both  laws are narrowly defined and refer  only  to

cadaveric  donations.   My Ministry  regulates  living  donor

organ  transplantation through professional guidelines.   The

existing guidelines allow living donors who are related.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, MOH announced that it was prepared to

consider  living  unrelated  organ  transplants.    We   have

examined  the  regulations and practices of  other  countries

that  allow living unrelated organ donations and have  worked

out a set of ethical guidelines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are legitimate concerns about allowing living

unrelated organ transplants.  Firstly, there are risks to the

donor from the procedure, particularly for organs such as the

liver,  where  the risk of death or medical complications  is

significant.   Secondly,  there  is  a  danger  that  healthy

individuals  may be offered financial inducements  to  donate

their organs, thus creating the potential for organ trading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH is therefore very careful in allowing living

unrelated organ transplants. They would only be allowed under

exceptional   circumstances  if  they  meet   the   following

conditions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the medical condition must be urgent;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) all options for organ donation by a living relative

of  the  patient  have  been explored and  found  to  be  not

possible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the donor's motive must be purely altruistic,

as   established   through  a  review   by   an   independent

psychiatrist and a medical social worker, and stated  by  the

donor in a statutory declaration; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the risks and the possible outcomes of the

operation  must be fully explained to, and accepted  by,  the

donor and the recipient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, and better, option to increase the availability

of  organs  for  transplantation is to raise  the  number  of

cadaveric  organs.   To  achieve this  aim,  my  Ministry  is

considering amending the Human Organ Transplant Act, such  as

including non-accidental deaths under the Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rather

than  leave the matter to guidelines, which means a  decision

would  then  have  to  be  made by,  presumably,  a  Ministry

official,  would it not be practical to have  legislation  to

permit the transplant of the organs, so that the decision  is

not a discretionary matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, could we also not, when introducing such

legislation, take steps to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that it would be an offence to engage in the  trading

of organs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained,

today  our two Acts, MTERA and the HOTA, cover only cadaveric

organ  transplants.  All other transplants, particularly  for

related  organ  transplants, we have regulated these  through

professional  guidelines  under  the  Private  Hospitals  and

Medical  Clinics  Act.   Last year,  we  said  that  we  were

prepared to look at unrelated living organ transplants.  As I

also  said  in  my reply, we are looking at the  Human  Organ

Transplant  Act,  and  we  will be  conducting  consultations

sometime towards the end of the year to gauge public reaction

to  our  proposals to expand the Act.  Right  now,  the  main

thing  we  want  to expand the Act is, first, to  cover  from

accidental  death to non-accidental death.  The second  thing

we want to put forward to the public to consider is to expand

the scope of HOTA, to expand from just kidney to also include

liver,  and  maybe even cornea.  This is something   that  we

want to propose and gauge public response.  And, third, to be

able   to   move   from  cadaveric  transplants   to   living

transplants.   All these are being considered, and  the  best

way forward, because the Ministry does not want to be too far

ahead  of  community reactions to such changes, we  will  put

these  proposals up for consultation.  We will then make  the

necessary legislative amendments after that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister how

would his Ministry ensure that donors are not under emotional

coercion, and that donors know the long implications of organ

transplants,  as  well  as the high medical  risks  of  organ

transplants, including death?  And whether we should make  it

compulsory  for  donors to have psychological assessments  or

evaluation by psychiatrist, apart from being certified fit by

doctors for an organ transplant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree with the hon. Member that

there are many issues involved, and that is why we are taking

a  more cautious approach before expanding the scope of organ

transplants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, before we allow a living

unrelated transplant, we require that the donor's motive must

be  purely altruistic, and that the donor must be reviewed by

an  independent  psychiatrist, and not just a medical  report

that he is medically fit.  So, we do have these safeguards in

place for living unrelated donor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also concerned about emotional coercion and that

there  could  be a risk of financial inducements  leading  to

organ trading.  We could put in a clause - as we have in HOTA

-  to say that organ trading is illegal, but then we have  to

enforce  it.  There are many issues involved and, as  I  have

said,  we are putting up some proposals.  We will do a fairly

comprehensive public consultation, and we will then come back

to the House later with our final proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister, roughly, how long will the review take and how soon

can the changes be implemented.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, our time-frame is to put up the

consultation paper sometime at the end of the year and  then,

depending on how the public response progresses, we  hope  to

come to Parliament probably early next year.

<br>12.38 pm

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, it is

not  uncommon  to  see refuse vehicles carrying  wastes  leak

sullage  water  on  the roads.  They cause nuisance  to  road

users and residents.  It also pollutes the environment.  Some

popular  spots  I  notice of the leak of sullage  water  from

garbage  trucks are the uphill road in Hillview  Estate,  the

junction  where vehicles turn from Chua Chu Kang  Drive  into

Chua  Chu  Kang Avenue 3, and the junction, turning from  Toh

Tuck Road into Commonwealth Avenue West.  Under the sun,  the

sullage  water  emits a strong and unbearable  pungent  smell

that  affects the people living near the contaminated  roads,

and  also the roadusers.  Such dirty and smelly sullage water

from  the garbage trucks is unhygienic and could be a  health

hazard.  Sullage water must not leak from garbage trucks.   I

would  like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry has  any

rules  to  prevent  leakage  of sullage  water  from  garbage

trucks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, large amounts of construction debris dropped

from  an overloaded lorry, causing two out of three lanes  of

the  PIE  unusable.  Luckily, it happened during an  off-peak

period; otherwise, it would have caused serious traffic jams.

For  trucks carrying sand, marine clay and incineration  ash,

due  to  the  nature of these materials, the  fine  and  soft

materials leak continuously from the gap between the tailgate

and  the  body of the trucks carrying them.  As a result,  it

contaminates the roads, dirties the cars, generates dust  and

pollutes the air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the above problems are partly due to the

inadequate  design of the waste transportation vehicles,  and

partly  due  to the negligence of the drivers. What  are  the

measures  taken  by  the Ministry to ensure  that  all  waste

carrying vehicles have adequate designs?  Is there any action

to deter people from committing such irresponsible acts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for sharing their views relating to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



management   of  solid  waste  and  water  resources.    This

afternoon, I would like to respond to the solid waste  issues

first, followed by water issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr Ang Mong Seng

and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the reasons for the recent

increase  in  incineration fees and refuse  collection  fees.

Sir,  there is no more landfill sites on the main  island  of

Singapore.  Today, 7,000 tonnes of solid waste are  generated

and  burnt at our incineration plants every day.  These 7,000

tonnes are burnt because we need to reduce the volume of  our

solid  waste to preserve our landfill capacity.  These  7,000

tonnes  of solid waste are turned into 1,600 tonnes of bottom

ash.  We then landfill them at Pulau Semakau.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present approach poses two problems. Firstly, every

5-7  years, we have to build a new incineration plant.  These

plants are not cheap.  For example, the latest plant we built

at  Tuas  South  costs $890 million.  It is not  cheap.   The

second  problem is that every 25-30 years, we have to find  a

new  landfill  site,  the size of Sentosa  Island.   I  think

Members here will agree with me that the present approach  is

not  sustainable.  It is not possible for us to build  a  new

incineration plant at a cost of $890 million once  every  5-7

years.   It  is  not possible for us to find a  new  landfill

site, the size of Sentosa Island, once every 25-30 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, therefore, have to adopt a new approach to the

management  of solid waste.  Basically, we have  embarked  on

three  strategies.   Firstly,  we  do  whatever  we  can   to

encourage  the reduction of waste, so that we can reduce  the

amount of waste that goes into incineration.  Secondly,  even

for  those waste that has to be incinerated, we try  to  find

ways to re-use the bottom ash, so that they do not have to go

to  the  landfill site.  And, lastly, for those solid  wastes

which  go directly to the landfill site without going through

an incineration process, we also find ways to re-use them, so

that we can move towards what we call zero landfill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>



Hopefully,  the  day  will come when there  is  no  need  for

landfill requirements at all.  In fact, zero landfill is  the

only sustainable way for Singapore in the management of solid

waste.   This  is  the reason why we have no choice,  but  to

continue  to increase the charges for the incineration  fees,

not  to  make profits, but only to recover costs.  Even  with

the  latest  round of increase to $77 per tonne,  the  amount

collected  is  still below the full cost  of  processing  the

solid waste.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incineration fee accounts for about 60-70% of the total

operation  cost  of  the public waste collectors.   Companies

that  collect waste from the households have to pay  for  the

incineration  cost.   The  fees  they  pay  for  incineration

accounts  for about 60-70% of their business cost.   This  is

the  reason why when there is an increase in the incineration

fees,  they  will have to recover this increase in  the  fees

from the increase in refuse collection fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ENV is mindful that this adjustment will have some

impact on our households and, in particular, on the SMEs.  We

have  therefore spread out the increase over a period of  few

years.   The last increase from $67 to $77 came up  to  about

15%  increase.   But, of course, incineration  fee  does  not

account  for 100% of the business cost - only 60% of business

cost.   So,  60%  of 15% gives you 9%.  In other  words,  the

refuse collection fees for households and SMEs would have  to

go  up  by  about 9%, and not 15%, as mentioned by Prof.  Low

Seow  Chay yesterday.  This works out to about less  than  $1

per  month  per household.  For HDB flat, it is  about  88-95

cents per month.  In the case of landed property, it is about

$1.50  per  month.   In the case of the  hawker  centres  and

market stalls, it is about $5 a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that nobody likes any increase in the refuse

collection  fees.  But, as I have mentioned, the present  way

of managing our solid waste is not sustainable.  So, the only

way  for  us  is  to work together to enhance  the  level  of

recycling, as that is the only sustainable solution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked at what point in time that the

refuse  fee  can  be  lowered if the  residents  continue  to

support  waste recycling efforts.  Sir, this is a  very  good

question.   The  refuse fee comprises  two  components.   The

first  component is the service fee that we pay to the public

waste  collector for collecting the waste from our doorsteps.

The  second component is the disposal fee - for them to  send

the  waste  to the incineration plant for incineration.   For

every  tonne  of solid waste that the household  is  able  to

recycle,  the public waste company will be able to avoid  the

payment of $77 for that tonne of waste, because he no  longer

has  to incinerate that tonne of waste.  But the problem  is,

on  the  whole,  the level of participation in recycling,  as

well  as  the amount of waste being taken out from our  waste

stream, at this moment, has not reached a critical mass.   As

a  result, the public waste companies are still not  able  to

derive  enough savings from recycling to compensate  for  the

cost of recycling infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what it means is that, over time, if we can

continue  to  encourage  our  residents  and  households   to

participate  in recycling, then hopefully the day  will  come

when  certain precincts could reach the critical mass to  the

extent  that  the public waste collection companies  will  be

able  either to contain the rise in the refuse fees, or maybe

even to reduce the refuse fees, because they will be able  to

derive  additional value from the avoidance of having to  pay

for  the incineration, as well as to be able to derive values

from the recyclables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, the Members of the House here can

actually do a lot to help us encourage the residents to  take

part  in recycling.  Hopefully, their precinct will be  among

the  first to benefit from having achieved the critical  mass

in recycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members may ask, is it possible for us to

achieve a critical mass in recycling?  For me, the answer  is

"Yes".   In April last year, 2001, we initiated the  National

Recycling Programme.  At that point in time, only 15% of  the

residents took part in recycling, meaning 1 in 7.  By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



the  end of last year, it has gone up to 22%, 1 in 5.  By the

end of this year, our target is to achieve 1 in 3, and by the

end of next year, 1 in 2.  In other words, if we continue our

momentum in recycling, we can indeed achieve a critical  mass

in  recycling.  We have made a good start, but I would  admit

that there is still room for improvement.  Take, for example,

some  households, even today, are still not issued with green

bags,  because  the recycling company, for whatever  reasons,

decided  that it is not worth their while to issue the  green

bags to certain categories of households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the companies, even though they were

supposed to collect the green bags once every two weeks,  did

not  do so regularly.  It has not been consistent and thereby

created a problem for the households.  At the same time, many

of  the private apartments and condominiums in Singapore  are

not  part of the National Recycling Programme yet because the

collection  of  waste for private apartments  does  not  come

under the ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming months and years, we intend to take

three  actions  to  further improve  the  National  Recycling

Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first action we are taking is to expand the coverage

of  the  National Recycling Programme.  In the  case  of  the

condominiums, the participation rate today is only  4%.   Our

aim  is  to  increase it to at least 30% over  the  next  two

years.  ENV has started working with 14 major managing agents

in   the  private  sector  to  introduce  recycling  to   the

condominiums managed by them.  Some of them have indicated to

us that they do intend to introduce recycling within the next

3-6 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second action that we are taking is to improve the

quality  of  service of collection.  ENV is now looking  into

the introduction of what we call "Minimum Quality of Service"

(QOS).  These QOS standards will be imposed on all the public

waste  collection companies, and all companies that  want  to

take part in the collection of recyclables.  For example, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



are looking into the possibility of requiring them to provide

100%  coverage  to  every  household  within  their  area  of

responsibility.  It means that they cannot pick  and  choose.

Secondly, door-to-door collection must be done at least  once

every 2 weeks, and on a fixed day of the week, so as to  make

it  easier and less confusing for the households.  Last,  but

not  least, they must be committed to collect a minimum  list

of  recyclables,  so  that  the scope  of  recycling  can  be

broadened  over  time.   At  the  same  time,  we  will  also

encourage them, for example, to place recycling bins in  void

decks, to supplement the door-to-door collection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we will continue to strengthen

public  education, and to improve community awareness.   Sir,

in  this  regard,  we will be working very closely  with  the

grassroots  advisors, Town Councils and so on.  For  example,

we  will put up posters on notice boards, in the Town Council

Newsletters,  and we intend to conduct roving exhibitions  at

the various community centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that these three actions, when taken,

will  be  able  to ensure that the operation of the  National

Recycling  Programme will become smoother and,  at  the  same

time,  lead  to  a  greater  level of  participation  by  the

households.   Hopefully, this will lead  to  a  reduction  in

incineration,  and  thereby help  to  contain  any  potential

rising cost in refuse collection in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, to reduce incineration, household

recycling  alone is not enough.  We will continue to  promote

recycling in the industries.  In fact, we are very  happy  to

see  that  the  level  in  recycling in  the  industries  has

improved   last  year  in  the  areas  of  construction   and

demolition waste, used copper slab, paper, cardboard, and  so

on.  We are also beginning to see the recycling of food waste

from  the  food  industry.  All these  are  very  encouraging

signs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming years, in order to reach a 60% target

by 2012 under the SGP



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



2012,  we have set ourselves much higher targets for a  whole

host of waste stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having addressed our strategy to reduce

incineration, I would like to go on to talk about what we can

do  with the incineration bottom ash, when it comes out  from

the  incinerators.   As I mentioned earlier,  everyday  1,600

tonnes of incineration bottom ash are being produced from the

burning  of  the solid waste in Singapore.  At  this  moment,

they  account for two-thirds of the waste that end up in  the

landfill site in Pulau Semakau.  Sir, we believe that  if  we

can  find  ways to reuse this bottom ash, then over time,  we

will  be  able to reduce the demand for landfill.  We started

doing  this  with the LTA.  A pilot project is now  on-going.

We  were  using  the Incineration Bottom Ash (IBA)  for  road

construction.  If this project is successful, we do intend to

broaden the use of IBA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third strategy, which is to

reduce  the solid wastes that are not being incinerated,  but

end  up in the landfill site directly.  We call it the direct

landfill,  eg,  construction and demolition  waste  and  used

copper slab.  Today, these are the two top solid wastes  that

end  up  in the landfill site directly, and they account  for

50% of our direct landfill waste.  So, we have decided to set

a  higher target for recycling these two waste streams.  Sir,

take  for  example  the case of construction  and  demolition

waste.  We are now working with the construction industry  to

see how we can increase the recycling rate from 85% today  to

90%  by the year 2012.  At the same time, in the case of  the

copper slab, from 90% to 95%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether something

can  be  done to recycle tree branches, trimmings and so  on,

and turn them into useful products.  Horticultural waste,  as

mentioned by Mr Ang yesterday, is not small.  Every year,  we

produce  about 280,000 tonnes.  These are basically generated

by  the landscape contractors of NParks and the various  Town

Councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our intention, basically, is to create more

facilities in the private sector, through the private sector,

so that some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>



this  horticultural  waste can be  turned  into  compost  and

charcoal.  Two new facilities will come into operation by the

end  of  the  year.  Our target is to increase the  recycling

rate  for the horticultural waste from 32% today to 70%  over

the next 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the overall outcome of these three strategies that

I  have mentioned - reduce incineration, reuse bottom ash, as

well  as reuse and reduce the direct landfill, will hopefully

help us to reduce, not just the amount of waste, but also the

amount of waste for landfill.  Today, we dispose about  2,400

tonnes of solid waste in the landfill site, and this quantity

is  expected to increase to 3,300 tonnes by the year 2012, an

increase of almost 50%.  We believe that the three strategies

outlined  earlier will enable us to reduce the waste disposed

at  the landfill site by 50%.  Sir, instead of going up  from

2,400  tonnes  to  3,300 tonnes over the next  10  years,  we

should  be  able  to reduce it, from 2,400  tonnes  to  1,600

tonnes.   And if we can succeed in doing so, we will be  able

to  reduce  the need for new incineration plants  from  1  in

every  5-7  years  to  1  in every 10-15  years.   But,  more

importantly, we will be able to extend the life-span of Pulau

Semakau from 25-30 years today, to at least 50 years in  time

to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to address some of the specific

cuts  brought up by the Members.  Prof. Low Seow  Chay  asked

why  do  we  allow some recycling companies to  collect  more

waste than they could, and as a result pose a fire risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV is aware that some of the recycling companies

do  accumulate  a  large amount of waste at  their  premises.

What  they  really have to do is to upgrade  their  recycling

operations, so that they can recycle these wastes faster  and

more  efficiently.   Under  our  Innovation  for  Environment

Sustainability  Fund,  we  are working  with  some  of  these

recycling companies to see how we can help them to  come  out

with  new  and better methods to recycle their  wastes.   For

example, we are now working with the industry to see  how  we

can process the horticultural wastes to produce compost in  a

shorter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>



time  so that the quality will be more consistent and better.

At  the same time, we will continue to enforce strict actions

against  those who deliberately flout the regulations.   Over

the  past  five years, we only had two cases of fire  in  the

waste  recycling  facilities.  One case was  the  wood  waste

recycling  company  at Lim Chu Kang.  The wood  waste  caught

fire in March 1998.  The SCDF conducted an investigation  and

came   to   the  conclusion  that  the  fire  was   not   set

deliberately.   So  no  legal action was  taken  against  the

company, but that company did clear the debris very promptly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case was the fire in November last year. I

think this was the case cited by Prof. Low Seow Chay.  As the

case is now in court, I will not comment further on the case.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether there are any rules on

enforcement to prevent the refuse trucks from leaking sullage

water.   Yes,  indeed,  there are rules  and  regulations  on

refuse removal operations.  The waste collectors are required

to  use  compaction vehicles for the collection  of  domestic

waste,  as  well  as various organic wastes.   They  have  to

minimise  the smell and they have to prevent the spillage  of

waste.   Before they embark on the road, they have  to  drain

off  the  sullage water from the compaction  of  refuse  into

sewers  in the bin centre.  We are aware that there are  some

trucks  that  are  still  not conforming  to  the  rules  and

regulations.   The  ENV  will continue  to  take  enforcement

action,  and  will pay particular attention to the  locations

cited by Prof. Low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether we have any rules to

prevent vehicles  carrying construction debris and sand  from

polluting the environment.  The lorries are required to cover

up   the   construction  materials.   The  ENV  carries   out

enforcement  rounds  regularly.  Last  year,  there  were  54

offenders.  When they are caught, for the first offence, they

are  fined  $150; second offence, $200; third offence,  $250.

Beyond   that,  for  subsequent  offences,  these   are   not

compoundable.  They will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



have  to go to court and the fines will be determined by  the

court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed the issues relating to

the  management  of  solid wastes.  I will  now  move  on  to

address  the  issue  relating  to  the  management  of  water

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th April, the Prime Minister said in this House that

Singapore  will move away from our reliance on  Malaysia  for

water.   Yesterday, several Members  -  Dr Teo Ho Pin,  Prof.

Low  Seow  Chay  and  so  on  -  have  also  called  for  the

Government to increase our self-sufficiency in water  supply.

Sir, in 10 years' time, on the demand side, we can expect our

demand  to go up by about one-third, meaning that we will  be

consuming  one-third more than what we are  consuming  today.

This  is on the demand side.  On the supply side, the  expiry

of  the 1961 agreement in 2011 will reduce water supply  from

Malaysia.  Basically,  the  Members  are  asking,  when  that

happens in 2011, with higher demand and lower supply, will we

be faced with water shortage by then?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, Members of the House, as well as

members  of  the  public, are concerned  with  three  issues.

First,  will  we have enough water by the year 2011,  if  the

1961 agreement is not renewed and extended?  Second, will  we

have  enough  water from 2011 to 2061?  Lastly, what  happens

after 2061?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to assure this House that even though the

1961  agreement  will  only expire in  10  years'  time,  the

Government  has already embarked on several key  projects  to

increase our own water supply.  I will now give the House  an

update  on this.  First, we are going ahead with three  major

projects to increase the supply of the local catchment water.

We  are going to convert the Marina Basin into a fresh  water

reservoir.   Second, we want to create a new reservoir,  down

stream  of the Lower Seletar Reservoir.  Third, we are  going

to  link up all the reservoirs in Singapore, so that we  will

be able to maximise the yield of the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



catchment areas in Singapore.  These three projects  will  be

completed by the year 2009.  They will significantly increase

the  supply  of our local catchment water from where  we  are

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are going to proceed with desalination as a

new  source  of  water supply.  The cost of desalination  has

come down steadily and rapidly by 50% over the last 10 years.

PUB  has therefore called a tender for 30 mgd of desalination

water.   The  tender will close on 31st May.  The plant  will

come into production by 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides desalination, what are the other options?

Yesterday,  Prof. Low asked whether we can ferry  water  from

Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and so on.  Let me  explain

to  the House that we are talking about securing water supply

to  meet the long-term requirements of Singapore.  We are not

talking  about having additional supply to solve our  problem

for one day, one week, next five years or next 10 years.   We

are  securing  water supply, hopefully, that will  strengthen

our  supply  system  for the next 50  years,  100  years  and

beyond.  In this regard, I do not feel comfortable relying on

this idea of ferrying water, no matter what is the amount, no

matter  how  cost  effective it  may  be,  from  places  like

Australia,  New Zealand and so on.  As pointed out  by  Prof.

Low,  in  times of emergency, maybe those options are viable.

But,  for today, I want to talk about long-term water supply,

meaning  sources which will be able to provide  good  quality

and substantial quantity of water over a long duration  -  50

years,  100  years and beyond  - and at a competitive  price.

Otherwise, over time, we will not be able to contain the cost

of water if these water sources are not cost competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, I would say that the two strategies,

which  I outlined earlier to expand the local catchment  area

and  to increase water supply through desalination,  are what

I  call the strategies of addition.  For example, let us  say

that  in our zoo today, we have only one lion.  If we  decide

that  one lion is not enough, and we would like to have  four

lions, what do we do?  One way is very simple.  1 plus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>



3 equals to 4.  So we go out to look for another three lions.

We  bring them to the zoo.  Then, 1 plus 3 equals to 4 lions.

So this is the strategy of addition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another approach. Assuming that we have a

lion, and why do we not find a lioness?  With a male lion and

a  lioness, they can together produce baby lions.  1 plus  1,

multiply by 2 also equals to 4.  In other words, as  we  look

for  a  long-term supply solution, we should not confine  our

mindset to just looking for new water sources to add  to  our

supply.  But, more importantly, we should think about how  we

can multiply the capacity of our water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leads me to our third strategy which is to

develop  water reclamation into a major source of  supply  in

the  long-term supply system of Singapore.  Some may ask what

is    the   difference   between   water   reclamation   from

desalination.  Why do we say that desalination  is  addition?

Why  do  we  say  that  water reclamation is  multiplication?

There is a big difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we consume 300 million gallons of water per day.

Every  single drop of the 300 million gallons of water, after

being  used,  is  treated by PUB to internationally  accepted

standard before it is discharged into the open seas.  And  to

make sure that this water is treated to the standard required

of the international community, we continuously invest in our

infrastructure  to ensure that sewage water will  be  treated

properly.   This  is precisely why we embarked  on  the  DTSS

(Deep  Tunnel  Sewerage System), as mentioned  by  Mr  Zainul

yesterday.  The DTSS is our long-term solution to ensure that

every single drop of used water will be treated properly  and

in  the  most  cost-effective manner.  In  other  words,  the

implementation  of  DTSS is to help  us  save  money  in  the

treatment of used water.  It does not incur additional  cost.

In  fact, it saves us cost.  Therefore, the concern that  the

DTSS  may  lead  to  higher water prices  in  the  future  is

unfounded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Zainul also asked whether we can find ways

to  use  the  DTSS for other utilities.  It is a  good  idea,

except that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



the DTSS is very deep.  That is why it is called deep tunnel.

It  is about 30-50 metres underground.  It is too deep for us

to use it for electricity, cable and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me come back to the point about

water  reclamation.  As I said, every drop of  water  is  now

being treated before we discharge it into the open seas.   At

this  moment,  only  5%  of  the  water  after  treatment  is

reclaimed  as industrial water.  The other 95%, or more  than

280  million  gallons per day, is being discharged  into  the

open seas, and is really wasted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the advancement in membrane technology, it

is  now possible for us to recover a good percentage of  this

95% of treated used water and turn it into clean water again.

In  other words, we can really give every drop of water a new

lease of life.  Instead of releasing this water into the open

sea, let this treated used water be mixed with sea water, and

then  take it back to go through desalination, which will  be

very  expensive.  Basically, we are saying,  why  do  we  not

capture  this  water before it is being discharged  into  the

open sea?  So, we turn the treated used water into new water,

and  we give it a new lease of life, and that is why the  PUB

has called it the NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin yesterday asked whether this strategy is a

costly  option.  Will it be very expensive?  In  fact,  water

reclamation has  two major advantages.  Firstly, it  is  much

cheaper than desalination.  In terms of capital cost  of  the

facility  for  reclaimed water, it  is  about  half  that  of

desalination.   Secondly, in terms of energy  consumption   - energy  cost  -  water reclamation costs only one-quarter  to

one-fifth  that of desalination.  Putting the  two  together,

the  saving in capital cost and the reduction in energy cost,

in  fact, NEWater will cost about half to one-third  that  of

the cost of desalination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second advantage of NEWater is that it is clean. It

is  even  cleaner than PUB water.  If we are to look  at  the

total organic carbon of NEWater, it is less than one-tenth of

PUB water.  Precisely because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



of   that,  the  industry  users  find  NEWater  to  be  very

attractive.  Take, for example, the wafer fabrication plants.

Today,  they take our PUB water and process it to reduce  the

total  organic carbon to a level that is acceptable for their

operation.   This  will cost them money.  But  starting  from

next  year,  all  the wafer fab plants in Singapore  will  be

using NEWater instead of PUB water.  Why?  Because NEWater is

cleaner  than  PUB  water,  and is more  suitable  for  their

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prof. Low Seow Chay asked what are we going

to  do  to  market  NEWater beyond wafer fabrication  plants.

Sir,  this is a very good question.  Our intention is to  set

up  a  reticulation system to reach out to various industrial

estates  and commercial hubs in Singapore, so that  over  the

next  10  years, we will be able to expand the use of NEWater

beyond  wafer  fabrication plants, to various  other  sectors

such  as  semi-conductors, chemicals, electronics, utilities,

engineering and so on.  Starting with 15 million gallons  per

day next year for the wafer fabrication plants, our target is

to  expand the use to more than 55 million gallons per day by

the   year  2012.   By  the  year  2012,  NEWater  or   water

reclamation  will  account for at least 15%  of  total  water

demand in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this increase in our water supply, namely, local

catchment expansion by the year 2009, desalination  by  2005,

and  NEWater by 2003 will be more than enough to make up  for

the drop in Johor water, by the time the 1961 water agreement

expires in 2011.  In other words, to the question whether  we

have  enough water by the year 2011, the answer is  yes.   We

will  have  more than enough to make up for the reduction  in

Johor  water.   At the same time, this increase  in  our  own

supply will enhance our self-sufficiency in water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question is: during the period between

2011  and  2061,  will  we have enough  water?   During  this

period, beyond 2011, we expect our total demand for water  to

continue to increase, as our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>



population  continues  to grow and the economy  continues  to

expand.   On the demand side, we need to conserve as much  as

we  can,  a very important point mentioned by Dr Teo  Ho  Pin

yesterday.  The PUB has an on-going educational and publicity

programme.  Over the years, the education programme  and  the

restructuring  of  our  water tariffs  have  been  effective.

Take,  for example, in 1996 and 1997, the increase  in  water

consumption  was  about 4-5% a year.  By  1998  to  2000,  it

dropped  to 1.2%.  Last year, the growth in water consumption

continues  to decline to 0.5%.  Therefore, I share  Dr  Teo's

point that it is very important for all of us to continue  to

do  whatever  we can to create this awareness  towards  water

conservation.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on the supply side, we will continue

to increase our own supply.  With the three projects which  I

have outlined earlier, there is still further scope for us to

further  expand the catchment areas.  At the same time,  with

the  cost  of desalinated water coming down, there  is  still

scope   for  us  to  continue  to  increase  the  amount   of

desalinated  water.  But, more importantly,  there  is  still

tremendous  scope for us to produce a lot more  NEWater  from

2011 to 2061, and beyond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just share with the House here that the

multiplying effect of NEWater is tremendous.  For example, if

we  were to reclaim 50% of the used water, we will be able to

double  the  water  supply  capacity  in  Singapore.   Today,

membrane  technology  for  water reclamation  can  achieve  a

recovery rate of up to 75%.  At 75%, it means that every drop

of water can be turned into four drops of water.  This is the

power   of  multiplication.   So,  the  adding  to  and   the

multiplying of our water supply system - expansion  in  local

catchment areas, desalination and water reclamation  -  is  a

very effective and very powerful combination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the challenge of water shortage is not a

problem faced by Singapore alone.  It is a global challenge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>



We  can be sure that there is research going on today looking

for  cheaper  and  better ways of producing  water.   We  can

expect  a breakthrough in technology in the coming years  and

decades.    We   intend  to  take  full  advantage   of   any

technological breakthrough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, this diversified platform of water

supply  will  enable us to increase our  water  supply  in  a

sustainable  manner  for  the next 50-60  years  and  beyond.

Therefore, the answer to the second question, whether we  are

confident of having enough water from 2011 to 2061, again, is

yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Othman and Mr Ahmad Magad asked whether

NEWater is safe to drink and, if so, when do we plan  to  use

it  for  potable use.  The use of reclaimed water for potable

use  is not new, as pointed out by Mr Othman.  This has  been

done  in several parts of USA for more than 20 years.   Take,

for  example,  just outside of Los Angeles,  a  place  called

Orange  County, they have been using water reclamation  since

1976  under a project known as Water Factory 21.  This  Water

Factory  21  produces 13 mgd, and is supplied to a population

of  about  2.5  million.   They have plans  to  increase  the

capacity of Water Factory 21 to 110 mgd over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is North Virginia, a place called

Fairfax  County,  just outside Washington D.C.   Since  1978,

they   have  been  implementing  water  reclamation   for   a

population   of  about  1.2  million.   Today,   this   water

reclamation  plant produces about 44 mgd.  Again,  they  have

plans  to  expand it to 70 mgd.  At these various  locations,

they  discharge  the  reclaimed water  into  the  reservoirs,

either  aboveground or underground reservoirs.  The reclaimed

water  is  then further processed together with the water  in

the  reservoirs, both underground and aboveground.  The whole

process is what we call the indirect potable use of reclaimed

water.   This  means they do not consume the reclaimed  water

directly,  but  go  through the process  of  mixing  it  with

reservoir water and process it for the second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask, if we say that the quality of reclaimed

water is so good, why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



then  is there a need to process the water one more time,  by

mixing  it  with  reservoir water?   I  asked  the  technical

experts and the answer given to me is very interesting.   The

technical  experts told us that the reason  they  do  this  - indirect potable use - is not because the reclaimed water  is

not  clean enough, but rather it is because the water is  too

clean.   After going through dual membranes and ultra-violet,

it  is so clean that the process takes away the minerals  and

nutrients  in  the water.  As a result, in all these  places,

what  they  have  to  do is to mix the reclaimed  water  with

reservoir water because this is the easiest way to  put  back

the minerals and nutrients into the water.  After processing,

it is consumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point to note is that while this process of

water reclamation started in the 1970s in USA, it is becoming

a  growing  trend  in  USA and other countries  today.   Why?

Because  the  technology  is improving  all  the  time.   The

quality of the reclaimed water is improving and, at the  same

time, the cost of water reclamation is coming down.  We  were

told  that in Atlanta, Georgia, they are now building a water

reclamation  plant.  Starting with 15 mgd,  which  will  come

into operation by 2005, it will eventually be expanded to  50

mgd.  Again, North Virginia, having been very successful with

the project that I mentioned earlier, is now building another

plant.  Starting with 10 mgd, it will come into operation  by

2008.  Basically, what is happening overseas has given  us  a

lot  of  confidence regarding the potential indirect  potable

use of reclaimed water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Singapore, the NUS laboratory has

been  conducting very comprehensive analyses  of  NEWater  to

ensure  that the water quality is indeed as good as what  the

technical literature has put it up to be.  These analyses are

supervised  by  a panel of experts, both internationally  and

locally, because we want to make sure that we tap on the best

brains in the world.  The process started more than two years

ago  and  tests are now on-going.  So far, the NUS laboratory

has  conducted 20,000 analyses over the last two  years,  and

they have established that NEWater is cleaner than PUB water.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



Normally, we look at water quality from three angles;  first,

in  terms  of  chemical  quality such as  the  total  organic

carbon,  minerals,  nutrients.  They have established,  after

20,000 analyses, that NEWater is even cleaner than PUB water.

Next,  in  terms  of  physical quality such  as  clarity  and

colour, again NEWater outperforms PUB water.  In other words,

NEWater  is  WHO+, because it is able to meet and exceed  the

World Health Organisation's standards.  This explains why  it

is attractive to the industry for use as high-grade water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is the bacteriological quality of the

water.   This is a very important factor because for  potable

use,  we are concerned about bacteria count, viruses, and  so

on.  Sir, here, I am happy to inform the House that based  on

the  20,000 analyses so far, they have established  that  the

bacteriological quality of NEWater is as good as  PUB  water,

because  the presence of bacteria and virus is not detectable

- it is so low.  It is just not present in the water, thereby

meeting the World Health Organisation's standards again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if we look at NEWater, it is not only

WHO+,  it is also PUB+.  It satisfies all the WHO's standards

and it is even cleaner than PUB water.  Notwithstanding that,

there  is  no need for us to rush the process.  We intend  to

take it one step at a time.  The next step is for us to await

the  recommendations  from these international  experts.   We

give  them enough time to conclude their studies.  We  expect

the  recommendations to come to the PUB and the ENV  sometime

in July.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad asked when will the Visitors' Centre

for  NEWater  be  ready.  I am aware  that  the  interest  in

NEWater  is now getting higher and higher.  This  is  a  good

sign.   The PUB is now building the Visitors' Centre  at  the

Bedok  NEWater Plant, which will be ready by early next year.

At  the  same time, to make it more convenient for our school

students  to get to know more about NEWater, we are exploring

the setting up of a Visitors' Centre in the Singapore Science

Centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me sum up the issue of water supply. As

Members of the House have mentioned, it is very important for

Singapore  to secure our water supply, and to be  more  self-sufficient.  With the increased supply of our local catchment

areas,  together with desalination and NEWater,  we  are  now

diversifying and increasing our water sources from two  today

- Johor water and local catchment water - to four by the year

2005.   In other words, if we look at Singapore as a country,

we  will  have  four big national taps.  What  is  even  more

important to note is that the water coming out from each  and

every  one  of  these four taps is of equally  good  quality.

Should the supply be disrupted in any of these four taps, the

other three taps can provide the mutual back-up to the fourth

tap.   We do not know what will happen to the supply of these

four  taps.   Maybe drought will reduce the supply  of  local

catchment  water.   Maybe pollution in  catchment  areas  may

reduce  the supply of water from Johor.  We do not know  what

will  happen.  But what is important is that we now have four

taps.   Whenever  the  supply in one  tap  is  being  reduced

because  of  whatever reasons, at least we have  three  other

taps  to  provide the mutual back-up.  Sir, in this way,  our

supply  system will not only become more cost-effective  but,

at  the  same  time, more resilient as we become  more  self-sufficient in our water supply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin yesterday asked:</b> can we be completely self-sufficient in the long term? Sir, the 1962 Water Agreement

will  continue to run until 2061.  Therefore,  the  issue  of

whether Singapore can be completely self-sufficient does  not

arise  until  2061.  After 2061, of course, we  do  not  know

whether  there  will  be an extension of  water  supply  from

Malaysia.  This is an on-going issue being negotiated  today.

But  what  is important is for us to recognise that Singapore

is  an  island  surrounded by sea  water.   Today,  with  the

advancement  in  membrane  technology,  with  the   cost   of

desalination coming down, with the ability to multiply  water

sources  through  water  reclamation,  the  answer  is:  Yes,

Singapore  certainly  can become completely  self-sufficient,

after 2061, if need be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that I want to assure

this  House and our people out there that they can  count  on

this  Government to do whatever necessary to ensure  that  we

will have enough supply to meet the needs of our industry, of

our people, today, in the future, for a long time to come.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the Singapore Green

Plan,  the target for air quality is 85% of good days - "good

days" being defined as days when the PSI reading is below 50.

I  understand  that the key pollutants that  matter  in  this

regard are sulphur dioxide and also particulate matters.  One

of  the main contributing factors, if we take away the  haze,

is  diesel  vehicles.  And we know that public transportation

in Singapore is the main user of diesel vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now in an era where there is a range of more

environment-friendly  options.  The range  includes  electric

vehicles, hybrid vehicles, right through to natural gas,  and

so  on.   So  the question is: how actively are  we  pursuing

these  options as part of our longer term effort  to  improve

air  quality in Singapore?  I welcome the initiative  of  the

compressed natural gas pilot project that the Ministry of the

Environment  has initiated with SBS and also  with  the  taxi

companies, ie, Comfort and City Cab.  I think 30 buses and 50

taxis are involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the questions I have are, first of all, what is the

time-frame for this pilot project, and what criteria will  be

used to assess its success and viability for extension to the

broader  fleet within the public transportation system?   The

second  question  is that the feedback, in general,  suggests

that the upfront cost of many of these green vehicles is  not

adequately  compensated for by the vehicle rebates  that  are

given  by LTA.  I believe that there has been some discussion

on  this  in  the  debate on the budget of  the  Ministry  of

Transport.   My question for the Ministry of the  Environment

is,  assuming  the  Ministry  of Transport's  policy  remains

unchanged on the matter of green vehicle rebates, whether  it

is  capital  or  operating cost rebates, what  more  can  the

Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



the Environment do to encourage public transport operators to

adopt the use of more environment-friendly vehicles?

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, you can take your two cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, my topic is

heat island.  The Concept Plan 2001 has increased the density

and  height  of future developments in Singapore.   High-rise

and  high-density  development will have  an  impact  on  the

quality  of  our  living environment,  such  as  ventilation,

warming,  pollution and noise.  One area of  concern  is  the

build-up of heat in our built environment due to the  compact

development and lack of cross natural ventilation -  this  is

what we call the wind tunnel effect.  This problem is further

compounded  by  the  extensive use of airconditioning,  which

emits hot air to the surrounding areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

(1)  What is the long-term plan to prevent the heating up  of

our  living environment?  (2) What are the measures taken  to

ensure  that the air ambient temperature is within  tolerable

limit?   (3)  How  does  the Green  Plan  2012  integrate  or

coordinate with the Concept Plan 2001?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on green consumers. Human activity has

left  a  permanent mark, potentially increasing  the  earth's

temperature,  destroying massive areas  of  tree  cover,  and

obliterating  thousands  of  living  species.   When  we   go

shopping, we use public or private transport, and we choose a

place to live.  Our choices have an effect on the quality  of

the   air  we  breathe,  or  the  water  we  drink,  and  the

environment  we  live in.  Everything we do will  affect  the

ecological balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

(1)   What   is  the  long-term  plan  to  encourage   "green

consumerism"?   (2)  What  are  the  measures  or  incentives

undertaken by the Ministry to support "green products"?   (3)

How do we educate Singaporeans to be green consumers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I was pleased to

learn from MOS Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday that the use  of

HDB  flats  for  home-based food business is  allowed  within

certain  guidelines.  Nonetheless, I noted with  a  tinge  of

amusement  when  MOS  Vivian added that, eventually,  whether

these  home-based food operators would take off would  depend

on the Ministry of the Environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the common complaint we often

hear  is  how  the public is referred from one department  to

another  is  also  making its manifestation  in  this  august

Chamber.  It seems that, although HDB has given its blessing,

it  is  no  guarantee that such home-based food business  can

take  off.   Now,  I would have to refer the  matter  to  the

Minister for the Environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to what is foremost in my mind and being an

optimist,  I am hopeful that the Minister for the Environment

and  his  MOS had followed through the arguments  I  had  put

forward  to  the  Minister  for National  Development  in  my

petition on Monday.  As such, I will not labour over the same

arguments  for advocating an informal sector in Singapore  to

help   the   unemployed,  and  to  nurture   mum   and   papa

entrepreneurs among the heartlanders by allowing them to  use

their  flat dwellings for operating home-based food business.

If  this  group  of  people were to be  granted  licences  to

distribute  and  sell their home-based  cooked  food,  it  is

important  that we ensure that the hygiene standards  of  the

food that they prepare are up to the standards prescribed  by

the  Ministry for hawkers preparing and serving food  in  the

hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last six months, I have seen no less than

10  residents who had been fined for selling food  without  a

proper  licence.  I raise this matter to the  Minister  as  a

matter  of  public concern, because of the need to  meet  two

seemingly  opposing  imperatives.  On  the  one  hand,  I  am

concerned that we help these unemployed people find temporary

sources of income, while they search and wait for job  offers

elsewhere.  On the other hand, we need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that standards of public hygiene, with regard to  the

handling of food, need to be strictly adhered to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully empathise with the Ministry's concerns in

respect  of  granting licences to people who want to  operate

their  food business from their homes and to sell  the  food.

It  is  not easy to ensure that hygiene standards are adhered

to,  because of the diffusion of multiple food businesses  in

the  homes of these people.  Nonetheless, as advanced  in  my

arguments  on  Monday, administrative difficulties  in  doing

something  should  not be used as reasons for  not  exploring

solutions to facilitate the outcomes that we are seeking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, we can stipulate a number of measures

to  address these concerns of hygiene standards and  quality.

For  example,  we  could  do  the following:  organise  short

educational,  food  preparation and hygiene  courses  by  the

CDCs, and aspiring small scale home-based food operators  are

required  to go through this programme before being issued  a

licence  to  sell food.  Limit the type of food that  can  be

prepared from home, eg, cakes, biscuits, desserts, satay  and

other  dried  food.   I urge the Minister to  consider  these

measures in order that his Ministry can justify the issue  of

such  licences.   In this way, we can ensure  conformance  to

standards and practices, and this is where the CDCs can  come

in  to  ensure  this.   After all, CDCs were  established  to

provide  decentralised service to the constituents  to  serve

them better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe policies must be responsive to changing

needs  and times.  Where we have constraints in making change

at the Ministry level, the CDCs, at their level, must provide

the  flexibility to address the needs of these people.  Those

who  do  not comply to specifications can have their licences

revoked.   Another way in which the Ministry,  or  CDCs,  can

also  maintain a better control of those who have been issued

with  a  licence  would be to maintain a  registry  of  these

operators.  CDCs could consider setting up a central  kitchen

for  these small-scale operators to prepare food and organise

for distribution of such prepared food to hawker centres,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>



restaurants  and other food outlets.  This will  spin  off  a

totally new food cottage industry in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate what I said on Monday, in fact, the

successful Bengawan Solo started its cake business  from  its

HDB kitchen flat many years back.  I also understand that  in

Taiwan, ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho, you are taking too long again.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> --- many of their successful

businesses started from home.  Our leaders have been  hailing

Singaporeans to change their mindset.  On this premise, I  am

calling on the Ministry of the Environment to embrace  a  new

mindset.   I  would  like to urge the  Ministry  to  consider

granting licences to enable these people to sell their food.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members of

Parliament - Mr Iswaran, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Ho -  for  the

very important issues they have brought up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first begin with the issue that Mr Iswaran

brought  up  on air quality.  If we look at air  quality  and

look  at  domestic  factors  that  affect  the  air  quality,

certainly, vehicle emissions are the most important.  Of  the

three  fuels  that  can power vehicles - petrol,  diesel  and

compressed  natural  gas (CNG) - CNG  is  the  cleanest,  and

diesel the least clean.   If we compare CNG to diesel, if  we

use  CNG,  we  will reduce particulate material emissions  by

more than 95%, and it will also reduce emissions, things like

nitrate oxide, hydrocarbons and sulphur dioxide.  So, ENV  is

taking  a  pro-active approach to encourage public  transport

companies  to try out CNG buses and taxis.  This  is  because

the  vehicular  emissions from these  vehicles  are  a  major

source of air pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major initiative we have taken is to work with our

industry   partners  in  the  establishment   of   supporting

infrastructure for CNG vehicles.  The cost of the  first  CNG

vehicle  refuelling  station in  Jurong  Island  was  jointly

funded by the gas company



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>



and    ENV,    under   the   Innovation   for   Environmental

Sustainability  (IES)  Fund.  ENV  has  also  been  providing

funding  support to help defray the higher cost of CNG  buses

compared  to  diesel  buses, so that the  bus  companies  can

experiment with CNG buses and gain a better understanding  of

the  long-term  cost  effectiveness of  operating  CNG  buses

versus diesel buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is focusing on public buses and taxis as the first

step.   If  the  outcome  is  positive  from  operation   and

environmental point of view, ENV intends to facilitate  other

fleet  owners to try out various types of green  vehicles  to

protect our air quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these schemes have just started. We need to wait

and  see  how they work out.  From this experience,  we  also

need  to  see what will be the long-term economic feasibility

of going completely into CNG.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the issue of higher temperatures in

cities,  that  Dr  Teo  brought up, this  urban  heat  island

concept  was  attributed  to  an American  meteorologist  who

pointed  out that the temperature of cities is a few  degrees

higher  than  that of the surrounding areas.  There  are  two

factors  that  give  rise to this.  This  urban  heat  island

effect is, firstly, caused by the absorption and radiation of

heat  by  man-made surfaces during the day, and the  lack  of

vegetation to provide shade and absorb the heat in  an  urban

environment.  The second factor is the heat released into the

urban  atmosphere by combustion processes from  vehicles  and

from  airconditioning and other sources of energy used within

the city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV, together with other Ministries, is working to

reduce  the  heat  island  effect by  tackling  both  causes.

First,  MND,  BCA,  URA and NParks have  already  implemented

measures  that could help to counter, or mitigate, this  heat

island effect.  And these measures include, first, the use of

lighter and cooler roofing and pavement materials that do not

absorb or radiate as much heat as dark surfaces or materials;

secondly,  by  setting up guidelines, standards and  building

design



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>



codes  to  reduce  the heat trapped within buildings  and  to

incorporate  green spaces as far as practicable; thirdly,  by

planting roadside trees and shrubs to increase the vegetation

within  the city; fourthly, by provision of parks and gardens

around buildings; finally, by promoting roof-top gardens  and

high-rise greenery under the concept of Singapore as  a  City

in a Garden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way of trying to reduce the temperature

within  the city is to reduce the heat produced by the energy

that  we  use, and we do this by promoting energy efficiency.

This  is being done under the auspices of the National Energy

Efficiency  Committee (NEEC).  The NEEC  recently  introduced

the  energy  label  scheme  for  home  appliances,  such   as

refrigerators and airconditioners, to promote the use of more

energy efficient home appliances.  The scheme will extend  to

other appliances, such as washing machines and TVs.  The NEEC

is  also  looking  at  other initiatives  to  improve  energy

efficiency in the industry, building and transport sectors.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Concept Plan 2001 and the Singapore Green

Plan  2012, the Concept Plan 2001 allows more land to be used

as  green  spaces and for further greening of  our  urbanised

landscape.   With this increased vegetation, the heat  island

effect  will  be  reduced.   The Singapore  Green  Plan  2012

complements the Concept Plan by encouraging building  designs

that make use of better natural ventilation, and hence reduce

the  need for air-conditioning and, therefore, more efficient

use  of  energy and less use of energy within the city.   The

Singapore   Green  Plan  2012  and  the  Concept  Plan   2001

complement   each  other  in  our  efforts  to   reduce   the

temperature within the city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also brought up a very important point, that of

green  consumerism,  that each and every  one  of  us,  as  a

consumer,  has an impact on the environment by our choice  of

lifestyle and the consumer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



products  we  use.  While some amount of official  incentives

may  be necessary to start off some green product programmes,

they  are not sustainable and cannot be a permanent solution.

ENV  has, therefore, been emphasising awareness-building  and

public  education to develop a more environmentally-conscious

population.  Changing mindsets and behaviour, however,  takes

time, and requires a comprehensive outreach programme that is

sustained over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV has embarked on an aggressive programme to build a

more  environmentally-conscious  population.   This  includes

making   environmental   education   a   life-long   process,

organising  public  campaigns such as the  annual  Clean  and

Green  Week in November, and sustaining the awareness through

commemorating  international events, such as  Earth  Day  and

World  Environment  Day.   We are  also  promoting  community

involvement   through  activities  organised  by   CDCs   and

grassroots organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these on-going programmes on education,

public campaigns and community and grassroots activities, ENV

has also launched the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS)

in  1992.   The  scheme  is  administered  by  the  Singapore

Environmental  Council (SEC).  The initial  scheme,  however,

met  with  limited success.  There were several  reasons  for

this.  One reason is that many consumers were not aware why a

product, as labelled, is considered green.  Another reason is

that not many consumers were interested in green products, as

they  were  not environmentally-conscious.  Consequently,  in

the  past, there was a low demand for green products.  Hence,

manufacturers were not keen to apply for the label.  But  ENV

and  SEC  have since worked together to improve  the  scheme.

One  way  is to provide useful information on the label  that

would assist consumers in making a choice.  For example,  the

energy  label  for  airconditioners  and  refrigerators   was

launched in April 2002.  The label provides energy-efficiency

information to consumers.  This enhancement has met with more

interest   from  the  distributors  of  airconditioners   and

refrigerators than the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>



old SGL scheme.  ENV and the SEC will be extending the energy

label  to  other  appliances, such as  washing  machines  and

dishwashers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, whether the revamped Green Labelling Scheme

will  succeed  will  depend on each  and  every  one  of  us.

Manufacturers  will respond only if there  is  a  demand  for

green  products.   If  all of us, as consumers,  can  make  a

deliberate  choice  to support green products,  manufacturers

will  take the cue.  This is a concrete way for all of us  to

demonstrate our support and do our bit for the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the issue which Mdm Ho brought up,

about home-based small food businesses.  My Ministry does not

allow  food  intended for sale to the general  public  to  be

prepared  and cooked at home for public health reasons.   The

concerns are that food prepared and cooked at home may not be

done  under strict hygiene conditions at all times, and  that

the persons handling food in the home may not meet our public

health  requirements.  All persons who handle  food  intended

for sale to the general public have to be medically screened.

They  also have to pass a course on food handling before they

can be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike licensed food establishments where their premises

are  readily  open  for inspection by our Environment  health

officers,  food  preparation and  cooking  in  a  residential

premise  are done within closed doors.  This makes inspection

and enforcement of public health requirements very difficult.

In  comparison, a licensed food shop can be inspected at  any

time  the  food  shop  is  open for  business.   No  licence,

however, is required if a person cooks for his or her  friend

or neighbours.  Such private arrangements are not prohibited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like Mdm Ho, I am sympathetic with those facing

difficulty in finding employment.  ENV will not be  intrusive

and  regulate  private  cooking arrangements  among  friends,

family  members  or  neighbours.   However,  everyday,   many

Singaporeans, foreigners and tourists eat out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>



at  public establishments with little fear of food poisoning.

This  is due to the vigilance of our public health inspectors

and  the high standards of hygiene that they ensure.  From  a

public  health  point of view, ENV does not intend  to  allow

food  prepared for sale to the general public to be  done  in

the closed environment of the home.  This is to ensure public

health safety.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me remind Members that if they make

long  rambling speeches, we will not be able to  finish  this

Head  within  the stipulated time.  That goes for  all  other

Heads too.  Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,

we  have altogether 124 hawker centres in Singapore, 32  come

under  the purview of ENV and the remainder under the control

of  HDB.   However, the administration of each hawker  centre

involves  three  authorities - the  Housing  and  Development

Board for rentals, ENV for licensing and the town council for

the  collection of maintenance fees and other  charges.   So,

even  for  a  small  hawker stall, we have to  involve  three

departments and the administrative costs become unnecessarily

high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could lead to much confusion for the hawkers. When

something  goes  wrong, they do not  know  where  to  go  for

remedy.  A stallholder told me that when the hawker inspector

came to check on his stall, he found that there was something

wrong with the water pipes. The inspector told him that  this

matter  was  under the HDB, and he was referred to  the  HDB.

When  he  went  to  the HDB, he was told  that   this  was  a

maintenance  and repair matter and it should come  under  the

charge of the town council. He went to the town council  only

to  be told that the piping problem was within the stall, and

that  it  was the stallholder's own responsibility to rectify

it.   I  had to step in to get the town council to look  into

it. The problem was resolved within four hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this kind of problem would not have happened

if  the  hawker centres come under one centralised  Ministry,

ie, ENV.  ENV should be the main coordinator,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>



and  handle all matters relating to the hawker centres,  such

as  issuing of licence, collection of licence fees,  rentals,

maintenance charges and looking after other related problems.

In  this way, we can have a one-stop service centre under the

Ministry of the Environment to administer all hawker centres.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, on upgrading of hawker

centres.   The  hawker  centre is  one  of  the  places  that

provides affordable food for Singaporeans, in particular  for

the  low-income people.  Watching the trend of prices charged

by  hawkers, prices are rising.  This is partly  due  to  the

relatively  high  prices charged by the stallholders  in  HDB

eating houses, and partly due to the increase in rentals  due

to tendered hawker stalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading, no doubt, will improve the ambience and

comfort  level of hawker centres.  With millions  of  dollars

spent, it is also natural to expect the Government to recover

part  of the costs through an increase in rental.  The amount

of   rental  increase  depends  very  much  on  the  cost  of

upgrading.  I have seen some of the upgraded hawker centres - expensive wall tiles with graphic pattern designs being used.

I have also seen some of the conceptual designs.  I have seen

fanciful  roofs and 3-dimensional roof structures  have  been

adopted.  All these will lead to an increase in the  cost  of

construction,  and  may  also lead to difficulty  maintaining

these   high  3-D  structures.   Ultimately,  these   factors

contribute to an increase in rentals and maintenance costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what action has been

taken  at  the  design stage to keep the cost of construction

and   upgrading  of  hawker  centres  and  their   subsequent

maintenance  costs low.  Does the Ministry plan  to  increase

rentals  after the upgrading and, if so, what plans does  the

Ministry have to keep food prices as low as possible  in  the

upgraded hawker centres?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Amy Khor is not here. Mr Ang Mong

Seng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, during my overseas

trips, I had occasions to visit their public toilets. I found

that  the  public toilets in Korea and Japan were very  clean

and the standard of hygiene there was exemplary.  I would say

they  are the best in the world. However, in China, it is  an

entirely different story. I was told that the ladies  had  to

carry  an umbrella whenever they went to the toilet,  because

there  were no doors at the toilets.  However, in preparation

for  the  Olympic Games 2008, they are sprucing  up  all  the

amenities, public toilets included.  I suppose by 2008, their

public  toilets will be as exemplary as those  in  Korea  and

Japan now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, much has to be done to our public toilets

too.  Years  back,  when I was in charge of  the  Island-wide

Cleanest  Estates Contest, I found that some  public  toilets

were quite clean, but overall the standard of cleanliness and

hygiene  left much to be desired. If we aspire  to  become  a

gracious society, we should improve the overall image of  our

public toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what is the progress in the

upgrading of our public toilets.  As for the toilets  in  the

coffeeshops,  some  may say that it is the responsibility  of

the  coffeeshop owners to keep their toilets clean.  However,

the fact is that the use of these toilets is not confined  to

the  customers and staff of the coffeeshops. Members  of  the

public  also  make use of these toilets, as  coffeeshops  are

public  areas  and are accessible to members of  the  public.

They are de facto, public toilets, and should be included  in

the upgrading programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that we have a Public Toilet Cleanliness

Contest,  so  as  to encourage the managers of  these  public

toilets  to  keep  the toilets under their charge  clean  and

hygienic,  and  to  contribute to  our  strive  to  become  a

gracious society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay touched on

the  issue of upgrading of hawker centres.  I want to  assure

Prof.  Low  that  we are fully aware that  upgrading  of  our

hawker  centres is a very expensive exercise.  It  will  cost

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>



about  $420  million  over 10 years.  In  batch  one  of  the

programme, the total cost came up to about $120 million.  For

the  second  batch,  the budget is in the region  of  $50-$70

million.  Therefore, we are equally mindful, as Prof. Low is,

on  the  need  to keep the cost of upgrading  to  as  low  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure Prof. Low and this House that the

ENV  places  emphasis of design basically  on  a  few  areas.

Firstly,  it is to improve ventilation; secondly, to  improve

the  layout  for  better  circulation;  and,  thirdly,  where

possible, to put in some handicap-friendly features.  At  the

same  time,  we  try  to  make the  seating  arrangements  as

innovative as possible, so that groups of different sizes can

sit together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we have been able to contain the costs of

upgrading.  So far, based on all the tender returns  that  we

are  getting,  I  would say that we are able to  derive  some

savings from our budgetted sum.  Notwithstanding what I  have

said,  I  can  assure Prof. Low that we will continue  to  be

mindful of the need to contain the costs of upgrading.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also made the point that upgrading may lead to

higher  rentals, and that higher rentals may lead  to  higher

cost  of hawker food.  I want to clarify that this is  indeed

not  the case.  Yes, we spend a lot of money on upgrading the

centres, but it is not our intention to recover the costs  of

upgrading through rental adjustments.  Just a few weeks  ago,

I  was  at  the  Adam Road Hawker Centre.  It costs  us  $1.7

million  to upgrade the centre.  But at the end of  the  day,

the rental adjustment for the stallholders there was only  $1

per  day.   In other words, if we were to try to recover  the

cost  of upgrading through rental adjustment, I work out that

we will need something like more than 100 years before we can

recover  the  cost of upgrading.  This is not our  intention.

The whole purpose of upgrading is to ensure that Singaporeans

will  continue to have a place where they can have good  food

at affordable prices in a conducive setting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low asked whether there is anything we are going

to do to ensure that prices at the hawker centres will not go

up.   Sir,  this  is an open market.  What I can  assure  the

House  is  that, under the ENV and HDB hawker centres,  there

are  altogether  20,000 hawker stalls.  In  other  words,  we

should  let market forces work to the fullest.  If  there  is

any  stall that charges higher prices, I would encourage  the

consumers  to  stay away from such stalls.  On the  whole,  I

would  say that the upgrading programme has progressed  quite

smoothly.   By the year 2004-2005, we aim to upgrade  one  in

three of the hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether ENV would consider taking

over  the function of HDB in managing all the hawker  centres

in  Singapore.   HDB  and ENV do work very closely  together.

But  I do see the point brought up by Mr Ang Mong Seng.  What

I  intend  to  do  is  to discuss with my  colleague  at  the

Ministry  of National Development to see whether we can  work

together,  as  suggested by Mr Ang,  to  provide  a  one-stop

service to the hawker centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on to the cut on public toilets. Mr Ang asked

what  is  the  progress on the upgrading of  public  toilets.

Today,  the  National  Parks, SMRT, bus interchanges,  hawker

centres  and HDB together manage about 1,100 public  toilets.

Out  of these 1,100 public toilets, 800 of them are found  in

the  coffeeshops.  Over the years, these agencies I mentioned

earlier  have implemented a systematic programme  to  upgrade

these public toilets.  For example, for ENV and HDB, we  have

upgraded  52 public toilets at hawker centres at  a  cost  of

$5.5  million.  Over time, all the public toilets in all  the

hawker  centres  will  be upgraded under  the  Hawker  Centre

Upgrading  Programme.  Likewise, for the National  Parks  and

SMRT,  they  also  have a formal programme to  upgrade  their

public toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one area where we do not have a formal

programme.   These are the public toilets at the coffeeshops.

As   I  mentioned,  there  are  about  800  of  them.   These

coffeeshops, as pointed out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>



by  Mr  Ang, are used not just by the customers, but also  by

the  members of the public.  I therefore fully agree with him

that  it is useful for the Government to see how we can speed

up  the upgrading of these public toilets at the coffeeshops.

I  am  happy  to  say that we have decided to  launch  a  new

upgrading scheme known as the Toilet Upgrading Scheme  (TUP).

Under  TUP,  the Government will co-pay 50% of  the  cost  of

upgrading  of  these coffeeshop toilets up to  a  maximum  of

$5,000 for each toilet.  This would be made available to  all

the  800  toilets in the coffeeshops, both rental as well  as

those   that  have  been  purchased.   This  will  cost   the

Government a total budget of $4 million.  We think  it  is  a

worthwhile investment.  This scheme will start in September.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by saying that it is insufficient to

just  upgrade the toilets, because at the end of the day,  it

is  very important that we take good care of these toilets as

well.  We intend to mount a 3P partnership programme.  We are

going  to work with the Restaurants Association of Singapore,

the  Coffeeshop Association, the Singapore Tourism Board, the

National Parks Board, grassroots organisations and so on,  to

heighten  public  awareness  on the  need  for  clean  public

toilets.   At  the  same time, we are going  to  improve  the

standard and quality of public toilet cleaning.  We  are  now

working  with the Centre for Cleaning Technology, as well  as

SPRING Singapore.  We are going to train all the cleaners  of

public  toilets to make sure that they will have  the  proper

technique and equipment when they clean these public toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Mr Ang suggested that we should have

an  island-wide competition on the "Cleanest Public  Toilet".

Again,  I think it is a very good idea.  Since Mr Ang is  the

man behind the island-wide "Cleanest HDB Estate Competition",

I   encourage  him  to  organise  this  competition  for  the

"Cleanest  Public Toilet".  I assure him that ENV  will  give

him our fullest support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by referring to what Mr Ang said about

China.  I was in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>



China briefly in December on a holiday in Beijing.  I asked a

taxi-driver,  "Why is your public toilet so clean  now?"   He

mentioned  the  same  reason - they are gearing  up  for  the

Olympic  2008.  He said, "Look, our leaders told  us  that  a

country  with  dirty  toilets has no future."   Sir,  in  the

context  of Singapore, I would say that a country with  dirty

toilets  has  no pride.  I hope all Singaporeans  would  take

pride  in having clean public toilets in Singapore.  Our  aim

is  to  turn these dirty public toilets a thing of the  past.

Therefore, your aim will help!

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I am often

reminded that as an MP and Mayor, one must keep close to  the

ground.  I agree.  But that is not the only reason why I have

this cut on cemeteries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a serious matter of life and death. It is

laden  with  emotions  and  thus  needs  sensitive  handling.

Nevertheless, to moderate emotions with realities,  allow  me

to quote what Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said sometime back

when asked about the reuse of the Kampong Java cemetery land.

SM  Lee said, "We have done enough for the dead.  Let's worry

for  the  living".  Today, we have the KK Women and  Children

Hospital  on  the  same  site,  delivering  more  lives   and

healthcare for the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to explain ENV's

thinking,  programmes  and  efforts  at  assuring  sufficient

burial grounds, what plans ENV has to meet that need in land-scarce  Singapore.  I gather that ENV and MUIS officers  have

made  study trips to a few countries outside Singapore.  What

are   the  findings?   Will  there  be  any  new  innovations

introduced  to make burial better, cleaner and more  suitable

for  Singapore's need to recycle burial grounds?   I  do  not

know whether the Minister wants to call it Cemetery Upgrading

Programme (CUP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I hope the Environment Minister would also

take  a  look at the present cemetery ground in Pusara  Aman,

maybe on a rainy day, to see how messy it can be and see what

can be done to give it a decent look there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, right now, ENV is undertaking a major cemetery

exhumation exercise at Bidadari.  I believe that the contract

was  offered  on  a  tender basis.  Has  the  Ministry  taken

sufficient measures to ensure that the sensitivities involved

are  factored?  What are they?  I would like to urge  ENV  to

take  all  measures  and steps necessary to  make  sure  that

sensitivities  are  taken  care  of  during  the   exhumation

exercise.   I  also learn that the contract for providing  of

columbariums  is  also  done  on  a  tender  basis.   Is  ENV

confident  that  such a method would not lead  to  escalating

prices  so much so people might then say, "even to  die,  not

cheap".

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, it was reported in

the press that the latest attempt of ENV to solve the problem

of  dengue  fever is to breed one new breed of mosquitoes  to

kill or neutralise the dangerous breed that will cause dengue

fever.  My concern is: how confident is ENV in ensuring  that

this  initiative  is 100% error-free?  Is the  Minister  sure

that  the bio-science laboratory responsible for the  project

will not mistakenly unleash another type of mosquito that  is

more deadly than what we already have here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the new breed of

mosquito   bites  and  sucks  blood  like  other   types   of

mosquitoes.   If  so,  when the new breed  of  mosquitoes  is

released  and  residents  complain of  mosquito  bites,  what

should  we  tell  them? Are we to tell  them  that  they  are

healthy and friendly love bites, so never mind?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite my concern, it is a quite a bold idea. If

the  initiative is proven successful and safe here,  perhaps,

we  can export the new breed of mosquitoes to make some money

and maybe develop ourselves into a regional mosquito hub.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I hate to be a pest. My

cut  is still on mosquitoes.  I would like to compliment  the

Ministry  of  the Environment for being very  proactive.   In

fact,  even  before  I raise the cut, my  question  has  been

answered.   You can see from the Straits Times,  they  did  a

very  good  job,  about the $100 million  war  on  infectious

diseases and bio-terrorism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



More  than that, they even have a very good expose about what

has been done to battle this problem about the mosquitoes and

other pests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to just briefly talk about more bites with

a  hotter weather.  I think that is still a problem  with  El

Nino  and we can expect a lot more mosquitoes. In fact,  some

residents are exasperated with this problem to the point that

each  time  when I go on house visits, I always get  feedback

that  the  children have been bitten by mosquitoes. In  fact,

one  resident  has  even sent me a collection  of  about  200

mosquitoes.  It looks like a piece of artwork.  But  this  is

just  to  show  how desperate they were.  I have  given  this

feedback  to  my  colleague,  Mayor  Othman,  and   the   ENV

apparently has acted on it. They do act fast.  But  what  can

ENV  do  to help alleviate this problem, especially when  the

weather gets hotter and the El Nino strikes?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Zainul and Mr Low

for  their  questions.   I will begin first  with  the  issue

dealing with the dead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land-scarce Singapore, both the living and the

dead compete for available scarce land.  We estimate that the

cemetery  at Chua Chu Kang can last up to 2064.  However,  as

this is the only cemetery that we have, we are concerned that

we  need to find ways to extend the lifespan of the cemetery.

I  am  pleased to say that we have found a solution, that  we

call the Modular Burial System (MBS).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MBS is a system where pre-fabricated rectangular

concrete  crypts  are  constructed,  forming  a  grid.   Each

rectangular  crypt is fitted with a concrete  lid.  When  the

time  comes  for burial, the lid for the crypt is  lifted  to

reveal  the empty chamber below.  The coffin or body is  then

lowered  into the crypt and the crypt is filled  with  earth.

After that, the lid is put back in place before it is covered

with a final layer of earth and turf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have consulted MUIS and a few other religious

organisations and they have found the MBS to be an acceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>



system.   The  MBS makes better use of the land  for  burial.

With  the  MBS,  the cemetery land can last up  to  2130,  an

extension  of  more than 60 years.  We agree with  Mr  Zainul

that  exhumation must be done properly. We will consult  MUIS

and other religious and ethnic groups to ensure that cultural

and  religious sensitivities are taken into consideration  in

carrying  out  exhumation.  Exhumation would be  carried  out

individually, with dignity and respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, for the exhumation of Muslim graves, the

agency  requiring  the  exhumation, for  example,  HDB,  will

appoint MUIS to take charge of the exhumation.  ENV will also

do  the  same  when  exhumation at  Chua  Chu  Kang  cemetery

commences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the problem of mosquitoes, because we are

situated in the tropics where the weather is warm and  humid,

we  will always have mosquitoes around us. We cannot get  rid

of  them, but we can keep their population size down so  that

the  impact,  both  as a nuisance and as a  vector,  will  be

minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with mosquitoes, we must realise that we are

dealing  with  an ecological situation out  there.   When  we

reduce the population of one type of mosquito, it is possible

that another species of mosquito, which previously would  not

be  able to thrive, would now increase in numbers.  There are

two  species  of mosquitoes that bother us in Singapore,  the

Aedes  and the Culex mosquitoes.  The Aedes breeds  in  clean

water  inside and outside homes, for example, in vases,  roof

gutters,  pots,  plates and litter thrown into  bushes.   The

Culex breeds in dirtier waters, like choked drains.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to keep mosquito population down is to make

sure  they have little opportunity to breed.  Using chemicals

to  kill  the  mosquitoes will not help  if  the  sources  of

breeding remain present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV's Vector Control Team, together with pest control

companies  engaged by ENV, carries out daily surveillance  in

areas  where the vector population is known to be  high.   We

have  good ground surveillance system that is linked  to  our

geographical information system (GIS), which will tell us, on

a  real-time basis, where the build-up of vectors are  taking

place.  However, ENV will need the help of everyone, from the

residents, especially those who live in landed properties, to

management  agents, including Town Councils and,  contractors

doing  construction work, to prevent mosquitoes from breeding

within their premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the concern about new types of

mosquitoes, our scientists are doing research on the  various

types  of mosquitoes and their genetic labelling so  that  we

can  better  understand how the mosquitoes  spread  from  one

region  to another, and what factors allow one population  to

increase,  while another decreases.  I can assure Members  of

Parliament that we have no intention of creating new  species

of  mosquitoes  in  our laboratories that  we  are  going  to

release into the environment.  That is something that we  are

not doing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Zainul. We are running out of

time, Mr Zainul.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Chairman, if Mr Ang Mong

Seng  is not going to crow on the other cut, I would like  to

inform the Minister that he did not answer my question  about

the tender system.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> In general, Sir, the tender system

is  the best and most efficient way of deciding how a project

is   to   be  done.   If  the  contractor  meets  the  tender

specifications, then we would have no problem  with  it.   If

there  is any specific problem with the contractor, Mr Zainul

can bring it up with our Ministry, and we will look into it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Minister and

only  going  to  ask  five  very  simple  questions,  $2  per

question.   First, does the Minister know how many  crows  we

have  in  Singapore?  Second, the Ministry of the Environment

has  engaged professional shooters to cull crows.   How  many

have  they  culled so far?  Third, many residents  complained

that  some  elderly people were attacked by  the  crows.   Is

there  any  plan to prevent that from happening?  Fourth,  is

there  any plan to stop the propagation of crows?  And fifth,

I  was  told  that  some  crows flew  from  Johore  Bahru  to

Singapore  in  the day and then fly back to Johore  Bahru  at

night.  Is there any plan to stop them from flying in?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I shall be brief. First, the

crow population in Singapore today is about 120,000.  Second,

we  have a culling rate of about 60,000 crows a year.  In the

last three months we have culled the same number of crows  as

the  whole  of  last  year, and so our culling  programme  is

extremely  successful.   We  hope  to  bring  down  the  crow

population eventually to about 10,000 in Singapore.  Crows do

not normally attack people.  They may do so only if provoked,

or  they perceive a threat to their nestlings.  So we do  not

think that crow attacks are really a big problem.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, investing in cultural capital is MITA's new vision.

Arts  is  now  viewed  as investment capital  as  opposed  to

consumption.  In short, arts is not just for arts  sake,  but

also  for  business  sake.  Any concept  which  promises  job

creation and economic growth is, of course, welcome in  these

difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must congratulate MITA for its creativity in extending

and  repackaging  the Renaissance City  Report  by  adding  a

business  element,  so  that  expenditure  in  the  arts   is

increasingly seen as an investment, something that will  reap

economic  rewards.  However, I must say that a close scrutiny

will  show that both the cultural capital and the Renaissance

proposal bear similarities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tenets of the cultural capital are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Creative cluster;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Creative people and workforce; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A connected nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that a creative cluster engaged in traditional

and  the  fine arts can become a potential growth engine  for

our  economy  has  already been recognisd in the  Renaissance

City   Report.    "Creative   people   and   workforce"   was

"Renaissance  Singaporeans",  and  "Connected   nation"   was

"Renaissance Nation and Society".  What is new is perhaps the

new emphasis on the sector of applied arts, ie, design, media

and advertising.  When fused with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>



artistic  innovation, it is hoped that we can come  out  with

new products and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to devise such a thorough and far-reaching proposal

must  have required a fair bit of time and energy.  I am sure

the ideas behind them are sound, but why two reports when one

will do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, we can allocate resources to push

through  the  reforms envisioned under the  Renaissance  City

Report  rather than putting our entire arts community through

another  round of brainstorming and vision seeking.  On  this

note, I would like to add a few ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Green Paper should argue for the increase of

funding for arts.  I know that in these difficult times it is

hard  to  argue  for more money to spend on  arts,  something

which  many  see as a luxury.  However, as the  Ministry  has

already   acknowledged  that  spending  is  now  a  form   of

investment  in the economy, we have no reason  not  to  spend

more to stimulate growth through arts spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, in order to introduce arts at all levels,

we  have  to start at our education system, to build an  arts

loving society.  I am happy to note that we will have an arts

school  soon.  Let us dare to dream of an arts university  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds for the Arts Education Programme (AEP) have now

increased to reach 50% of the student population.  But,  from

what  I  know,  AEP,  in  most  schools,  amounts  to  merely

sponsoring tickets for students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, parents also have to change their mindset.

Parents  want their children to be a doctor over a violinist,

a  lawyer  over  a  writer, a teacher  over  an  actor.   Our

children are told that this is a pragmatic world, one  cannot

live  on  the arts, keep it only as a hobby - as the  Chinese

say, er bu si, chi bu bao.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arts education must have a bigger role to play in

the  life  of  our young, otherwise we can forget  about  the

creative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



cluster  of a cultural capital vision.  It will never  create

5% of our GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there must be a sizable arts industry in

order  to  provide sufficient job opportunities.  Some,  like

the  film  industry, involve high overhead  costs.   This  is

where  funding comes in.  Hence, we come a full  circle.   If

arts  is  to be seen as an investment, we must have not  more

visions and reports but a sound and solid business plan.   We

need to have a clear direction of where we are heading, where

are  the returns we expect on our investments, and how we can

exhibit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that everything must reduce itself

to  dollars  and  cents.  Instead, what I  want  to  see  are

implementation plans, and the enhancements to what is already

a very good blueprint.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I support MITA's vision to develop

Singapore  into  a creative and connected  place.   Arts  and

culture  can  definitely  play  a  significant  role  in  the

economic and social development of Singapore.  We must aim to

develop Singapore into a culture hub.  It should also, at the

same  time, attract more tourists to Singapore.  Cities  like

Paris  and  Edinburgh are good examples of places which  have

developed  the  arts and cultural capital to  boost  economic

activities and community bonding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the plans to develop cultural capital in

Singapore; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the key performance indicators to measure

cultural capital?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I was a little

disappointed to note that the budget allocation to MITA stood

still  at  1.5%  for Financial Year 2002.  It is  a  moderate

increase  of  $20.94 million to $425.53 million, in  absolute

terms, but nevertheless, I was hoping to see more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many may ask, in such time when many face unemployment

and economic hardship, is there room for arts and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



culture?  The answer is a resounding "Yes."  Perhaps, more so

now,  because it is in critical times like this that we  need

to  delve  deeper into ourselves and bring out the  intrinsic

value  of  our rich cultural capital from within,  so  as  to

achieve  a breakthrough.  Let me illustrate my point with  an

example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how much is a watch worth? It can be $10, $100 or

tens  of thousands, depending on who created it, which artist

has  his hands on it, and which musician puts a tune  in  it.

In the 1980s, when the famous Swiss watch-making industry was

facing  laggard  sales  and serious threats  from  high-tech,

lower-cost Japanese products, a man called Mr Nicholas G Hyak

took an ordinary mass-produced watch and got a few artists to

exhibit their works on it.  He said, "We have to give  Swatch

a  warm  heart  and soul so that people would love  it."   As

such,  within a short span of five years, Swatch,  a  plastic

watch company, became the largest watch making company in the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalising on cultural diversity of a nation brings a

breath  of fresh air into the watch economy, and put a  piece

of Switzerland onto many people's wrist.  In fact, it has got

a back-end added value of promoting tourism in Switzerland as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can do the same too. In fact, Singapore has a

very  rich  cultural  capital.  With the diversity  of  race,

language, religion and a highly cosmopolitan city, we are  in

a  good position to tap on our cultural capital to give us an

edge in the competitive world.  A few examples are the Banyan

Tree,  and  Creative Technology who has recently created  the

ProdiKey.  These are all very good examples of combining arts

with  music  and  culture into traditional and  technological

platforms.  As such, my questions are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are some of the programmes that we have put in

place  to  tap  on our cultural capital so as to  bring  this

diversity into our technology, and into our products?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is this funding sufficient as proportionate to the

value that it can bring to our economy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is this funding sufficient as proportionate to the

role   that   it   plays  in  making  Singapore   a   vibrant

cosmopolitan, as well as it being a social glue?  If I  could

coin the 5Cs in cultural capital, the 5Cs would stand for:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Creativity - which is the power to invent and

innovate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Connectivity - which is the power to connect people

on a heart and soul level;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Capability - which is helping all our artists, our

other talents to come in and contribute to our economy;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Competitiveness - because it makes an ordinary

product  extraordinary, it makes it unique and gives  us  the

competitive edge; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Community - because it brings together groups of

people with different talents to communicate with each  other

to create new things from this collaboration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would also ask, as some of my

colleagues  have asked, what are some of the yardsticks  that

would  be  used  to  measure the success of germinating  this

cultural   capital,  both  from  the  economic   and   social

perspectives.    I would like to add that we should  bear  in

mind  that arts and culture, or the germination of a cultural

capital itself takes time to come to fruition.  And, as such,

the   measurement  used  to  determine  the  ROI  from   such

investments should be different from that of mere  statistics

alone.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as we grow

and mature as a nation, we have to look at our development in

a  wider perspective than just in the economic sense.   There

is an increasing need for us to grow and develop our cultural

capital.   The  strategy  to grow  our  cultural  capital  is

laudable and long overdue.  We must understand that many used

to  consider the arts and culture as a luxury.  This view  is

passe,  and  there is a need for a major mindset change.   We

must take the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>



opportunity in our process of remaking Singapore to make this

shift.  We must view the arts and culture as an integral part

of our development and growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cultural heritage is rich and multi-faceted. We

should  harness this vast potential and exploit  it  to   our

advantage.  The investment and resources that we allocate  to

the  arts and culture should not be seen as wastage.  We have

to look at the long-term rewards, and the intangible returns,

ie,  a more culturally rich and vibrant Singapore.   We need,

over  the long term, to portray Singapore not only as a place

of  economic  excellence but also as a  centre  for  artistic

excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate what was said by Dr Ng Eng Hen

yesterday, the congregation of brains and minds would attract

investments.  I would further add that congregation of brains

and  minds in a vibrant and artistically and culturally  rich

environment will be ever sweeter for investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in view of the growing importance of this

aspect  of  our country's development, I would encourage  the

Minister  for  Finance to allocate more  resources  to  MITA.

Over  time, we should accord more funds to the Ministry  than

the 0.3% of GDP as it is today.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, we are now in the

process  of  remaking Singapore.  I would therefore  like  to

join  my  fellow colleagues to ask the Minister if  he  would

share  his  vision  on the role of arts and  culture  in  the

strategy  to  remake  Singapore.   In  particular,   we   are

searching for competitive advantages for a changed world, and

here  we  must  exploit  all our  strengths.   Our  arts  and

cultural  heritage does not need to be "nice to  have".   Art

and  cultural  centres of the world have exploited  arts  and

culture as a source of growth.  For example, London and Paris

have used arts and culture to lure both tourists and talents.

We  can do the same.  I would therefore like the Minister, in

his  reply,  to address, if possible, the role  of  arts  and

culture as a strategic tool for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>



our economic development and competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the other day,

Prime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong spoke about  attempts  by  the

Government to try and uplift the morale of Singaporeans.   So

far, in Parliament, the only thing that we hear are about the

downturn  of  the economy, the doom and the  gloom.   Really,

arts  and culture should be for all seasons.  When times  are

good, there are reasons for us to celebrate.  When times  are

not  so good, arts and culture can indeed uplift the mood  of

Singaporeans.  Therefore, I would suggest that  the  Ministry

take  a  contrarian  view as far as the budget  provision  is

concerned.  If we think that the economy is not likely to  be

good, in fact, we should give more money to the Ministry,  so

that  there would be the enhanced outreach programmes to  the

people.   In  fact,  in  the budget provision,  the  outreach

programmes  have plateaued.  I do not see efforts being  made

to enhance these outreach programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remain ambitious to achieve the middle class society.

I think, as we attempt to more forward in our economic ladder

and   with  a  better  educated  population,  two-thirds   of

Singaporeans   are   receiving   tertiary   education.    The

intangibles  become important.  Singaporeans  are  no  longer

materialistic.  They are very interested in the things of the

spirit  and  the  soul,  and arts  and  culture  become  very

important.   Singaporeans  are  well  travelled.   They   are

exposed  to  top  displays  and performances.   We  are  also

talking about attracting top talent to Singapore.  So  it  is

very,  very  important for a society like ours that  we  have

this  wholesome  living, this quality of  life  that  we  are

looking at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts

is  really a very young Ministry.  It is only about 10  years

old.   It is a very long journey.  I think we have made  very

good  progress, and we should encourage the Ministry to press

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to ask the Minister about the balance

of  the  three  sectors, of Government,  private  and  people

sectors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>



I  believe  too  much  is imposed on the  private  sector  to

provide  the  funds.   I think the Government  can  do  more,

because  we  have not developed the patronage system as  yet.

So  it  is  not easy to get the private sector  or  even  the

people  sector  to cough up the money.  Maybe the  Government

should put as much seed money as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is the question of job creation

opportunities.  In times where jobs are difficult to come by,

this is an area where jobs could be created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have a query about Capitol Cinema. It

is  in  my constituency.  When Capitol Cinema was closed,  it

was intended to become a theatre.  It has been mothballed for

a long while.  One of the problems with eviction is that when

the  place becomes empty, the whole place gets hollowed  out.

And  that  is  always  the problem  when  there  is  lack  of

synchronisation  between the party that  acquires  Government

buildings and filling up the place.  I am waiting to see when

Capitol Cinema will come back to life again.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, arts and heritage play an important

role in helping to build a cohesive and gracious society.  It

strengthens the sense of belonging of our people and enhances

their  quality  of life.  As a young country, Singapore  must

chart clear directions to promote arts and heritage.  Sir,  I

would  like to urge the Government to provide more  resources

for  MITA  to work closely with community-based organisations

to organise more arts and heritage programmes for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also like to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the masterplan for the arts and heritage

programme in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the strategy to promote arts and heritage to our

people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How much resources are allocated for arts and heritage

programmes?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I was delighted to hear during one

of the briefings for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>



the   GPC  for  MITA,  that  they  have  an  Arts  Everywhere

programme.   I  was  delighted because  the  Arts  Everywhere

programme  means that it will enable everyone  to  appreciate

and  to  partake in the process of enjoying the arts  itself.

However,  I  would like to also ask whether it is  just  arts

everywhere, or is it arts everywhere, arts everyone and  arts

every time as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to inculcate a nation that breathes and lives art,

the  art  and  heritage initiatives have  to  permeate  every

strata  of  the society, making its presence felt everywhere,

lives  in  everyone and present every time.  To  quote  Prime

Minister  Goh in his National Day Rally speech last year,  he

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In new Singapore, there will be abundant opportunities

for  Singaporeans and global talent to work and do well.  New

Singapore  will  be  one of the world's finest  most  livable

cities.   Arts,  theatres,  museum,  music  and  sports  will

flourish.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote him again:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our city will not only have that, but also the richness

of  diversity.  But above all, Singapore will be a  home  for

Singaporeans.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to ask MITA if they would consider

extending their Arts Everywhere programme on a faster  scale,

as well as beyond a few centralised locations, beyond that of

arts that is appreciated only by the elite, and expand beyond

just  a few major events like the Arts Festival or the Womad.

What  initiatives are there to bring arts and culture to  the

heartlands,  and  what funds are available for  community-in-partnership   programmes?   I  hope   there  will   be   more

initiatives  and  at  a quick pace that  could  be  generated

within the next year.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I was very much

encouraged to read in the newspapers the other day that  MITA

is  pursuing the concept of cultural capital, ie, the synergy

between arts and enterprise.  I really do think that this  is

long  overdue,  because  for too long,  the  arts  have  been

regarded  as the poor cousin to sciences in Singapore.   When

we  were a developing country,  we could understand the  need

to push science and technology.  But I think that concept, in

the present changing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



global  economy, is a little outdated, because the arts  does

have  a  tremendous economic value.  In this regard, I really

think that the budget for MITA should be increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see arts not just as something for arts sake. I am a

firm  believer in arts for arts sake, but the problem is that

I do not think that artists can live off talent and fresh air

alone.   They obviously need funding.  They obviously need  a

demand for the arts and the creative sciences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if the Ministry could comment on whether

it  sees  Singapore  as  a potential design  centre  for  the

region,  because  there  is  a  big  demand  for  design   in

furniture,  handphones,  computers.   The  Scandinavians  are

especially good at this, but we do not have a reputation  for

this   in  Southeast  Asia.   So,  I  was  wondering  whether

Singapore could be developed as a design centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is in fashion. Fashion, obviously, is

often  regarded as frivolous  -  girls' stuff. But the  thing

is  that it is actually a multi-billion dollar industry.  And

I  do  not  think that, in Singapore, we have actually  fully

tapped into this.  New York, London, Paris, Milan are fashion

capitals  of  the  world, but not a lot of the  manufacturing

goes  on  there.  Their value is actually as a design  centre

for fashion and, of course, they outsource the manufacturing.

I  was  wondering  whether it would be  possible  to  develop

Singapore  as  a fashion centre of the East, something  which

Thailand is aiming to do, but perhaps we can pip them to  it.

And whether, possibly, we could have something like a weekend

fashion  street  to allow young designers  to  display  their

designs  and sell them.  The reason why I say this is because

we  should  not put them in shopping centres where the  rents

are  high.   Let  them go to somewhere where  the  rents  are

relatively  low.  They can sell their designs  and  the  acid

test of whether their design is good or not is whether people

will  actually buy it.  And this is something where  tourists

can go as well, because the demand is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>



always for branded goods, but sometimes for street fashion  - things which are considered as edgy and funky.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Ministry what are the

plans  to  develop Singapore as a cultural hub, certainly  in

terms  of  concerts  and performances.  Again,  this  has  an

economic  reason behind it.  If we want to attract  MNCs  and

expatriates to Singapore, one of the reasons why  they  might

choose  Singapore over another country is when they  look  at

lifestyle.   If  they had to make a choice between  Singapore

and  Hong Kong, if all else remains equal, if we are able  to

offer  a  better  lifestyle in terms of  arts,  performances,

concerts,  we  might  have an edge.  Sir,  I  would  be  very

grateful if the Minister could answer that.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, may I first thank Mr

Seng Han Thong and all the other Members who have just spoken

for  their enthusiastic support for the arts, especially  for

the  call  for  more money.  Perhaps they could  repeat  that

another day when the Minister for Finance is in the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have pointed out that the arts has economic

value.   Indeed,  our economy has changed,  and  we  are  now

restructuring the economy and, likewise, the  arts  is  at  a

turning point.  What I would like to do, before I answer  the

specific suggestions that have been raised, is to sketch  out

MITA's new vision for the arts.  To get the most value out of

the  arts, we need to have a new way of looking at the  arts.

But  this is a difficult task to do, because many of us  look

at  the arts as something of an indulgence, something that is

for the well-heeled, the rich and those who have the time  to

spend.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help me illustrate this point, I brought along a

piece  of  unusual  art.  If I may, I will  hold  it  up  for

Members  to  see.  At first glance, this is a  very  ordinary

picture.   It  is a picture of rows of flower  baskets.   But

this   is   no  ordinary  picture.   This  is  a  stereogram.

Stereograms were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



all the rage several years ago, all over the world.  You see,

Sir, within this picture, there is a hidden picture, and this

is  a picture that you can only see if you have the technique

to  look at it.  It is a special technique.  But if you  know

how,  you  will see that within this picture,  right  in  the

middle of it, is one big heart of flowers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem is most of us are very frustrated when

we  look  at  this and do not see the heart.  The problem  is

that  we have been taught our whole lives, when we look at  a

picture,  to focus on the picture.  But we can only see  this

heart  if we do not focus on this picture, but that we  focus

in  front  of it.  I can cross my eyes like that [indicating]

or focus my ends behind it.  Like, if I held it up, I look at

you while looking at the picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a fusion of arts and technology. But I

bring up this illustration because unless we take a different

way  of  looking at the arts, unless we move  away  from  our

notion  that  the arts is only for the well-to-do  or  is  an

indulgence, then we would not begin to see the potential that

the arts has for the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me share MITA's vision. Today, the arts plays

three roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the arts keeps alive our traditions and

culture.  Whether it is gamelan music, or Teochew opera,  the

arts  connects us with our heritage, one of the "Cs" that  Ms

Penny  Low brought up.  We may not understand the opera,  but

watching  it  somehow  gives  us  a  sense  of  identity  and

belonging.   Or as Ms Penny Low also said, the arts  provides

the "social glue" that keeps us together, and I think most of

us accept this view of the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the arts is also important for the sheer

enjoyment  and  wonder  that  it  brings.   It  arouses   our

emotions,  and  stimulates our minds, and it  makes  us  feel

alive.   The arts reminds us that there are some things  that

money cannot buy.  It lifts our human spirit.  It affirms our

humanity.   I  think  most of us would also  agree  with  the

second view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, even though the arts is important in and of

itself, we can leverage on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>



power of the arts and especially the fusion of arts, business

and  technology to spur the growth of a creative economy  and

to  make  Singapore  a vibrant city.  The arts  has  economic

value,  but here, I think, is when not everybody agrees.   It

is  true  that  artists  are often  driven  solely  by  their

passion.   They may create images or play music only  because

they  want  to express their innermost thoughts and feelings.

But  whatever their motivations, their performances add  life

and  zest  to  our  community, and create  economic  benefits

perhaps in more ways than they intend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me expand on some of the ways that the arts

can and do create economic value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as Dr Teo pointed out, the arts attracts

tourists.   This  creates jobs for Singaporeans.   For  every

dollar  that a tourist spends on the arts, Singapore  Tourism

Board  estimates  that $1.80 is spent on other  things,  like

food  and  accommodation.  Can we do more?  Yes, we  can  and

will.   NAC and STB collaborate closely to make the arts  one

of  the attractions for tourists.  The NAC estimates that  up

to  5% of the people who attended the Singapore Arts Festival

last  year  were tourists.  But that is just 5%, at  most,  a

mere 8,000 people.  So there is clearly potential here to  do

more.   Our  new  performing arts centre -  the  Esplanade  - Theatres  on the Bay - which will be a world-class performing

centre, will give us a big boost in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the arts creates economic value because it

makes talented people want to live in Singapore.  And we  all

know  that  talents create jobs.  Our first  priority  is  to

develop and retain our own home-grown talent.  Offering  them

good  jobs  is  one thing.  But we also need  to  offer  them

interesting, exciting and fulfilling lifestyles.  If  through

the  arts, we can make Singapore the preferred choice of  our

own home-grown talents, then, I think we also have the chance

of attracting international talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as many of the Members have said, the arts is

also  an industry.  In developed economies, like the  US  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>



UK,   the   creative  and  copyright  industries,  that   is,

activities  such  as  advertising,  film  production,  music,

fashion  and design, account for between 5-7% of the economy,

and they are growing more rapidly than the total economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore build up our applied arts industry,

as  Mr Seng has urged.  MITA, together with our economic  and

educational partners, will launch a new design initiative  to

develop  our design capabilities.  We would include  fashion,

as  suggested by Ms Indranee, but we also want to  go  beyond

fashion to exploit the value of design across all sectors  of

the  economy.   Media  and  content creation  are  also  good

industries to promote.  We have a good chance of turning them

into a new growth area if we can leverage on our strength  in

digital  technologies such as animation and multi-media,  and

promote  more  companies to set up pre-  and  post-production

facilities in Singapore.  Perhaps, one day, we can get  Harry

Potter or Gandalf, or Yoda, to make a movie in Singapore, and

to  conjure  the  magic  here.   Or  perhaps  it  will  be  a

combination  of  Mulan  and  Lara  Croft  fighting  the   toy

soldiers.  The possibilities, of course, are endless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the arts helps to make us a more creative

economy.  The arts shapes the way we think.  It challenges us

to  think out-of-the-box, and develops new habits of  looking

at  things  from unusual perspectives.  If we practise  these

new  habits, then, over time we develop a more curious spirit

and  a  more  probing mind.  Such a change will help  promote

original  and  critical thinking in every sector  across  the

economy,  so that creativity becomes our natural response  to

challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arts and culture have always been an essential

part  of our society, enhancing the quality of our lives  and

shaping the character of our communities.  But, today,  in  a

globally  and  sharply competitive world, the arts  plays  an

important economic role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this, then, is our new vision for the arts:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it adds vim and vitality to our city, drawing

tourists, and keeping talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it drives new industries and creates new jobs, and

opens up new employment opportunities for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all, that it makes us a more creative people,

equipped and energised to drive a creative economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me move on to address a number of specific

issues Members have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See raises a pertinent point when he calls

for  the  conservation  of certain old  buildings,  like  the

Capitol  Cinema,  to  retain  our  heritage.   Such  projects

require the concerted effort of various agencies, such as the

URA,  STB and NHB, and also the private sector.  I assure  Mr

Loh  that  these  agencies  will work  actively  to  identify

suitable uses for old buildings, including the ones owned  by

the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin wanted to know whether the money spent on

the  arts  has brought the sought after benefits.   Over  the

past  two years, additional funds under the Renaissance  City

Project  (or RCP) have enabled MITA to support more  artistes

and  to bring the arts to wider audiences.  Let me cite a few

examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2000 and FY 2001, about $7.5 million and $8.3

million   were   disbursed  through   NAC's   grant   schemes

respectively.   This higher funding enabled our  artistes  to

develop new works and also to perform overseas to gain  wider

exposure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds also provide 31 individuals and 66 arts groups

with  affordable space to practise their art under the  NAC's

Arts Housing Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore hosted more than 4,500 art events - so on any one day, you've got more than 10 things you can do

- attended by about 940,000 people at ticketed events - these

are  the highest figures we have ever seen in our local  arts

scene.   Compared to 1997, the number of events has increased

about 60% while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>



audiences have grown 25%.  This is not explosive growth,  but

it  shows a steady and sustained interest in the arts.  So we

have made progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See suggested that we work more closely with

university  and  polytechnic students to tap  them,  both  as

audiences and artistes.  I agree, but the process of exposure

should  start earlier.  This is the aim of the joint MITA-MOE

Arts  Education  Programme, which  reaches  out  to  primary,

secondary, JC and ITE students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong expressed his hope that everyone will

develop  an appreciation for the arts.  I agree.  To  achieve

this, we need to change people's perception that the arts  is

only  for the rich or well-educated.  We can only do this  by

giving more people a first-hand experience of the arts.  Some

arts  groups are already doing quite a bit of this.  The  SSO

performed  in  Tampines earlier this year,  attracting  about

2,000  people.  Last month, STB's performance at  West  Coast

Park drew 3,000 people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can and will do more, and it will not plateau, as

Mr  Loh Meng See fears. MITA will launch an "Arts Everywhere"

movement to bring the arts to everyone, every time,  to  make

the arts a part of our everyday environment.  We will partner

agencies  like  HDB,  CDCs and grassroots  organisations,  to

bring  more performances to neighbourhood parks and community

halls.   We will also develop mobile exhibits that can travel

to the heartlands.  Mr Seng will be glad to hear that many of

these  performances and programmes will be free.  But if  you

want to buy a painting, you have to pay for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, nothing is really for free. Ms Penny Low

asked,   given  our  new  vision  for  the  arts,   and   the

contribution of the arts to the economy, whether we have  set

aside sufficient funds to promote and develop the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCP funds have given the arts a boost, and helped to

make Singapore a more "happening" place, indeed, a more funky

place, as Ms Indranee said.  With our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>



new vision for the arts, and with the support of hon. Members

of  this House, MITA will continue to make a case for  higher

Government  funding  and for the arts to develop  a  creative

economy, both in good times and bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we need the continuing support of

the  private sector.  The private sector has been supportive.

But MITA will continue to develop new programmes to create  a

stronger  partnership with them, to unlock the value  of  the

arts in business, and to bring about mutual benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite a few Members have asked how we can measure

the  impact of the arts on our society and economy.   We  can

measure the impact of the arts on our economy from the number

of  tourists,  or  the output of the creative  and  copyright

industries,  or the number of talented people who  will  make

Singapore their home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot measure in dollars and cents how the arts

contributes to our social bonding.  What value can  we  place

on  the  Singapore heartbeat, or the happiness that  we  feel

after  listening to an orchestra play, or the sense of  pride

that   beats  within  us  when  others  speak  well  of   our

communities and our nation?  These are priceless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new mindset towards the arts. Like seeing the

big  heart in that stereogram, this is easier said than done.

But  once you see it [indicating], once you are able  to  see

the  heart  within the picture, you always  see  it.   If  we

succeed, if we are able to have a paradigm shift in the minds

of all Singaporeans, then Singaporeans will see that the arts

contributes to the well-being of our society, as well  as  to

the  creation of new jobs, and greater competitiveness of our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the arts will no longer be something that we have

got to push people to support.  But like the air it breathes,

it  will become an essential part of us.  That is the  vision

of the arts that MITA will work towards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, MITA's vision is to

develop   Singapore  into  a  global  city  for  information,

communication  and the arts, while enhancing our  Singaporean

identity and multicultural heritage.  I read from the Straits

Times  Life!  section on 10th May that the  Ministry  has  an

interesting  approach,  that  is,  arts  plus  business  plus

technology  provide the catalyst through cultural capital  to

build a creative and connected Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key goals of the Ministry is to develop

Singapore  into  a  global media city.  I  must  commend  the

Ministry  for  making  significant  progress  in  this  area.

Today,  major media names, like BBC, Dow Jones and  satellite

broadcasters, like HBO, Walt Disney, ESPN and Discovery,  all

have  facilities  in  Singapore.  I would  like  to  ask  two

questions.  First, what is the Ministry's assessment  of  the

progress of Singapore's development as a media city?  Is  the

Ministry   monitoring  closely  the  developments  in   other

countries?   I am particularly impressed by the rapid  growth

of Dubai as a media hub in the Middle East.  It launched a hi-tech, multimillion dollar Media City in January last year, as

part  of the plan to make Dubai the region's information  and

IT capital.  Is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>



there anything that the Ministry can learn from Dubai's rapid

growth as a media hub?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the issue of censorship. Does our censorship

policy  hinder our growth as a media hub?  Let  me  cite  one

example.   We  have  been trying to develop Singapore's  film

industry.   Over the years, we have had hits like  "Money  No

Enough"  and "I Not Stupid".  We also had some other  misses.

Recently, there was a critically acclaimed film "Lan Yu" that

was  shown  at  the  Singapore International  Film  Festival.

Granted that the film may not be seen by a wide audience here

due  to  our censorship guidelines, my question is: can  such

films, however, be produced here for foreign audiences?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, the partial liberalisation of

the  media industry has resulted in some form of competition.

Some  may  argue  that,  as  a  result,  the  consumers  have

benefited.   The choices for local newspapers, TV  and  radio

have  increased.  Furthermore, with the availability of cable

TV, we are all spoilt for choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is the quality and standards of the local

media.   After all, the dust has settled.  Can we really  say

that  the  partial liberalisation has achieved its objectives

and,  in  turn, increased the standards and quality  for  the

general benefit of the public?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore aspires to be a media hub for the region.

But,  on  the  other hand, we also exercise  a  cautious  and

strict control over the media industry.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister to give his position on standards and highlight

the  regulations  that  are  in place  to  ensure  our  media

companies are not controlled by foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with the Minister that there is a vast

potential for content development and production.  This  area

needs  enhancement and boost.  I would just like to  cite  an

example.   A  few days ago, we were fortunate to welcome  the

delegates from Iran.  We asked them how they managed to  grow

their film industry and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>



the  kind  of  statistics that they cited  to  us  was  quite

impressive for a country, like Iran.  It produces  60  to  70

films  a  year and about 2,000-3,000 amateur films per  year.

They  have  also attained international recognition  and  won

several  international awards.  Just recently a country  like

Bosnia,  which is stricken by war and trouble in the country,

managed  to  win  the  international  foreign  award  at  the

Academy.  So these are the examples that we can see.   For  a

country like Singapore, we can learn from countries which are

having difficulties and yet they are able to grow their  film

industry.  So I would like to ask what are the plans of  MITA

to boost this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Mr Zainudin has asked whether

competition in print and TV media has improved the quality of

these  media.  And Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked for a progress

report  on  the development of the media industry.   When  we

introduced  competition in the print and  TV  media  in  June

2000, we hoped that this would give viewers and readers  more

media choices, higher quality content, including better news.

We  also  wanted  to make our media companies  stronger,  and

better positioned to compete in a multimedia world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years, viewers and readers have more choices.

There are two more English language papers and a net increase

of  one free-to-air channel.  There are more news and current

affairs   programmes  on  television.   TV   viewership   and

newspaper readership are up about 6-8 percentage points.  And

I  am  glad  to  say  that  the Programmes  and  Publications

Advisory Committees have observed that the overall quality of

both print and broadcast media has been maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has also brought about innovations. New

formats  have  been  introduced for TV  news,  some  channels

leveraging  their  presentations  off  their  pool  of  print

journalists.   The main local newspapers have introduced  new

features  and offer more in-depth analysis and discussion  of

issues.  The media companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>



have  also  started to link and cross-promote their  contents

across  different  media,  such as  TV,  newspapers  and  the

Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take one example, Channel NewsAsia is increasingly

recognised as a reliable and credible information source with

a  distinct  Asian  voice, especially  in  the  wake  of  the

September  11  incident.  It not only  provides  Singaporeans

with  excellent news coverage, but now reaches more  than  10

million homes across 15 countries in the region.  So overall,

we  can say that competition has given consumers in Singapore

more  choices and we are beginning to see some of the  sought

after benefits in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for free-to-air television and newspapers is

currently  between  two media groups, each  dominant  in  one

field  of  media.  So far, competition, while keen,  has  not

been  dysfunctional.   However,  our  local  media  plays  an

important  social  role, and we must  therefore  ensure  that

social  goals are not compromised as a result of competition.

For example, we want to ensure that a certain amount of local

programming  is  available during prime time  on  television.

And  we do not want our newspapers to compete for readers  by

sensationalising the news, or publishing sleazy articles.  To

ensure  that neither group abuses its dominant position,  and

that  quality does not decline, MITA is planning to implement

a  competition code later this year for the media sector.   A

draft code prepared by MITA's consultants has been circulated

to the media industry for comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to Mr Zainudin's point and concern about foreign

influence,  I think he need not be concerned about  this,  as

this  is adequately taken care of by the existing rules under

the  Newspaper  and  Printing Presses Act,  as  well  as  the

Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a broader perspective, the media industry goes

beyond  free-to-air television and newspapers to include  all

types of content creation and content delivery



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



formats.  This is a rapidly changing industry that offers new

opportunities for growth, from film production to  animation,

to multimedia services, to video-on-demand and, soon to come,

3G  multimedia messaging.  Companies are merging so that they

can  leverage their capabilities across different  technology

platforms and market segments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has noted that others, like Dubai,

and  Mr  Zainudin  has also noted Iran, have  recognised  the

economic   value  of  this  industry  and  are   aggressively

promoting  it.   What can we learn from them?   We  must,  at

least, be equally aggressive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give focus to the media industry, we will merge

Singapore   Broadcasting  Authority  (SBA),  the  Films   and

Publications   Department  (FPD)  and  the  Singapore   Films

Commission (SFC) into a single statutory body which  will  be

called  the  Media  Development Authority  (MDA).   MDA  will

promote  the  growth of the media industry,  working  closely

with  EDB  and  other  agencies, to  attract  investments  to

Singapore   and   to  develop  our  local  content   creation

capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang wanted to know if our censorship

regime would stifle the growth of the media industry.   I  do

not  think  so.   Because  of  our  multi-racial  and  multi-religious  society, we set guidelines for contents  that  are

targetted  at  Singaporeans.   But  we  do  not  impose   our

standards  on  others.   Media  businesses  are  welcomed  to

operate  here within the laws of the land.  The formation  of

the  MDA  will bring together the various content  regulatory

bodies,  to ensure that all our content regulations are  well

coordinated across different media and correctly balanced  to

promote social harmony while encouraging industry growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the competition code in place and the formation of

MDA,  we  expect to see renewed vigour in the media  industry

and the creation of new job opportunities for Singaporeans in

the years ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last year, in the

Committee of Supply, I raised the possibility of us having  a

Freedom  of Information Act.  My argument, if you recall,  is

that  governments these days are expected to  be  transparent

and  accountable.   Freeing  up  information  will  also   be

consistent with our desire to become a knowledge economy.   I

believe  that,  with  information,  people  can  make  better

informed choices than they otherwise would have been able  to

do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can understand there is a need to consider

issues  of  national security in deciding whether or  not  to

release   information,  there  could  be   other   types   of

information  where such concerns are not pressing.   In  this

area, perhaps the Government can be more liberal and open  in

providing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did say then that the Freedom of Information

legislation serves two purposes.  If I could recap, first, it

imposes an obligation on the part of the Government to  allow

non-security, non-sensitive information to be made  available

to  citizens  where  such information affects  their  rights.

Often,  information about a person may be gathered which  has

an  effect  on  the  way the Government  decides  on  matters

affecting the person which may not be accurate and which does

not  lend itself to being challenged by the interested party.

Subject  only to requirements of national security, I  cannot

see  why  such information may not be made available  to  the

person  concerned  after, perhaps, an appropriate  period  of

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the availability of information to interested

persons,  as  of right, may have a salutary effect  on  civil

servants.   As a civil servant, if he knows that  his  record

will be subject to public scrutiny at some point of time,  he

will be more careful perhaps in the way in which he documents

his  record.  This will have a positive effect on maintaining

and, perhaps, raising the level of conduct of civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his reply to my query last year, my

parliamentary  colleague, Mr Yatiman  Yusof,  said  that  our

National Heritage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>



Board Act allows for declassification of Government documents

after a period of time, and from time to time.  I had a  look

at  the Act and would add that it falls far short of what  we

are trying to achieve here for the following reasons.  First,

the  Act does not set out any comprehensive framework for the

declassification  of information within a certain  timeframe.

Secondly, it does not confer upon a person a statutory  right

to  ask  for information that may be relevant to him.   There

are many more reasons but, for now, these two are sufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way to feel that we are mature

enough  to  consider such a legislation  as  the  Freedom  of

Information Act.  To be sure, we are not the first to look at

this,  as many countries in the west, such as the UK and  the

USA,  have  already done so.  And if we want to move  towards

the  developed standards elsewhere, it is about time that  we

seriously  consider  enacting such a legislation  as  I  have

suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to ask the Minister whether

the Government could consider such a legislation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Arthur Fong is not here. Mr Zainudin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, with the rapid advancement of

technology  in the info-communications arena, the  challenges

faced  for  control  are  approaching  impossible.   In  this

respect,  I  would like to ask the Minister  to  choose  more

education over control on the issue of Internet.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the right

to  be  left alone or to keep information about ourselves  to

ourselves  is  a right that I believe everyone  would  value.

Informational privacy has become one of the most  significant

forms  of  this  right  in the last decade,  because  of  the

advances  made  in  technology and the everyday  use  of  the

Internet.   Perhaps,  in recognition  of  this,  the  IDA  is

charged  with  the  specific duty  and  given  the  power  to

establish,  maintain  and promote data protection,  standards

and codes relating to privacy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology to make it easier for us to surf the

Internet   also  presents  risks  to  informational  privacy.

Everyone knows what cookies are.  Those who have yet to  surf

the  Net probably think that they are biscuits.  Children are

more  familiar with the cookie monster.   But, for those  who

surf the Net, they know cookies as software devices that  are

used  by server connections to store and retrieve information

about  the user.  It is intended to make life easier for  the

user, because the user preferences are then stored and become

known  to  the server.  But, increasingly, these cookies  are

becoming  cookie  monsters.  They are used  by  many  service

providers   to  collect  information,  which  is  then   sold

commercially, usually to mass marketing agencies.  The  users

suddenly find themselves bombarded with thousands of messages

advertising all sorts of products.  I am sure the  experience

is  not  unique to anybody, and it is a common one.  I myself

have   had  advertisements  for  flowers,  chocolates,   even

pregnancy  kits  which, of course, I do  not  think  I  need.

Obviously,  many  see this trend as a severe infringement  of

personal privacy.  And the US legislature has recognised this

by  considering a Bill on online personal privacy, which  has

just   secured  the  approval  of  the  US  Senate   Commerce

Committee.   The general view is that good privacy  practices

mean  good  business.  Consumer confidence will increase  and

more will use the Net for their purchases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, a number of letters have surfaced in the

Forum  Page of the Straits Times, lamenting the lack of  such

laws  in Singapore.  Singapore has so far preferred the self-regulating solution for both the private and public  sectors.

However, this is generally now regarded as insufficient for a

number  of reasons.  Firstly, companies may set out having  a

good  privacy  policy but may actually change in  due  course

without  the  users'  consent after  collecting  information.

Secondly, there are many cases of companies facing bankruptcy

and  selling their databases as a means of keeping afloat and

yet  others,  of  course,  may deliberately  use  cookies  to

surreptitiously  collect information for commercial  reasons.

Such companies are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



unlikely to abide by any self-regulating code without teeth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to promote consumer confidence is to promote

electronic commerce.  Promoting consumer confidence  requires

serious  attention to be paid to the protection  of  personal

data.  Only legislation can lay down the baseline of personal

privacy  protection.  Self-regulation has not been a  success

so  far.   This is recognised in the United States and  other

countries, such as the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,

Taiwan  and Japan.  We must not be lagging behind if  we  see

ourselves in the forefront of electronic commerce.  I  would,

therefore, like to ask the Minister to consider the following

measures:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, ask IDA to seriously explore the legislative option

for  providing  a  baseline of protection  for  informational

privacy;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, advise and direct all websites or content providers

in  Singapore  to  make available a privacy  policy  that  is

couched in simple language and not legalese; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, to encourage the use of IBM's free technology

solution  to  privacy,  the  Tivoli  programme,  that   will,

amazingly,  translate  all  written  privacy  policies   into

electronic  format  and  apply the whole  new  rules  to  the

website of the content provider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in consumer law, there is a general rule called

caveat emptor or "buyers beware".  This rule has increasingly

been  supplanted  by  legislation protecting  the  rights  of

consumers to physical goods.  In the case of the Internet, as

far  as  personal  privacy  is concerned,  it  is  still  the

situation   of   "Surfers  beware.    Cookie   monsters   are

everywhere."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to act to protect informational privacy

in  a  meaningful manner and, I hope, the Minister will  take

note of that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you have two cuts. You

can take them together.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

the  Government had legislated on regulating the Internet and

requiring  all sites with political contents to be registered

with the SBA.  This has caused fear and unease to some of the

website  operators.  As we have read in the papers,  some  of

these active civil society members, like Dr Tan Chong Kee  of

Sintercom, would rather close down the website than  to  have

it registered with the SBA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Singaporeans to take on and compete in the

global arena, we cannot continue to restrict them to grow  up

in  a  closed  and  protected environment.   If  Singaporeans

cannot  be trusted to judge issues for themselves,  how  will

they  ever learn?  Such requirement for political control  is

not  helpful  to  the nurturing and growth of  the  Singapore

societies.  Will the Minister look into freeing up more space

for  Singaporeans  to  own  and operate  discussions  on  the

Internet without the feeling that Big Brother is watching and

coming  to  catch  them?   I hope the  Minister  will  remove

political societies and websites with political contents from

this registration requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to my second cut, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister regarding the application of a printing permit for a

political  party newsletter, what is the reason for requiring

all  the  CEC  members of a party to apply for this  printing

permit.  It is not possible for the whole CEC to sit  on  the

editorial  board  to  edit every article of  the  newsletter.

Should  not  the  onus and licence requirement responsibility

from the Editorial Board alone be sufficient?  This will help

to  simplify  requirements and also be a lot more meaningful.

Can the Minister kindly explain why all the CEC members in  a

political party that applies for such a printing permit  also

be  required  to  declare  their personal  assets?   Is  this

requirement  also  enforced upon the PAP publication,  Petir?

And  that all the PAP CEC members also have to declare  their

personal  assets  to MITA when they apply for  this  printing

permit.  I am not sure, but I do not think so.  Therefore, is

such   a  requirement  a  veiled  threat  to  the  opposition

political parties and a means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>



to  suppress their freedom of publication?  Can the  Minister

kindly clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Members have raised a number of

issues  relating  to  the management of  information  in  our

society,  namely, censorship, data protection and  access  to

information.  These are fundamental issues to the way nations

are  governed  and  to  the  way  societies  function.   Each

community  has to decide for itself what these  rules  should

be.   While  these  issues are not new, our  environment  has

changed,  and we cannot duck these changes.  We are a  global

city and, therefore, open to influences from everywhere,  and

we must adjust and adapt to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One challenge is the Internet. The Internet has become

a  vital tool for business and personal growth.  But, at  the

same  time,  it is also a source of all kinds of  undesirable

content,  including pornographic content and hate  materials.

Filtering software, offered by the Internet Service Providers

(ISPs),  can  help to keep out some of these materials.   But

regulations  alone cannot prevent the naive and curious  from

being tricked or lured to undesirable sites.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore agree with Mr Zainudin that we should

educate  the public and in particular, parents, so that  they

can   take  their  own  preventive  actions  to  avoid   such

materials.   Last  February, SBA  established  a  $5  million

Internet  Public  Education Fund. To-date, $1.2  million  has

been  used to support eight on-line safety projects. The fund

has  benefited organisations like the Parents' Advisory Group

for  the Internet (PAGi). PAGi was formed two years ago,  and

has  trained more than 23,000 parents to provide guidance  to

their children on the safe use of the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we also need to provide safeguards against

another  kind  of abuse over the Internet, and  that  is  the

spurious  use of the Internet to spread false information  or

to  inflame  emotions, causing hurt to affected  parties  and

harm to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



society.   This  is  why the Government has  imposed  certain

registration   requirements  for  political   and   religious

websites, and political party websites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia claimed that this rule was the reason why

the  Sintercom website closed down.  This claim is  unfounded

and  his  suggestion to waive the rule is unwise.   Sintercom

need   not   have  closed  down  because  of   these   rules.

Registration  does  not  impose any  extra  rule  on  content

providers and websites.  Nor does it disallow open discussion

or criticism of Government policies.  Yes, indeed, the public

is free to access these sites and to judge for themselves the

contents.   These sites are bound by the class licence  rules

of the Internet, and by the laws of the land. Registration is

a reasonable and prudent measure to establish accountability,

and  to  deter irresponsible persons from using the cloak  of

anonymity to create mischief and harm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia also asked why it is necessary for the CEC

members of political parties to be named as the publishers of

party websites and newspapers, and to declare their assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in politics, it is only too easy to run down

political opponents or to stir up trouble under the cloak  of

anonymity.  This is why it is necessary to remove this cover.

It  is  reasonable  and fair to expect CEC  members,  as  the

highest  decision making body of a party, to stand  by  their

views  openly,  and  to  take  responsibility  for  what   is

published  on  their  website or in  the  newspapers.   Also,

requiring CEC members to declare their assets when they apply

for  a  newspaper  permit ensures that  they  are  people  of

substance  who have not tried to avoid their responsibilities

by appointing proxies to represent them on the CEC, and to be

the fall guys should they run into trouble with the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has also asked if this rule applies to Petir and

to the PAP.  Yes, it does.  But PAP CEC members declare their

assets to the Prime Minister and SBA accepts that declaration

as fulfilment of this requirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to the issue of data protection which

was raised by Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung, who has informed me

that, owing to an urgent personal matter, he is unable to  be

present  for  the response.  The ability to  store  and  move

tremendous  amounts  of data and the open  structure  of  the

Internet  make all of us vulnerable to information misuse  or

abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is mindful of this. Apart from basic

legislation,  like the Computer Misuse Act, we  have  enacted

sector-specific legislation, like the Private  Hospitals  and

Medical Clinics Act, the Banking Act and the Income Tax  Act,

to protect sensitive personal data like medical and financial

records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sector-specific legislation, however, may not cover all

types  of  information that an individual may  want  to  keep

private.  However,  a wide and sweeping legislation  on  data

protection may also not be the best way to move forward or to

make  things better.  This is because such a law  could  deny

companies'  access to information that they need to  come  up

with   better  ways  to  tailor  products  and  services   to

customers.  It would hinder innovations, and customers  would

miss  out on useful and convenient services.  After all,  not

all  of  us reject cookies.  Some of us do like the taste  of

some of those cookies.  And we accept the cookies because  we

want  to get to those sites.  Also, complying with a broadly-based law could raise significantly business costs, and  this

would affect small businesses and start-ups the most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These benefits apply both to the private and the public

sectors.    Indeed,  through  e-Government,  many   new   and

convenient  services have been delivered to the  public.  The

Government's  approach to data protection is,  therefore,  to

set  in  place  rules  and  processes  that  would  safeguard

privacy, without incurring high costs or stifling innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has its own internal guidelines,

administered by the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



of  Finance,  that guard against misuse of information.   The

Second Minister for Finance elaborated on this in this  House

last week, so I shall not go into that further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, we are working with the private sector to

strengthen   industry   self-regulation.   The   industry-led

National   Trust  Council  is  currently  conducting   public

consultation  on  a  Data Protection  Code  for  the  private

sector.    The   draft  code  is  modelled  on  international

standards, and I would encourage Members to give their  views

to the Council as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me touch on free access to information. Mr

Sin  Boon Ann has argued that Singapore should have a Freedom

of  Information  Act.  He has raised this before.   He  feels

that  it  is appropriate, in an information-oriented  society

like  ours,  that  individuals should  have  free  access  to

information held by the Government, and that this would  make

the  Government  more  careful in  the  way  it  manages  its

information resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is natural as we become more and more of an

information society, that the public will want to have  great

access  to information that are important to them,  and  that

affect  their daily lives.   To-date, Government  information

is available through a variety of channels, for example, mass

media, governmental publications, the Government websites  of

which  there are many, and the National Archives.  Parliament

is  also  a  source of information where MPs  regularly  file

questions to get specific answers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But legislating information access rights, as suggested,

also   has  its  pros  and  cons.   Yes,  it  might   improve

transparency, but it will also shift more public resources to

addressing   individual  demands,  rather   than   collective

benefits.   It  may  also  impose  rigidities  on   the   way

information  must  be kept and managed in order  to  be  made

available  for public scrutiny.  And like data protection,  a

legislated approach to information access can raise costs and

hinder innovation within the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the public today is denied

information they need,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>



except for information that could compromise our security  or

national  interests.  Is there a practical need that  is  not

met?   In practical terms, we have more access to information

than  we really can use. But if there are specific needs that

are not addressed, then we should take a look at them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system we have today is working well. Instead of a

Freedom of Information Act, there may be more practical value

at  this  time  to take a needs-based approach and  cultivate

greater  civic  awareness  and  involvement  around  specific

issues that can benefit the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues that the Members have raised on

information management are fundamental to the development  of

our  society,  whether  it  is data  protection,  freedom  of

information  access  or censorship.  Our society  is  neither

static  nor closed, and we will review our policies in  these

areas  from  time to time to keep pace with our economic  and

social development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Members for making these important issues as

part of this debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I just want to seek some

clarification from the Acting Minister.  Just  now,  he  said

that  the particulars of assets of the members of the CEC  of

the  PAP  are  handed  to the Prime Minister.  If  I  am  not

mistaken, the PAP is a private political party, just like any

other  political  party in Singapore.  I  believe  also  that

Petir is a publication of a private organisation.  It is  not

a Government publication.  How is the law being complied with

when  it  is  required that all the CEC members  must  submit

their  assets  to SBA, but in this case, it was submitted  to

the Prime Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clarification. When the details of assets are

submitted to the Prime Minister, is it submitted to the Prime

Minister  as Prime Minister, or is it submitted to the  Prime

Minister as the head of the PAP?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> The PAP is not just a private political

party.  It is the ruling party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



It is the Government.  It forms the Government.  When office-holders  declare  their assets to the  Prime  Minister,  they

declare  to  the Prime Minister as the Prime  Minister.   The

purpose  of having this rule, as I gave Mr Steve Chia  in  my

reply,  was  to  ensure that the CEC members  are  people  of

substance and that they do not put proxies on board  the  CEC

so  that  these proxies can be the fall guys for them  should

they  run  into trouble.  This objective is achieved  by  the

declaration  that the CEC members make to the Prime  Minister

in their duties as office -holders.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, Infocomm Vision 21 aims to achieve

e-Government, e-business and e-lifestyle in Singapore in five

years'  time.   To-date,  many  Singaporeans  understand  the

benefits of IT, but many are still experiencing difficulty in

acquiring   necessary  IT  skills,  especially   the   senior

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing IT skills and awareness is important. But

what  is  more important is to make sure that those who  have

learnt  IT  know how to apply the IT skills to  better  their

lives.   We  need a more structured and quality  approach  to

achieve our Infocomm Vision 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the outreach programme for increasing the

IT skills of Singaporeans?  How effective is the programme in

imparting IT skills to these Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can more resources be channelled to the Community

Development Councils (CDCs) to help to run some of  these  IT

programmes,  in  collaboration with other  civic  or  private

organisations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the plans to help lower-income families to

own PCs?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, since the unveiling of the

Infocomm 21 Plan, the dot-com bust had occurred, and euphoria

for  a  networked world has ameliorated.  The  landscape  has

changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister could share his views on the

following.  How have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



dot-com  bust and related developments affected the  Infocomm

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision, if any?  What is the progress with the bringing of

broadband  connectivity into homes  and  offices?   How  many

homes and offices have subscribed to broadband services?   Is

the Minister satisfied with the broadband adoption?  What are

the  causes for resistance to broadband access?  Is  price  a

deterrent?  If so, what is being done to bring it  down,  and

when can we see this happening?

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what is the status of the digital divide in

Singapore?   What progress have we achieved  to  review  this

divide?  Has it in the meantime widened?  What further  plans

are being considered to fight this digital divide?

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, the world telecommunication

industry is in the midst of a financial melt-down.  There  is

over-capacity.   I just want to find out from  the  Minister,

what  is the situation in Singapore?  Has it the same effect?

Do  we have over-capacity?  Do we have the critical mass  and

the economy of scale to enable these networks to survive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, also Sir, the consumers of bandwidth do not see the

prices   falling,   even   though   telecommunications    has

liberalised  and we see more competition.  We  read  recently

that Starhub is going to acquire SCV and I am concerned about

the  role  of content providers and systems integrators.   By

allowing the two large groups remaining, will there be a role

for  content providers?  I think one of the great issues with

regard  to  telecommunications is really the role of  content

providers,  the variety of them, the access and provision  of

content and how the systems could be integrated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with my colleague before me who has spoken, I

see  that  the percentage of the workforce which is competent

in  infocomm, has only risen marginally from 43% to 45%.   So

what steps are we taking to improve the competency level of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans in infocomm, especially for older workers?  When

do  we  see the day that we have 100% competency in infocomm.

Are  we producing enough talent in this area, because  as  we

want  to  grow this industry, obviously, what will hold  back

would  be  the human capital?  Can the Minister  give  us  an

assessment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, the burst of the dot-com

bubble  has been a painful lesson for many.  I would like  to

caution  the  Minister  on the hype  and  hoo-ha  of  the  3G

technology.   It  is  all  good and well  to  anticipate  and

project   the   possible  growth  and  earnings   from   this

technology.    There   are  still  many   uncertainties   and

technologically speaking, there are many hurdles to  overcome

and bugs to cure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could learn from the experience of the European

countries    that    had    inadvertently    thrown     their

telecommunication companies into battle for  the  coveted  3G

licence, even before any concrete system or services could be

rolled out. Is this a good thing to do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to caution the Minister against

putting a high premium on the 3G licence, because in the end,

it  is  the  consumer who is going to pay for these services,

and  worse still, it could hinder the growth rather than help

it to develop to its full potential.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, first

let me thank the four Members who spoke up on various aspects

of  infocomm development in Singapore.  As this is the  first

Budget in which ICT comes under the purview of MITA, allow me

to  briefly sketch out MITA's view on this sector, even as  I

reply to the specific queries of the Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ICT sector in Singapore has come a long way since

1981  when we formed the National Computer Board.  The  early

pioneers have gone on with age.  Some have moved to  take  on

new  responsibilities, like Mr Philip Yeo, who is now leading

the  charge  of growing another new industry for Singapore  - the life



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>



sciences.  Another notable pioneer is Minister Lim Swee  Say,

who  is  now  championing the cause of clean environment  and

NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have these and many other pioneers to thank for the

significant progress that we have achieved.  They helped  lay

not only a strong foundation, but a nimble culture, which has

allowed  us  to  move  in  tandem  with  global  market   and

technology  trends.  Over the years, we see NCB  moving  from

Mindef  to MOF, to MTI and then to MCIT to merge with TAS  to

become IDA.  And now IDA has moved into MITA's stable to help

us  push  the  ICT  sector to a new  height  as  we  position

Singapore  for  the  next  wave of convergences  between  IT,

telecoms and broadcasting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after 20 years, the ICT sector has grown to become a

very  significant  contributor to  our  GDP.   Its  value-add

contributes  about  5.5%, which is  significant.   The  total

industry  revenue is about $26 billion, and growing strongly.

Right  through  the Asian financial crisis,  the  ICT  sector

continued its strong and robust growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress we have made in the sector does not happen

naturally.  It is the result of proactive planning and timely

policy  interventions.   On  the policy  side,  let  me  just

highlight  three  major initiatives, which have  particularly

positioned us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government's decision to fully liberalise the

telco  sector  in April 2000.  Competition has  brought  down

prices, and increased the range of service offerings  to  all

Singaporeans,  young  and old.  Many of  us  have  personally

benefited from this.  My daughters certainly do.  One of them

told  me  the other night that she sends 700 SMS  messages  a

month.   She  assured me that she is not among  the  heaviest

users in her class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government's decision to bring about a world-class infocomm infrastructure. Our IT 2000 Masterplan

transformed  Singapore into an Intelligent  Island.   We  now

have  1  million  homes in Singapore, all of which  have  the

options



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>



to  effect broadband connection, either via ADSL, the  copper

wire, or SCV cable.  And, increasingly, some homes will  also

have a third "wire", which is wireless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked about progress in broadband

adoption in homes and offices, which Mr Loh Meng See asked as

well.   We had a recent survey and it showed nearly 1 million

broadband  users  in  Singapore.  This  means  that  1  in  3

Singaporeans, above the age of 10, are broadband users.  More

significantly, more than half of them took up broadband  only

last  year.  So clearly, the big bang in telco liberalisation

has contributed to this growth, by bringing down prices.   As

far  as I know, the cheapest broadband access package in town

is only $38 per month, for unlimited usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government's initiative to actively cultivate

sophisticated demand.  We have, as Dr Tan put it, gone beyond

the  IT awareness stage to cultivate savvy usage of this very

important medium.  The public sector is leading on this.  Its

$1.5 billion e-Government Action Plan seeks to transform  the

civil service into a leading e-Government in the world.  Two-thirds  of all Government services that can be offered online

are  already  being delivered electronically.  But,  we  will

push  towards 100%.  So, similarly, our private sector should

actively review their business processes to see how they  can

further  exploit ICT to attract, to retain,  and  to  delight

their customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, after 20 years of strong growth, the ICT

sector  remains in a dynamic, creative and developing  phase.

Technology  will continue to surprise.  Broadband,  wireless,

3G,  web  services, digital media, next generation  Internet,

and who knows what, will open up many new opportunities.   In

particular,  the  merger of ICT with media  should  throw  up

exciting  opportunities.  For example, in the  digital  media

content  industry, many industry analysts expect it  to  grow

from US$100 billion to possibly US$350 billion by 2004.  This

is  an  exciting  field where arts, business  and  technology

intersect.   Winners will go to those with  a  good  dose  of

creativity and imagination.  Those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>



can  provide  the consumers with a differentiated  experience

will  win.  It is a wide field, including animation, computer

games,  music,  entertainment, film  and  print  media  using

digital   technology   for   both   content   creation    and

distribution.   Our  Singapore  companies  should   seriously

consider how they can ride on this wave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan was correct to highlight the boom and

bust  of  dot-coms.  He asked if the bust should lead  us  to

review  our Infocomm 21 Vision.  Many dot-coms have  crashed,

but  the  effects of the Internet Revolution in changing  the

way  we  live, work and play, are permanent.  Industries  and

companies  continue  to be transformed  by  ICT.   Technology

continues  to  make progress.  So we are reviewing,  or  more

correctly,  updating our Infocomm 21 Vision, not so  much  in

response  to  the  bust of the dot-coms,  but  to  take  into

account the continuing progress in technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one key difference in our approach going

forward.   In  the  last 20 years, the Government's  role  in

championing   the  industry,  jumpstarting  the  development,

investing  in capabilities and infrastructure,  have  laid  a

strong foundation.  It has been largely supply-driven, policy-driven  and domestic focus.  Going forward for the sector  to

achieve  its next breakthrough, the efforts will have  to  be

more demand-driven, industry-driven and export-oriented.   It

means  leadership in exploiting ICT for strategic  advantage.

It  means  the  ability  to extract maximum  value  from  our

commanding  lead,  to go beyond Singapore  to  penetrate  the

market overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chair the Economic Review Committee's Services

Industry Sub-Committee.  We  have identified several  service

sectors  which we think Singapore can excel in, and  the  ICT

sector  is  a clear candidate.  Given our 20 years  of  head-start  and investments in capabilities, we are bullish  about

its continuing growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A completely industry-driven ICT Working Group, led by

Mr Wilson Tan of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  IT Federation, has been busily working  with  more

than  100  industry players to help us draw up  the  strategy

going  forward.   They will complete their  work  and  submit

their recommendations in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One strong advantage of Singapore in the ICT sector is

that young Singaporeans are not shy of new technology or  new

gadgets.  Our parents may seem to be shy of ICT, but I do not

think  it  is  because they are shy of new  technology.   The

lower usage of ICT among the older Singaporeans is often  due

to other factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I personally dislike SMS (I do not mean my

neighbours in this Chamber), because I cannot stand the  tiny

screen of the mobile phone and my thumb seems too big for the

keys.   Likewise,  many  older Singaporeans  are  "digitally-divided"  because  the working language on  the  Internet  is

still largely English, and many do not know how to type.   So

understanding  these  barriers is  important  if  we  are  to

further bridge the digital divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA's various initiatives have produced meaningful

results.   I will just name a few.  For example, through  its

collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  under   the

National  IT  Literacy Programme, we have trained  more  than

80,000  Singaporeans.  The One Learning Place  at  Toa  Payoh

Community  Library has trained more than 100,000 Singaporeans

in  the  use of broadband.  My mother-in-law attended one  of

the  courses in a neighbourhood community centre and she  now

enjoys  her  real-time mahjong session on Yahoo.com,  playing

with players from all over the world, whom she never met.   I

watched  her play the other day.  She could not take part  in

the  cyber-chat which always accompanies such  games  because

she does not understand English.  So she just concentrates on

the game, and therefore she wins all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See talked about the upcoming merger between

Starhub  and SCV.  As the former Chairman of SCV, I played  a

small part in that merger process, which is on-going.  And it

has a specific objective, which is to create a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



fixed-line  infrastructure in Singapore as an alternative  to

SingTel.   Just  now  I talked about the three  wires  -  the

SingTel wire, the SCV wire, and a future "wireless".  But  by

creating this alternative fixed-line infrastructure we  bring

about  greater  competition on domestic fixed-line,  which  I

think will further reduce the prices of telephony, as we know

it today.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainudin that we should not be too

romantic about 3Gs, and its hype.  Fortunately for us, we are

not too much ahead of the curve.  The Europeans were ahead of

it.  So with huge auction prices, it now caused a big problem

to  the industry.  That is why sometimes, it does not pay  to

be  the early bird because you may end up the early worm.  In

certain cases, you have to be the early bird, but I think, in

this  case, it is better to see what has been done elsewhere.

And  so  when  we  took our 3G auctions, it was  many  months

later.   As  you can see, the bid prices are quite different.

I read the Financial Times last week about the 3G development

in  Europe  where there are great concerns.  We are  watching

this whole development very closely so that we can learn from

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about greater use of the Internet

so as to bring this application to the whole community, young

and old, IT-literate or otherwise, creating, for example,  e-communities.   I  totally agree.  This  is  a  very  powerful

medium  and  a very effective mass communication  tool.   The

fact  is  we are under-utilising it.  I agree with  him  that

CDCs,  Town  Councils  and Singaporeans  individually  should

think  creatively  on  how much more they  can  exploit  this

medium.   IDA  (with a $25 million budget) will be  happy  to

facilitate and to cheer them on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, contents and applications are the key drivers.

Once  I  got  my  mother-in-law to play mahjong,  my  problem

becomes  one  of how to get her off the screen.  My  youngest

daughter is addicted to Neopets.com and according to her, her

entire class too.  This is a US website, which reaches out to

teenagers, allowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



them to set up cyber shops to sell virtual goods to one

another.  It is absolutely cool, and along the way, a whole e-community is created globally.  But she learns a thing or two

about setting prices, how to take part in auctions and market

competition, and that, for example, a price war is

fundamentally crazy.  Only the other day, she asked me why a

particular player was selling her ware at a price way below

her cost.  She lost a customer as a result.  She could have

gone on a price war but she decided against it.  I thought to

myself, when she grows up, she may join PSA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q - (cont.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, we have just heard that

Singapore  wants to be an infocomm hub and IDA has to  ensure

that   we   have   a   world-class   standard   of   infocomm

infrastructure  and quality of service.  However,  there  are

complaints of mobile phone service standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue is on mobile phone portability. The

mobile phone is mobile but the phone number is not.  When one

switches to another service provider and wishes to retain the

phone  number, the operator will use call forwarding  service

to solve the problem.  But this is not the complete solution,

as  is  pointed out by many users who had complained  to  the

press.   I  note that the IDA, in its reply to the complaint,

has said that it recognises that with technology advancements

and market developments, it is necessary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



review  the  MMP solution regularly.  I would  like  to  know

whether  a  review has been made and what is the position  of

IDA now on the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, is regarding the issue of the service

standard  of  SMS.  There were complaints that  SMS  messages

were  not delivered even after days.  I wonder - because  the

Senior Minister of State dislikes SMS - whether IDA is  going

to   set  mandated  service  standard  for  the  SMS  service

providers.  Or is it just going to deem it as not one of  the

functionalities  not needed by most users, and  thereby  need

not set any mandated standard?  And I would advise the Senior

Minister  of  State  that if he had a problem  in  using  his

thumb,  maybe  he should try the PDA phone.   You  can  write

Chinese as well, using your hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it has also been brought to my attention

that  there are instances of dropped lines when mobile  phone

users enter MRT tunnels during train rides.  There was also a

complaint today from MPs that if one goes inside the lift, he

would  also experience dropped lines.  What is the IDA  going

to  do  about  it  to ensure the service operators  take  the

necessary  action  to  prevent all this frequent  problem  of

dropped lines?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang has raised a

number  of issues concerning mobile phone services.   Let  me

deal with them one by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mobile number portability, or MNP, IDA mandated MNP

since the start of mobile competition on 1st April 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several technical ways to achieve portability.

IDA  decided at that time it was better to leave  it  to  the

mobile operators themselves to decide which was the best way.

This is consistent with the regulatory practice in most other

countries.   However,  the current solution  adopted  by  the

operators does not allow portability for mobile data services

such  as SMS.  We recognise that this shortcoming can  hamper

competition and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



likewise,  innovation.  IDA is working with the  industry  to

review  the  existing technical solution, and it will  ensure

that  the market remains competitive and able to deliver  new

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-operator SMS, that is SMS across

different  mobile  operators, IDA  has  mandated  this  since

February 2000.  Any mobile user can send and receive messages

to   and  from  the  customers  of  other  mobile  operators.

Singapore  is one of the very few countries in the  world  to

have  actually mandated inter-operator SMS.  IDA is currently

working with the four mobile operators to examine whether the

inter-operator SMS service can be improved, and will consider

whether  or  not to set minimum Quality of Service  standards

for SMS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on mobile coverage in MRT tunnels, IDA has

mandated  that  all operators must provide  coverage  in  MRT

stations.  But there is a problem here.  We have not  so  far

imposed minimum Quality of Service standards because of  this

problem, and that is, there is limited physical space in  MRT

tunnels.  There is space for the trains but there is no space

for  a lot of other things.  Mobile operators therefore  have

been  required to share infrastructure in MRT tunnels.   This

limits  their  mobile capacity, and it makes it difficult  to

isolate  problems  to  a  particular  operator.   For   these

reasons,  QOS  standards have not so far been set.   But  IDA

will  continue to monitor the overall service levels closely,

and work with the mobile operators to address and resolve the

network  congestion or quality of service problems when  they

arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I seek a clarification

from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, a short clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> He said that service standards were

set  for  SMS.   But is the standard for delivering  messages

set?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> No, Sir, I said that service standards

were  not  set.   We  have not set them because  there  is  a

competitive marketplace.  If there is a competitive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



marketplace, you leave it to the operators how they  want  to

achieve  this.  One of the problems, of course, with  service

standards in SMS today is because of people like Mr Khaw Boon

Wan's  daughter  who sent out 700 messages a month,  maybe  a

day!   And  there  are many kids who find  this  a  very  fun

technology,  just to keep in touch with each other.   But  it

puts a lot of traffic onto the system.  One possible solution

could be to differentiate service types, so that the business

users could subscribe to more expensive service and therefore

get better quality of service.  But this is something for the

market really to work out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. I

wonder,  where  is  the balance?  On the  one  hand,  IDA  is

supposed  to provide the service standard and, on  the  other

hand,  it  is  saying that you leave it to the  market.   So,

which is which?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> IDA's responsibility is to ensure that we

have a competitive marketplace, and we leave it to the market

then  to decide.  Where there are restrictions to competition

in the marketplace, then IDA will step in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

answers, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, just now, the Acting Minister Mr

David  Lim  asked us to look at this stereogram [indicating].

He  said that the Government had a heart there.  I looked  at

it,  but I cannot see the heart there.  Fortunately,  Dr  Lee

Boon  Yang  who  will  be taking over as Minister  for  MITA,

taught  me how to look for the heart,  and I finally  saw  it

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what you can see, you say you can see. What you

cannot  see,  you  must say you cannot  see.  However,  I  am

reminded of the famous story of the Emperor's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>



New   Clothes.   The  Emperor's  new  clothes  were  not   in

existence,  and nobody could actually see it,  but  everybody

pretended that he saw it.  Eventually, it was this little boy

who exclaimed, "Hey, the Emperor is not wearing anything!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we had a Singapore edition of the Emperor's

New Clothes, that is the "Hungarian Ghost Festival".  We know

that this problem arose from a wrongly translated description

in   the  Chinese  version  of  a  Singapore  Tourism   Board

publication.   This Hungarian Ghost Festival has  turned  our

society into a nation of ghosts and our ancestors have become

Hungarians.  The Chinese community was naturally very unhappy

with it.  There are a lot of articles in the newspapers,  and

even   the  ordinary  citizens  are  saying  that   this   is

disgusting.  The Government saw it, but it said nothing about

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people said that this was indeed a "national

disgrace"!  Why  is  it a   national disgrace!   Because  the

Hungarian  Ghost Festival was not the only problem.  In  this

Singapore Tourists' Guidebook which was distributed freely to

incoming  tourists  at the airport, the  Chinese  translation

stated  that  two former   Prime Ministers of Singapore  were

buried  at the Kranji War Memorial.   We all know that  there

is  only one former Prime Minister of Singapore, and he  will

be  celebrating his 80th birthday. He is still very  healthy,

and  he is flying all over the world.  Our Prime Minister  is

in  the  pink  of  his health, and his face is  shining  with

vitality.   He can easily live to 100 years old.   How  could

they  say such inauspicious thing about them.  This is indeed

disgusting!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lianhe Zaobao, many readers wrote to complain

about it. Some commented that the Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew  in

two  volumes which ran into some 2,000 pages were  translated

into  Chinese,  by our local translators, and  there  was  no

mistake  in them.  Why was there no mistake?  The  reason  is

very simple.  It was because the publishers were very serious

about   it.   On  the  other  hand,  although  the  Tourists'

Guidebook   was   an  official  publication,   the   relevant

Government  agency  did not take it seriously,  and  did  not

attach any importance to it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the problem. Very often, when we write to a

Government   department  about  some  issues,  we  inevitably

receive  a reply, "We will look into it."  When we raise  the

issue  face to face with the Government officials, they  will

say,  "I  see, I see". So, they look and they see. Look  see,

look see, and in the end nothing is done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB said that the Guidebook was translated by some

people  in Shanghai, some foreign talents!  No doubt,  it  is

good  to  use foreign talents.  But the question is: did  our

own  people  bother to vet and approve it?  We  want  foreign

talents, but we also need our own local talents to complement

them. Foreign   talents plus local talents, great things  can

be  done.  Foreign talents and no local talents to complement

them, there will be full of problems.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, we had problems with the wrong

translations  in Contact Singapore that made  us  a  laughing

stock  within and outside Singapore. This year, we  run  into

similar   trouble   again  with  this   Singapore   Tourists'

Guidebook.  The  problem is the attitude of these  Government

departments remains unchanged. They do not take their Chinese

publications seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of Singaporeans feel very hurt because of this. Mr

Lee  Seng Giap wrote an article in the Lianhe Zaobao entitled

"Top straight but bottom crooked".  The common expression  is

"Top not straight, hence the bottom is crooked".  However, in

the  present  case, the people at the bottom are doing  well,

but the people at the top could not be bothered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many readers have suggested that we should have a

Central  Translation Bureau.  This is a  long-term  plan.   I

think the immediate plan is to have an official vetting panel

to  vet through all important official translation works.  If

the  Government department cannot get enough people to do the

job, it can make use  of talents from the private sector.  If

this cannot be done,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>



then  it  is not a question of not being able to do, but  not

wanting to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng, you have only 5 minutes left,

and it includes the Minister's reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): DPM Lee said that,

when  we  are  remaking Singapore, we  will  leave  no  stone

unturned.  But the problem is that some stones are turned and

then  put back in the same place. In this case, nobody  seems

to  want  to  remove this stone at all.  Last year,  we  were

tripped by this stone, this year this stone is obstructing us

again.  The  various Government departments are reluctant  to

take on this responsibility.  I feel MITA should take on  the

role of a coordinator.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to my question, DPM Lee mentioned that when

the  Japanese Minister merely said, "Hm!", the civil  servant

took  the cue and said a lot of things. I hope that  DPM  Lee

will  now say, "Hm!", and let the civil servants go  and  get

things done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I share the anguish and anger of

Mr  Seng  Han Thong when our "Hungry Ghosts", in the hand  of

the Shanghainese translator, became naturalised "Hungarians".

I  was  in  MTI  for  seven years.  So I know  MTI  corporate

culture  very  well.   In MTI, we are allergic  to  repeating

mistakes.   Each mistake leads to a thorough  review  of  the

operating  procedure so that a similar mistake does  not  get

repeated.   So I have no doubt that, from now, in STB,  there

would  not  be double vetting, there will be triple,  perhaps

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human error cropped up in STB. But it could have

cropped up in other departments, as in Contact Singapore, two

years  ago.   It  could  have also happened  in  the  private

sector.  Mr Seng felt that a Central Translation Bureau,  or,

in  the  interim,  some  vetting panel,  would  prevent  such

problems in future, at least for the public sector.  I am not

so sure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These incidents underline the importance of context and

knowledge of cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>



nuances.   Hence,  we  cannot treat the  language  as  purely

technical.  For Singapore to be cosmopolitan, we must develop

a  deeper knowledge of culture and context.  And this must be

achieved  at every level, not just the translators,  but  the

managers in charge must build that up too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every publication is a communication exercise. The

manager in charge is finally responsible for the accuracy  of

the message.  He must take ownership.  Passing the buck to  a

central bureau, or a vetting panel, is more likely to  result

in  a loss of accountability on the part of the manager.  The

language  experts in the Central Bureau can, at  best,  do  a

technical  translation job but they cannot  fully  appreciate

the  nuances of the content or the intricacies of the  policy

intent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personal experience of this. Just two-three

months  ago, I have to give a couple of lectures to a largely

Buddhist  audience.   So  I prepared my  speech  in  English,

because  I  am more competent in English.  Then  I  asked  my

colleague in MITA to do a translation for me.  But I have  to

do the final vetting and, in fact, as it turned out, I had to

make  a  few  amendments because the translator,  being  non-Buddhist, cannot fully capture my intent accurately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with Mr Seng that MITA, with its pool of

language  experts,  is in a position to help.   We  can  help

train  translators.  We can help standardise the  terminology

to  be  used.  We can help translate the important Government

documents.   And  we  do  provide  such  a  service  for  our

colleagues  in  the  other Ministries,  but  we  have  to  be

selective.  For example, our service cannot extend to tourism

promotion publications which should rightly remain  the  full

responsibility of STB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is an important part of our heritage. It can

also  be a competitive advantage.  So we must all try  to  be

better at it.  It is therefore very good of Mr Seng to  raise

this very important point.  Credit must also be given to  the

media for highlighting these incidents.  If we do not exert



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>



high  standard on ourselves, then we will never  be  able  to

make progress.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng Han Thong, would you like to

withdraw your amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Arthur Fong is not

moving.  Amendment No. (4), Mr Zainudin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QH

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every major city of the world has its own historical and

cultural  landmark.  The Esplanade's design  and  development

have  caused some stir in the architectural circle and  among

our  citizens.   Personally, I have to admit  that  I  am  an

admirer of this national landmark.  Say whatever you like, it

sure stands out like a sore thumb on the bay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, we could only turn to several common

sites   for  concerts  and  performances.   Now,   with   the

Esplanade, I am confident Singaporeans can benefit and  enjoy

a modern, hi-tech, world-class theatre and concert hall.  The

Esplanade  will go a long way in promoting and elevating  the

art  scene  in Singapore.  Sir, my only concern is  regarding

the status and role of the Esplanade, as a private entity, in

the effort to promote arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am for the investment in the arts and culture. It is

important.   With regard to this, I would like  to  highlight

the  major  investment  towards  this  project  and  ask  the

Minister how is the Esplanade going to balance its role to be

economically viable and, yet, making the arts accessible  and

affordable to the masses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, for many Singaporeans

driving  past or gazing out of the SBS bus as he  passes  the

Esplanade, one wonders how much he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>



would appreciate what goes on inside and much less what  went

on inside the Victoria Theatre these past years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recognise that the Esplanade will truly be the

pride  and joy of Singaporeans in time.  Like the arts circle

in  Singapore, I am anxiously awaiting for the opening of the

Esplanade.  It will play an important part in developing  and

encouraging  a  softer  side  and more  holistic  Singaporean

through the appreciation of the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the Esplanade is simple - to entertain,

engage,  educate and inspire.  To entertain who?   To  engage

who?   To  educate  who?  To inspire  what?   The  answer  is

simple.   To  entertain art lovers, engage and interact  with

people  who  can  appreciate  and  even  identify  with   the

performances and performers, educate people who have  yet  to

experience  the various art  forms and finally to  inspire  a

quest  for  more artistic exposure once entertained,  engaged

and educated.  Simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is, however, not as simple when we ask who are

these  people that we want to entertain, engage, educate  and

inspire.   Sir,  how  many affluent  Asian  art  lovers  will

consistently  fly  in, cruise in, drive  in  to  support  the

programmes that are obviously going to be of a wide spectrum.

How  many Singaporeans will take up all the other seats night

after night?  This must be difficult for a few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to increase a healthy mass of art lovers, MITA has

instituted many initiatives.  Some good examples are the Arts

Central  on our TV, Arts on the Move series, that is  brought

to  the  HDB  heartlands,  Cross  Talk  events  in  community

centres, Music Box - performances by young talented musicians

and  many  more.   We  even have a Theatre Management  course

study at the university.  There is also a concerted effort to

bring  in ASEAN artists and also to entice the regional  arts

companies to take root here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom-line is we want to be prominent on the

international arts calendar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>



Before  that  happens, we ask ourselves, will  the  range  of

activities  that the Esplanade will stage be able to  sustain

its  momentum?  Surely, performers and artistes want to  play

to  audiences  and not just to experience performing  in  the

newest  performing Arts Centre with the latest that  acoustic

and theatre design has to offer at this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have asked earlier, is the regional pool of theatre

goers  enough?  Is our own Singaporean pool of theatre  goers

developed?  Well, maybe after 12th October this year, foreign

talents will find Singapore the least stressed place in  Asia

to  work and play will also say that there is the Theatre  on

the  Bay and there is much at play!  But as much as we  would

like, the foreign talent pool cannot help us too much in  the

area  of  filling the seats night after night.  Many  average

Singaporeans will tell you, this is for the atas  sikit,  the

artsy  and  even for the ang moh foreign talent that  we  are

wooing, and not for the average Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that there are, today, in our heartlands,

Singaporeans  who  have in the past few  years  developed  an

interest in the arts, but this group is small.  Will the many

programmes,  as  I have acknowledged earlier, to  "culturise"

our  people,  result  in  a  short time,  help  build  enough

cultural ballast for all that the Esplanade has the potential

and will to stage?  I do not think so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, large Government grants will be necessary to

keep  the  curtains up for these two honeycomb  architectural

icons, or for the average Singaporeans it is nan sat du lian,

the  glass  skin.   Sir,  for the year  2001,  the  Esplanade

company ran a deficit of $3.8 million.  A Government grant of

$4 1/2 million  was necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, we are in deficit of time now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> I am finishing. Assuming that the

learning  curve  and the reputation of the Esplanade  as  the

performing  Arts Centre is on the world stage in,  say,  five

years,  I would like to ask the Minister the estimated yearly

Government grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>



for  the  next five years and beyond which is needed to  keep

the curtains up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I am happy that MITA is

developing  the  Old Parliament House.  This  historical  and

important   heritage  of  our  country  must  be  given   due

importance and accorded the right place in our society.  With

respect  to  this, can the Minister update the House  on  the

progress of the development and the future plans for the  Old

Parliament  House?  May I also ask what is the difference  in

the  model of development compared to the old SJI?  I had the

opportunity  to  accompany  the  Minister  on  his  visit  to

Reflections  at Bukit Chandu recently, and it was  really  an

exciting  and  interesting  experience.   I  would  like   to

encourage  the  House to pay a visit to this  new  museum  at

Bukit  Chandu.  If this is an example of the kind  of  future

development that we can get for our museums, I have to really

say  that  it is a commendable effort, and I would  encourage

MITA to work on the same model for the Old Parliament House.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, both Mr Zainudin Nordin and Mr Arthur Fong

wanted  to  know what programmes the Explanade has to  enable

the  public to identify with, enjoy and be proud of  it.   Mr

Zainudin  also wanted to know whether the Esplanade would  be

managed  as  a  business entity or as  an  entity  of  public

character,  and  how  the  Esplanade's  viability  would   be

maintained while allowing Singaporeans to enjoy it  and  feel

ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin mentioned the success of the Pepys Road

programme  and  also asked whether the Old  Parliament  House

would be modelled along that line or with the SJI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade's mission is to be a performing arts

centre  for everyone.  To fulfill this vision, the  Esplanade

hopes  to  resonate  and  connect with  both  the  local  and

international audience by presenting an extensive and diverse

range of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>



programmes.   It  will  strive  to  present  activities  that

everyone  can  participate in and  enjoy.   To  fulfill  this

mission, the arts centre will start with three weeks  of  fun

and   exciting  programmes  immediately  after  its  official

opening  by  the President on 12th October this year.   There

will  be  local and international performances and activities

reaching   out  to  families,  teenagers,  adults   and   the

international audience.  All her state-of-the-art  facilities

-  the 1,600-seat concert hall, the 2,000-seat theatres,  two

smaller studios and three outdoor performing spaces - will be

utilised to their fullest, to enable Singaporeans to soak  in

the  festivities and fun.  In addition, within the  Esplanade

compound,  a  performing  arts library  and  a  3-level  mall

consisting of unique restaurants and shops will be opened for

the public to explore and enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the opening programme, the Esplanade has

allocated more than 50% of its annual programming budget  for

family  and  community-based  activities,  such  as  cultural

festivals,  public education programmes, free outdoor  events

every  weekend, and annual open-house days.  The  public  can

look   forward  to  enjoying  programmes,  such   as   ethnic

festivals,  Children's  Festival and an  International  Music

series throughout the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the distinctive architecture of the Esplanade has

made it a talking point among Singaporeans.  It has even been

featured  in  cartoon  strips in  our  local  newspapers.   I

believe  that  some  Members of this  House  have  seen  this

cartoon in the Sunday Times.  Mr Fong is correct too when  he

said  that the Esplanade is iconic to Singapore.  But, beyond

being  an  icon  of our nation's support for  the  arts,  the

Esplanade  hopes to nurture and strengthen our  social  bonds

and  ties  through a shared interest in the arts.  And,  with

the support of the promotional agencies, such as STB, NAC and

EDB, it will strive to enhance both her image and Singapore's

overseas.  In short, the Esplanade will have a heart close to

its community but it will be known throughout the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade is an entity of public character.

Similar to many performing arts centres around the world, the

Esplanade  will not make direct profits from the  very  broad

and  diverse  arts  programming it will undertake.   But  the

benefits  and  viability  of  the  Esplanade  should  not  be

measured  solely on direct economic terms as it  brings  many

indirect   and  intangible  benefits.   The  Esplanade   will

increase   the   vibrancy  and  creativity   of   our   local

environment,  enhance our attractiveness  to  global  talent,

encourage more creative and imaginative thoughts, and help to

strengthen  our  relationships and  ties,  both  locally  and

overseas.    The   corporate   world   can   also   integrate

performances  at the Esplanade into their client relationship

development   programmes.   This,  in  turn,   sharpens   our

competitive  edge.   The  Esplanade should  be  viewed  as  a

competitive tool for Singapore therefore, and it is important

that we support the growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question by Mr Fong whether we can sustain

this  effort,  I  say  it would be a  big  challenge  to  the

management   of   the   Esplanade  as  well   as   ourselves,

Singaporeans.  How much will it cost?  It will  cost  a  lot.

But this is something that we can be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the Old Parliament House, Mr

Zainudin  Nordin  felt that the conversion of  the  Singapore

Arts  Museum  should  bear its value  to  the  community.   I

totally  agree with him.  We should also value the fact  that

the  Old Parliament House is an important historical building

to  Singaporeans.  So far, the model that we  build  will  be

based on the museums that we have earlier developed, eg,  the

SJI, which have been successful in drawing in both local  and

tourist  visitors.  He may be glad to know  that  the  annual

visitorship  to  the  SAM between 1996  and  2001  was  about

151,541  and that 30% of the total visitors were tourists  to

the  Singapore  Arts Museum.  So, because of  the  attraction

that  Singapore Arts Museum has, the model that  we  plan  to

have  for  the Old Parliament House will also be  along  that

line.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical significance of the former Parliament

House  would indeed be preserved.  This will be done  through

the conversion of the building into a multi-disciplinary arts

and  heritage  centre.   A display along  the  walls  of  the

corridors  of  the constitutional history of Singapore  would

highlight   the  building's  significance  in  our   history.

Artefacts and plaques indicating important rooms of  the  Old

Parliament  House  will  also  be  displayed  throughout  the

building.  The draw of allowing Singaporeans a peek into  the

building  where  Parliament was once held will  attract  both

local and foreign visitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House will be interested to know

that  the Parliament Chamber will now be reused as a  Concert

Chamber.   The  former  library  will  be  converted  into  a

blackbox  theatre meant for use as a performing venue,  while

the  Committee  Room will be used as an art  gallery.   Other

proposed facilities include a film theatrette, rehearsal  and

meeting rooms, restaurants with riverview and alfresco dining

facilities.   These will transform the Old  Parliament  House

into an arts venue with events all year round.  Together with

Victoria  Theatre,  Victoria  Concert  Hall,  the  new  Asian

Civilisations Museum at Empress Place and this new Parliament

Building, the Old Parliament House development will help make

the  entire  area  an arts and cultural hub that  speaks  for

Singapore's present and past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Straits Times report yesterday mentioned the

discovery of four ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yatiman, we have five minutes to

"guillotine" time actually.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Let me conclude by saying that

while we put the former Parliament House to new use, we  will

also  highlight  its past role in relation to our  nationhood

and  constitutional history, and also the ancient history  of

its  vicinity as revealed from the archaelogical exploration,

as carried in the Straits Times a few days ago.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh Meng See, we have five minutes

before "guillotine" time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QI 5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising the subject of the Malay Heritage

Centre  because I believe it should not be just a centre  for

the  Malay  community.  It should be a national  project.   I

recall the failure of the Malay Village in Geylang Serai some

years  ago.   It is important that we make it a success  this

time.   If  we  are  ambitious enough, we should  make  it  a

regional  centre for Malay heritage.  So I just want  to  ask

the  Minister what plans we have to make it lively  not  only

for the centre but also the surrounding areas, the programmes

and activities, and for public education as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, heritage should be

everyone's  hub,  especially for a  country  as  economically

successful, global and cosmopolitan as Singapore.   Singapore

should be proud to have a Malay Heritage Centre to complement

that  of  the Indian and Chinese.  It is after all a national

heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just go to the question, Sir. Could MITA share

its  thinking on the project and explain how it assesses  the

progress  made  and  its  direction?   How  will  a  National

Heritage  Board  and other related agencies  under  MITA  and

Government  agencies like URA, Land Office and STB  help  the

MHFC make the project viable and a success?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the

development  of museums, MITA has done well. We have  now  15

heritage  and  arts museums. To create museum  going  culture

among  Singaporeans, MITA has even gone further by organising

a MuseumFest at Suntec city to attract the shoppers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, Singaporeans prefer shopping than visiting

museums. Thus,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



MITA has moved the museums to the shopping centre. This is  a

right strategy. Sad to say, if we ask Singaporeans to name 10

shopping  centres, many can name them without much difficulty

whereas many could not name even a few museums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides focusing on local Singaporeans, I felt that we

should  also  focus  on  the  7 million  tourists  who  visit

Singapore  annually  now  that  we  treat  Arts  spending  as

investment which could also create economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we categorise the 15 museums into a few

groups  and actively promote the different groups  of  museum

among different target audience: certain kind of museums  may

be  of  interest  to  the Japanese tourists,  others  to  the

interest  of the Europeans and some to the Chinese  tourists.

The  pamphlets can be printed in the languages of the  target

groups and be distributed at MRT stations, hotels and tourist

resorts.  Many other countries have done this and  have  seen

the results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can be creative, innovative and flexible in the

promotion and operation of museums, I believe, in the  longer

term, we can attract more Singaporeans as well as tourists to

our museums.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, time is running short. I

would  like to thank Mr Zainul Abidin and Mr Loh for  raising

the  important issue of the Malay Heritage Centre at  Kampong

Glam.  I would like to report that it is progressing well and

that it is expected to be completed in the year 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what is being done to enhance the Centre, I would

say  that  an  urban planning consultant was appointed,  with

financial  support  from  the  Singapore  Tourism  Board,  to

conduct  a consultancy study and development, and there  have

been some recommendations and some ideas have been thrown up.

First,  they  are talking about pedestrianisation  of  Sultan

Gate  leading to the Malay Heritage Centre; second, they  are

drawing  a  demarcation line in Kampong Glam  into  a  cross-section, the Green Fingers, Commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>



Spine,  etc;  third, to close Kandahar Street temporarily  on

weekends  and  turn  it  into  a  food  centre.   With  these

measures, we will be able to make Kampong Glam Malay Heritage

Centre a very attractive place for people to visit, shop  and

participate in the activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong suggested that we should open the

museums  on  Mondays.  Currently, the museums are  closed  on

Mondays to enable the maintenance of gallery items on display

and  to  ensure that the museums are clean and well kept  for

visitors in the week ahead.  At present, our National  Museum

stays  open until 9.00 pm on Fridays, and if a public holiday

falls  on a Monday, with the exception of May Day, they would

be open to the public.  Mr Seng suggested that we should also

open on Mondays.  Even though it is an international practice

for  the museums to be closed on Mondays, I am happy  to  say

that  MITA  is glad to accept Mr Seng's challenge for  us  to

dare to be different, and we will try to open the museums  on

Mondays on a trial basis and we will assess public reaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meritocracy is a principle embraced by Singaporeans. It

is  a  principle  that  has  served  us  well  and  is  often

attributed  as  the underlying reason for our competitiveness

and rapid progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that every Singaporean, regardless of

how humble his or her family background, can succeed, and  we

often  read  of students from poor families doing brilliantly

in  their  studies and succeeding in life. There are  several

common examples here in this House.  It is also true that low-skilled  workers  can get ahead if they were  to  work  hard,

upgrade  their  skills and are prepared to undergo  life-long

learning.  We  must continue to encourage  and  motivate  all

Singaporeans  to  give of their best,  and  not  to  look  to

welfarism  as  a  viable alternative.  But our  policy-makers

must  realise that there will always be the bottom 5-7%,  who

despite their best efforts, will not be able to keep up  with

the rest.  If Singaporeans are to bond as a cohesive society,

meritocracy and competitiveness alone will not enable  us  to

achieve   this  objective.   It  has  to  be  tempered   with

compassion for others, other than ourselves and our immediate

family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Singaporeans have to be personally responsible

for their own welfare, the aged, the disabled and those less-gifted  must  never  be  made  to  feel  disenfranchised  and

neglected.    In  a  society  built  on  meritocracy,   equal

opportunities lead to unequal outcomes.  Those who lag behind

may feel demoralised and resent the success of others.  Those

who  succeed  may feel less obligated to help anyone.   After

all,  did  we not, wittingly or unwittingly, imbibe  in  them

that  in  meritocracy whatever success that  is  achieved  is

based entirely on one's own effort and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>



merit?   Could  we  always depend on the  more  able  in  the

community to support the less fortunate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's social welfare system has largely been based

on  the  family and extended family support.  This has served

us  well  in the past, when families were large and  extended

families  living  together  quite  common.   But  times  have

changed.  Families are smaller, nuclear families common,  and

being  single is no longer unusual.  There are also prominent

examples in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, working with the community, must find

ways to create adequate social safety nets for those who  are

unable  to  keep  up, despite their best efforts,  but  in  a

manner  not  to  destroy  the sense  of  self-worth,  or  the

incentive for them to give of their best, however humble that

may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell the House what social safety

nets  have  been put in place and the strategies  adopted  by

MCDS  to  assist  low-income families, the disabled  and  the

disadvantaged  to cope with the changed social  and  economic

environment,  and  the  measures to  assist  them  and  their

children to improve the situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the recent recessionary effect of

the  economy  is affecting the lives of many Singaporeans  in

more  ways  than  one.  To begin with,  there  are  now  more

Singaporeans  who  are  unemployed,  and  who  may   not   be

employable since for many of them, the restructuring  of  our

economy has resulted in many of the lower-skilled jobs  being

made permanently redundant.  Unemployment is more than 4% and

rising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that for the unemployed and the needy families in

Singapore,  we  have many public assistance schemes  to  help

them.    To   mention  a  few,  the  CDCs  provide  financial

assistance, utility grants and food allowances for  a  period

of  time.  There  are also a number of those  who  are  given

public  assistance that is worked out based on the number  of

persons in the family. The question really is, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



which  has  always been the subject of much  debate  in  this

House,  how much help should we give before one can  in  true

conscience say that enough has been given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we are not a welfare state and that the

underlying concern about welfare assistance is a loss of  the

work  ethic  if  public assistance is so  readily  available.

Sir,  I agree that we must not provide help to such an extent

that  people lose their willingness and desire to work.  Yet,

we  cannot  say,  at  the  same  time,  that  those  who  are

unemployed  are not willing to work.  There are many  in  our

society,  who  through no fault of their own, are  without  a

job,  or  are  without a job because they are  either  single

parents  or are medically unfit.  And for many of them,  they

often  have  young  families. Sadly, Sir,  it  is  often  the

children who suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we talk about building a compassionate society and

asking  Singaporeans to give up their lives for the  country,

if  necessary.   For  many Singaporeans who  are  desperately

struggling, the call to put the country before self,  somehow

rings hollow if the perception exists that the Government  is

not prepared to do more if it is able to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we and should we do more to help these people? Yes,

I  say  we should. My point is, just because there are people

who  may potentially abuse the system, does not mean that  we

should not do more to help the genuine poor.  For a start,  I

think  we should ensure that all Singaporeans should at least

be assured of a minimum standard of living, and this standard

should move with the changing standards over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should set up some kind of unemployment

insurance  or  fund  to help families ease into  unemployment

slowly and cope with the trauma that comes with unemployment.

Of  course,  such assistance should not be given at  a  level

that is a substitute for the full income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, families of public assistance should not be

made to feel like they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



beggars  in our society.  They should be counselled regularly

by  social  workers to ensure that every cent  that  will  be

given will be usefully spent for the benefit of the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will comment on the above proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, when our

economy   went  into  recession  last  year,  the  Government

introduced  the  Economic Downturn Relief  Scheme  (EDRS)  to

provide  short-term help to those affected by the  recession.

Now  the economy is showing signs of recovery.  I assume that

at  some  point in time, when the Government is certain  that

the  economy is out of the woods, the EDRS will be  suspended

or terminated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that the EDRS should not be a permanent

feature,  I  would like to highlight three areas of  possible

problems in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, improvement in the job market usually lags

behind economic recovery.  Even when our economy recovers, it

will  take time for employers to regain confidence and  start

recruiting again.  It will also take time for new investments

to  come  in  to create new jobs.  Therefore, we need  to  be

prepared  that  the job market will take  a  longer  time  to

improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while the economy may have recovered and the

job market improved, there may still be segments of residents

who  are unable to find a suitable job, or may need more time

to  find  one  because of skills mismatch.  They  may  remain

unemployed for a while more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, economic restructuring is likely to be a

permanent  feature in our economy.  This is  because  of  the

fast-changing world we are in today. People are  expected  to

be  in and out of jobs as the industries they are working  in

restructure  themselves.  This is unavoidable,  but  it  does

mean  that there will always be a good number of workers  who

may be temporarily out of job.  Some of them may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>



be  financially  stretched, especially those who  have  heavy

commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we phase out the EDRS when the economy recovers,

I   would   like  to  appeal  to  the  Ministry  to  consider

introducing  some  kind of Economic Restructuring  Assistance

Scheme (ERAS) to help these three categories of people.   The

ERAS can be similar to the EDRS in that it is short-term  and

limited  in  dollar value, so as not to create  a  dependency

mentality.   But it is discretionary and simple  to  operate,

therefore,  we  can  respond  rapidly.   It  has  a  specific

objective of helping those who lost their job as a result  of

economic  restructuring, and yet unable to qualify under  the

usual  public assistance schemes.  The Ministry could perhaps

consider  expanding the Interim Financial  Assistance  Scheme

for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the ERAS may even take the form of a

short-term interest free loan which the recipient has to  pay

back  over  time  after he has found  a  job.   Under  normal

circumstances,  he  would  find  it  difficult  to   take   a

commercial  loan as he is unemployed. With a short-term  loan

provided  by the Government, he can avoid having to sell  his

house and risk breaking up the family just because of a short-term cash flow problem.  As the loan needs to be repaid,  the

temptation  for abuse is drastically reduced  and  those  who

apply  for  it  are likely to be those who are  genuinely  in

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consider

my  suggestion  to  put  in place an  Economic  Restructuring

Assistance Scheme, either as a form of short-term grant or  a

short-term   loan,  to  help  those  affected   by   economic

restructuring in future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> The current

economic downtown has seen many Singaporeans affected  either

directly  or  indirectly.  I have spoken earlier  during  the

general  debate  of an increasing number of Singaporeans  who

are financially trapped with mountains of bills to settle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our approach to welfare has been guarded and indeed

cautious.  It should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  stay  that way.  We have  to  ensure  that  any

financial  assistance scheme implemented does  not  create  a

disincentive to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the role of administering financial assistance

programmes has now been delegated to the CDCs.  It has been a

year  since  the  CDCs took over this role  and  somehow,  it

coincides  with  the onset of the economic crisis.   I  would

like  to ask the Minister to give an update on two groups  of

people who have come to the CDCs for financial assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first group are the retrenched workers. Sir, the

EDRS  was  introduced  as part of the off-Budget  package  to

assist  Singaporeans who were retrenched.  Can  the  Minister

share  with  the House how many families have  been  assisted

through  the  EDRS  scheme?   How long  has  assistance  been

provided?  What proportion of these recipients return to  the

CDCs for further assistance?  That is, what is the proportion

of those who are still in need of assistance at this time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group are the non-retrenched workers. These

are  the people who are not eligible under the EDRS.  Can the

CDCs  also administer the other financial assistance  schemes

to  assist their respective residents?  Since taking over the

role from MCDS over the past one year, can the Minister share

with  the  House  the effectiveness of CDCs in  administering

these  programmes?  What is the turnaround time for  each  of

the  case,  that  is  from the time the  case  comes  to  the

attention  of the CDC to the time that the case receives  the

financial assistance?  How has this differed  from  the  time

these schemes were  administered centrally by MCDS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also share with the House how many

individuals  have  come to seek financial  help,  other  than

EDRS,  at  the CDCs in the last one year?  How many of  these

cases  were  successful in their applications, and  how  many

were   not  successful?   What  are  the  social  demographic

profiles of these families who have come to seek help?   What

is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>



proportion of those who have returned for more assistance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that providing financial assistance to these

families  will  only address the symptom.   There  are  other

underlying  problems  that  often  accompany  the   financial

problems. The provision of financial assistance should  be  a

means  to  an end rather than an end in itself.  To do  this,

however,    requires   closer   caseload    management    and

intervention.   In  this  regard, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister what is the average caseload of each worker  in  the

CDCs with regard to financial assistance cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence indicates that the caseload for each

CDC's  staff is very high.  If this is so, how can  the  CDCs

ensure  that  their  staff are effective  in  doing  caseload

management   and   intervention,  thus  ensuring   that   the

underlying problems are addressed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs are not the only organisations who provide

financial  assistance to needy Singaporeans.   Indeed,  there

are  many VWOs out there who provide financial assistance  to

these  families  also. While we pride ourselves  in  ensuring

that  our  financial assistance programmes do  not  create  a

disincentive  to  work, the availability  of  many  financial

support providers may create a buffet syndrome, resulting  in

what social workers call the "professional cryer", one who is

able  to  move  from one organisation to another  in  seeking

help.  May I ask the Minister what efforts are being done  to

ensure that this does not happen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the general debate on the Budget Statement,

I   shared  observations  that  many  families  are   feeling

financially trapped with arrears quickly accumulating as  the

days   go   by.   My  understanding  is  that  the  financial

assistance  provided  by  the CDCs  will  only  assist  these

families  in  the short-term, and will not be  sufficient  in

helping  them settle their arrears.  I would like to  ask  if

MCDS  shares this same observation and, if so, how does  MCDS

hope  to  assist  these  families  overcome  their  financial

predicament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, what I

wanted  to  say have been succinctly put forth by  those  who

have spoken before me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo is not here. Mrs Yu-Foo.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Sir, I think the best

safety  net is the family.  Families are the building  blocks

of  society.  The families act as the first line of care  and

support for an individual, especially during uncertain times.

There  are signs that the family values may slowly be eroded.

For example, divorce rates have been rising, singlehood rates

have been rising too, while fertility rates have fallen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus our attention on economic uncertainties

and  restructuring, we should not lose sight of the value  of

the  family.   Our  Prime Minister has  identified  declining

fertility  as  one  of  the key challenges  for  our  future.

Despite  generous tax incentives, the Baby  Bonus  and  other

measures, the number of births has remained low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the young professionals, men and women,

told  me  that they are so busy with their work that they  do

not  have the time to socialise, meet new friends and find  a

partner.   And  they  are giving up the  search  for  a  life

partner even when they are in their early 30s.  Perhaps it is

time  for  MCDS to consider privatising the SDU and  SDS  and

allow  the  private sector to manage these functions.   Maybe

they are more imaginative in this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Education Committee (PEC) on the Family,

after  consultation with people from all sectors of  society,

have come up with 70 recommendations, which include balancing

the  work  life  and  family life, family  support  services,

narrowing the gap between men and women in their expectations

of   life  and  marriage,  and  fostering  a  family-friendly

society.  Can the Minister comment on how MCDS will implement

the 70 recommendations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there might be a need to review the slogan of

procreation "Have three or more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>



if you can afford it", the reason being that it looks like no

one can afford it.  The rich cannot afford the time, the poor

cannot afford the money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister when the

Ministerial Committee on Marriage and Procreation is going to

release  its report.  Is it at the courtship stage, pregnancy

stage, or going to be delivered soon?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in Denmark and Norway, the fertility

rate  is  quite  good.  This is because of extensive  support

from the Government, such as childcare, nanny-care, financial

support,   and  so  on.   Would  the  Government  look   into

implementing some of these schemes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch on abortion. There are about

14,000  abortions here a year, and about 60% of them  are  by

married  women.  Sir, I am not against abortion.   There  are

many reasons for abortion.  According to feedback, women  opt

for  abortion because of medical reasons, forced pregnancies,

financial     difficulties,    alternative     contraception,

immaturity,  fear  of  losing out on  promotion,  out-station

postings, studies, or the inability to get a flat.  Abortion,

however,  is  a highly personal decision and it is  difficult

for  the  Government to interfere.  But, in some  cases,  the

mother might want to keep the baby for adoption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, abortion counselling would need to be strengthened.

Mandatory   counselling  should  be   done   by   independent

counsellors  and  not by the clinic itself,  as  there  is  a

conflict   of  interest.   Mandatory  conselling  should   be

extended  to the family as well.  There should also  be  more

joint  efforts  by MCDS and VWOs to support  distress  cases.

Sir, a life saved is one more Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an important question I wish to ask.

Procreation is the responsibility of the individual  and  the

family.    How   far   should  the  state   share   in   this

responsibility?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, as Mrs Yu-Foo had mentioned, family is the basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>



building  block of our society, and I think many people  know

that  it  is also one of our five shared values.  On this,  I

believe,  there  is no disagreement.  However,  not  everyone

found family life to be a job.  Some said that it is becoming

more  stressful, and there are many reasons why some families

felt  stressed,  and  some failed, resulting  in  abuses  and

divorce, and we all know that the children also suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons are, I believe one way to handle

the  situation is to see how the problems could  be  reduced.

In this respect, Sir, I think our people need to be assisted,

and  be better prepared for the role in the family.  In  this

respect,  Sir, I must stress that we should not  assume  that

every  child will grow up and will automatically be  able  to

know  how  to become a husband or a wife one day,  and  maybe

later  on a father and a mother.  They need something.   They

need  to be prepared.  They need to know.  And, even if  many

people  claim  that  they are able to cope  without  anyone's

guidance,  or on their own through reading and  all  that,  I

think more should be done to help our people.  And, with some

help,  I  believe those who can cope can manage even  better.

Those  who are facing problems would at least be in the  know

of how to manage and to minimise their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, starting a family and managing it is not a new

human  enterprise.  We have been doing it  for  thousands  of

years.   And  after  being in this for so long,  I  think  we

should have grown smarter from all our past experiences.  And

this  is why, and this is also where, I believe, we could  do

more.  We need to share more information on family life  with

our  young.  I am not just referring to the importance of the

family,  but also to increase their appreciation of  starting

one,  and managing it as well as they could.  For in the end,

how  well one manages his or her own family has a lot  to  do

with the future of our people and our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see that the Ministry of Community Development

and  Sports  has  drawn  up  many  programmes  pertaining  to

marriage and the family.  However, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>



I  notice  that  they  are almost entirely  targeted  at  our

adults.   My  question is:  is it not a little  too  late  to

target  grown-ups in trying to achieve the Ministry's desired

outcome  of  cultivating positive attitudes  about  marriage,

about  family and about parenthood?  In this respect I  would

like  to  see  more efforts being done to target our  youths,

even as early as when they are in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can reach them younger and help more of them

to  be better informed on family matters, I think by the time

they  grow up they could be in a better position to set up  a

strong  and stable family.  And this is one of the Ministry's

mission statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the best is for MCDS to work with the Ministry

of  Education and try to come up with a programme that  could

assist  our young to better understand and appreciate  family

life.    In  our  schools  today,  for  example,  there   are

programmes like Home Economics and Sexuality.  I think  these

programmes,  combined with many other family life  activities

currently  promoted  by  the MCDS separately,  could  be  put

together  to  become  something new, something  like  a  non-examinable  subject  that  could  be  taught  at  the   upper

secondary level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea is to have our young people understand and

appreciate  the core areas of family values.   In  this  way,

they  are  more  likely  to grow up with  greater  awareness.

Anyway, with such knowledge the children could also be a more

positive  helping hand in their own families while  they  are

still growing up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone, for example, needs to study English,

Mathematics and Science, and other subjects from a very young

age  in  order to prepare them for their working  life.   And

once  they have a good job, they can continue to improve  and

upgrade  their skills, and in these areas, I believe we  have

done  a  good job.  But, I think there is a case to  consider

teaching  our young, or at least sharing with them, the  core

values  about  family  life, so that  they  are  also  better

prepared  for  it when the time comes.  And in  this  way  we

would stand a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>



better chance to have a good career and a joyful family life.

And  they could upgrade their knowledge on both aspects, from

time  to  time.  But, by then they should have a  good  basic

understanding about family life.  And even for those who  did

not  do  well  in their career, they could at  least  try  to

achieve  a good and happy family life by making good  use  of

the  lessons  about family life that they have learned  while

they were still young, or from a young age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to be of help is to try to get every

aspiring  couple to attend some marriage preparatory  course.

I think not everyone has the time and the ability to think of

all  potential challenges that one is likely  to  face  in  a

marriage,  or  to think of so many ways to make the  marriage

work  even  better for the family.  Sir, such  courses  could

assist  many  people to be able to think and look  ahead,  to

foresee the challenges and to be prepared when it comes.  And

they  could even use the knowledge to avoid certain pitfalls.

This  is  where I believe past experiences that  many  others

have gone through could be of help to new couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I add that the more happy families

that  we  can help to create the better it is for our society

and  our  future.   Sir, I sincerely hope that  the  Minister

could  look into some of my concerns and to find ways to  get

family  life  education included in a more comprehensive  and

digestible way in our schools or to have some programmes  for

those who plan to get married.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman :</b> Mr Chairman, one of the

tenets  of S21 is strong families.  We have often heard  that

the  family is the building block of our society.  As the key

social  institution, we will continue to strive to  keep  our

family strong.  It is this importance that has been placed on

the family that I am raising this cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not clear, if we do indeed have a family policy.

My  understanding is that we do have policies that affect the

family, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>



the form of housing, healthcare, employment and, even perhaps

education.   But,  do we actually have a family  policy  that

systematically  attempts to put forth  the  interest  of  the

Singapore family?  I would appreciate it if the Minister  can

enlighten the House on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the marriage and divorce statistics, as mentioned

by  Mrs  Yu-Foo,  do  not  reflect a healthy  trend  for  the

Singapore family.  In 1999, there were 14 divorces for  every

100  marriages.  In the year 2000, there were 23 divorces for

every  100  marriages.   In  terms of  actual  numbers,  Sir,

between  1999  and  the year 2000, the  number  of  marriages

dropped  by 7%, but the number of divorces increased by  57%.

These   statistics,  compared  with  the  much  talked  about

decreasing  birthrate and ageing society, raise questions  on

the strength of the Singapore family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there fewer marriages, but more divorces? Other

indicators  of  our  families  being  stressed  include   the

incidences of domestic violence and juvenile delinquency.   I

would like to ask the Minister the following questions:  What

are  the  programmes that MCDS has developed in strengthening

the  family?   What  are  the  outcome  indicators  of  these

programmes, ie, are these programmes effective?  How does the

Ministry  define  a strong family?  Are our families  getting

stronger  or  weaker?   How do we know  that  we  are  indeed

strengthening our families?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have argued elsewhere that to understand the

developments of families, we need to appreciate the  changing

societal   trends.    The   increase   in   the   educational

qualification  of  women, in my opinion,  has  a  significant

influence in understanding the state of the Singapore family.

I  believe that the role within the family must change,  from

one  that is clearly defined along gender lines, to one  that

is complementary in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with women making up half of the workforce, and

dual   income  families  being  the  norm  rather  than   the

exception,  it is imperative that we recognise the  need  for

complementarity of roles between men and women  in  families.

Sir, while we do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>



not  deny the Asian value that men are seen as being the head

of  the  household, we also cannot deny the  contribution  of

women  in the family's economy.  It is impractical to  expect

women  to  go  out to work, to supplement the income  of  her

husband, and contribute to the country's economy but, at  the

same  time,  to  expect  them to continue  to  perform  their

traditional roles of mother and homemakers.  While the  women

are  doing  their part to supplement the men's  role  in  the

economic sphere, men must also reciprocate and do their  part

in supplementing the women's role in the domestic sphere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe strongly that MCDS should focus its

programmes   on   promoting   strong   families,    on    the

complementarity of roles between men and women in the family.

Men  can,  and should be encouraged, to be nurturing  fathers

and  domesticated  husbands.    Their  roles  should  not  be

confined  to merely being the breadwinner and disciplinarian.

The  wives  will certainly appreciate their partners  sharing

the responsibility of building this strong family.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have always believed that dual career couples

share three jobs between two people, that is, two careers and

the  maintenance  of a home.  Indeed, we should  continue  to

promote  this  and,  I  am sure, it will  contribute  towards

increasing our fertility rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note MCDS' support on the role of fathers.

But, Sir, I think we need to do more.  We need to address the

issues  that men face in families.  As we encourage  them  to

perform  non-traditional roles, I encourage MCDS  to  develop

more  programmes that will focus on the issues that men  face

as  husband, father, employee, and even son.  This in  itself

is deviating from the norm - that men do not talk about their

issues.  Sir, I have worked with men in different groups, and

I  am  confident that men do need to talk about their issues,

and  these  issues are directly related to their  ability  to

strengthen their families.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would encourage MCDS to also focus its efforts on

the  issues of socialising our children in preparing them for

adult  roles in families.  While we are socialising our girls

to  be  independent, educated and career women,  we  are  not

socialising   our  boys  to  be  domesticated  husbands   and

nurturing  fathers.  Unless they are prepared,  and  we  deal

with  this at this juncture, we will continue to see stresses

in  marriages as roles are not performed to expectations.  It

is  not  a role reversal but a complementarity of roles.   In

this  regard, I would encourage MCDS to develop a coordinated

programme  at  addressing  the socialisation  issues  of  our

children in our families.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we are living in a

fast-paced society, from third world to first world's  living

standards   in  one  generation.   Now,  with  the   economic

downturn,  families are subject to a lot of pressure  at  all

times.   Some  of the problems are stress-related,  like  job

losses,  retrenchments,  relationship  problems,  harassment,

especially  now  from  creditors  and  relatives,   divorces,

separations,   family   difficulties,   grief,   bereavement,

problems  with addictions such as alcohol,, smoking or  other

drugs,  gambling,  unwanted pregnancies  and  other  personal

worries or life stresses, and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two statistics reflect some of the problems of our

families.  The number of juvenile delinquents is high (31 per

100,000  children).   The  number  of  persons  divorced   or

separated, as what Dr Maliki has said, within the  10  years,

increases from 1.3% in 1990 to 2.5% in 2000, that is, double.

Most  of  these problems are found in dysfunctional  families

and  normal healthy families too.  With the smaller families,

family support is much reduced.  Some of these problems  must

be solved as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose a one-stop support centre in

every  constituency.   The Ministry of Community  Development

and  Sports  should make residents aware of such centres,  so

that  they  are  accessible to them.  We should  educate  the

people that these are the centres that they can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>



go  to  for  help in times of need, especially now  with  the

economic  downturn,  coupled  with  massive  job  losses.   I

propose   that   trained  and  professional  counsellors   be

allocated   to  each  constituency  centre  too.   Retrenched

workers can also be trained to assist the counsellors and run

the day-to-day operations of these centres.  This creates job

openings  for  retrenched workers too.  These centres  should

also have a 24-hour telephone counselling service, trained to

listen  first  and counsel later.  Presently, there  are  too

many  telephone numbers for people to remember when they  are

in  trouble,  and these are not reaching the  ground.   These

centres  could  also  work closely with  schools  within  the

constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs are well placed to provide these support

centres.  However, Mayors have told me that they do not  have

enough  finances.  Presently, there are only 12  CDC  service

centres,  which  are  too little, ie, one  centre  for  about

300,000  people.  Therefore, I urge the Ministry  to  support

this  one-stop  support centre, which will help  Singaporeans

cope  with  all  these  problems derived  from  dysfunctional

families   as  well  as  normal  families  in  this  economic

downturn.  As the saying goes, you shall reap what  you  sow.

And  I  would like to support my argument one more time that,

Sir,  even  our court is adopting this one-stop  approach  in

handling family cases now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, children from low-income

households  who  do  not  have  strong  family  support  home

environment  benefit the most from attending  good  childcare

and  before-and-after  school care  centres.   Unfortunately,

many  low income families may not be able to afford  to  send

their  children  to  childcare centres.  During  last  year's

Committee  of Supply's debate, I asked the then Minister  for

Community  Development  and Sports  to  consider  introducing

schemes to make it more affordable to these families to  send

their  children to good childcare centres.  I would now  like

to  ask the new Minister for Community Development and Sports

to give this House an update of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>



additional  measures  and initiatives that  were  implemented

since then, to make childcare services more affordable to low-income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us what are the measures to

increase the number of childcare centres in Singapore and the

plans  to upgrade the quality standards of childcare  givers?

Does  MCDS  have  plans  to facilitate and  improve  informal

childcare  arrangements where parents can receive  assistance

personalised  childcare arrangements,  especially  for  young

infants   too  young  for  admission  into  normal  childcare

centres?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the total fertility rate in Singapore

is  on  the  decline.   Childcare  provision  constitutes  an

important  influencing  factor  for  many  parents  to   have

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still short of childcare centres and I know MCDS'

plans  to increase childcare centres further.  A majority  of

our  young parents are from the more educated group who  want

professional  care  for  their  children.   Better  childcare

centres,  with  increased numbers of certified  professionals

and  dedicated staff, should, therefore, be planned  for  our

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS should provide childcare facilities to both the HDB

as  well as the private housing estates.  There is a need for

childcare centres to be located in areas where there is  more

demand,  such as the new densely built areas with many  young

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare centres at the workplace are convenient for

many  parents.   This  calls  for more  assistance  from  the

Government  to  encourage  employers  to  consider  providing

childcare centres at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are more childcare centres that cater to

children  below  18  months of age now,  the  fees  for  such

centres  are  very high, with the cheapest one charging  $650

after  subsidy.  Will MCDS please look into the affordability

issue  and  consider  providing  higher  subsidies  for  such

childcare centres?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that very young children fare

better  with family-based childcare.  MCDS should, therefore,

encourage  family-based  childcare, especially  for  infants.

The  ideal caregivers for infants are, of course, the parents

themselves.  However, in the context of Singapore,  immediate

family members, relatives, neighbours and even friends can be

reasonably good parent-substitutes.  The question is  whether

MCDS  could subsidise such family-based childcare in lieu  of

care  at  childcare  centres.   Granting  subsidy  here   may

encourage  suitable housewives and retirees to  work  and  to

have  income while "staying home".  These caregivers  can  be

accredited   or   monitored  and   registered   under   MCDS'

supervision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of childcare subsidy, will MCDS

consider   giving   full  childcare  subsidy   for   special-circumstance  lower-income families?  The  parents  in  these

families  need  to go out to work but do not earn  enough  to

cover childcare.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, our childcare policy

has been in place for many years.  The primary purpose is  to

facilitate  women  to  continue to remain  in  the  workforce

following  childbirth.   This  policy  has  served  us  well.

Childcare  centres  are  excellent  grounds  for  the   total

development  of  a  child physically, emotionally,  socially,

psychologically and, of course, intellectually.   Indeed,  it

is  a stimulating environment for the children.  I can attest

to  this as my children have benefited well from the exposure

to a childcare environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned about the children of low-income

families,  just like my colleague, Mr Charles  Chong.   I  am

seeing   many  of  these  families  lately,  with  heads   of

households who are not working and with minimal income coming

into  the  family.   The mothers do not  work  because  often

times,  they  have more than one to three children.   To  the

mother, the decision to work is weighed against the cost that

she  would  have  to  incur  in placing  her  children  in  a

childcare  facility.   This is a practical  consideration  as

what they can possibly earn may actually end up going to  the

childcare fees; thus, the decision to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>



stay at home and look after their children themselves.  While

this  is  a  practical  and viable  option  for  them,  I  am

concerned with the development of their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have just completed the debate on the budget for

MOE,  and  one  of the issues raised by many Members  of  the

House  is  the stress that children face in school.   Indeed,

today's  child  may not have a bright future  if  he  or  she

enters  primary school without a good foundation  during  the

pre-school  years.   I am concerned that children  from  low-income families do not have access to strong foundations, and

they  may  be  disadvantaged for life.  Yes,  there  are  the

kindergartens  that  provide pre-school education.   I  think

these    children   will   benefit   more   from   structured

developmental  programmes  that are  available  in  childcare

centres.  They need a headstart to ensure that they  will  be

on  the  same footing as the other children when  they  reach

primary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS has put in place the Centre-based Financial

Assistance  Scheme  for  Child Care (CFAC)  to  assist  these

families.   Subsidies  of up to 90% of  the  childcare  fees,

subject  to a cap of $250 per child, are provided  to  assist

these  families to place their children in childcare centres.

I  think  MCDS  recognises  that CFAC  not  only  facilitates

improvement  of  family income but provides a  headstart  for

children  of low-income families.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  what is the take-up rate of the CFAC programme  to-date,  that is, how many children are currently enjoying  the

subsidy from CFAC.  My understanding is that the take-up rate

is  rather low.  If this is so, what are the Ministry's plans

to  improve the take-up rate?  Can the Minister also  compare

this  figure  to the number of families with young  children,

who   are  receiving  financial  assistance  from  CDCs,   to

determine the extent of children from low-income families who

can benefit from the CFAC programme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my suspicion is that the low take-up rate is due,

firstly,  to  the  lack of motivation for  private  childcare

operators to facilitate this process.  For at the end of  the

day, if these parents are not able to pay the fees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>



due  after  the  subsidies, they become a  liability  to  the

childcare operators.  The administrative process must be made

as  simple as possible for the operators, to ensure that  the

scheme  reaches out to the deserving families.  Perhaps  MCDS

can encourage more voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  to

operate  childcare centres.  As often times, the fees charged

by VWO-run childcare centres are more manageable for the low-income families after receiving the subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of childcare and related to it, the

welfare and development of children, is indeed important  for

us   to   address.    Children  coming   from   disadvantaged

backgrounds  are  likely  to continue  to  be  disadvantaged,

unless  they are given an alternative environment  that  will

stimulate their intellectual and social development.   Access

to  formalised  childcare  services  not  only  benefits  the

children, it will also facilitate upgrading opportunities for

their  mothers.  The children are our future,  regardless  of

their  socio-economic  status that  their  families  are  in.

Those   who  come  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds,  indeed,

deserve  special  attention.  We  need  to  invest  in  their

development  for  us  to prevent another generation  of  low-income families to emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MCDS will look into the criteria and

administrative processes of administering the CFAC to  ensure

the  access to the scheme for children of low-income families

is further enhanced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not here. Ms Irene

Ng.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, many parents in

dual  career  families find it increasingly hard  to  combine

work  and  family  life as the pace and  complexity  of  life

increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women continue to bear the main responsibility of

childcare at home, and often need support if they are able to

have  productive and satisfying careers.  Indeed, one  reason

couples are not having more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>



babies  is because they do not feel they can cope with  their

family duties, on top of their careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flexible work arrangements are the most common way

to   help   employees   balance   their   work   and   family

responsibilities.  The experience of other countries is  that

such  work-life  programmes do help in recruitment,  increase

staff  productivity and morale, and actually  save  cost,  as

they reduce absenteeism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, in Singapore, companies have been slow to offer

flexible  work  arrangements.   Today,  only  about   3%   of

Singaporeans  are  on flexible work arrangements.   There  is

also little progress in the provision of childcare facilities

or  childcare leave for both men and women at the  workplace.

A  survey  two years ago by the Singapore National Employers'

Federation  found that three in four companies  do  not  give

their  staff  paid time-off to care for their sick  children.

And  this is despite all the work and effort by the Work-Life

Unit  set up under the Ministry.  I am sure that the Ministry

has  studied the experience of other developed countries with

more success in this area.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry has any

more plans to encourage Singapore companies to adopt flexible

work  arrangements  and  work-life programmes.   And  as  the

biggest employer in Singapore, I would urge the Government to

take  the  lead in adopting work-life strategies and flexible

work  arrangements.   In  so doing, it  should  also  take  a

realistic account of women's increased participation  in  the

labour  force  -  women  make up 54%  of  the  public  sector

workforce  as  in  the national workforce.   It  should  also

recognise  the  trend  towards a greater  sharing  of  family

responsibilities between the men and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I would urge the Government to

remove  the contradictions in its system.  If I may  cite  an

example, married women officers are allowed paid child  leave

to  look  after their sick children below six years old,  but

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>



the  male officers.  It is as if the Government believes that

it  is not the responsibility of the fathers to care for  the

children  when  they are sick.  I am sure many  fathers  will

disagree  with  this.  Another contradiction,  while  married

women  officers  are  entitled to  take  child  leave,  their

children are not entitled to medical benefits, while those of

their  male counterparts do.  I would urge the Government  to

develop  measures to enable parents, both women and  men,  to

discharge    effectively    their    working    and    family

responsibilities equally.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, like the previous

speakers  before me, I agree that the family is an  important

institution that must be cherished and protected.   The  fact

of  the  matter  though  is  that  Singaporean  families  are

undergoing  tremendous stress.  This is due to many  factors,

such  as  the  pace  of  change, rising expectations,  ageing

population   and  the  increasing  number  of   dual   income

households.  As jobs become more insecure, the role of men as

the sole breadwinners will change and more women will have to

work  to  support the family and ensure a continuous flow  of

income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, pro-family policies are important to help people

balance  work  and  family.  If we do not  put  more  serious

effort  into this, then I am afraid that something will  have

to  give, and it will be the family.  The demarcation between

home  and  work is artificial, as one affects the other.   An

unhappy  worker  is  likely  to be  an  unhappy  family  man.

Likewise,  an unhappy family man is likely to be  an  unhappy

worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that have implemented work-life programmes

have  found  that their employees perform better and  produce

higher quality work.  Work-life programmes are common in many

developed   countries.   Many  of  them  have  also   adopted

legislation   to   promote  work-life  balance.    Our   male

parliamentarians may be heartened to note that many countries

in  Europe  today  mandate the provision of paternity  leave.

Paid  paternity leave ranging from three days to  four  weeks

are  provided  in Denmark, Finland, Belgium, France,  Norway,

Portugal and Sweden.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>



do  not know whether our male parliamentarians and other male

workers outside will be so fortunate, but at least these  are

some of the developments in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the Ministry has embarked on many

efforts  to  promote and strengthen the family and  help  the

workers  balance  work and family.  Unfortunately,  employers

here  have been sluggish and slow to respond.  Flexible  work

arrangements  for women who cannot work full time,  or  fixed

work  patterns, are uncommon.  Despite the fact that we  have

one  of  the  highest percentage of Internet users  in  Asia,

telework has not caught on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many working people continue to struggle between caring

for  the needs of children and aged parents and keeping their

jobs.  Often when they have to tend to family needs, it  will

be  at  the expense of their jobs as employers view  them  as

unproductive.  I recall the case of a worker, a man, who told

me  that, every morning, before he comes to work, he  has  to

help  his  wife bathe his bedridden mother.  As a result,  he

often  ends up late for work and he receives warning letters.

So  people  are caught in this kind of situation  because  of

their family needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to ask the Minister the

following  questions:  How effective is the Ministry  in  its

efforts  to promote work-life programmes?  What more  can  be

done  to  educate  and  change employers'  attitudes  towards

workers with family responsibilities?  And finally, will  the

Minister consider recommending changes to our law to  provide

for big family care leave which can be used by the worker  to

take care of a sick or disabled family member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, juvenile delinquency

continues  to  be  a prevalent problem and  I  note  that  an

increasing  number  of  young  delinquents  are   placed   in

institutions  for rehabilitation.  Solving this will  require

multi-partite involvement, such as stronger family and school

support,  the  Police  and  community  organisations  working

together.  But my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>



concern right now is what is being done to ensure that  these

young  offenders  are  not being influenced  and  emotionally

damaged by more seasoned and hardcore delinquents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a recognised fact that there is a need to

implement  rehabilitation.   But  we  must  ensure  that  the

situation  with these young offenders are not made worse  and

that  they be given a second chance to redeem themselves  and

become normal individuals when they are discharged.  I  would

appreciate it if the Minister could provide an insight as  to

what  measures  are  taken  to shield  young  offenders  from

incorrigible  ones, and what his Ministry is  also  doing  in

post-rehabilitative measures to prevent the relapse of  these

individuals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore's population will age

rapidly  over  the  next  30 years.   From  just  7%  of  the

population  aged 65 years and above in 1999  to  19%  of  the

population  by 2030, that is, almost one in five Singaporeans

will  be 65 years, or above, by then.  The sheer increase  in

the number of elderly will create added challenges on society

and  more  stress on families.  The support through  services

for the elderly will therefore become more and more critical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the Ageing

Population was formed in 1998 to lead a coordinated  national

response to address the challenges of the elderly.   The  IMC

has  finalised  its  recommendations after receiving  reports

from  the six committees in November 1999.  And in June 1999,

a  Services  Review Committee was set up to  review  existing

elder  care provision and delivery and to develop a blueprint

for   elder  care  services.   The  blueprint  also  includes

strategies and plans designed to achieve the desired outcomes

formulated by the IMC.  Could the Minister give the House  an

update on the progress made in the implementation of the  IMC

recommendations, details of the recommendations that have yet

to  be  implemented  and  those  that  have  been  found  not

feasible?   And  are  there any plans to  expand  elder  care

services to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>



families  to  continue taking care of their elderly  members,

rather than to depend solely on institutionalised care?

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the elderly have the

highest  rate  of suicide among all age groups in  Singapore.

The  rate of suicide is increasing, as more people live  past

the age of 75.  Singles are the most vulnerable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the elderly in Singapore face the prospect of

isolation and loneliness in this fast moving society.  First,

there  is the trend of the younger generation wanting greater

independence and privacy.  They prefer to live on their  own,

away  from  their aged parents.  Indeed, in the last  decade,

the fastest growing type of living arrangement for old people

was  that  of living alone, or with their spouse  only,  away

from their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And second, the increasing number of singles means that

Singapore will see more elderly singles living alone  in  the

future.   Already,  we can see the trend  towards  one-person

households.   The  percentage of one-person  households  rose

from  5.2%  in  1990 to 8.2% in 2000, with singles  who  have

never  been married before making up more than half  of  such

households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have a whole generation of young

people  who  are  growing up without much  contact  with  the

elderly  in  their daily lives.  Often, their caregivers  are

foreign maids.  This is a society that celebrates youth,  the

creators  of  today's fast-changing technology  and  who  are

plugged  into the globalised world.  They have little  regard

for  the wisdom passed down through generations.  In  such  a

society, the elderly face the risk of feeling useless to this

society and that life is meaningless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put these trends together and you will see a society

suffering from the effects of an age divide.  It also  points

to  a  fraying  social  compact, with  the  expectations  and

obligations  of  the  different generations  to  support  and

nurture each other becoming more and more unclear.  If we  do

not bridge this age divide, but instead enlarge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>



it by policies and approaches which encourage age segregation

and  bias  against the elderly, we will only breed a  younger

generation  who has little understanding and  value  for  the

experience and wisdom that comes with age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pressing need to bring the generations

together, through inter-generational strategies.  This  means

engaging the young and old in cross-age activities where both

are  valued  as  active and contributing members.   The  more

common  approach  in  Singapore today  is  to  cater  to  the

different  groups separately, with programmes  organised  for

senior  citizens as a group and the young as  another  group.

This will segregate them further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to take a more inter-generational approach in framing public policy for the youth

and  the elderly.  Today, more than ever, there is a need  to

take  an  inter-generational perspective to  create  policies

that unite, and not separate the generations.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, as we figure how to best prepare for

the  demands of our fast ageing population, half  the  battle

would  have been won if we could influence Singaporeans  with

the  correct mindset.  Positive attitudes towards ageing  and

the aged should be actively promoted.  A mindset change needs

time and a lot of effort to nurture, and I would like MCDS to

prioritise and enable us to achieve the desired outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people should be regarded as useful citizens whose

wisdom, skill and talent are valuable resources.  The society

will  benefit  if  we  tap these resources  for  as  long  as

possible.   The  elderly should not be  perceived  merely  as

potential  socio-economic problems.  Not all old  people  are

senile,  moody  and weak.  We need to have our citizens  move

away from wrong impressions and treat growing old with dread.

We  need  to  show  our  people that  ageing  is  not  always

associated with disability, and that disability in old age is

often  due to disease, which, if treated early, may not  give

rise  to  disability.  An ageing society can still be  active

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>



vibrant.   Octogenarians will be common and, in  no  time  at

all, many of us in this House will join their ranks.  I would

not  like  to think then that all octogenarians are decrepit,

depressed or demented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us promote "A time to begin a new chapter in life by

being  active  and  involved:  starting  new  activities  and

setting  new  goals"  as  our  mindset  towards  ageing   and

retirement.  Sir, older people can indeed approach ageing and

retirement in new and exciting ways and MCDS can do  much  to

help them realise that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey of 803 American men and women aged 50 to 75

has  found  that 40% are working or plan to work  after  they

retire,  while an equal percentage do or plan to do volunteer

work.  MCDS should be encouraging and facilitating this  type

of  attitude  by  increasing the avenues for Singaporeans  to

remain at work and to do volunteer work.  Although we have  a

higher  unemployment rate now because of our recent  economic

recession,  we  should  have  a long-term  view  and  not  be

deterred.  Matching the seniors to further training or to job

placements  can also be enhanced.  People are tending  to  be

healthier and are going to live longer.  As we plan,  we  may

need  to  turn full circle and adopt policies and programmes,

provide  retraining opportunities, offer flexible work  hours

and encourage those who want to stay on the job to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a large and increasing pool of volunteers

to  tap from among the older Singaporeans.  Training them  to

be  competent in different areas of our needs will give  them

recognition  and worth.  The volunteers should be  recognised

for  their  work and it would be good if they  can  get  some

privileged  or subsidised care when, in turn, they themselves

need community services.  They should also be reimbursed  for

transportation and minor costs of incidentals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>



population will be 65 and above.  That will give  rise  to  a

lot  of  social  and national problems.  This very  important

problem  must  be  jointly resolved by  the  Government,  the

family and society, and we should prepare well in advance and

reduce all the impact that may be brought about by the  aging

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government has introduced a lot of

new  measures to look after our senior citizens  and  it  has

been  praised by many senior citizens.    What I am concerned

with  is  how  to give more care and concern to these  senior

citizens.  In Singapore, most families are small and, most of

the  time, only an aged mother or father is staying at  home.

If  they cannot do any work, at the most they will go to  the

void deck to kill time.  They feel very lonely and isolated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suggestion. Maybe, in our community centres or

in  the  old schools in our constituencies, we can set  up  a

Community Senior Citizens' Institute so that we can make  use

of  the  facilities at our community centres to provide  some

leisure   and  training  for  them.   We  encourage  lifelong

training.   We  can open from 8.00 am to  5.00  pm.   In  the

morning,  we can encourage these senior citizens to  do  some

qicong  or exercise, and do something that is good for  their

health.  We can also provide some educational programmes, eg,

explain to them some of the important policies of the nation,

and they can have lunch.  In the afternoon, we can allow them

to  use  some of the facilities, such as karaoke or let  them

learn  computer or some language.  Malays can learn  Chinese,

and  Chinese can learn Malay, and they can exchange and build

up a better cohesiveness among themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important point is that many of these

senior citizens are still active and they can still work.  We

also have healthy senior citizens who can take up the job  of

looking  after  the old people at home.  Some  factories  may

need  part-time workers.  They can come to the CCs to  employ

these senior citizens.  It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>



also  good for the senior citizens because they can earn some

extra income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the Mayor of our Southwest CDC, and we

wish  that  we  could set up this Community Senior  Citizens'

Institute  as  a pilot project in the Bukit Gombak  Community

Club.  If this is successful, it will be extended to all  the

other  constituencies in Singapore.  So I would like  to  ask

the Minister for Community Development and Sports whether  he

will  support this suggestion or to give us his  support  and

perhaps give us some financial support as well.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, one of the MCDS'

stated   desired  outcomes  is  to  bring  about  an  elderly

community that is well prepared for old age.  As we know, the

number  of  elderly in Singapore will continue to  grow  from

around 250,000 today to about 800,000 by the year 2030.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trend of our young having fewer children and

some  staying  happily  unmarried,  the  proportion  of   the

elderly,  ie, those 65 and above, against the young  and  the

whole population, is also set to grow.  This is added by  the

fact that more people are enjoying a longer life expectancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Aging Population has made many

good  proposals.   Among others, it touches on  health  care,

financial security, employment, as well as housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current situation in the job market, the

question  of financial security and employment of our  senior

citizens  has become a matter of great concern.   Last  week,

for  example, I was visited by a senior citizen  who  retired

more than a decade ago, but continues to work today.  At  the

age  of  66, he still finds it necessary to find  a  job  and

continue to work to sustain himself.  He is 66.  He is  still

healthy  and  is keen to work because he needs  to  get  some

money to get by.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we have heard many reports of

people who complain of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>



difficulty in getting jobs even when they are only  in  their

40s.  They are still young, yet they are not treated as young

anymore.   Many of them have young children in school.   This

trend  could affect their ability to pay for their flats  and

to  save  enough  for  their old  age.   But  can  they  have

financial security?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my hope that this year's budget and other

measures  taken  by  the  Government to  increase  employment

opportunities could help to solve the problem.  At  the  same

time,  more workers should undertake skills upgrading courses

so as to improve their employability.  For, at the end of the

day, I believe the elderly may be divided into two groups  of

people.   One, those who would be in need of help  and,  two,

those  who  are more fortunate and can help others.   Between

the two, we should have programmes that could match them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While efforts are being done by the various social and

community  agencies to assist those in need of help,  I  hope

more  efforts are also put in place to help the  majority  of

our elderly to enjoy their old age meaningfully.  One way  is

to  capitalise on their experiences and skills.  Many elderly

are  still  able  to  remain active,  given  a  chance.   For

example,  there are retired teachers, nurses, police officers

and people from various other professions.  I have met many - and  I  believe Members too have met many of them -  who  are

still  able  to contribute and want to remain active  and  be

engaged with the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope there is a way to assist as many of them as

possible to remain employed or be involved in programmes that

could   keep  them  to  remain  partly  employed  and  partly

contributing to the betterment of society.  Self-help  groups

and  Community Development Councils, for example, can  always

tap   on   the  expertise  of  retired  teachers  for   their

educational programmes.  Similarly, I believe we  should  tap

on  the  resources of retirees from other professions.   They

have  wide experiences, and I believe these can still be  put

to  good  use  for  the rest of our society,  especially  the

younger generation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also those who will find it more fulfilling to

spend  much  more  time with their families, especially  with

their  grandchildren.  As long as our elderly can spend their

time  happily  and meaningfully, feeling secure  financially,

etc,  I  think they are fine.  And I always believe that  the

best  is  left  for those who care to plan  early  for  their

retirement years.  In fact, I believe it is the only  way  to

be well prepared for senior citizenship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Ah Heng is not here. Mr Zainul

Abidin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, after 10 days of

Committee  of Supply debates, one does feel that  he  ages  a

little!  But in order not to give you more stress, I will try

to keep my speech brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I reached 40, I thought it was the prime of my

life.   I  thought I had a whole life in front  of  me.   But

before  we knew it, we have reached 50.  And, now, at 54,  if

it  were  10  years  ago, I would have  been  thinking  about

retirement at 55.  But, alas, no.  We now have to worry about

what  we  have to do for maybe the next 10, if not 15  or  20

years.   The  point I would like to make is that there  is  a

definite  change  in profile of aging.  The  people  who  are

aging  today  are different from those who aged before.   And

there  are certain policies which we have carried out earlier

on, eg, 2-child family, may have an impact on the parents  of

today,  with  smaller families.  Thus, many parents  who  are

aging  now  are  also  facing a  kind  of  loneliness.   This

shifting  of retirement age from 50 to 55, to 62 and  to  67,

will  also have an impact in the kind of programmes  that  we

will need to prepare our society for the greying era.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Japan 20 years ago and I remember that, in

fact,  the  Japanese had very extensive programmes -  surveys

and  programmes  were carried out.  I am sure that  Singapore

can  also  learn  from such more established communities  and

societies.  I would like the Minister to share with  us  what

approach  the  Ministry has taken in terms of  learning  from

others'  experiences, which are the countries  that  we  have

been to, so as to look at their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>



profiles  of  aging,  and what kind of  programmes  would  be

relevant to our needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the changing profile of the aged, we

should also realise that they are better educated, the  point

mentioned  by Mr Maidin earlier on.  I think we  should  find

ways  to  tap their expertise and make them feel more useful.

Although they may have reached retirement age, they can still

contribute  to  society in various ways  to  make  them  more

productive in part-time work, or in terms of helping  out  in

community service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would like to make is this question of

preparing  for  the aged should not be done when  people  are

already  retired.  I think they should start early.  And  one

way  to  achieve that is to have this blend of the not-so-old

with  those  who  are aging.  In that way, we  can  make  the

younger people realise the need to prepare for aging and also

to  understand  the problems faced by those who  are  already

aging.   This blending or bonding between the not-so-old  and

those  who are aging would provide a very important  learning

curve for both age groups, and that will help us in preparing

for our greying era.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, first, I would like to

thank  all Members who have, in one way or another, supported

the  work  of MCDS and its related agencies.  Let me  address

some  of  the  key  issues first before I take  some  of  the

specific issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has raised some very thoughtful

concerns  about the ability of our current social safety  net

to help our low-income families cope with the changing social

and economic realities.  Sir, if the House allows me, let  me

explain  how  my Ministry is strengthening the social  safety

net in order for us to help needy Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a net that was designed to hold a light weight

needs to be strengthened to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>



bear a heavier load.  Our social safety net was designed  for

a full-employment economy.  It is now coming under increasing

strain,  and  two major forces are at play.  First,  economic

restructuring and our move towards a knowledge-based  economy

will  certainly  put  more  workers  at  risk  of  structural

unemployment  or  under-employment.   Second,  as  has   been

mentioned  by  some speakers, demographic and social  trends,

such as smaller families, nuclear families and, of course, an

aging  population, will test the tenet of family as the first

line of support.

There  is  no  doubt  that  with the  economic  downturn  and

restructuring, more Singaporeans, particularly our older  and

less-skilled  workers,  are in need of  short-term  financial

assistance  while they look for work.  Last year  alone,  the

Community   Development   Councils   approved   about   4,200

applications  for  short-term assistance, a  7-fold  increase

over  the  previous year.  We need to ensure  that  those  in

genuine need receive effective and timely assistance, without

creating  an  entitlement  mentality  and  eroding  the  work

ethics.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address these challenges, my Ministry will put

in  place  a  three-prong strategy to strengthen  the  social

safety net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will review the policy design of the social

safety net to ensure a right level and kind of help is given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will put in place programmes to help children

from lower-income families access educational and development

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will continue to build up the capability of

the  social  service sector to deliver effective services  to

help those in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, first, to explain the policy design of the

social  safety net.  Our social assistance schemes are  meant

to help the most vulnerable or weakest in society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>



This  is in line with our philosophy of self-reliance.  Those

who can help themselves and their families should do so.  But

my  Ministry  recognises that many lower-income  Singaporeans

are  also  lowly skilled and hence more vulnerable to  losing

their jobs as a result of economic restructuring.  They  also

have little savings and limited assets to fall back on when a

family crisis such as retrenchment strikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan has raised concerns over the adequacy of the

Economic   Downturn  Relief  Scheme.   He   has   made   some

suggestions.   I will address that later. Some  Members  also

asked  if  more can be done to help individuals in  need,  be

they  older  or less skilled workers, or even some  displaced

mid-level executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, work is still the best form of welfare. The longer

a  worker remains unemployed, the more difficult it  will  be

for  him  to find work subsequently. We need to help him  get

back to work as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS)

helps  distressed  Singaporeans with a  short-term  grant  of

three  months in the first instance.  There are  no  explicit

conditions attached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the help being given is effective, the

grants  will now be packaged with job counselling, job search

and  skills  training plans.  Recipients will be helped  with

IFAS  grants  for the first three months, and  extendable  by

another  three months if they are still unable to find  work.

MCDS  will  work with the Ministry of Manpower and  the  five

CDCs to help cases in need transit as quickly back to work as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above approach highlights a key principle of

our  social safety net, that is of "mutual obligation". While

the  community and the Government will try their best to help

those in need, Singaporeans who have landed on the safety net

must  also  recognise that their welfare and families'  well-being  are best secured through gainful employment, and  they

need to help themselves climb out.  This may mean adapting to

a  new  job, or a job that does not pay quite as well as  the

old job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there will always be needy Singaporeans who have no

means of subsistence and are unable to support themselves due

to  old  age,  illness  or some other adverse  circumstances.

They will need long-term care and support from the Government

and  the  community.  The Public Assistance  Scheme  (PA)  is

their main source of financial support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry last reviewed the Public Assistance rates

in  January last year, and in the light of higher costs  that

may  arise  from the GST increase, we are revising the  rates

again.  The  new rates will be announced towards the  end  of

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would be aware that the CDCs also supplement the

Government's schemes with their own local schemes  to  assist

those  at the margins who need help, but who may not  qualify

for the Government's assistance schemes.  Mr Sin Boon Ann has

mentioned  a few examples of Singaporeans who would  like  to

work  but are unable to do so and yet, still need to  support

their  families.   My Ministry will look into  the  needs  of

these  families at the margins, and how the appropriate group

can be identified and reached without creating an entitlement

mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to re-emphasise that the family is

still the first line of care and support for its members.  In

assessing  applications for financial assistance, whether  it

be  Public  Assistance  or the short-term  Interim  Financial

Assistance Scheme (IFAS), case workers in the CDCs will  look

at  the merits of each case as a whole.  The CDC case workers

have   some   flexibility   in   helping   deserving   cases,

particularly  those affected by job loss and those  requiring

short-term aid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry's second thrust is to help the next

generation stay out of the social safety net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has rightly pointed out the need for

access  to good child care.  Poor early development is indeed

a  high risk factor in disadvantaged children faring worse in

later  life,  and perpetuating the poverty cycle.   Many  who

apply for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>



short-term financial assistance now have young dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as possible, we should try to prevent these

children  from  becoming the structurally unemployed  of  the

future.   Our challenge, therefore, is to help children  from

lower-income  families  access and benefit  from  educational

opportunities available in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have also mentioned that studies show

that  early childhood education, especially for children from

low-income  families,  is  crucial  to  giving  them  a  good

foundation for learning and overall development, so that they

can be prepared for school and, in the future, employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two years, my Ministry has been

collaborating with Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre to  pilot

an early intervention case management programme to detect and

strengthen  these  families.  The programme,  called  Healthy

Start,  initially focused on families with infants and  young

children  up  to two years old.  The programme provides  good

grounding for the family to uplift itself by helping  parents

improve  their  skills  and knowledge of  child  development,

linking them to relevant community resources and services and

extended   family  networks,  and  enhancing   their   family

functioning  through casework and counselling.  So  we  catch

them  early,  give  them assistance, build  up  self-reliance

within the parents so that they can run programmes at home on

their own, and where they need assistance, they know where to

turn  to.  We close the information gap.   We provide  skills

for the parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot has shown some very promising results. My

Ministry  plans  to  extend  the pilot  to  cover  "at  risk"

children  up  to  six years old, and to more  Family  Service

Centres.   This  initial phase will be evaluated  before  new

plans are developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry enhanced the Centre-based

Financial Assistance for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>



Childcare  (CAFC)  Scheme to make childcare  programmes  more

affordable for low-income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enhanced the subsidy levels in the CFAC Scheme to

provide   between  $170-250  for  children  from   low-income

families.   Families  from  the  lowest-income  bracket   are

eligible  to receive the highest amount of subsidy  and  need

only  pay  as little as $20 a month in childcare  fee.   This

year, the Community Assistance Fund will set aside $2 million

to  subsidise  childcare  under  the  Centre-based  Financial

Assistance for Childcare Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked some questions about the utilisation

rates  of the Centre-based Financial Assistance for Childcare

Scheme and what efforts will be taken to encourage more  from

the  low-income  families to take up the Scheme.   Dr  Maliki

might  like  to  know  that  in FY2001,  the  CDCs,  who  are

administering the scheme, received nearly 1,000 applications.

Of  these, about 85% were approved.  In terms of applications

and  approvals, this has been the highest attained thus  far.

Last  year,  MCDS officers targeted publicity at the  service

providers  -  the childcare operators, CDCs,  Family  Service

Centres and self-help groups, as they are in touch with  low-income families.  We will try to extend this network as  much

as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to find ways to step up

publicity   efforts  and  our  partners,  whether   childcare

operators,  social  service agencies,  Community  Development

Councils, Members of Parliament and families themselves - all

have  an  important role to play in ensuring that  low-income

families utilise available childcare services to better their

children's development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also asked about help for student

care.  With  MCDS' subsidies, families earning  at  or  below

$1,500  per  month need only pay between $42-$60  per  month,

depending  on whether the centre is school-based  or  located

away  from the school.  My Ministry will periodically  review

these rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third prong of our strategy to strengthen the

social safety net is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>



upgrade   the   social  service  sector,   to   improve   the

effectiveness and the range of social services.  We  need  to

develop the capabilities of the social services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) are a

linchpin  of  the social service sector.  Many  of  them  run

programmes   for  the  community.   To  help  upgrade   their

services, my Ministry will provide more financial support  to

VWOs.  This amount will be channelled into two directions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, MCDS will increase the recurrent funding to

programmes  run by VWOs by $7 million each year.   This  will

certainly  improve the depth and the breadth of the  services

provided by our VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my Ministry will set up a VWO Capability Fund

with  $30  million over five years to support areas  such  as

training,   development   of  new  services,   organisational

development   and   the   adoption   of   info-communications

technology. These are some of the things that we will  do  in

terms  of funding to help our social service sector build  up

capabilities to deal with the current problems  that  we  are

facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given greater public funding and increased public

expectations  about  accountability,  as  well   as   service

quality, VWOs will need to improve their governance, as  well

as service delivery structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, especially for clearer accountability, my

Ministry   will  spell  out  service  standards   and   other

requirements  in  service agreements  between  MCDS  and  the

voluntary welfare organisations this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to assist the voluntary welfare

organisations    on    their    journey    towards    greater

professionalism  and enhanced service to  their  clients,  my

Ministry  and  the  National Council of Social  Service  will

provide   extensive   support  to  them   through   training,

consultancy and other initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS is also working with the Ministry of Manpower and

the National Council of Social Service on a pilot Strategic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>



Manpower   Conversion  Programme  to  provide  the  necessary

training  for  mid-career  people to  move  into  the  social

service  sector, initially as social workers and social  work

aides.   This  will help to address the current  shortage  of

skilled  social  service personnel and,  at  the  same  time,

provide employment opportunities in the social service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity again to re-affirm the fundamental principles underlying our social

safety net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the family remains the first line of care and

support  for  its members.  As many Members have  spoken,  we

acknowledge that the family is under pressure, and I will  be

addressing  this  later.   But the "family  first"  principle

still  holds, and any assistance given should not  supplement

the family's care-giving role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Many Helping Hands principle remains just as

relevant, if not, more so, given the challenges ahead and the

widening  range  of needs. The local community,  the  private

sector,  the  people sector and the Government will  need  to

work  together  to  expand the network of resources  to  help

families  and  individuals  in  need.   Long-term  Government

assistance  is  directly  extended where  the  individual  is

unable  to work, and the family is unable to provide adequate

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within this social safety net, every individual and

family in genuine need will be helped, either financially  or

by other means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki has asked about how CDCs have been coping

with  the  administration of the various financial assistance

schemes   and  about  the  profile  of  the  people   seeking

assistance.  The CDCs have seen an increase in the number  of

applications  for financial assistance since they  took  over

the  administration of social assistance functions  from  the

Ministry of Community Development and Sports.  Prior to  that

delegation, each social assistance officer used to handle  on

average  about 15 cases per month. Now, each officer  handles

as many as 45 cases per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>



month.  This was mainly due to the economic downturn as  many

retrenched  Singaporeans  are coming  to  the  CDCs  for  the

Interim Financial Assistance and job placement services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been greater awareness of the

availability  of  the  social  assistance  schemes   due   to

extensive media publicity.  As the CDCs are on the ground and

thus  more accessible, this has also resulted in more  people

coming forward to apply for the assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs have helped almost 15,000 beneficiaries with

financial assistance amounting to $9.5 million between  April

2001   and   March  2002  through  the  Government's   social

assistance  schemes.  In  addition, the  CDCs  also  disburse

another  $670,000  through their local  financial  assistance

schemes.   About 76% of the beneficiaries are  HDB  dwellers.

The   CDCs   are  also  receiving  requests  from  non-rental

dwellings, mostly the smaller HDB purchased flats because  of

the recession and retrenchments.  About 65% of the recipients

under  the  Public Assistance Scheme are aged  70  years  and

above.  On the other hand, 67% of those receiving help  under

the  Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS) are below  50

years  old,  and about 34% of the IFAS recipients have  below

secondary qualifications.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in terms of processing time, the CDCs took

an  average  of four weeks for straightforward  cases,  while

complicated cases took about 8-10 weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also raised the concern about whether CDCs

will  have  enough  resources to basically  deal  with  these

cases.   I  just  like to assure Dr Maliki  that  we  are  in

constant  contact with the CDCs, especially with the  Mayors,

who  understand better what are their needs, and how best  we

can  assist  in terms of meeting some of these  demands.   In

fact,  this morning I had a meeting with the Mayors  for  one

particular project, and most of the Mayors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>



informed me that most of their workers are out in the  field,

talking  to  parents and families, in order  to  assist  them

directly and quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has made some other suggestions, eg, we

should  do  more to help the genuine needy who are unable  to

work,  single  mothers and the elderly; for  MCDS  to  set  a

minimum   standard  of  living,  some  form  of  unemployment

insurance;  and families on PA should be regularly counselled

and  not made to feel like beggars.  I assure Mr Sin that the

last  thing we want to do is to make Singaporeans  feel  that

they are like beggars.  In fact, more often than not, we have

difficulty  reaching out to some of these people.   Secondly,

when  we do contact them, and we offer assistance, we try  to

follow  up  with some programmes.  It is always difficult  to

get  in touch with them.  So I would like to assure you, Sir,

that  we  will continue to reach out to those at the  bottom,

because they need more help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public assistance rates are pegged to the minimum

household expenditure.  So, we must ensure that whatever that

we  do,  Singaporeans continue to be able to at  least  enjoy

that level of standard of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan has a proposal, ERAS, as a loan scheme to replace

the EDRS.  Sir, MCDS used to have a loan scheme to help needy

cases  set up small personal business efforts, such as school

canteen  operations, and the like.  The scheme, however,  was

unsuccessful.  For one reason or another, the businesses  did

not  take off, and the loans were never returned.  We are  of

the  view that loans will be better administered by financial

institutions who can assess and advise on the setting  up  of

these  small businesses.  But I assure the Member  that  even

after  the  economy has recovered, there will  be  assistance

schemes  in  place, either at the CDCs or at  the  CCCs.   As

Members  may know, every week MPs will receive requests  from

residents,  and I know from my own experience in Jalan  Besar

GRC,  we will activate a network of grassroots leaders to  go

out  and assess what are the needs of this particular person,

be  it  school children's education, utilities and what  have

you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>



The  assurance  that I would like to give to  the  Member  is

that,  even after EDRS has been stopped, and I am not  saying

that  it will be stopped, because PA will have to review this

as  we  look  at how the economy recovers, and I  accept  his

point that there could be a lag between economic recovery and

job  creation,  the  schemes which are  in  place  -  welfare

schemes  run by the CCs and the Interim Financial  Assistance

Scheme by the CDCs - could be tweaked to fit the new economic

conditions, in order to help those who may still need help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the number of families who

have  received EDRS and what proportion who returned for more

help.   So far, about 10,300 cases have been approved.   This

is,  of  course,  smaller than the number of cases  who  have

applied.   As  you know, many people think that  EDRS  is  an

entitlement,  so  people who have been out  of  job,  or  the

elderly, have come forward and demanded their $200.   But  we

have  approved  only 10,300 cases so far,  and  it  has  cost

Government  $4.13 million.  We are not able  to  provide  the

proportion  of numbers who came back for help.  As  you  know

the  EDRS  cycle is now moving only into its 2nd  cycle.   We

will  continue to monitor the number of cases.  If the  cases

do jump up, I think we will have to do something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With job-matching, Sir, as I have suggested earlier,

IFAS, which is now without any condition, but once we link it

to  job matching and job counselling, this will help them  to

tide over their crisis and solve their key problem, which  is

being out of a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the IFAS cases that Dr Maliki enquired about

the  turn-around  time,  roughly, we  are  talking  about  an

average  of  four  weeks  for  a  straightforward  case,  but

complicated cases can take 8-10 weeks.  Some of the  problems

that  CDC case workers have communicated back to us,  through

the Mayors and the general managers, are that, as I mentioned

earlier,  sometimes  they  are not  at  home,  they  are  not

contactable.  More recently, we have written to all MPs  that

whoever may want to ask the Government to assist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>



some of these families, to provide contact numbers so that we

can reach them much faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the percentage of cases approved, as I

mentioned  earlier, for IFAS we have about 46% for  FY  2001.

This  is  about 4,238 cases approved out of 9,216 applicants.

I mentioned earlier about the case load in the CDCs.  This is

about  45 cases per month.  More often than not, the kind  of

work  that  they deal with the families, I am sure Dr  Maliki

too  will appreciate, is complicated and complex.  It is  not

just  a  simple  financial problem.   There  could  be  other

related  cases.   So what the case workers have  done  is  to

intervene  and  refer some of these cases to  Family  Service

Centres  and  VWOs.   We assist where  we  can  in  terms  of

financial  assistance,  and we do a  lot  of  referral  cases

downwards, towards the VWOs and the other agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has talked about unemployment insurance

as  a possible suggestion.  I think we will all agree that if

we  have  unemployment insurance, it will perhaps go  against

the   interest  of  workers.   Now,  with  companies   paying

retrenchment benefit, based on the number of years the worker

has  been with the company, companies will think twice  about

retrenching workers.  Also, at the end of the day,  like  all

support  systems, it can be subject to abuse and lead  to  an

erosion of work ethics.  Some of the experiences that we have

gathered from overseas, when we studied some of these  social

safety net programme, show what we called "bunching" in terms

of many workers all of a sudden becoming unemployed when they

meet  the  minimum criteria to be eligible for the insurance.

So,  they try and play the system in that sense, because they

know there is a supporting network.  Just like the EDRS, some

came  forward  because they feel they are  entitled,  because

they  want to get the $200.  Our view is that an unemployment

insurance system may not be sustainable, especially in  times

of a prolonged economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to the first prong of the social safety

net, which is to link all of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>



assistance  programmes that we have to job matching  and  job

counselling.  We know that some of the CDCs have started this

work,  but we hope we will be able to make this as  a  formal

arrangement, where possible, to bring the person back to work

as  quickly  as  possible.  At the same  time,  Members  will

appreciate  that there have been reports in the  papers,  and

even  in  this House, about some families who are not willing

to take up the job, because that is not the kind of work that

they are used to, or not the pay that they want to enjoy.  So

adjustments will have to be made, and we will continue to  do

our  best  to ensure that the matching is done optimally  and

families are being helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can move on to the next section, which is the

Singapore  Family.   Many  have  spoken  about  the  need  to

strengthen  the family, and I think we could not  agree  more

with  all  the Members who have spoken up.  Sir,  all  of  us

recognise  that  the family is operating in  a  more  complex

environment.  Globalisation and technology have  changed  the

way  we  work and live.  For many, material life  goals  take

priority.   In  a more competitive environment, parents  face

work-life tensions, as they strive to fulfil their  work  and

familial responsibilities.  Often, it is the kids or children

who  feel  the brunt of their stress.  Sometimes people  even

decide not to have children because of this.  Hence, I  would

like  to thank Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon for her passionate appeal

for  us  to  help  families, Mr Maidin for  his  well-thought

views,  and Dr Maliki for raising a number of key  issues  on

the  family.   I think, like them, I believe we should  never

lose  sight  of  the value of the family as one  of  the  key

building blocks of our Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many family problems could perhaps have been

avoided  if only the families had been aware of the  problems

earlier  and acted on them.  This is why my Ministry believes

in  equipping  families  with the  skills  and  knowledge  to

strengthen   their  family  life.   Our  approach   is   both

developmental and preventive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key developmental strategy is the promotion of family

life  education.  Families can pick up family life  education

materials in public libraries, resource corners, such as  the

`Family  Connections' set up in December last  year  at  NTUC

Downtown East Resort.  Early intervention is the crux of  the

preventive  strategy.   This  is  especially  important   for

families  that  are at risk.  A good example is  the  Healthy

Start  Programme which I mentioned earlier,  which  helps  to

identify families with babies and young children who may need

help.   As  I  said  earlier, the programme  has  shown  some

promising results.  We are expanding it, but we will study it

very  carefully, because we want to make sure that by helping

early  we  can prevent future problems.  Therefore,  I  agree

with  Mr Maidin that we should expend more efforts on  family

life education for our young and couples intending to marry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform Mr Maidin that MCDS and the

Ministry  of  Education  have recently  launched  the  School

Family  Education Programme.  This programme is my Ministry's

latest  initiative  to make family life  education  resources

available in schools for the benefit of parents, students and

teachers.   Students will be taught core values about  family

life.   So they are exposed to what family life is all about,

and  their  parents  and  teachers can  pick  up  skills  for

parenting and maintaining work-life effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January this year, the School Family Education

programme  has  been piloted at four schools, with  financial

support  by  three Community Development Councils  and  MCDS.

The   programme  has  so  far  attracted  a  total  of  9,000

participants,  including  3,000 parents  from  varied  income

backgrounds.  My Ministry expects to extend the programme  to

more schools next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of involving children in family education

is  highlighted  in  our  National  Family  Week  this  year.

Children,  as  we  know, play a key role in reaching  out  to

their  parents,  and  encouraging them  to  attend  parenting

programmes and bringing family life materials from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>



school  to  home.  Activities involving parents and  children

will be emphasised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mr Maidin on the importance of

marriage  preparation.   The  importance  of  preparing   for

marriage and equipping oneself with skills to stay married is

frequently  reinforced  in the various  public  communication

platforms  that  MCDS  uses.  These  include  TV  programmes,

advertisements,  press coverage and other similar  platforms.

This  is  also  one of the reasons why we set up  the  Public

Education  Committee  on the Family,  which  was  chaired  by

former  Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon,

and  now currently chaired by Minister of State, Mr Chan  Soo

Sen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has asked about the 70 recommendations of the

Public    Education   Committee   on   the    Family.     The

recommendations are categorised under four thrusts.   Let  me

remind her:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Imbuing the young with positive values towards the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family;

(2)  Reinforcing marriage as a lifelong commitment;

(3)  Promoting family life and Family Life Education for all;

and

(4)  Creating a Family Friendly Environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you can see, the recommendations cover the

entire spectrum, from the young to those who are married,  to

those  who  are  getting married, and  also  to  creating  an

environment which is conducive for family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will prioritise these recommendations

according  to  whether  they  are  impactful,  and   can   be

institutionalised over the next ten years; can be  integrated

into  the lifestyle of Singaporeans; and can be sustained  by

community  partners and other service providers in  the  long

run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, we are not just going to run the

programmes,  and then after that stop.  But we want  to  find

ways



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>



in  which the programmes can be integrated, first, with  some

of  our partners and, second, how we can make this as part of

the lifestyle of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now want to turn to the topic that is of concern

to  us  all, and that is of marriage and procreation.   I  am

glad  that  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has given me the opportunity

to  raise  this subject.  She mentioned that despite generous

financial assistance, the number of births has remained  low.

Let me make two points here, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our package of measures go beyond the Baby Bonus.

I  hope Members can recall what the Baby Bonus scheme is  all

about.   For  the 2nd child, we give the parents some  money,

and  if  they have a 3rd child we give them a bit more  money

for  the next 6 years, because we want to help them.  We  are

committed  to  creating  a  total  environment  conducive  to

raising  a  family.  So we do not merely throw money  at  the

problem   of   declining  fertility.   Our  efforts   include

promoting family-friendly work practices, developing more and

better  quality  childcare centres, public  education,  among

other support services.  My Ministry will continue to try and

reduce  the  obstacles to marriage and having children.   The

Government,  however, Sir, can only do so much.   Ultimately,

it   has  to  be  a  community  effort  involving  employers,

religious leaders, people sector groups, the media,  parents,

grandparents,   friends,  MPs,  and  an  individual   effort.

Employers, for example, must understand that their  employees

are  not  just  units of production.  Numerous  studies  have

shown  that  an employee who can balance his work and  family

well  will  be  a  loyal,  highly  energised  and  productive

employee  who  can contribute significantly to the  company's

bottom-line.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the end of the day, individuals must want to

marry and have children, and be prepared to make compromises.

One  cannot  expect to be compensated by the  Government  for

every   sacrifice   made  for  his  or   her   family.    The

gratification and joy that come with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>



marriage and family are what make these sacrifices worth it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has asked about the work of the Ministerial

Committee  on  Marriage and Procreation.  The  Committee,  as

Members  know,  is  a  standing one.  It will  give  periodic

reports  and updates at appropriate forums.  I would like  to

remind  her that the Ministerial Committee delivered once  in

August 2000.  It is now trying to conceive again, so that  it

can deliver again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she also mentioned about the social policies of

Denmark,  Norway and other countries.  I agree with her  that

their  benefits are indeed generous.  Denmark,  for  example,

spends  heavily  on  day-care  facilities  for  children  and

different types of family and child allowances.  But, we must

remember that in Denmark, total public expenditure represents

about  60% of their GDP, and the social sector alone accounts

for about 15% of GDP.  We do not have such a budget.  How  do

they finance this?  Although their personal tax on income  is

not  high, their value-added tax is as high as 25%.  So,  can

one imagine if we were to raise GST in Singapore to 25%?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo also mentioned that it could be timely to

review the "Have three or more, if you can afford it" policy.

I  believe that the intent behind the policy is still  valid,

ie,  couples who have large families must be willing and must

be able to take care of their children.  So we have to signal

to  families that there is a cost involved in having children

and, if you can afford it, why not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem, I agree, is to convince the middle income

and  the well-to-do that they need not stop at two.  I  think

it  boils  down  primarily to values and expectations,  which

changing a slogan simply would not help.  If our Singaporeans

have a more holistic and balanced definition of success, they

might welcome more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo may also like to know that we are currently

reviewing the Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>



Development  Unit  (SDU), and privatisation  is  one  of  the

possibilities.  I do not necessarily agree that  the  private

sector  can  do  a  better  job than  the  Government.   But,

nonetheless,  one  idea  being studied,  as  Mrs  Yu-Foo  has

suggested,  is  to  privatise or let the  private  or  people

sector  do direct services.  SDU will then have a promotional

and  policy role.  We will study in what way we can basically

work better with the private sector or even other bodies, who

are  not  necessarily from the private sector  but  from  the

people sector, to carry out SDU and SDS' work.  Just to  add,

for  example, in the Malay-Muslim community, part of the work

is being done by the Muslim Religious Council where they take

a  slightly  different approach - they work through  informal

networks  and  partners.  So, we will try  whatever  that  is

needed  in order to make sure that our efforts at encouraging

people to get married remain successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also raised the issue of abortion. I

agree  with her that abortion is a highly personal  decision.

Let  me assure the Member that there are sufficient resources

and  measures in place to assist families who want to and are

able,  with  a little bit of help, to care adequately  for  a

child.   They can seek assistance at community and  voluntary

welfare organisations, such as the Family Service Centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for abortion counselling, we, together with the

Ministry of Health, can look into the issues raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked how our families are faring. A

benchmark Study on the Singapore Family, conducted  in  1999,

showed   that  families  in  Singapore  are  still  generally

healthy.   We  probably have to update the  study.   But,  at

least,  in  1999, the data showed that things are  still  all

right with the Singapore family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also asked about outcome indicators. As a

Ministry,  MCDS is guided by macro indicators such  as  Total

Fertility Rate, General Marriage Rate, General Divorce  Rate.

MCDS  also uses attitudinal surveys and studies to supplement

the "hard" numbers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the remedial programmes for

families   that  inadvertently  break  up.   No  matter   how

effective our preventive and development programmes  can  be,

there  would be families needing additional support.   Hence,

remedial   programmes,  targeted  at  families   already   in

distress, are another priority for MCDS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence and marital problems are two major reasons why

families  break  up.  My Ministry drives and administers  the

mandatory  counselling  programme for family  violence  cases

referred  by  the  Family  Court.   We  also  work  with  the

community  to  implement programmes to help couples  consider

alternatives before resorting to divorce proceedings.  Family

Service  Centres and specialised counselling centres are  our

key partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been asked as to whether our

programmes are effective.  I would like to assure Members  of

the House that my Ministry puts in a lot of efforts to ensure

that  the  programmes  remain relevant  and  effective.   For

example,  we have been working with the National  Council  of

Social Service and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to put  in

place a Programme Evaluation System (PES) to help us evaluate

and  ensure the effectiveness of the programmes.  This  is  a

programme  that we are working with the VWOs.   It  is  being

rolled  out now, so that at the end of the day, the VWOs  who

are the social deliverers of such programmes can assess as to

whether or not their programmes are effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to the next point, let me just address

questions   raised  by  Mr  Ahmad  Magad   in   relation   to

rehabilitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has asked about the well-being of young

offenders  in  the juvenile homes.  First, I  would  like  to

clarify that juvenile delinquency has been on the decline  in

the  last  five  years.   The number of  juveniles  who  were

arrested  and charged fell by 30% in the period  of  1997  to

2001.  We also see a decline of 37% in the number of juvenile

offenders  admitted  to  the homes in  the  same  period.   A

continuum of treatment options is available



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>



for  different types of juvenile offenders.  Those  who  have

committed  less  serious  offences are  placed  in  voluntary

welfare   homes.   Those  who  have  committed  more  serious

offences  and need more intensive supervision and  discipline

are  placed in MCDS' juvenile homes, and these are the  Boys'

Home  and  the  Toa  Payoh  Girls' Home.   Within  the  MCDS'

juvenile   homes,  we  segregate  residents  who   are   more

vulnerable   from   those  who  are  older  and   higher-risk

offenders.  So there is some form of segregation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry adopts a multi-discipline approach in

rehabilitating   juvenile  offenders.   Upon   admission,   a

juvenile  offender  is  assessed to identify  his  strengths,

weaknesses and his propensity to re-offend.  My officers then

work   with   the  juvenile  and  his  family  to   draw   up

individualised   care   plan.   The   plan   maps   out   the

rehabilitation needs of the juvenile to enhance  his  success

in rehabilitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Mr Ahmad Magad that my

Ministry takes every step to ensure that each resident in our

Homes  is  given the appropriate rehabilitative treatment  to

develop  him  or her into a socially responsible  individual.

Like Mr Ahmad Magad, we are concerned about recidivism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to how else my Ministry intends to

support  the  Singapore family.  Many  speakers  have  talked

about balancing work and life.  Let me address this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Singapore economy restructures, work patterns

will  change.  The family's position, as the primary provider

of  care and support to members, will come increasingly under

stress.  Sir, the Government recognises this dilemma.   There

is  a  need  to  balance the demands  of  life  and  work  on

Singaporeans.  Our challenge is to facilitate Singaporeans in

the  pursuit  of their aspirations, with regard to  work  and

family,  of  preserving  the  quality  of  family  life   and

maintaining Singapore's economic and social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work-life practices enable working parents to spend more

time with their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>



children.   Also,  singles will have more  opportunities  for

personal aspirations, socialising and attending to the  needs

of their family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Irene Ng has asked what more can be done to push

companies  in  the  direction of work-life programmes.   This

requires  a  multi-pronged approach.   In  the  first  place,

companies   must   be   convinced  that  adopting   work-life

programmes,  such as flexible work arrangements and  employee

support   programmes,   are  aligned  with   their   business

objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has taken a proactive approach by setting up

the Work Life Unit (WLU) in September 2000 to promote a work-life friendly culture in Singapore.  We partner MOM, SNEF and

NTUC  to  organise  the biennial Family Friendly  Firm  Award

(FFFA), which is aimed at recognising companies for their pro-family  efforts.   This year will be the  third  run  of  the

Award.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit networks and collaborates with partners such as

the Employer Alliance on Work and Family, which is a group of

Family  Friendly  Firm Awardees, the Health Promotion  Board,

the  Economic  Development Board, business  associations  and

MNCs  to champion the work-life issue.  In addition, the Unit

produces resource materials to guide organisations on how  to

implement    work-life   strategies   and    flexible    work

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing mindsets of both employers and employees takes

time.   We  need to build the local business case to convince

employers about the benefits of being work-life friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to work with new champions and

explore  new  channels  to reach out  to  more  CEOs  and  HR

practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has suggested that the public sector take

the  lead in pushing for work-life practices.  Let me address

some of the things that she has raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has already allowed Ministries and

Departments  to  adopt  flexible work  arrangements  provided

there  is  no drop in service levels or increase in  manpower

cost.   Depending  on  the nature of work,  applications  for

telecommuting are also considered.  So we have, for  example,

in  my Ministry and some other Ministries, alternate Saturday

off.   Some  people  have come back and  do  part-time  work.

Since  1987, married female officers with children may  apply

to  work part-time, up to a period of three years, subject to

a yearly review.  So we can make those adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other work-life friendly provisions include maternity

and paternity leave and full-pay unrecorded child sick leave.

In  addition, married female officers are eligible for up  to

four  years of no-pay leave if their children are below  four

years of age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to add also that many companies have

come  on  board.   Personally, I think this is  a  very  good

programme.   Those  who are here, who are  from  the  private

sector, may want to consider this as an alternative, and they

could  discuss  with their HR professionals on how  work-life

initiatives  can be adopted.  I would like to add  also  that

ever  since I took over the Chairmanship of MENDAKI,  I  have

asked  MENDAKI  to examine how work-life initiatives  can  be

introduced,  because  over 90% of the staff  in  MENDAKI  are

females.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mdm Halimah's question about legislation, the

Ministry  of  Manpower is reviewing the  Employment  Act  and

related  labour legislation with a view to providing  greater

flexibility   to   employers  to  implement   flexible   work

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, however, mindful that legislation could

introduce   market  rigidities.   The  success  of  work-life

strategies,  such  as  flexible work  arrangements,  flexible

benefits  and  various employee support programmes,  is  best

ensured when companies are convinced that such programmes are

aligned  with  their business objectives.  We  are  examining

this matter in consultation with our tripartite partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, organisations adopt work-life friendly

practices  as a business imperative.  I am pleased  that  for

this  year's  Family Friendly Firms Award, 435 organisations,

compared to 344 in 2000, responded to Phase 1 of the process,

which  is  to  assess the extent of family friendliness.   Of

these, two-thirds have less than 200 employees.  So, even the

smaller  companies are coming forward, realising  that  work-family  arrangements are actually ideal and suitable for  the

modern  economy, and will help them in terms of their bottom-line and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouraging response shows their recognition of the

importance of work-life effectiveness on the bottom-line.  As

aptly  put  by a US work-life expert, who was here last  week

and  I  had  a  chance  to meet her, I quote  her,  with  her

permission,  "When  work is effective, life  benefits.   When

life is working, work benefits."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is 7 o'clock.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have half a minute left.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, at the end of the

day, I think we have to continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>



to  reach  out  to  the companies and convince  them  on  the

benefits  of  work-life initiatives.  The Work Life  Unit  in

MCDS  is  very active in this regard.  We have had a  seminar

recently  by  an  American expert for the past  three  weeks,

meeting  with  HR professionals, talking to  them  about  the

benefits of work-life arrangements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 7.00 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.
