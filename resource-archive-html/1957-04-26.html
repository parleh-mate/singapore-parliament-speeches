<div align="center"><b>NOTICES OF MOTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Moment of interruption)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please

you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I find that from the Order

Paper  two motions of mine which were on the Order

Paper yesterday are not carried over. I would draw

attention, Sir, to the procedure of this House  on

Wednesday when Members in charge of items  on  the

Order Paper were not called upon to name a date at

the   end  of  the  day,  and  I  was  under   the

impression, Sir,  that  yesterday,  as  the   day

before,   the   items  would   be   carried   over

automatically.  I  do  not mind  the  one  on  the

appointment   of  a  Commission  of   Inquiry   on

Corruption,  Sir, because the Chief  Minister  has

accepted it in full, but I am most unhappy that  a

long overdue motion on banishment should have been

dropped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[That this Assembly notes: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that the Banishment Ordinance (Cap. 127)

now  in  force  in this territory  provides

opportunities  for  completely   unfettered

and  absolutely  unchallengeable  arbitrary

exercise  by the executive of the power  to

banish  permanently domiciled  aliens  from

their   homes  and  their  work  and  their

normal surroundings;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that the population of Singapore is unique in the very large proportion of domiciled persons who are technically aliens and potential victims of the Banishment Ordinance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that the Principles and Aims presented

by  the  Labour  Front  to  the  electorate

require  inter  alia "the investigation  of

the  working of the Banishment law  with  a

view  to  repeal and revision in conformity

with  basic concepts of democratic  justice

and  the  actual needs of the  country  and

the    removal    of   opportunities    for

injustice.";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and calls upon the Government to present to this

Assembly within 30 days a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



Bill   amending   or  replacing   the   Banishment

Ordinance  (Cap.  127)  and giving  the  domiciled

aliens  of  Singapore adequate protection  against

arbitrary deprivation of their right to  live  and

work in this territory.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[That this Assembly recognising that it is of

paramount  importance to the  development  of  the

democratic  process  in Singapore  that  not  only

should  the elected representatives of the  people

and  public servants be incorrupt, but  that  they

should  be manifestly incorrupt, and their conduct

should   at   all   times  be  beyond   suspicion,

recommends to His Excellency the Governor that  an

inquiry  Commission  be  appointed  with  all  the

powers   provided   by  the  inquiry   Commissions

Ordinance, of which the Chairman should be a  High

Court Judge, with legal assistance from either the

Attorney-General's  Department  or  the  Singapore

Bar, to enquire into public anxiety on the subject

of  the  integrity of members of the Assembly  and

the City Council whether holding office or not and

all  public servants whether in Government service

or  in  the service of Statutory bodies or of  the

City Council and report thereon, and to make recommendations   as  to  what  steps  (including   the

formation  of  a  permanent  Court  with   special

powers, and strengthening of the Corrupt Practices

Investigation Bureau) should be taken  to  enforce

the  highest standards of integrity and to develop

the  confidence  of the public  in  their  elected

representatives and their public service.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The honourable Member has been good

enough  to  give me notice that he  was  going  to

raise  this point. On the first point, of  course,

on  Wednesday there was no moment of interruption.

There  was  just  a  motion for  adjournment  and,

following  past practice, all items undisposed  of

were   automatically  carried  over  to  the  next

sitting  day.  But  when there is  the  moment  of

interruption, different considerations arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under paragraph (6) of Standing Order No. 7,

inter  alia,  at  the moment of  interruption  the

Clerk  shall "read through the remaining items  of

business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



standing on the Order Paper and, as each  item  is

read,  the  Member in charge of that business  may

name  a day on which that business shall again  be

placed upon the Order Paper."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in the past, at the moment of

interruption,  suggested  to  honourable   Members

that,  unless  there  was a dissentient  voice,  I

should  take  the remaining items of  business  as

having been read and place them on the Order Paper

for   the   next  sitting  day.  That  of   course

postulates  that Members in charge of those  items

of  business  are  present. I am not  entitled  to

assume that Members in charge will not dissent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of interruption yesterday, I

noticed that both the Honourable Member for Changi

and  the Honourable Member for Cairnhill, who were

Members in charge of three of the remaining  items

of  business,  were not present. I  therefore  was

unable to follow the procedure adopted in the past

and  the  Clerk proceeded to carry out the  strict

terms of the Standing Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position now is that the Honourable Members

concerned will have to give new notices  of  their

motions in order to bring them before the Assembly

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on this point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir. In view of the

statement  made  by  the Chief Minister  that  the

Government  was going to appoint a  Commission  of

Inquiry into corruption, which meets the aims  and

purposes of the motion standing in my name on  the

Order Paper yesterday but not appearing on today's

Order  Paper,  I here and now declare  that  I  am

prepared not to proceed with it any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[That this Assembly recognizes the paramount

importance to Singapore of an incorruptible Public

Service,  and is of the opinion that a  Commission

of  inquiry  under the provisions of  the  Inquiry

Commissions  Ordinance  (Chapter  52)  should   be

appointed  (a)  to  inquire  into  the  report  of

allegations of corrupt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



practices, if any, in the Public Service, the City

Council, the Singapore Improvement Trust  and  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board; and  (b)  to  recommend

measures   for   preventing,  combating,   and

eradicating  corrupt practices  in  the  aforesaid

Public Service and organizations.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REARRANGEMENT OF ORDER OF BUSINESS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, under Standing  Order

9 (2),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on items 1 and 3 on the Order

Paper be taken after item 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is that, as a result of the

debate  on  the  Clerks Employment  Bill,  various

points  were raised and it was decided to  adjourn

the  sitting  to  today in order  to  enable  hon.

Members to have an indication of the amendments to

be  proposed.  Hon. Members are not aware  of  the

amendments to be proposed and I require  a  little

bit  more  time for my Ministry to go into  detail

into   the   points  raised  by  the  Member   for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  though  I  have not got  a  Ministry  at  my

disposal, nor various Ministers, nor the Attorney-General's   Department,  I   have   prepared   and

presented  to  this House my notice of  amendments

and  every  Member will find on his  seat  a  copy

thereof.  I  did  indicate  yesterday - and  it  was

yesterday morning at 11.30 - the exact nature of  my

amendments, reading them out. I cannot  understand

why  there  should be a postponement.  I  have  no

objection to a postponement to later today, if  it

is a question of today; but if the Merdeka motion,

which  has  been sandwiched, perhaps  symbolically

and  appropriately, between a lot of other  items,

postponed from day to day like a dirty football in

a  corner,  is not completed today,  when  are  we

going  to  have a discussion on items 1 and  3 - the

Clerks Employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



Bill and the Shop Assistants Employment Bill - which

have  waited a long time? If the Minister  intends

to  proceed  with it tomorrow, if  he  intends  to

proceed  with it on Monday, I will accept it,  but

if  he  intends  to postpone consideration  beyond

Monday, no, Sir, I would rather sit till midnight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, "evil is he

who evil thinks." There is no intention whatsoever

to  delay  the  passing of these  two  Bills.  The

Member  for Cairnhill has discussed the amendments

which he has in mind with the Attorney-General. As

far as this side of the House is concerned, we are

prepared  to  discuss  them.  There  are   certain

amendments  which we are prepared  to  accept.  My

concern  is for the other Members of the  Assembly

who,  I  feel, would like to study the  amendments

proposed. That is why I asked for these two  items

to  be  taken out of the Order Paper.  It  is  not

intended that discussion on these two motions will

be  postponed  to  an indefinite  time.  In  fact,

during  the  afternoon session, if it is  felt  by

hon.  Members that the business set down for today

could  be completed by a reasonably late  hour,  I

would  ask  for leave to suspend Standing  Orders.

Otherwise   the  sitting  will  be  adjourned   to

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on items 1 and 3 on the

Order Paper be taken after item 5.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SEAMEN'S REGISTRY BOARD BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Recommittal read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (25th April,

1957),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That clause 5, as amended, stand part of the

Bill."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That clause 5, as amended, stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  resuming from where I stopped  yesterday,  I

would like to point out a few flaws in this roster

system  in connection with the employment  of  our

seamen, seamen who are registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



in Singapore. They are faced with a number  of

disadvantages.  We are aware that ships  call  not

only  at  Singapore  but also  at  such  ports  as

Penang, Port Swettenham, Malacca, Kuching  and  so

on.  If  the  roster  system is  disliked  by  the

shipowners and they decide that they are going  to

destroy  it, then unless a parallel roster  system

could  be  instituted in other  ports,  employment

would  then  be  taken, not in Singapore,  but  in

other  Malaysia ports. I therefore  query  whether

this roster system is going to help our seamen  or

whether  it is going to prevent them from  further

getting  employment. It is very unwise,  I  think,

for  Singapore to start this roster  system  until

other  governments,  such as  the  Federation  and

Sarawak,  start  a similar one. Seamen  will  then

have a better chance of getting a job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that this roster system is prompted by

the  desire to eliminate bribery. The question  of

bribery is now being taken up by Government  which

is  appointing  a commission to enquire  into  it.

Bribery   should   be  stamped   out.   There   is

administrative difficulty; but this  problem  must

be  eradicated and we cannot eradicate it by  just

having  a  roster system. Let the people  who  are

concerned  come forward to Government  and  report

those   people  who  are  responsible   for   such

deplorable  acts which deny reasonable  employment

to seamen unless they bribe. Let them come forward

and  complain  to  the Government  and  bring  the

culprits  to  book. If Government will  take  very

strong  action  on this, then that aspect  of  the

argument will be met. However, if Government feels

that this roster system will help the seamen - but I

do  not  think  it  will - then  I  would  like  the

Government  to think carefully about it.  Let  the

system  be given a trial, if it must have a trial,

but let it be for a fixed period. If the result is

that   it   is   not   going  to   create   better

opportunities of employment for seamen,  then  the

system  must  be dropped. The idea of this  roster

system  is to protect our seamen. If it  fails  in

its  aim,  then  we must think of  other  ways  of

protecting  them.  I am of the opinion  that  this

system  will not achieve this aim and I  wish  the

Government would reconsider it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> I have just

one  small  point to make, Mr Chairman.  I  would

like to ask the Minister for Commerce and Industry

whether  it  is not a fact that under  the  roster

system the seaman will lose his freedom of choice.

He  has to take whatever job is offered to him  by

the  vessel  or the shipping company,  whether  he

likes it or not, in order to secure employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Hon. the Minister for Commerce and

Industry mentioned how a ship could have a  multi-racial  crew  and  yet at the same  time  work  in

harmony.  He  mentioned, for example - it  does  not

really  matter if I quote him accurately - that  the

engine-room  hands,  for instance,  might  all  be

Hainanese. Now I would like to ask: supposing  the

master  of  a  vessel required  two  engine-hands,

would  he,  in the ordinary way of things,  seeing

that  his choice is restricted to two rosters,  be

able to get the men he wanted?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I would like

to make a few points and also ask a few questions.

Will  the roster system consist of seamen  of  all

races  and of all nationalities, or is the  system

meant to protect only our local men? If it is  for

all seamen, is it not our duty to do first justice

to  our  seamen  who  may  remain  unemployed?  If

everyone has a chance, it may be that our own  men

may be last on the roster. Is there any preference

given to them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protests have been made by the ship-owners in

regard to the roster system when employing seamen.

On  the  other  hand, I understand the  Government

wants  the  roster system to protect  our  seamen.

"Our  seamen"  means  I hope those  who  are  born

locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two aspects to the problem. Some

say  that because of the roster system, seamen may

not  have  sufficient opportunities for employment

whether  they are of Indian, Pakistan, Chinese  or

Indonesian nationality and that they may  have  to

go to other ports in search of employment, and the

ships might avoid Singapore to get men of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



their  choice.  That is the shipowners'  point  of

view. If that happens, of course, we are bound  to

lose.  The  other  side of the  argument  is  that

Singapore   is   the   only  port   which   offers

opportunities to the employers to pick and  choose

seamen  of any nationality. Sir, there are certain

shipping  lines which employ only Chinese  seamen.

There  are  others which employ only  Indians  and

Pakistanis.  There are still others  which  employ

only  Indonesians. Sir, Singapore is a good market

for employment for seamen, but if we have a roster

system, the situation might arise where a shipping

company  might find trouble in getting  the  right

men  because  the seamen selected  for  employment

might  not  fit  in with the other seamen  already

employed; so the shipping company might have to go

elsewhere  for seamen. However, I have  no  strong

views about this. If our seamen suffer as a result

of  this  roster system, then the Government  will

have to amend the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Chairman, the

first and most important misunderstanding which is

in  the  mind of the Member for Serangoon is  that

Singapore  might lose trade as a result  of  ships

being  diverted to other ports because they cannot

recruit seamen here as they like. That is  a  very

fallacious  argument. Ships come  to  a  port  not

solely for the purpose of recruiting seamen.  They

do  so primarily if an inducement offers. If  they

can get cargo and it is paying, they will come  to

a port, if they recruit seamen while at that port,

it  is  just  incidental, if the  port  facilities

offer it. They may perhaps stop at an intermediate

port  on  their route if there is urgent necessity

to  recruit seamen, but they will not  go  out  of

their  way just to recruit them; and therefore  if

there is any loss, it is not going to be a loss of

commerce to Singapore, a loss of shipping, a  loss

of  transport facilities or diversion of  shipping

away  from Singapore, but it is going to be solely

a   matter  of  losing  employment  for  Singapore

seamen. So let us get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



this   point  clear - it  is  not  going  to  be   a

commercial loss to Singapore, it is going to be  a

loss  to  seamen as far as gaining  employment  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the representatives of the Seamen's

Council  of  Action pointblank in Committee:  "Are

you  prepared to take the risk of shipowners going

to  some  other port to recruit?" And  they  said,

"Yes, we are prepared to take the risk because  we

are thoroughly fed up with the manner in which the

seamen  are  being exploited here  in  Singapore."

Sir, these people were the representatives of  all

the  unions  in  Singapore. Should  the  Committee

accept  their word as representing the  wishes  of

the  seamen, or should it accept the word of  some

ship-owners who said that, in spite of the unions'

assurances  that  they wanted the  roster  system,

they  knew that the seamen would not want it? This

is  not  in accordance with democratic principles.

If you have representatives nominated by a certain

body,  it is their views that you should  take  as

being  representative of that section. You  cannot

claim  the oppositions views as representing them.

Therefore, if there is any diversion of recruiting

seamen away from Singapore to other ports, and  as

a  result  the seamen suffer, the best  thing  for

them to do is to throw out the representatives who

came    to   the   Select   Committee   to    make

representations  and  appoint   a   new   set   of

representatives    and   get    them    to    make

representations  to  Government  to  abolish  this

provision in the Ordinance. If that happens  after

giving the roster system a fair trial - it will take

a  year to implement it in the first instance - I am

sure  that  the Minister (whoever he  is  at  that

moment)   will  take  steps  to  prevent  anything

detrimental  happening  to  the  people  or  to  a

section  of the people of Singapore and  therefore

steps will be taken to rescind that portion of the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon raised the point as to

how  we  are going to help the Malays  if  we  are

going to have a sectional or racial register. What

happens  if one particular race is not represented

on  the  register?  I think a  similar  point  was

touched upon by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Telok Ayer. Sir, when I  mentioned  a

separate register for Malays, a separate  one  for

Chinese which is subdivided into sections for  the

various  clans,  the same system  could  apply  to

other  races. But if there are not many seamen  of

other  races,  probably we could  have  a  general

roster   for   them:  for  example,  Indians   and

Pakistanis.  These seamen are only  a  handful  in

Singapore.  The majority of seamen are Malays  and

Chinese. Therefore it does not mean that the other

races  who  are domiciled here would suffer  as  a

result  of  this  roster. But we  cannot  force  a

shipowner  to  take on a person of a certain  race

whom  he does not want, because that would not  be

conducive to a happy atmosphere on board the ship.

So if a shipowner wants two Hainanese, he could go

straight  on  to  the Hainanese category  of  that

roster   and   recruit   them.   But   which   two

Hainanese - Mr A and Mr B, or Mr  C  and  Mr  D?

That   is  where,  as  far  as  the  employer   is

concerned, the shoe pinches - I know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seamen from other territories cannot go on

to  this register in Singapore. They are barred by

this  Ordinance.  But seamen could  be  signed  on

outside,  say Hongkong, and brought to  Singapore.

We  cannot  stop that because those are reciprocal

facilities  which  other ports offer  to  us.  Our

seamen  can  be signed on here and flown  over  to

Hongkong or Sydney or any other port and taken  on

board there, and if we stop that, then those other

countries will stop the same facilities to our seamen. It is possible that Penang or Malacca or Port

Swettenham might have a better system of selecting

crews and thereby attract shipowners to make their

selection of seamen there, but in the past it  has

been  proved,  as the Member for  Telok  Ayer  has

pointed  out,  that Singapore can offer  the  most

multiracial type of crews, and most of the  Malays

who  are  recruited from Singapore are  Federation

men - they are from Malacca and Johore. Besides, not

all  the  ships  which call at Singapore  call  at

Malacca.  In  fact, I do not think  any  big  ship

calls  at Malacca, and only some of them  call  at

Penang and Port Swettenham. Our immigration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



laws are tight. We do not allow any seamen to come

into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is not the result of my being

moved  by  the  pleas of the Seamen's  Council  of

Action to do something for the seamen. I have been

in  the Ministry watching how things are going on,

and  my heart bleeds for these unfortunate seamen.

I  have  not got the eloquent language  which  the

Member for Cairnhill has at his command, but I say

in  all sincerity that I feel sorry for them. They

are in fact in a much worse plight than the clerks

are, because they are not educated. So if you talk

of  asking them to go and report corruption, it is

impossible for them. To a person who is illiterate

and  who is offered a job but is asked to pay  $50

in  order to get it, his first inclination will be

to  pay the $50 and get the job. He will rather do

this  than  get involved if he goes  to  a  police

station where he will have to spend time reporting

this  case of corruption. He will then have to  go

and  give evidence and, for all you know, his word

will  not be believed because he is held to  be  a

man of straw. It will be his word against that  of

an  official in the Seamen's Bureau or an employee

of  the  shipping company who will  probably  have

backing,  and who will say "This man is  a  liar",

and probably the magistrate will believe him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spent a lot of time over this Bill.

I  have studied every word of it so that it should

be as perfect as humanly possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the Opposition's arguments are

based  on the idea that the roster system  is  not

going  to  be  successful.  Now  why  should  they

conceive  the  idea that it is  not  going  to  be

successful? First of all, in most cases, most  of

the  employers will not have to go to the  roster.

They are allowed to sign on their own crew as many

times  as they like, which means that probably  60

or  70  per  cent of the crew can be re-signed  on

every  occasion, and they will only have to go  to

the roster for the wastage and for replacement  of

that  part of the crew who go on leave or  die  or

leave their employment, which probably will not be

a  big percentage. Now, when they go to the roster

for that small percentage,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



if they can get efficient seamen from the

race  and  even the clan that they want, then  why

should  the system not succeed? The only hindrance

is   that   they  cannot  get  the   person   they

particularly want - Mr A or Mr B - but they can  get

efficient men from the race or the clan that  they

want, and they can have two choices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if a man is not efficient, he has very

little  chance  of  getting on  the  register  and

subsequently  on the roster. If hon. Members  have

studied  the Bill, I will point out clause  7  (c)

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may make rules not inconsistent

with this Ordinance for the following purposes-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to prescribe the conditions under which the

Board  may  cancel,  suspend  or  alter  the

registration of seamen;"



<br><br>and  the Minister naturally will take advice front

the  Board before he makes these rules which means

that the Minister could, under the rules, make  it

a  condition that a seaman who has not served well

or who has been guilty of inefficiency or laziness

would go down on the roster and be penalised,  and

so  on, so  that  there is every chance  of  only

efficient seamen being put on the roster. Again in

clause 8 (f):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Board may make regulations...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the particulars to be furnished by

applicants for registration as seamen and by

registered  seamen and masters or employers,

upon   the   discharge  of  such  registered

seamen."



<br><br>The  masters  or employers, when they discharge  a

seaman,  will give particulars of that  seaman  to

the Board and the Board will then be in a position

to  know what type of seaman is going to he placed

on  the roster and they would probably make  rules

to  fit him in an appropriate place on the roster

if  he  is not a good man. So that again goes  for

efficiency. My purpose is to get efficiency in our

seamen  but,  at the same time, not  to  get  them

exploited by the shipowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to get on the register, a seaman must,

first  of all, undergo a medical test. That  would

probably eliminate half the number who are on  the

present register because many of them are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



medically fit - I believe probably at least about 30

per  cent.  Then after that, I am  sure  that  the

Board  will  put a qualification and say  that  he

must  be  experienced as a seaman for a number  of

years  or a number of months (it is up to them  to

specify it). But there again, that shows that  the

man has got the necessary experience and I am sure

that  the Board could ask the Minister to  make  a

regulation  saying that he must have  had  a  good

discharge. If those conditions can be  put  up  by

the  Board and can be made by the Minister,  I  do

not  see  why  the shipowners should  worry  about

efficient  seamen  not being available,  in  other

words,  the  seamen who go on the roster  will  be

bona fide seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect, Sir, from hearing the Member for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) that the threat  of

some  ship-owners  to go and  recruit  from  other

ports - and probably they may carry out that  threat

just  out  of  spite - is because they do  not  want

anything to fetter their choice. They do not  want

anything   to   hinder  them  from  choosing   the

particular persons they want and just out of spite

they might go out of Singapore for a few months to

recruit from outside. But I do hope that they give

up  that  idea. Our local companies, many  Chinese

companies  and  the  Straits  Steamship   Company,

employ almost all their crew from Singapore and  I

am  sure  that they will not wish to  go  outside.

They  will prefer to carry on here so long as  the

system is workable. If the system is not workable,

then  it is in the interest of Singapore to change

that  system  and I will see that  it  is  changed

then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this assurance to the House also that I

shall  be  watching very closely the  workings  of

this Board and I shall not hesitate to remove  any

member of the Board whom I find to be obstructive,

whether  he is a trade unionist or whether  he  is

representing the shipping interests,  and  I  have

powers  under  clause 3 (6) where it says  "unless

earlier removed by the Minister" and that power is

expressly put for the purpose of-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Benevolent dictatorship!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is necessary at times;

when  you know that the affairs of seamen  are  in

such  chaotic conditions and when you know that  a

certain  section  of  members  are  out  to  wreck

anything  that you do. Some sections could  remain

away  from the Board and refuse to form  a  quorum

and  therefore  the Board could not  function  and

have  meetings.  Now if that happens  or  if  they

wilfully obstruct, then I am going to remove  them

under  that subclause and I purposely put in  that

power. If any Member of the House has any doubt as

to  my  ability to administer that or to  my  bona

fide intentions, I would ask them to move a motion

to  delete  that.  In fact, I  did  point  it  out

yesterday or the day before when the debate  arose

on some other Bill on the same clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> I am sorry to flog this

point, Sir, and I will be very brief about  it.  I

hope I am not being very obtuse but it seems to me

that,  in  fact, there are not two rosters,  there

are  two  lists of choice; but if you  place  your

Pakistanis,  your  Indians or  your  Hainanese  on

separate  lists, then, in fact, there are  several

rosters. Would the Minister agree with that?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Bill says "roster

or rosters" and again it gives power to sub-divide

roster  or rosters into categories. It is a matter

of  name. You can call it by any name you like but

you  have  separate  lists. The seamen  themselves

also  have  been given a chance to have a  choice.

There  is  a clause which provides that the  Board

will  decide,  if a seaman refuses employment,  on

what his position on the roster should be. For the

first  refusal, I am sure the Board will say  that

there  will  be  no penalty but for  a  subsequent

refusal,  they might put him down a few places  on

the roster; so that the seaman has also a choice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On a point of information,

to  Singapore to join his ship when it calls here?

Is that possible?

<div align="center"><b>MUSLIMS BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>10.39 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the motion

standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Muslims Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper  No.

L.A. 5 of 1957, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been a long time in

Committee. It is a measure that has been  debated,

I  believe,  not only in this session but  in  the

previous session of the Assembly, for more than  a

year  now  and  the Committee has  gone  into  the

matter very thoroughly and examined many witnesses

in great detail. Most of the time of the Committee

was  spent on that controversial clause 47 of  the

old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



Bill  renumbered clause 41 in the  present  tabled

Bill.  The  clause  dealt  with  the  question  of

whether  the  validity of Muslim wills  should  be

restricted only to wills or portions thereof  that

are in accordance with the Law of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Members will recall that the Select

Committee   was  given  a  special  directive   to

consider  the  desirability of  including  such  a

provision in the Bill. Detailed examination of the

witnesses revealed that the overwhelming  majority

of  Muslims were strongly of the view that such  a

provision  should be included. The same  arguments

that   have   been  brought  out  in  this   House

previously against such a provision were put up by

a  group  of  two witnesses but a  host  of  other

witnesses rebutted these arguments again on  lines

similar  to  those brought out by me in  answering

criticisms  at  the Second Reading stage  of  this

Bill  in November last year. On balance, Sir,  the

Committee  felt  that, since there  was  a  strong

desire  amongst  Muslims  for  incorporating  this

provision and since there was genuine concern  for

those  rightful heirs who might otherwise be  left

unprovided for, provision should be entered in the

Bill as set out in clause 41.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I have spoken on this platform before that I never

take  part  in  religious controversies.  Being  a

layman,   I   leave  this  job  to  the   experts.

Personally,  I consider that religion  is  between

man  and his Creator. No man is perfect except the

prophets and one has to answer to his Creator  for

omissions  and commissions whether he  follows  or

does not follow his religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been placed on the Select Committee

and  I belong to the Muslim faith. If anyone  born

of  any faith says that his faith is so and so, he

must be true and steadfast to his religion when it

comes to legislation. There can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



no  two  opinions of any religionist going against

one's own religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the first object of this Bill is to

protect Muslim women against unscrupulous men  who

abuse the right to marry four women and chuck them

off  as  chattel if they so desire  but,  strictly

following  the  religion, it  is  not  so.  It  is

enjoined in the religion that when marrying again,

the  husband has got to give his second, third and

fourth  wives equal love, it means that it is  not

possible  for anyone to marry more than one  wife,

excepting when there is no issue, and so on.  Now,

the  whole  thing has been abused in this  country

and  it  is  very necessary to give protection  to

Muslim  women.  This Bill should  have  come  into

force  long ago and should not have taken a  year.

This  is  something good in order to  protect  the

women  from  being exploited by unscrupulous  men.

However,  the discussion went from this  to  other

issues   of  inheritance  and  that  is  how   the

controversy arose and time has been taken.  It  is

very unfortunate that it took such a long time  to

get  in  the  main object which is to protect  the

women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is no objection at all to that

portion  of  the  Bill  as far  as  marriages  and

divorces  are  concerned. There  is  no  objection

whatsoever to the suggested clause 47 which is now

the  present  clause 41 as far as  any  Muslim  is

concerned. When a Muslim is asked to vote, he  has

got  to  follow the Islamic law. Now here,  I  may

say,  Sir, that the Koran has stood the  test  for

1,400  years. Nobody has been able to  change  it,

even a comma.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversy comes to clause 42 as it is now

in  the present Bill. Now, Sir, Singapore has  got

no  State  religion.  The argument  has  been  put

forward  that if the Government or the Assemblymen

are willing to allow the Muslims to enact some  of

the  laws  of  Islam  into a Bill,  why  not  take

advantage of it? I certainly agree that we should.

At  the  same time, if there is any defect  or  if

there  is any law in existence against the Koranic

laws, that should be amended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



too.  As a matter of fact, any other person  or  a

group of persons of different religions could come

before  this Assembly to present a Bill that  they

should  be  governed by their  own  religions.  Of

course,  the  Muslims would have no  objection  to

that as the non-Muslims are allowing us to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I draw the attention of the House to the

proceedings  of the Select Committee meeting  held

on  26th  February, 1957. Sir, clause  42  of  the

Bill, as it stands now, has got a proviso reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that any of the next of kin who is not

a  Muslim  shall  be  entitled  to  share  in  the

distribution as though he were a Muslim."



<br><br>Sir,  my contention is this. Are we allowing  the

enactment  of laws according to Islamic  law?  Are

the   Muslims  in  this  Assembly  going  to  vote

according  to  Koranic law? If they are  Muslims,

are  they not bound to follow the Koran,  if  they

believe in it? Now, there are persons who may  do

certain things for worldly gain but here they will

not only be judged by their God but they also will

be  judged  by  their Muslim  voters  if  they  go

against  the Koran. Sir, there was evidence  taken

on  this.  The  majority view  agreed  that  there

should  be  nothing put in which  is  against  the

Koran  and that that proviso should be taken  off.

However,  there was a minor difference of opinion.

Now, Sir, it is not a matter of opinion. The Koran

lays  down certain laws which must be followed  by

every Muslim. There is no question of opinion.  In

that  Committee, Sir, I asked those  who  differed

whether  we could have expert advice. As a  matter

of  fact,  expert advice was given but, from  26th

February,  1957 up till now, they have had  enough

time  that  if  at all they had wanted  to  follow

their  religion,  they should have  by  this  time

sought expert advice. There is no excuse for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to take a little more time. I

know  that  the  majority of the Members  of  this

House  are  not Muslims and they may not  be  very

much  interested  in  this question.  The  law  of

inheritance according to the Koran is this.  If  a

girl who is not a Christian or a Jewess marries  a

Muslim, she and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



her  children are not entitled to any inheritance.

Also  by religion, he is not allowed to marry such

a  girl. A Muslim is not allowed to get married to

any   other  non-Muslim  girl  except  to  a  girl

belonging to the faith of Christianity or Judaism.

There  is no bar against such a marriage  but  the

expert opinion and the Koran says that she or  her

children   will   not  get  any   share   of   the

inheritance.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I would like to continue. If it

is  not on a point of order, I do not like  to  be

interrupted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the position. According to the Koran,

this  proviso is un-Islamic and it should be taken

off  the  Bill.  Sir Sayed Ibrahim  Alsagoff,  the

Chairman of the Muslim Advisory Board, who  is  an

Arab by race, born in Mecca and well versed in his

religion,  has  written a letter - as  I  said

previously, this will not interest the  non-Muslim

-   Members  of  this  House  but  I  pray   their

indulgence - dated 21st October, 1956, to  the  Hon.

the  Chief Secretary and a copy has been forwarded

to  me.  This  has been mentioned  in  the  Select

Committee meeting held on 26th February, 1957,  in

which he asked for the deletion of the proviso  to

the  old clause 41 which is, of course, now clause

42. Well, that is also the opinion of the Chairman

of  the  Muslim Advisory Board. Now, whatever  the

advice or opinion may be, what does the Koran say?

Are we going to enact a law for the Muslims? If it

is  to  be  a  law for the Muslims, it  should  be

according to the Koran and nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move an amendment to the

motion, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the motion, to add the words

"subject to the recommittal of the Bill in respect

of   clause  42  to  a  Committee  of  the   whole

Assembly".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have that in writing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I propose to move an

amendment  to clause 42, to leave out the  proviso

reading:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that any of the next of kin who is not

a  Muslim  shall  be  entitled  to  share  in  the

distribution as though he were a Muslim."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will be my amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir,

personally, my request will be that those  Muslims

in  this House who accept the Muslim faith  should

by right vote-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been considering this

point  very carefully and I do consider  that  any

remark of that nature must, of necessity, be taken

as   an  attempt  to  influence  Members  of  this

Assembly to vote in such a way that if they do not

vote  in  the  way indicated by the  Member,  they

might  open  themselves  to  either  spiritual  or

temporal injury. That is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I accept your ruling, Sir. Now,

this is my amendment, Sir, and I expect I can  say

that Muslims should abide by their religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No seconder? The motion fails. The

The  principles as laid down in the Bill meet with

the  wishes and desires of the Muslims in general.

A  Bill  of  this nature has, in fact,  been  long

I  fully  support that the Bill now be adopted  by

this Assembly.

for  a  long  time, since 1954.  The  majority  of

to introduce this Muslims Bill in order to satisfy

the Muslim population in Singapore with regard  to

inheritance. I, Sir, as a Malay and a believer  in

the

devolution of property of Muslims, it is a matter

which they should properly decide for themselves.

We support the Report in its present form because

we  understand  that the majority of  the  Muslim

Members on the Committee, and the majority of the

Muslim   community   representatives   who   have

appeared  before the Committee, support the  Bill

in its present form.



<br><br>11.04 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my opening speech on moving  the

motion, I purposely did not touch upon clause 42,

and this proviso to the clause, as I thought that

it  had  been sufficiently debated in  Committee,

where   the  majority  of  the  Members  of   the

Committee being Muslims had rejected the deletion

of this proviso, and as I thought that the Member

for  Telok  Ayer had been satisfied. Had  I  been

aware,  Sir,  that  he  was  going  to  move   an

amendment, I would have touched upon it,  and  he

might  then  have  seen  fit  not  to  move   his

amendment; he might probably have been  convinced

by  my  arguments. However, I think it is now  my

duty - even at this late stage - to say something on

this   clause  in  order  to  clear  up   certain

misunderstandings which the Member's  speech  has

created,  probably through no fault of  his  own - perhaps he himself is not clear in his mind as to

what the intentions are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much mention has been made that "according to

the   Koran  this  proviso  is  un-Islamic",  and

"according to Koranic law this is so  on  and  so

forth".  However, although the  Koran  was  often

mentioned, it was not quoted. That, Sir, is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



point - the  part  of the Koran which  purports  to

forbid  Muslims  from giving  a  share  of  their

property to non-Muslim heirs was not quoted. Sir,

it  is  easy to say "according to this, according

to that" without quoting anything definite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two points I would like to make.

First  the Koran is the fountain of Islamic  law;

there is no doubt about that. But Islamic law has

been  evolved by Muslim jurists over  many  years

since  the  birth  of  the Islamic  religion;  no

doubt,  they have based Islamic law on the Koran,

but  they  filled  in gaps here  and  there  from

Hadith.  Now, Hadith  are  the  sayings  of  the

Prophet  and  there  is a difference  of  opinion

between  the various sects of Muslims on  Hadith.

Some  sects accept certain parts of Hadith,  some

do  not. The second point is that you find  among

believers  in Islam there are so many  sects,  or

firkas, as they are called. The major one are the

Sunnis,  and  in Malaya they form the predominant

majority. The Shias are only a handful here. Now,

it is true to say that, according to Islamic law,

this  proviso should be removed; but  it  is  not

true  to  say that according to Koranic law,  for

there  is  no specific mention in the Koran  that

non-Muslims  may not or should not share  in  the

property of a deceased parent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, touching on this proviso - prior to

1924, the law applicable here on the distribution

of  an  intestate deceased Muslim was not  Muslim

law but English law. That English law was changed

by  the  Mohammedan (Amendment) Ordinance,  1923,

which came into effect on 1st January, 1924. From

that  date, the law states that an estate,  in  a

case   of   intestacy,  shall   be   administered

according to Mohammedan law except in so  far  as

such  law  is opposed to any local custom  which,

prior  to  January 1924, has the  force  of  law,

provided that any of the next of kin who is not a

Mohammedan  shall be entitled  to  share  in  the

distribution as though he were a Mohammedan. From

1924  to the present time, this provision is part

of the law of the Colony; yet no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



good  Muslim  has  taken  any  objection  to   it.

Probably  all  Muslims have not  abided  by  their

religion, according to the Member for Telok Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim Advisory Board, Sir, as far back as

1955, made representations on the inclusion of the

testacy  clause  that  wills  should  be  executed

according to Islamic law, but it did not take  any

objection to this particular proviso. It was  only

in  October  1956,  when some  elements  began  an

agitation  that  the  proviso  was  un-Islamic  in

nature, that the Board was probably forced to make

objection. Even then, they did not press  it  with

as much vigour as they have done in the other one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is in force in this Colony a

Civil  Marriage Ordinance according to  which  any

marriage  made  under it is  valid.  If  a  Muslim

contracts  a  civil  marriage  with  a  non-Muslim

woman, that marriage is therefore valid and she is

his  wife according to the law of the Colony, even

though  the Islamic law says she is not his  wife,

if  she does not belong to followers of the  Book,

that  is,  if  she  is not a Jew or  a  Christian.

According to the law of the Colony, she is a legal

wife and her children are legal heirs. It would be

inequitable, therefore, to cut off that  wife  (or

her children) from sharing in any property left by

her Muslim husband.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a book written by a prominent

Muslim jurist, Mohameddan Law, by Syed Ameer  Ali,

who is often quoted in the courts in India. On the

proviso  that non-Muslim heirs should not  inherit

from a Muslim parent, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These provisos do not owe their origins to

religious   exclusiveness  but  to  the  political

necessities  of  the early Commonwealth,  when  an

unbeliever   was  an  inveterate  enemy   and   an

appostate a traitor."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another big argument against deleting

the proviso, and that is that according to Islamic

law, not only is a non-Muslim not allowed to share

in  the property of a Muslim, but a Muslim is  not

allowed  to share in the property of a non-Muslim.

This again is stated by Ameer Ali, who writes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the Sunni law, a Muslim does not inherit

from  a non-Muslim, nor does a non-Muslim inherit

from a Muslim";



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



so  that  when you have parents who are of another

religion  and  their children are  converted  into

Islam,   those   children  cannot  inherit   their

parents'  property.  If  you  are  going   to   be

equitable, to see both sides of the argument,  and

prevent  non-Muslim heirs from participating,  you

have, according to Sunni law, similarly to prevent

Muslim  heirs - and  Sunnis predominate  in  Malaya.

What  will  happen in countries like India,  where

many  converts to Islam have been made from Hindus

and  others?  -all  their children,  if  they  are

Sunnis,  will not be able to inherit.  (I  do  not

know about Shias or other sects).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my contention, therefore, is that it is not

correct to stipulate that we must go "according to

the Koran" and say that we are not following it by

refusing  to accept the request of the Member  for

Telok  Ayer - we are sticking to common sense:  and,

in  a multi-racial society like ours in Singapore,

where there is close affinity between the races, I

do  not  think  it  is  fair that  Muslims  should

deprive  their  wives, who may be non-Muslims  but

who  are legally married to them under civil  law,

and  their  legitimate children  from  sharing  in

their  property; and it is also not fair that  the

children of legally wedded non-Muslim parents,  if

such   children  are  converted  to   Islam,   are

prevented from sharing in their parents' estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move my motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and

agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS IN LONDON, 1957</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

consent to move, and I now hereby move, the motion

standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) takes note of the Report of the Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in  March

and  April, 1957, as contained in Sessional  Paper

No.  Misc.  2 of 1957, and approves the points  on

which agreement has been reached; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves the stand of the All-Party

Delegation   in   not  accepting   the   condition

stipulated in paragraph 30 of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in rising to move this motion, I want to

make it clear that this is not a Government motion

at  all.  The subject of this motion  is  not  the

product  of  the Government; it is the product  of

the  united  efforts of the All-Party  Delegation,

and  I  am  moving this motion as  leader  of  the

delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man who blazed the trail for a

constitutional   advance   is   the   Member   for

Cairnhill.  It  was  he who  mobilised  the  first

campaign and led an All-Party Mission to London in

April   1956.  He  fought  hard  and   he   fought

vigorously for us, but it was a matter for  regret

that  the  mission did not succeed.  Although  the

mission did not succeed, Sir, it had done at least

one  good  thing, and we must not forget this;  it

opened  the way for the next round, and the credit

for this rightly goes to the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I took over office as Chief Minister in

June  last year and pledged to have another  crack

at  the  Colonial Office. Having been a member  of

the  Marshall  Mission, I  had  the  advantage  of

personal knowledge of the way the fight went,  and

how and why it went wrong. With this advantage,  I

was  able  to  plan, and plan early, the  strategy

that could give us a good chance of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was Minister for Labour and Welfare in

the  Marshall Government, I accepted an invitation

to   attend  a  conference  in  Oxford  of  Labour

Ministers of colonial territories. This  was  held

in  June-July 1956; and when I took over the chief

ministership, I decided that I should attend  this

conference, and I took the opportunity it afforded

me to see the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

I  had two rounds of friendly sparring with him. I

came  away with the knowledge that the going  then

was  still  tough and that an early official  bout

was  inadvisable. I went round meeting people  and

making plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited London again, Sir, in December, this

time  to fix a date for the Constitutional  Talks,

to  draw up an agenda and to have preliminary  and

unofficial  discussions  with  the  Secretary   of

State.  I took the opportunity it afforded  me  to

meet  more  people  and make further  plans.  This

time,  I  returned to Singapore  more  hopeful  of

success  in the forthcoming talks. But I  did  not

allow  this hope to blunt the strategy that I  had

already  made  up in my mind, and it  was  that  I

should strive for an All-Party unity which was  to

be the magnetic force to attract success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step was to call an All-Party

Conference.  The  first meeting was  held  on  7th

February  and altogether the conference met  eight

times.  The  conference drew up its blueprint  and

this  was incorporated in a White Paper which  was

presented to this Assembly as Sessional Paper  No.

Misc.  1  of  1957.  A  special  sitting  of  this

Assembly  was  called  for  5th  March,  when  the

blueprint of the All-Party Conference was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



debated,  and it was heartening to the  people  of

Singapore  that this national issue  received  the

unanimous  support  of  the Assembly.  Thus,  Sir,

there  was unity of purpose in the Assembly; there

was  unity of purpose in the All-Party Conference;

and  what was left to be proved was unity  in  the

All-Party Delegation that was entrusted with  this

mandate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left Singapore leading this delegation

confident in this unity, and I am happy and  proud

to  repeat  in  this Assembly that this  wonderful

unity  in the delegation during the talks and,  in

fact,  during our stay in London, was  the  source

from  which  we  derived  our  strength,  and  was

responsible  for the successful discharge  of  our

mandate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London knowing what we had to do, and

the unity in the delegation provided the means  to

do  it. The Press communique that was released  at

the  end of each session was all the news that  we

allowed to go through. There were no leakages  and

no  sensational statements by any  member  in  the

delegation. We were convinced that this course  of

action  was  a  necessary and wise one,  but  this

should  not  be taken to mean that all  was  plain

sailing   in  the  conference  chamber.   It   was

certainly  not  so. The good ship  "The  State  of

Singapore" did encounter rough weather, but we did

not  flounder  nor  founder because  our  teamwork

pulled us through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, let us turn our attention to

Sessional  Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1957.  This  is  a

Report  of the Constitutional Conference:  let  me

repeat,  this  is  a Report and not  an  agreement

signed by both parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Look at paragraph 12.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This Report is self-explanatory and I do not propose to go into

details.  I will, however, touch upon one  or  two

important aspects in my opening speech, and should

there  be  any  point on which hon. Members  would

like  elucidation, the members  of  the  All-Party

Delegation would supply the information.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of this Report side by side with the

mandate that was given to the All-Party Delegation

at  the sitting of the Assembly of 5th March  will

disclose   that   the  mandate  has   been   fully

satisfied, except on two points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is paragraph 16 (i) of Sessional

Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That responsibility for the relations of the

Singapore   Government  and  the  United   Kingdom

Government shall be transferred from the Secretary

of  State  for  the Colonies to the  Secretary  of

State for Commonwealth Relations."



<br><br>Sir,  the  answer  to  this  is  to  be  found  in

paragraph  55 of the Report contained in Sessional

Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1957, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Conference took note that the Singapore

Delegation  had expressed the desire in  paragraph

16  of  the Report of the All-Party Conference  in

Singapore, contained in Sessional Paper No.  Misc.

1  of  1957  for  the Legislative  Assembly,  that

responsibility for relations between the Singapore

Government   and  the  United  Kingdom  Government

should be transferred from the Secretary of State

for  the  Colonies to the Secretary of  State  for

Commonwealth  Relations.  The  Chairman  explained

that  Her  Majesty's  Government  understood   the

feelings which prompted this request, but that  it

was  not  possible under the present  division  of

responsibilities between the two offices  for  Her

Majesty's Government to agree that the affairs  of

Singapore   should   he   transferred    to    the

Commonwealth Relations Office."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanation given to us, we can safely

infer   that  some  change  in  the  division   of

responsibilities  is  afoot.  Moreover,  Sir,  the

decision of the All-Party Conference was that  the

All-Party Delegation should press for this demand,

but  not to make an issue of it. We have therefore

discharged the trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is paragraph 13 (b) of

Sessional Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government rates of pay and conditions of

service to apply to such employees",



<br><br>that  is, civilian employees in the armed  forces.

Sir,  the answer again is to be found in paragraph

2 of Appendix C to the Report, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government indicated that they

could  not bind themselves to relate the rates  of

pay   and  other  conditions  of  service  of  the

employees  of the Service Departments  exclusively

to those enjoyed by employees of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>



the   Singapore   Government.  In  following   the

generality  of 'good local employers' due  account

was always taken of the rates and other conditions

in   both  the  public  and  private  sectors   of

employment."



<br><br>Sir, this demand is not a constitutional issue  at

all  but  was  included in order that  the  matter

could  be  pressed  in  London  with  the  Service

Departments.  It  is clear from  paragraph  11  of

Sessional Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957 that there  is

to   be  no  change  in  the  responsibilities  of

external  defence and external affairs apart  from

the  control of trade and cultural relations which

should be vested in the Singapore Government.  The

Government, however, is interested in this  matter

and  will  render all possible assistance  to  the

workers' organisations concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to touch on paragraphs 52,

53  and 54 of the Report. These refer to the  date

of  introduction of the new constitution. The view

of  the  All-Party  Delegation,  as  expressed  in

paragraph 54, correctly reflects the view  of  the

Assembly  as  made  known at its  sitting  on  5th

March. The Government does not wish to hold office

under  the  present constitution  longer  than  is

necessarily imposed by the desire of the  Assembly

to  give every opportunity to all persons who will

acquire  citizenship rights to have a say  in  the

choice  of  the  new  government  under  the   new

constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You can do that this month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Government will do

everything in its power to expedite the fulfilment

of this desire.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The instalment plan!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And now I come to the second

part of my motion, and that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"approves the stand of the All-Party Delegation

in  not  accepting  the  condition  stipulated  in

paragraph 30 of the Report."



<br><br>Paragraph 30, Sir, clearly states the stand  taken

by  the  All-Party Delegation. We had no directive

from our various Parties on this issue, nor had we

a mandate from this Assembly, but as it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



made  clear  to  us that Her Majesty's  Government

intended  to  impose this condition  unilaterally,

and  in  exercise  of the powers still  vested  in

them,  the  All-Party Delegation decided  that  we

should only take note of this intention and report

to  this Assembly. The Parties represented in this

Assembly, Sir, now have had time to consider  this

condition, and this will no doubt be made known to

us in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State explained to the

delegation  that this was a temporary restriction.

It  was  only to apply to elections to  the  first

Legislative  Assembly under the  new  constitution

and  that  only detainees whose appeals  had  been

rejected   by  the  Appeals  Tribunal   would   be

affected, and Her Majesty's Government intended to

impose this, sincerely believing that this was for

the good of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party has given full consideration to

this  condition, and has decided  to  approve  the

stand  taken  by the All-Party Delegation  in  not

accepting  the condition. As the Party  in  power,

there is another reason why we cannot accept  this

condition.  We  will be placed  in  the  invidious

position  of having our actions against subversive

elements being twisted by uncharitable people as a

measure  against our political opponents and  thus

prevent  them  from  standing for  elections.  The

actions  that  we have taken in the past  and  may

take  in  the future while we are still in  office

are   and  will  be  in  the  discharge   of   our

responsibilities to look after the welfare of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if my motion is accepted under the first

part, the drafting of the new constitution can  be

proceeded   with   without  further   delay.   The

Government can introduce a Citizenship Bill-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - which has to be prepared

in consultation with Her Majesty's Government, see

paragraph  49  of the report, and  implement  such

other action as to expedite the elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In due course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And under the second part,

the  Secretary of State can be moved to reconsider

the   imposition  of  Her  Majesty's  Government's

condition precedent to the new constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying once

again in this Assembly that we are grateful to the

Government  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   and

particularly  to the Chief Minister,  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman,  for  their  assistance  and  co-operation

which  made  possible the creation of an  Internal

Security Council under the new constitution  on  a

three-three-one basis. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second  the  motion. As a member of the  All-Party

Delegation,  I  believe  we  have  discharged  our

duties  to this Assembly. We have carried out  the

mandate  given  to us by the people  of  Singapore

expressed  through  the various political  Parties

and  through  the Assembly here. We believe,  Sir,

that  we  have  secured the  maximum  possible.  I

remember  that last year we failed  and  after  we

failed,  some  attempt  was  made  to  revive  the

conference, and if we had secured agreement  then,

comparatively  speaking, we would still  have  got

more   this  year.  The  failure  last  year   was

regretted,  because it would have  been  one  year

earlier for us to have self-government if  we  had

secured  agreement. We would probably  be  in  the

midst  of an election today. However, all that  is

past  and we have started anew. We went to  London

again this year and we got what we wanted. I  know

there might be criticism that what we have got  is

too  little.  People may say that we  should  have

elections    immediately,   but   the    All-Party

Delegation had in mind that the people who are  to

enjoy citizenship rights should be given a chance.

Some  people  are  of the view that  it  could  be

implemented  immediately  and  that  these  people

should  be  given,  say, two  months  to  register

themselves. However, to be democratic and  knowing

as   we  do  that  not  all  people  in  Singapore

understand everything told to them once or  twice,

we  feel that we should give them more opportunity

to  be well versed in what is imparted to them and

to   exercise  their  right  to  become  Singapore

citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Whilst we sit in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Furthermore, Sir, since the

citizenship law - and we agreed to this  during  the

last  time we met - cannot be promulgated  at  once,

there  must be consultation. Time must be  allowed

for the passage of the Bill - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think in this particular

debate  I  must  insist that there should  not  be

unseemly interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. I

am quite used to such interruptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom too must amend its

Nationality  Act because we have  just  got  self-government. It is not independence, and as it  is,

we  are still to some extent governed by the  laws

in the United Kingdom. I believe those who have so

much  concern for the people who will be  eligible

to  become  citizens of Singapore  should  have  a

thought for them and should devise ways and  means

of  letting  them  make  the  right  decisions  to

shoulder responsibilities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably another criticism may be levelled at

the  delegation  about the Security  Council,  and

they  may  say that this gives the United  Kingdom

Government  a  great deal of power. Compared  with

what  we would have got last year, I think we  are

in a much better position, because now we have not

only  the three votes of the Singapore Government,

but   we  also  have  the  Federation  vote.   The

Federation  vote,  I think, is  one  of  the  most

impartial  votes which we could get.  On  the  one

hand,  I  understand they have made  an  agreement

with the United Kingdom on a matter of defence. On

the   other  hand,  however,  they  are  a   close

neighbour  of Singapore and understand Singapore's

problems much better, and I believe they will vote

in a very fair way, both to the United Kingdom and

to  Singapore.  In  fact, they  should  vote  more

favourably  to  Singapore  because  events  taking

place in Singapore will also affect them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the last part of the motion, we are of

the opinion that the condition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



stipulated in paragraph 30 of the Report could not

be  accepted  because it is undemocratic.  We  are

trying  to sell democracy and we feel that  if  we

are  to fight undemocratic elements, we should use

democratic means to fight them. We know that if we

fight in a democratic way we will win in the  end,

whereas probably we will be accused of winning our

battle  if  we  tie the hands of the  undemocratic

elements. That condition however is imposed on  us

by  the United Kingdom. They have the power to  do

so at present. They mean to use that power. We are

still  subjected to that power, but  we  can  only

shake  that  off  after we  have  held  our  first

elections, and if we want to shake that  condition

off, we must hold an election-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not now, but as early as we

can  after  we have considered the rights  of  the

people  whom we have always in mind.  We  want  to

give them those rights. Sir, I beg to second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in this motion, which came at the tail of  a

long  list of business and kicked around from  day

to  day  like  an unwanted football,  and  in  the

speeches  in support of this motion, not a  single

time  was  merdeka mentioned - not  even  tiga  suku

merdeka.  But  let  me  name  it - tiga  suku  busok

merdeka. They know, and we know, that what is here

before  us  is a request that we nail down  for  a

further  indefinite period with our own hands,  we

hammer  in  the  nails  of colonialism  which  was

imposed on us by force before - that is no fault  of

ours.  But now with our own hands we are to  rivet

the  chains  on  the people who  trusted  us,  the

people  who had faith in us, the people who  loved

us, and hoped that we would know how to effect the

freedom and the dignity which they desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a phrase in the English

language - "stony   silence".   It   connotes   cold

contempt, the quiet and implacable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



antagonism of the temporarily helpless, the  quiet

of  the  people who lined the streets of Singapore

when  the  Japanese troops held their  sway.  Just

stony silence. Today, Sir, Singapore is eating the

ashes  of  its  dead  hopes  with  stony  silence,

despite  the grin of our naturalised Malayan,  the

Minister  for Public Works. They can  glory,  Sir,

because  they  have  so provided  that  they  will

remain in office as long as this Government is  an

effective  extension of the Colonial  Office,  not

only  to 1959, but thereafter by Order in Council.

I shall seek to prove it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a very considerable propaganda

build-up by the happy newspapers of Singapore, our

imperialist,   colonialist,  capitalist   friends.

There  was even a considerable propaganda build-up

by  Government organisations - like Radio  Malaya - to

welcome the heroes of the Merdeka Mission - the all-successful Merdeka Mission, so heavily praised  by

the  Colonial Office, so heavily praised  even  by

the  man  for  whom  I have some respect,  Malcolm

MacDonald.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Old friends so parted!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> So I learn that a man, however

good,  in  the service of the Government toes  the

line,  as they learn to toe the line in the P.A.P.

One  day  their  Treasurer says he supports  David

Marshall  in  his appeal for immediate  elections,

and  it  is published in the newspapers. The  next

day,  he writes in an official memorandum to  say,

"I  erred.  I  am sorry. My Party has changed  its

mind. It is against immediate elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to know how the ashes of our dead hopes are

being  served up with all the pomp of  colonialism

by  the gentlemen of the Merdeka Mission - I  saw  a

newsreel,  Sir - I have not seen a newsreel  of  the

signing  yet,  I  must see that. It  was  not  the

signing   of  the  agreement,  Sir,  it  was   the

agreement of disagreement. But I saw a newsreel of

the  triumphal return of this Merdeka Mission  and

the people's reaction. Sir, this newsreel with all

its  modern  propaganda  techniques  and  all  its

dubbing in of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



sound effects could not hide the small number,  or

the   stony   silence,  of  the   onlookers.   The

decorations which greeted the delegation were  the

British   Crown  and  the  British  Lion  rampant,

emblems  of imperialism thoroughly appropriate  to

welcome back the delegation that handed the people

of Singapore to continued imperial rule. I have no

doubt   that  the  officials,  who  put  up  these

decorations  of the British Lion rampant  and  the

British  Crown  intended for  His  Royal  Highness

Prince Philip, thought that, apart from a question

of  degree,  the  status was the same,  here  were

further   imperialist  factors,  and   they   were

entitled to an imperialist welcome. On the padang,

Sir,  the  stony  silence of  some  5,000  people,

although, Glory be, a platoon of the P.A.P. sought

to liven matters up on command with boos and calls

of  merdeka. The boos were deleted, Sir, oh let me

say  that  right away, in case the Chief Secretary

takes action against this film unit, the boos were

deleted  and merdekas were dubbed in.  Where  were

the people of Singapore? Where were the people  of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In Batu Pahat!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> One of them, whose contempt for

the Merdeka Mission would never have permitted him

to  be  anywhere  near  the participation  of  the

triumphal  return,  was  doing  his  duty  to  the

citizens of Malaya in Batu Pahat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hooray!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> But where were the rest - walking

around  on  the  padang  across  by  the  sea  and

completely ignoring the Merdeka Mission.  And  the

rest  of  the people of Singapore? Where were  the

trade  unions,  the T.U.C., the  Government  trade

unions, the P.A.P. trade unions? Where were  they?

The  newsreel tried to imply that a loving  T.U.C.

had   stopped  the  car  which  was  carrying  the

triumphant  Chief Minister and handed him  banners

and  the  picture of a sick lion. The  T.U.C. has

officially denied it was ever present at any  part

of the procession to welcome back this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



Merdeka Mission. Where were the trade unions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front made a special matter of

passing   a  special  resolution  at  its   annual

conference  to  welcome back its  members  in  the

Merdeka  Mission with a mammoth rally.  Where  was

that  mammoth rally? It was not and it could never

be, Sir, because the Labour Front and every Member

of this House and every citizen outside knows that

a  mammoth  rally would be a horrible  joke,  that

there  would  be  nothing but stony  silence,  and

perhaps worse, to welcome back these gentlemen who

have handed us over to our enemies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why, why this cold contempt of the people

of   Singapore  for  their  Merdeka  Mission,   as

evidenced  on the day of their return  and  since?

Because  when  the  hour  of  opportunity  struck,

Singapore  was found wanting, wanting through  the

inadequacy of its own representatives. We  failed,

Sir,  not because Lennox-Boyd was too strong - that

is a glorious failure: it is a failure of which we

need  not  be  ashamed;  when  we  are  broken  by

superior force and we are shot down with a machine-gun  bullet - we  failed because we were  afraid  of

Merdeka, we, the representatives of the people  of

Singapore. We failed because we have weak guts - we,

whom  the people of Singapore trusted. In  silence

must  the people of Singapore bear the shame  that

their   own   representatives,  the  people   they

trusted, let them down. Their people failed in the

hour  of  opportunity. All Singapore, Sir,  shared

the  shame of the inadequacy of its delegation  at

the wonderful opportunity which was before it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been very fashionable to damn the

flamboyant ex-Chief Minister, to seek to bury  him

and to place on his shoulders the slimy hatred  of

persons   who   fear  an  honest   and   a   clean

constitution  for  the people of Singapore,  which

would  make radical changes in the present  vested

interest  set-up. But I am not seeking to  justify

myself  if I ask you to turn back a few  pages.  I

will  give you my word - I can take what I am  given

and I can take a lot more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



I  survived the Japanese prisons, do not forget. I

ask  you to turn back the pages because I want you

to contrast what happened and what has happened in

order  to  judge  the attitude of  the  people  of

Singapore.  Can you remember, Sir, the warm  solid

support  of  the  people of Singapore  during  the

constitutional crisis of our young days,  in  July

and  August 1955? Even the double-crossing  P.A.P.

supported us, and I have, as a trophy of honour, a

little  cartoon  in  a Chinese paper  showing  the

rejoicing  of  the people of Singapore,  who  were

prepared to have no government at all rather  than

a  stooge government. They were united, the Sikhs,

the   Chinese,   the  Malays,  the  Indians,   the

Eurasians, all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember, Sir, Merdeka Week last year? I

shall  not remind you of the motion of the  Member

for Paya Lebar who said, "Let us have independence

immediately."  I shall not. Sir, I  am  trying  to

draw  attention to some of the decent things  that

have  occurred - the Merdeka Week of last year;  the

unity  of  purpose  of  all races;  the  signature

campaign - I know, because we were told it was those

horrible  little  Chinese school boys - let  me  say

this   to  you - those  Chinese  school  boys   have

committed  many  errors; the Chinese  school  boys

have  been  a  headache and have  caused  harm  to

Singapore;  their  conduct has harmed  temporarily

our  relations with the Federation, but  in  those

Chinese  school boys there is pure gold, there  is

honesty,  there is sincerity, there  is  idealism,

there  is  energy. And those who  sneer  at  those

Chinese school boys will never be abe to guide the

destiny of this country to anything that is  worth

while.  Sir,  we speak of the signature  campaign.

Sir, I have to anticipate objections because I  am

not going to be permitted a second speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do you remember the mammoth rally at the

padang?  Yes,  I know, we broke a few windows - that

is  what  you  remember, a few windows  only  were

broken.  Oh,  those dreadful things so beautifully

magnified by the English Press! That is what  they

remember about that mammoth rally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member ought

to address his remarks to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I was indeed, Sir. With respect, I

say  to  the  Chair that that is what the  English

Press  has  so beautifully magnified. The  English

Press, which slants and slimes every honest effort

at  nationalism in this country. Subversion?  What

is  that  but  subversion, Sir, that  the  English

Press  does  by dishonest techniques  to  try  and

destroy our struggle for true nationalism. What is

that   but  subversion.  Are  we  sending  Colonel

Simmonds to the undemocratic Changi jail? No, Sir.

Yes, you remember. Everbody remembers. We remember

the  mammoth rally because of the broken  windows.

Heh,  heh, heh, heh! I remember, Sir, the decency,

I   remember   the  affection.  I   remember   the

enthusiasm, I remember the good humour  of  40,000

to  50,000  people. I remember the warmth  of  the

people  seeking freedom, the realisation of  their

hopes  for  a  clean and honest future,  to  stand

straight  in the eyes of God and their fellow-men,

in  friendship  with the United  Kingdom,  and  at

peace with all the communities in Singapore.  That

is  what  I can remember, Sir. There were acts  of

hooliganism, all right-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Friendship with the United

Kingdom?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Friendship with the United Kingdom

I   say   I   do   believe.   Those   people   are

understanding. Their friendship is  necessary  for

our long-term welfare - friendship and partnership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those days the people gave us all we

asked  for. They gave us their love. They gave  us

their  trust. They gave us their support in  every

way that we asked for it, because it was going  to

be  a people's merdeka, and we had not only shouts

of  merdeka, not only mammoth rallies, but we  had

the  joy of unity of feeling, of being in the swim

with  all  human  beings. To greet a  politicians'

merdeka, we have a stony silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not fashionable today to speak of

independence.  No,  Sir, we are frightened.  Those

persons who are vocal, who have the opportunity to

talk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



in    this   House,   they   are   frightened   of

independence. They are frightened of  merdeka.  We

say  we are too small, not viable. We say that  we

must  bend our knees and put our foreheads to  the

dust at the feet of the Tunku until it pleases him

to  lift us up. I say to you, Sir, that is not the

fate  of Singapore. I say to you, Sir, that I have

times  without  number in this House  and  outside

indicated that our ultimate and our true  destiny,

the   true  destiny  of  the  Federation  and   of

Singapore  is in unity. That I do not question,  I

have  never questioned, and I have even  struggled

for  it  before the Tunku took office, immediately

he was elected; and he, who is an honest man, will

admit  it.  In fact, it is in the books.  Sir,  to

crawl  on my forehead and on my knees gives  me  a

backache,  and  I do not believe  it  will  assist

Singapore in bringing it any nearer to unity  with

the  Federation. I believe that such an  attitude,

Sir, will merely increase contempt-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the hon. Member realise-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If the Tunku-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

stood up. Does he wish to intervene?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill

not  understand that what he is saying  is  making

things worse?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member can only

intervene  if the Member for Cairnhill  has  given

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I say, Sir, that it is the duty of

Singapore and those who purport to be its  leaders

to  face  facts  squarely. One fact  is  that  our

ultimate  destiny, our true destiny, and not  only

ours  but  that of the Federation, is in a  united

Malaya. I have said, I do not know how many times,

but  let  me  repeat, that the Federation  without

Singapore  is  like the the fingers  of  the  hand

without   its   thumb.   Singapore   without   the

Federation is the thumb without its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



fingers.  But  we can exist independently,  and  I

say,  Sir, that crawling to the Federation on  our

foreheads and on our bellies and on our knees  can

only  create  contempt, and is  creating  contempt

today, and can only achieve a position whereby the

Federation    seeks   control,   without    giving

protection,  seeks privileges without  giving  any

concession.  That  is what the  present  trend  is

heading  for. I say, Sir, that if the  Tunku  does

not  want us, and if the Federation does not  want

us, then it is the duty of the people of Singapore

not  to continue crawling on their bellies but  to

reorient  their outlook, and that was the position

we  took  last  year,  and which  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  endorsed  as  a  member   of   the

delegation  in  London - that if we cannot  achieve

integration with the Federation, then we must have

independence within the Commonwealth. Sir, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Coward!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You are-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not use

the word "coward". Will he withdraw it, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I withdraw it. I shall deal

with it in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir. I am saying

that  Singapore must consider, until such time  as

it   can  with  dignity  achieve  unity  with  the

Federation, whether it is to remain a colony or to

achieve   a   position  of   human   dignity   and

independence within the Commonwealth. I know  that

the  Commonwealth is supposed to be  an  obsession

with  me, all right, but obsession or no,  let  me

add   this:   if   we  are  not  wanted   in   the

Commonwealth,  then  we must  again  reorient  our

attitude, Sir, and consider whether we should  not

instead   struggle  to  make  this  territory   an

international territory, an international port,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



under the protection and the Asian headquarters of

the United Nations. Yes, it is easy to sneer, Sir,

very easy, but much that we benefit by today, much

that is gracious in our way of life, much that  is

worth  while  in  our  thinking,  was  started  by

allegedly  crazy people. If I am called  crazy  by

the  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar,  I  shall  indeed

consider that an honour. To those who consider  it

fashionable  today,  Sir, to speak  of  how  small

Singapore is, how weak, how impossible it  is  for

us  to  achieve independence until the  Federation

has  mercy upon us, may I draw their attention  to

some of the things we said last year? I quote from

the  Report of the Singapore All-Party Mission  to

London,  April/May 1956, Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.

31  of 1956, at page 19, in a speech delivered  in

London   at  the  opening  of  the  constitutional

conference at Lancaster House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As to its size the population of Singapore is

larger  than that of New Zealand when it became  a

member  of  the League of Nations. Our  population

today  is  larger  than the  population  of  seven

independent  countries  who  are  members  of  the

United Nations - Iceland, Costa Rica, Jordan, Libya,

Luxembourg,   Nicaragua,  and  Panama   and   only

slightly   less   than  three  other   independent

countries - Honduras, the Lebanon, and Paraguay. Our

revenue  is  greater than that of  16  independent

countries   which  are  members  of   the   United

Nations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our revenue is more than 16 independent

countries  and our population is equal  to  almost

ten  independent nations who are  members  of  the

United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we say, Sir, in our memorandum - approved

by   the  P.A.P. by  the  way - submitted  to   the

Singapore  Constitutional Conference by  the  All-Party Mission:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though the present Constitution of Singapore

did   not  come  into  operation  until  the   8th

February,  1955, all parties are agreed  that  the

aspirations of the people of Singapore  cannot  be

met   except  by  the  attainment  of  full  self-government within the Commonwealth as soon as  the

necessary  constitutional changes can  be  brought

about."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full self-government within the Commonwealth",

Sir. I continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As in other Asian countries, colonial status is

considered to deprive the people of self-respect."



<br><br>It seems now that colonial status under the Rendel-Yew Hock Constitution deprives the people of self-respect, but colonial status under the Lennox-Boyd-Yew Hock Constitution does not. We shall see.



"On  the  25th  July,  1955, the  new  Legislative

Assembly  clearly  affirmed  its  resolution  that

colonialism  be  brought  to  a  speedy   end   in

Singapore.  On the 5th April, 1956 the Legislative

Assembly passed the following resolution:-"



<br><br>Sir,  I  hope the gentlemen are not bored to  hear

what  they  did. If they are, may  I  remind  them

about this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the

people  of  Singapore, its belief in the principle

of  'the basic right of peoples to governments  of

their own choice', as enunciated in the Washington

Declaration  signed  by Sir  Anthony  Eden,  Prime

Minister  of  the  United Kingdom,  and  President

Eisenhower,  President of  the  United  States  of

America, on the 1st of February, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore  lies in close and friendly  cooperation

with  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Commonwealth

territories;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation to the forthcoming Constitutional Talks

in London to seek forthwith for Singapore-"



<br><br>Now, what did we seek?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-the status of an independent territory

within the Commonwealth, and to offer an agreement

between  the  United  Kingdom Government  and  the

Singapore Government whereby the Government of the

United  Kingdom  would  in  respect  of  Singapore

exercise  control over external defence  and  give

guidance in foreign relations other than trade and

commerce."



<br><br>And  that resolution, Sir, in case your memory  is

short,  was  passed by 27 votes to zero  and  four

abstentions - three  officials and  Mr  Sutherland,

Now, Sir, I am amused to note that the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar noticed this motion of the Assembly

and  referred  to it in a speech  on  the  5th  of

March, 1957, Sir, at a hastily convened sitting of

this Assembly, after my departure for Brunei.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On important business.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Yes. It was known that I would

leave  for  Brunei on the first of March.  On  the

first,  notice of motion was given for the 5th.  I

was  never  informed at all. I tried to get  back,

Sir,  and  as you are aware, I arrived four  hours

too late - the Merdeka motion taking two hours to be

debated in this Assembly, two hours - I consider  it

indecent  haste.  Here  is  what  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar said about this motion. I  hope  he

does  not mind, I know that the P.A.P. thrives  on

inconsistency,  and the P.A.P.'s  basic  political

philosophy  is to try and fool most of the  people

most  of  the  time to get into  power.  Sir,  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, on the

5th  of  March, 1957, said, at col.  1465  of  the

Official Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I did look up the former resolution. The

House will forgive me if I were to remind them  of

the terms of the resolution they passed on the 5th

April last year. The resolution first opens with a

flourish   by   a  reference  to  the   Washington

Declaration of Dwight D. Eisenhower...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were fierce words and, I am sorry to say,

they  did  not materialise. Looking  back  now,  I

thought -"



<br><br>Not  "I  think" - a man is entitled  to  change  his

views, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- I thought - like when the platform collapsed

at the famous rally at Kallang-"



<br><br>He did not collapse on the platform-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- it was a symbolic act of unwisdom of

people who did not prepare the ground before  they

climbed on the platform."



<br><br>"A  symbolic act of unwisdom", Sir. Can  you  tell

me,  Sir, who was the man who seconded the  motion

on  the  4th of April, 1956? Who was the  man  who

seconded the "symbolic act of unwisdom"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was not on the platform.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I know that last year it was

fashionable to be a nationalist, and  this  was  a

nationalist  motion,  so the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  seconded the motion, His was the  privilege

of  seconding the motion. His was the privilege of

seconding  this  "symbolic act of unwisdom".  This

year   it  is  no  longer  fashionable  to  be   a

nationalist. It is fashionable to be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



colonialist.  He considers it a symbolic,  act  of

unwisdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It hurts, does it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Yes, it hurts indeed to see the

twistings and turnings and tortured conduct of the

P.A.P.,   always   seeking  to   adopt   what   is

fashionable today because, by doing that, you fool

most of the people most of the time - and those  who

can  see what you are doing do not matter, because

they  are a minority. Their votes will not  matter

very  much.  But,  Sir,  remember,  this  is   the

principle  of  the  P.A.P. - you  achieve  political

office,  you achieve political power,  by  fooling

most  of  the  people most of  the  time,  and  so

inconsistency  is quite naturally  part  of  their

technique  and  double-crossing is part  of  their

technique.  I mentioned the Kiss of Judas  at  the

very first sitting of this Assembly in April 1955-

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question then is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) takes note of the Report of the Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in  March

and  April, 1957, as contained in Sessional  Paper

No.  Misc.  2 of 1957, and approves the points  on

which agreement has been reached; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves the stand of the All-Party

Delegation   in   not  accepting   the   condition

stipulated in paragraph 30 of the Report.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is all very

simple.  First we get the whip, now  we  want  the

gag;  hon. Members are quite tired, I am going  to

take  quite  some  time on this matter.  I  cannot

treat  it in the cursory fashion in which  it  has

been  dealt  with by the Hon. the Chief  Minister,

and  Members  on the Opposition and elsewhere  are

entitled-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think perhaps the hon.

Member  has  misunderstood the position.  I  quite

agree  that Standing Orders sometimes can be  very

complicated but, in this particular instance,  the

request,  I  think,  would be  that  the  Assembly

continue even till midnight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



to  deal  with  this item until it  is  completed.

[Interruption] Order. If the motion is not  agreed

to  or  there is no assent given that  the  motion

should  be moved, the position then would  be,  of

course,  that, at the moment of interruption,  all

business  stops and we continue again  on  Monday.

That is the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I lost my temper a little this morning and I would

like  to  apologise. I cannot,  Sir,  imitate  the

stony  silence of the people of Singapore.  To  my

mind,   what  is  happening  is  a  deathblow   to

democracy  in this territory and Cairnhill  has  a

voice  unlike  the other helpless sections  and  I

intend  to make that voice heard. Perhaps I should

be  a  little  more courteous. I  understand  that

Julius  Caesar,  when  the bloody  hand  of  Brutus

struck,  said, 'And you, you Brute'  or  words  to

that   effect.  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that

Shakespeare  romanticised,  Sir,  and  that   when

Julius C�sar felt the knife of his best friend  in

his  own heart, he must have rent the heavens with

his  cry  of death. I consider, Sir, that what  is

happening today is the destruction of all hope for

the  establishment  of  democracy,  attraction  of

goodwill  and  respect for the democratic  process

and  that  we are clearing the arena for what  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar would  describe  as  a

clean,  straight fight between the Colonial Office

and  its  fellow travellers on the one  hand,  the

Communists  and  their fellow  travellers  on  the

other  hand  and the decent people  of  Singapore,

being  inarticulate, are between the crossfire  of

those two camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore, although they are

inarticulate, do seem to have second sight and  do

seem  to understand. Once they believed that there

was  possible  a  people's  merdeka.  Their  stony

silence  before and after these merdeka talks  and

during  these  merdeka talks,  as  my  friend  the

Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) has pointed

out to mean, was an indication that they knew that

what  they  were  going to get was a  politician's

murder-ka-document that murdered what they seek.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lennox-Boyd-Yew Hock Constitution is in

spirit  and in fact as colonial a document as  the

Rendel-Yew  Hock Constitution although  it  is  an

improvement  in some aspects. You do  not  believe

me?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was wondering whether the name

"Yew Hock" refers to the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Indeed, Sir, he signed the Rendel

Commission's Report and that is why we call it the

Rendel-Yew Hock Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member then say the

Rendel-Chief Minister Constitution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Chief Ministers come and go, Sir;

even  this Chief Minister here who hopes to go  on

forever.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, it may be that I am crazy but

I  trust  that  Members and you,  Sir,  have  some

respect  for the Times of India, a paper respected

in  its  own  great  country, a  country  of  many

millions,  a  country of long culture,  a  country

that  has  known colonialism, a country  that  has

travelled  successfully and constitutionally  into

freedom  and a country that bears us no  ill-will,

What  does the Times of India in its leader, Sir,

of   the   16th  of  April,  1957,  say   (heading

"Disappointment")? I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Mr Lim Yew Hock, the leader of the

All-Party delegation, has affixed his signature to

the  draft  constitution  for  Singapore  recently

negotiated with the British Colonial Secretary, it

is  difficult to resist the impression that he has

done  so with many reservations - reservations which

are  apparently  shared by other  members  of  the

delegation - and   will   almost   provoke    bitter

controversy when the constitutional proposals  are

debated    in   the   Assembly.   The    so-called

constitution   which  has  emerged  from   amongst

painstaking   negotiations   is   a   particularly

outstanding example of an unsuccessful  compromise

that will obscure rather than clarify the colony's

political future-"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not write this, gentlemen:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-a future that will apparently be a strange

compound of self-government and dependence on  the

British    Government    of    a    kind    almost

indistinguishable  from  colonialism."  [That   is

putting it politely, Sir,] "...it has nothing to do

with  the kind of self-government that is the only

answer to colonialism."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this constitution is known by all who can

read  and understand to be an improvement in  part

but  is,  in  fact  and  in  essence,  a  colonial

constitution and the improvements are  not  to  be

brought into force until an indefinite period when

it   so   pleases  His  Excellency  the   colonial

official.  Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister  knows

full  well  that what he has got back is  a  thing

that is deformed and a thing of shame. That it why

he  applies the Whip in a matter which  should  be

beyond party politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delegation has had a wonderful and a unique

opportunity  for  success.  The  last  delegation,

blocked  a  few yards from goal last year,  passed

the ball to the present Chief Minister, creating a

diversion   to   weaken   the   opposition.    The

disclosures of the Fascistic attitude and  tactics

of the Colonial Office towards Singapore last year

earned  for  the  people of Singapore  the  active

sympathy  of  all Asian nations with  considerable

repercussions   on  the  Colonial   Office.   They

realised that they could not afford to fail  again

and  they  realised that they had to  succeed  and

succeed  soon  to  save their face.  Not  only  in

India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Japan but even in China,

there  was the most heartfelt and active  sympathy

for the people of Singapore. Let us admit frankly,

Sir,  to be fair: the Chief Minister improved  his

position after receiving the ball and improved  it

magnificently.  Whatever  we  may  think,  in  the

context of the long-term welfare of Singapore,  of

his actions in August and October last year, there

is  no  question whatsoever in my mind - nor should

there  be  in anybody else's - that his  actions  in

August and October improved his position vis-a-vis

the Colonial Office to a very considerable extent.

The  goal was wide open. He knew it and he fumbled

and  all  we get is a corner kick, and  why,  Sir?

Because there has developed in the past few months

a  fear  complex,  a  fear of  merdeka  which  the

Progressives always had in their hearts but  which

the  rest  of us did not have - a contagious  fear - a

fear that took away our faith in our people and in

our  destiny. Sir, I will say this: I am not above

fear and I am not without recognition, nor have  I

ever been, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



the  dangers  involved  in  any  progress.  A  man

enforced to lie horizontal for 20 years, when  you

start  to  make him walk, will fall and  bark  his

shins  and break his bones. He needs to  learn  to

walk.  He must be encouraged to walk. Sir, in  the

world  of today, fear is not only for those of  us

in  Singapore who are considering the consequences

of  merdeka but fear is for all the people of  the

world.  Although  the  Minister  for  Health  (Mr

Braga) takes so blithely the repercussions of  the

hydrogen bomb, most thinking people do have a very

real  fear that there will be an extermination  of

the  human race as a whole and certainly of  human

culture  of  today but we cannot, Sir, survive  in

any way whatsoever if we are to permit our conduct

to  be governed by fear. Fear is an inhibitive and

a  corrosive emotion. It is no basis on  which  to

build your future. Though one should recognise the

grounds   which   indicate  danger,   one   should

nevertheless,  in my view, have faith  in  oneself

and  in  the  future  and this faith  the  Merdeka

Mission  lacked.  Sir,  the  Merdeka  Mission  has

returned  as  loyal subjects of the Rt.  Hon.  Mr

Lennox-Boyd and their cries of merdeka  are  empty

cries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I shall come to my specific objections

to  this  deformed thing that we have  before  us,

this   Report  that  is  not  an  agreement,  this

agreement that is not an acceptance. Sir, my first

and  foremost objection - and I hope the Member  for

Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong) will hear  this - is

that  the agreement gives us much less, I  repeat,

very  much  less and I repeat once more, radically

less   than   what  was  offered   the   Singapore

delegation  last May. Now, Sir, unlike the  Member

for Serangoon, I do not intend to make a statement

and  leave  it  alone. I intend to prove  it  with

chapter and verse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second objection, Sir, is that this document,

if  and  when it comes into force, makes no change

to the essential colonial spirit of our status. We

remain   colonial  subjects.  It  is  a   colonial

government  and we are under the domination  of  a

foreign colonial power and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



not  merely external domination but domination  in

our every-day life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third objection, Sir, is that the date for

implementation of this extraordinary  constitution

is  of an indefinite character which suggests that

it  is  never  intended to be brought into  force.

This  Assembly  is not entrusted,  Sir,  with  the

question  as to whether the time is ripe to  bring

it  in  nor can we petition and get a consent.  It

must  be a colonial official who, in his goodness,

must  be satisfied that the time is ripe to  bring

in  that  constitution and let me repeat  that  so

long  as this Government is an efficient extension

of  the Colonial Office that long will there be no

new  constitution  and  no election,  for  let  us

recognise, Sir, that by a simple Order in Council,

this  Government can request their friend the  Rt.

Hon.  Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd to continue their  life

for ever and ever, amen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other items of objection to this

agreement. There is the insistence of the Colonial

Office  that we remain under its jurisdiction.  It

is a petty matter, Sir, when the whole thing is in

a  mess.  Our  insistence at the time was,  "Look,

Great Britain, we want a clean future relationship

with  you. We want a relationship of goodwill.  We

want an end to struggle. We want a new chapter  in

our  life,  a chapter of partnership  and  of  co-operation. So do not insist on the Colonial Office

being  the channel of our relationship.  You  pass

your   relationship  through  the  sewer  of   the

Colonial  Office. It must stink when  it  gets  to

this  end." But, Sir, when we have the whole thing

a  stench, what does it matter if it goes  through

the  sewer  of the Colonial Office? What  we  have

now,  Sir, is not a document that anybody in  this

House  can  pretend is one on which the people  of

Singapore should rest content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we have the comic weeping, wailing and

gnashing   of   teeth   about   the   banning   of

subversives, the comic relief which I  shall  come

to,  in due course, but they are minor matters.  I

am in a very queer position there, Sir. I consider

that it is the duty of the Singapore Government to

make such provision in its own Elections Bill  but

I also consider that it is most improper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



for  the  Rt. Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd or anybody

else outside this territory to tell us how to suck

eggs and to make us do it their way - Oxford way  of

eating eggs, not Cambridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now perhaps to the most crucial

aspect  of this consideration. The Hon. the  Chief

Minister   has   very   studiously   avoided   any

suggestion that he got more than what was  offered

last year. He knows darned well that it is not so.

But  the seconder, the Member for Serangoon,  says

that  we  got more than last year. Sir,  you  will

forgive me if I take some time on this aspect  and

prove to you not merely that we got radically less

but  we  handed  over lock, stock and  barrel  all

control  over internal security - we who pretend  to

the  status,  the powers and the privileges  of  a

self-governing  territory! Let us  see!  Look  at,

Sir,  the debate of 5th March, 1957, columns  1457

and  1458. What did this Assembly ask? Without  my

presence to spur anybody on, Sir, we asked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... from Her Majesty's Government for the

people of Singapore the status of a self-governing

state  with  all the rights, powers and privileges

thereto appurtenant in all internal affairs.".



<br><br>That is clear:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and the control of trade, commerce and

cultural relations in external affairs."



<br><br>But  let  us look at this mandate which  has  been

fulfilled to the hilt: "We demand the status of  a

self-governing  state with all the rights,  powers

and privileges thereto appurtenant in all internal

affairs." Let us look, Sir, at the Report produced

by  the All-Party Conference to this Assembly last

month and there it says in the clearest terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the last talks broke down, the Singapore

Mission  had  been offered by the  United  Kingdom

Government  counter proposals to our demands,  and

these are set out as Annexure L, Pages 67, 68  and

69  of  Cmd.  Paper  31 of 1956. The  Conference's

decision  is that the All-Party Mission" [this  is

this  present  Conference, Sir] "will  not  accept

anything  less than what had already been  offered

by the United Kingdom Government."



<br><br>Right,  what  were we offered? Look, Sir,  at  the

document to which this refers and that is Annexure

L in Cmd. Paper 31 of 1956 being the Report on the

All-Party Mission to London last year and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



if  it  please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  will  be

reading from Annexure L, at page 67. These are the

constitutional  proposals offered  by  the  United

Kingdom  to the people of Singapore through  their

delegates  in  London on 12th May,  1956  (a  year

ago):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Singapore to be known as the State of

Singapore."



<br><br>Granted again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The Governor to be replaced by a High

Commissioner."



<br><br>Not  agreed  and  there is, it  is  suggested,  an

improvement. All right, we will mark  that  as  an

improvement. One up. We will discuss the emptiness

of  the  improvement  in due course  but  let  the

Member for Serangoon have a little glory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(3) The ex officio and nominated Membership of

the Legislative Assembly to be abolished."



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(4) The number of elected Members of the

Assembly to be increased to 50."



<br><br>It is now 51. Mark him up two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(5) The ex officio Ministers to be abolished".



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(6) The portfolio of the Chief Secretary to be

transferred to an elected Minister."



<br><br>Same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(7) The portfolio of the Financial Secretary to

be transferred to an elected Minister of Finance."

<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(8) Responsibility for the Department at

present  assigned  to the Attorney-General  to  be

transferred to an elected Minister."



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(9) The Attorney-General to be an official, and

to  continue to be independent in relation to  the

initiation,   conduct   and   discontinuance    of

prosecutions."



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(10) The Chief Minister instead of, as at

present,  the Governor to preside at  meetings  of

the Council of Ministers."

<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(11) The High Commissioner to receive copies of

Council agenda, papers, minutes and conclusions at

the same time as Ministers."



<br><br>Now, it is the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(12) Responsibility for External Defence to be

vested in the United Kingdom Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(13) Responsibility for External Affairs to be

vested  in the United Kingdom Government (but  see

footnote (ii) )."



<br><br>Same.

Now clause (14) and I do ask your attention.

It  is  not  the same. It is much less,  radically

less.

Clause (14) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(14) A Defence and Security Council" [not

Internal   Security   Council,   Sir,]   "to    be

established,  consisting of the High Commissioner,

the  Chief Minister, two other representatives  of

the   United  Kingdom  Government  and  two  other

representatives of the Singapore Government" [that

is,  three  on  each side]. "The High Commissioner

(or  in  his  absence  the person  exercising  the functions of High Commissioner) to be Chairman  of

the Council."



<br><br>Same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and to have a casting vote."



<br><br>No casting vote this time. Chalk that up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The High Commissioner and the Chief Minister

respectively  to  nominate the representatives  of

the  United  Kingdom and the Singapore  Government

(and  alternates) and both to be enabled in  their

respective  spheres to call in attendance  on  the

Council any persons from whom advice or assistance

may  be  required  in  the  deliberations  of  the

Council."



<br><br>Now, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Council's functions to be : -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to discuss any matters of common

concern...".



<br><br>Notice  the word "discuss", not internal security,

but:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... regarding external affairs and external

defence,  and  to decide in any 'borderline'

questions concerning the respective  spheres

of  authority  of  the  United  Kingdom  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Governments;"



<br><br>Now:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(ii) to receive and consider regular reports on

the internal security situation;"



<br><br>"To receive and consider". No executive powers  of

action!  We  got less. This is what they  offered,

not what I asked for. This is what Britain offered

on 12th May, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(iii) to make recommendations...".



<br><br>Not to take action, Sir!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... to Her Majesty's Government in the United

Kingdom  or  to the Government of Singapore,

as may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



appropriate,  on any matters brought  before

the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council to meet regularly...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause (15) reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(15) Should the assistance of troops under

United  Kingdom command be required... requests  for

such  assistance  to  be  made  through  the  High

Commissioner."



<br><br>That is the same but it is not fair to stop there,

Sir, when we come to discuss what is happening and

how  we handed over - we with our own hands and  our

own  signatures - internal security to an  authority

outside  the authority of the people of Singapore.

"Oh,  yes,  it  is going to be simple:  there  are

three   Ministers  and  one  Minister   from   the

Federation."  The question is a simple  one,  Sir.

The  new  constitution  has  no  real  powers   in

internal  security. Internal security will  be  in

the  hands of a Council or a Committee which  will

work  in  private and which is not responsible  to

the  House  nor to the people. Internal  security,

Sir,  will  be  outside the  jurisdiction  of  the

Singapore  Government. What we were offered,  Sir,

was    that   they   merely   discuss   and   make

recommendations about our internal  security  but,

in  fairness, that was not all. Let us read on and

this is where we got a bit tangled:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(16) Her Majesty's Government in the United

Kingdom to have power by Order in Council-".

<br><br>Notice, Sir, it is not the gentlemen hidden inside

a  secret  room  in Government House  where  after

lunch  they  sit  down with three  United  Kingdom

members,  the  three  Singapore  members  and  the

gentleman  from the Federation in the  secrecy  of

their  board room taking decisions for which  they

are not responsible and answerable to anybody. No,

Sir,  it is the United Kingdom Government by Order

in  Council which can be questioned in  their  own

Parliament.  "To have power by Order in  Council":

it is a public Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> And that is better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I will say this a little later on

that we asked for and obtained the right that this

power  should  not  be  exercised  except  by   an

affirmative motion in the House of Commons with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



its  complete publicity. I can understand  members

of  the  Merdeka Mission squirming with discomfort

at  having  these points pressed  home.  Let  them

squirm  whether by grin or by act. What have  they

the  power  to do, Sir, by Order in Council?  Have

they  the  power  to  interfere  in  our  internal

security? This is the power we have, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) to make provision for the fulfilment of

their   responsibilities  [not  in  internal

affairs,   Sir]  in  relation  to   external

defence and external affairs on the basis of

the  clause set out in SCT. (56) 9 with such

amendments as may be agreed."



<br><br>Because  we  have created a terrific  noise,  Sir,

when  they  defined external defence and  external

affairs  and  we  said,  "You  are  impinging   on

internal security." They said, "All right, we will

agree  to further amendments." You do not have  to

ask  anybody's memory on the subject. It is  here:

"with such amendments as may be agreed".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In particular Her Majesty's Government would be

prepared to agree to the following: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the High Commissioner to make Regulations

under   the   Order  in  Council  only   after

consultation  with  the Defence  and  Security

Council;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) compulsory military or other service not to

be required;'.

<br><br>On this, the present Internal Security Council can

do what it likes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(c) movable property not to be requisitioned

except with the concurrence of the Singapore

Government;".



<br><br>That does not apply now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) immovable property to be compulsorily

acquired only on payment of compensation  in

accordance  with the general local  law.  No

acquisition  without consultation  with  the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>Let me put it to you straight, Sir. The present so-called  Internal Security Council  can  order  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  to  do  just  what  they

please. They are the supreme dictators - or whatever

you like to call them - the dictator of dictators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



wish  to  object to an hon. Member of  this  House

making an unseemly exhibition of himself but would

it  not facilitate the hearing of other Members of

this  Assembly  to  know what  is  actually  being

argued  and the points which are being pressed  if

they were put over more lucidly?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  are  not  unaccustomed  in  this  Assembly  to

exhibitions  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar

whereby  he  seeks  to make his points  quite  by,

shall  we say, mistaking the point. Now, Sir,  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar does not understand: I do

not  seek  to impress him but let me say  this  to

you, Sir, and to other Members of the House. I saw

the   exhibition   of  the  P.A.P. through   its

unfortunate  Treasurer, Sir, who on one  evening - I

think   it  was  18th  March - said  that  he  fully

supported  Mr Marshall's demand for elections  in

August. It was published in the papers and in  the

next  evening the pathetic animal came out with  a

memorandum saying, "I am sorry. I made  an  error.

My  Party  changed  its mind.  We  are  definitely

against elections." When I saw that, Sir,  that  a

man  in  the  P.A.P. has  no  room  for  personal

integrity of thought but must toe the Party  line,

I, since then, Sir, although I knew a little of it

before,  shall certainly never seek  to  influence

the  P.A.P. with  argument.  They  can  only   be

influenced   the  way  the  Colonial   Office   is

influenced and that is by superior force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may resume. Now, Sir, we have seen in

what  the British Government offered us last  year

that   there   was   one  Defence   and   Security

Council - one  only, Sir, and one which we  screamed

about - and the hon. Member strenuously defended the

rejection  when  we came back to  this  House  and

reported it and that Defence and Security  Council

had  merely advisory powers in respect of internal

security,  it  could  discuss  matters  of  common

concern  regarding external affairs  and  external

defence  and  decide any borderline questions.  It

had  to  receive and consider regular  reports  on

internal    security    and    it    could    make

recommendations to the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



Government  and Her Majesty's Government.  So  its

powers  were of a purely advisory character,  note

the nigger in the woodpile (clause 16) which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom

to have power by Order in Council-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to make provision for the fulfilment of

their   responsibilities  in   relation   to

external defence and external affairs.".



<br><br>What is the objection? There really was none. They

said,   "You  could  have  external  affairs   and

external  defence,"  but as  the  Colonial  Office

always  does in these matters, it never shows  its

ugliness  publicly. It hid it  in  a  document  it

called  Annexure 1 [SCT. (56) 9]  on  page  51  of

Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 31 of 1956.  It  defines

external  defence  and external  affairs  somewhat

very  widely  so  that,  in  fact,  there  was  an

infringement  by Her Majesty's Government  in  the

United  Kingdom,  a  sort of a  reserve  power  of

interference  in  certain  aspects   of   internal

security and that was where we protested and  they

said,  "Right, we will re-word and amend it so  as

to  limit  the area of interference  by  Order  in

Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, gentlemen, let me add this very briefly.

What  did we agree in this Report - this Report that

is  not supposed to be an agreement? Sir, I  think

that is what the Hon. the Chief Minister said this

was.  "This was a Report and not an agreement."  I

cannot  blame the Hon, the Chief Minister. Perhaps

he  has had no time to read it but if I might draw

his attention to the last sentence of paragraph 12

of  Sessional  Paper No. Misc.  2  of  1957  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrangements upon which we have agreed are

set out in the following sections of this Report."



<br><br>So if those sections are not in agreement, perhaps

we do not speak the same language or perhaps he is

embarrassed by the fact that section 30 is one  of

the sections that are covered by this sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrangements upon which we have agreed are

set out in the following sections of this Report."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in this agreement that is not an

agreement but is a Report, what have we got?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government indicated that it was

their intention-"



<br><br>Unfortunately, they could not carry it  out.  They

always have very good intentions-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the new Constitution should confer upon

Singapore   Ministers  full   responsibility   for

maintaining internal law and order and  preventing

subversion."



<br><br>And that is what the House asked for:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... the status of a self-governing state with

all  the  rights,  powers and  privileges  thereto

appurtenant in all internal affairs ...".



<br><br>This  was  Her  Majesty's intention. Paragraph  25

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, since the internal security and

external  defence  of Singapore are  interrelated,

all matters relating to the maintenance of law and

orderly  government  would  be  of  interest   and

concern  not only to the Singapore Government  but

also  to  Her Majesty's Government in  the  United

Kingdom."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 26 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We accordingly agreed-".



<br><br>Bravo,  the Progressive Party! You got it in!  You

can  dimple on both sides of your cheek, Sir!  You

deserve  it! This is what they wanted and this  is

what they finally got for us:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We accordingly agreed that the Constitution

should   provide  for  the  establishment   of   a

Singapore Internal Security Council. The functions

and objects of this Council should be: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to consult on all questions of policy

relating to the maintenance of public safety

and public order;".



<br><br>That  is  the same as clause (14) (ii)  that  they

offered us last year. "To consult on all questions

of  policy  relating to the maintenance of  public

safety. . .". Consultation is fair enough. We  can

learn from everybody. I am prepared to learn  even

from  a  Communist,  let alone  learning  from  an

Imperialist.   I   am   ready   to   learn.   Sir,

consultation  is perfectly fair but  look  at  the

next:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(ii) to maintain the efficiency of all organs

of  the Singapore Government concerned  with

internal security;".



<br><br>That  is what the Internal Security Council  does:

not  recommend,  not advisory. It  has  powers  to

maintain  the  efficiency not only of  the  Police

Force   but   of  all  organs  of  the   Singapore

Government concerned with internal security.  Yes,

well done, the Progressive Party! And:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(iii) to ensure equal access by both

Governments to the services of these organs

and to all information at their disposal."

<br><br>That, Sir, is fair enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, paragraph 27 has this improvement. You

remember  last  year,  Sir,  we  appealed  to  the

British Government to allow the Chairman to  be  a

Malayan  appointed by the Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation of Malaya and the Tunku was  then  good

enough to agree to that. That was rejected but now

finally the British Government bowed to this minor

concession, not as Chairman, but as an  additional

member  and  that unquestionably is an improvement

but an improvement to a Council that no longer has

the  same  character. What do they give you?  They

give  you sixpence, they take a hundred quid.  You

cannot see it, or pretend you cannot see it-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must remind the

hon.  Member  that when he uses the second  person

"you",  he probably means the Delegation  and  not

the Speaker!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir. Now, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I ask you to turn to paragraph 27 (h) and  (i)

on  page  7 of this Report, and see what  else  we

gave   this   no  longer  "Defence  and  Security"

Council,  but  this blatantly "Internal  Security"

Council with powers to maintain the efficiency of

all  organs of government. What further powers did

we give it, Sir? It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(h) A vote on any matter within the Council's

functions should be regarded as a binding

decision, to which immediate effect should be

given by the authorities responsible."



<br><br>Do  you know what that means, Sir? It means  that

the  Assembly we will have here, Sir, or  anywhere

else,  will be just a puppet. The government  will

be  run from the board room. It is true there will

be  three members of the Singapore Government, one

from  the  Federation and three  from  the  United

Kingdom,  but,  Sir, we will be handing  ourselves

over to dictatorship of a hidden and secret body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is to be a Federation Minister; so what? I

am  very  happy that we are to have  a  Federation

Minister to co-operate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



with us, but is anybody suggesting that he

is  the  angel  Gabriel? Or is anybody  suggesting

that sometimes the Singapore Government would  not

like  to  evade  its  responsibilities  for  doing

something by making that Council do it? Is anybody

suggesting that, in the light of what we have seen

happen,  we  are going to be any less colonial  in

status  under that regime, with the secret  board-room  meeting  taking  decisions  which  over-rule

anything   that  happens  here?   What   kind   of

government are we going to have? Are we  going  to

be puppets with puppet masters in the board-room?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, paragraph 27 (i) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is any disagreement as to whether a

particular matter was of internal security, and

therefore within the functions of the Council, the

matter should be discussed and decided by the

Council",



<br><br>and in respect of all these decisions they are

binding and have the effect of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, paragraph 27 (k) , Sir - "If the Singapore

Government  failed  to  meet  any  requirement...".

Supposing the three gentlemen say, "We do not like

it  and  we are sorry that the Federation Minister

has agreed with the United Kingdom and we will not

co-operate"? What happens? -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Singapore Government failed to meet any

requirement  placed on them by a decision  of  the

Council,  the  Chairman of the  Council  would  be

empowered so to inform the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

and  to  advise  him to make an  Order  to  secure

fulfilment of the requirement."



<br><br>And  what  does he do? It seems fair  enough  to

advise  him, but listen to this - this  is  British

advice -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara would then be

obliged-"



<br><br>obliged-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to make the Order, which would have the force

of law in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will be having our Head of State doing

the  dirty work for the Colonial Office and taking the   blame.  Who  is  responsible? - the   Internal Security  Council for which we ask. It  is  not  a question, Sir, of whether it is going to be abused or  not going to be abused; it means in fact  that democracy is dead, that there is a dictatorship of seven  behind  the  scenes to do  just  what  they

please, when they please and how they please,  and

that their will, by a majority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



of  four  to three, is law. That is our democracy,

Oxford style. [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to hold you up; I seem to have

mislaid  a  document. Sir, I ask  that  I  may  be

permitted to come back to it later if I  can  find

the document from which I seek to read to you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Assembly to note this, Sir, and

if I am wrong, I trust that the Hon. the Attorney-General will tell me how I am wrong, because  this

is  a serious question; if I err, let the Assembly

have  the truth. Sir, not only have we surrendered

when this carrot finally reaches the mouth of  the

donkey,  not only have we surrendered our  control

over  internal  security to this  board  of  seven

dictators,  but we are creating a third  board  to

control  the  new Assembly of Singapore.  This  is

something new, something which I do not  think  is

necessary; but look, Sir, at paragraph 37. What is

my  objection to these secret boards? It  is  very

simple, Sir. If you divide power in a way that the

person exercising it has no responsibility towards

the  people - you cannot fix him personally with the

responsibility, you cannot pin him down  and  make

him  answer - then in point of fact the area of  his

power is completely excluded from the jurisdiction

of  the Assembly and the people's representatives.

In  respect  of this Internal Security Council,  I

say to you, Sir, the people of Singapore know that

it   means   that  our  entire  internal  security

position will be completely outside the control of

this  Assembly, that it will be in  the  hands  of

this  group  of dictators, and that we  can  never

know  their  decisions  because  it  is  a  secret

organisation, a secret council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example, Sir, how these

things  can happen and how the people of Singapore

and  their representatives can lose any  sense  of

initiative  and  self-respect by  making  somebody

else   do   the  dirty  work.  When  I  became   a

"dictator",  when  we were in  office,  for  about

three weeks, Sir, the question arose as to whether

we  were to renew the Emergency Regulations.  Now,

Sir, it was part of our platform



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



to   review  and  repeal  them  so  much  as   was

necessary,  and  at that time  there  was  a  very

strong movement for complete repeal. Now, Sir,  it

was  part  of  my  duty (the  duty  of  the  Chief

Secretary,   it   is  true)  to  investigate   the

position; and I may have been wrong, but I think I

was  right,  I  believed that  it  was  absolutely

essential  for our way of life that some  sort  of

powers of detention should be retained. Naturally,

I  was  very  embarrassed early in  my  tenure  of

office   to   have  to  meet  strong  and   bitter

opposition.  And I remember, Sir,  that  Sir  John

Nicoll said, "You repeal the Emergency Regulations

in the Assembly and your voters will be satisfied.

I  will  then  reintroduce them by  virtue  of  my

special  reserve  powers,  and  we  will  both  be

satisfied." Sir, if I were to meet Sir John again,

I  would apologise to him for being as rude  as  I

was.  I thought he was insulting me and the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this document, Sir, particularly

the  weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth  about

the ban on subversion being an undemocratic ban, I

feel that all Sir John did was to think that I was

just a normal politician. Sir, that is the kind of

thing     that    will    happen     again     and

again - unscrupulous  politicians  will   not   take

responsibility  for  necessary  acts   which   may

temporarily be unpopular, but will pass  the  buck

to   the   Internal   Security  Council,   thereby

constantly maintaining the sort of tension and the

sort  of antagonism which we see created the cause

for the weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to it, Sir, as I was pointing out to

you,  we are to have an InterDepartmental Council,

and I would like to read paragraph 37:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was clear that this practical division in the

handling of external relations,"



<br><br>external relations-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"together with the responsibility of Her Majesty's

Government  for  defence, made it  necessary  that

there  should  be continuous consultation  between

the  two  Governments on the many points at  which

their  interests and responsibilities would  touch

or  overlap.  We had agreed upon the establishment

of  the Internal Security Council, but noted  that

its competence was limited strictly to matters  of

internal security."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Last year, there was no necessity for this.

Then, we did not ask for an additional council.

Why this year? Why, except that they want a

further point of control. I read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"37. Her Majesty's Government therefore proposed

that there should be established some purely

consultative-"



<br><br>but let us see how purely consultative it is-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- some purely consultative machinery through

which  the  United  Kingdom  Government  and   the

Government  of Singapore should consult  upon  and

discuss  all  matters  or problems  affecting  the

Singapore  Government arising from  Her  Majesty's

Government's  responsibility for external  affairs

and  defence.  The Singapore Delegation  indicated

that  they  regarded defence and external  affairs

(save  where  the  latter had  been  delegated  to Singapore)  as being matters entirely  within  the

United  Kingdom  sphere, for which  the  Singapore

Government  could not constitutionally accept  any

responsibility: they nevertheless  recognised  the

need  for  some consultative arrangements  through

which   Her  Majesty's  Government  could  consult

Singapore's   interests,   or   make   known   any

requirements  arising from their  responsibilities

involving  action  on the part  of  the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"38. We therefore agreed to establish, by

administrative   action... an   Inter-Governmental

Committee...".



<br><br>Now, Sir, this is a purely "consultative"

organ - you will remember. Sir, paragraph 37 says it

is "purely consultative". But the last sentence

slipped into paragraph 39 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except to the extent to which the Council

decided that a matter was one of internal

security, it would be the duty of the Government

of Singapore to give effect to Her Majesty's

Government's requirements"



<br><br>in this Inter-Departmental Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, we, the Government of Singapore, are to

be under the orders of this Inter-Departmental

Committee of a "consultative" nature to give

effect to Her Majesty's Government's wishes in the

realms of external affairs and external defence.

Let us read down, Sir. Paragraph 40 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Conference further agreed that if the

Singapore Government were to fail to carry out

their duty to meet such requirements, the

procedure mentioned in paragraph 27 (k) "-



<br><br>and remember the words, Sir? - the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara would then be obliged to make an Order on

the advice of the Chairman of the Council, on the

advice of the British adviser, and this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



advice of the British adviser he shall be obliged

to take-



<br><br>" the procedure mentioned in paragraph 27 (k) ,

which relates to the implementation of the

Internal Security Council, is applicable in this

case also. When the requirement related to a Bill

before the Singapore Legislature, which in the

view of Her Majesty's Government would prejudice

the discharge by Her Majesty's Government of their

responsibilities, the Chairman of the Security

council would also have the power to advise the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara to reserve the Bill for Her

Majesty's pleasure, and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

should then be obliged to do so."



<br><br>That  is the position, Sir. Not even on the advice

of this Inter-Departmental Council, Sir, but if in

Her Majesty's Government's discretion it is deemed

by  Her  Majesty's Government that a  Bill  before

this  Assembly is of a character which  prejudices

the   discharge  of  Her  Majesty's   Government's

responsibility - that is wide enough - then that  Bill

must  be  reserved by our Head of  State  for  Her

Majesty's   Government  to   consider,   for   Her

Majesty's Government's pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are nearing the moment of interruption

and  although  I have much more to dwell  upon,  I

feel  that it may be appropriate at this  juncture

to   introduce  an  amendment  which  Members  can

consider.  I would ask first, Sir, as a matter  of

information, whether I am correct, as  I  think  I

am, in  saying  that  I may,  after  moving  that

amendment,   proceed   after   the    moment    of

interruption, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Cairnhill can

indicate the terms of his amendment at the end  of

his speech before he moves the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir. The terms of my

amendment,  Sir, are to leave all the words  after

"(1) "-I  am  changing the wording in "(l) "-and  to

insert the following; that it



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"regretfully takes note of the Report of the

Singapore  Constitutional  Conference   held   in

London  in March and April 1957, as contained  in

Sessional   Paper  No.  Misc.  2  of  1957;   and

nevertheless    calls    for    the     immediate

implementation  of  the new Constitution  on  the

basis  that  all persons qualified  by  residence

for  citizenship shall be entitled to vote at the

first elections; and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave "(2)" alone, Sir, not because there is

any question of a change of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



mind.  To me, it is a statement for which  I  have

some  contempt because, first of all, it does  not

accurately state the facts, and, secondly, I am in

favour  of  a ban on subversives participating  in

politics.  But  I  am  not in  favour  of  Britain

interfering by making the provision a part of  our

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I would like, in so far as there is

time,  to  make clear one aspect of this question,

and to interpose an explanation of what I mean  by

"nevertheless    calls    for    the     immediate

implementation  of  the new  Constitution  on  the

basis that all persons qualified by residence  for

citizenship shall be entitled to vote at the first

elections".  Sir,  the  new  constitution   is   a

colonial constitution. It gives us nothing to crow

about,  but it does give us an opportunity  for  a

fresh  election for a bigger House,  and  I  feel,

Sir, that there has been a tremendous maturing  of

the  people politically. I also feel, for  myself,

Sir,  that  this  House has  now,  shall  we  say,

expended  its  utility, and that  it  is  in  fact

rapidly  becoming  nothing  other  than  a  vested

interest which seeks its own perpetuation. I feel,

Sir, that however unfortunate and deformed the new

constitution   is,  however  much   of   an   evil

hunchback,  it  is  better than the  existing  one

because  it will give us a greater opportunity  in

our  struggle  to  end  our colonial  status.  The

quicker we get it, the quicker we end it, and that

is  something  to remember. It is  patent  to  the

people  of Singapore that from this Assembly  they

can  expect nothing more; they can expect  nothing

more  except an effort to perpetuate their sitting

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason given for not holding elections, Sir,

is  that  we  have 260,000 citizens, or  potential

citizens,  and  that we should  wait  until  these

people  are given an opportunity to vote. I  shall

go  into  somewhat longer detail  a  little  later

about the validity of that excuse. But what  I  do

say  is  that we can do it now if we are  sincere,

Sir - and this one is really an attempt to resurrect

Lazarous. The Hon. the Minister for Public  Works,

a  naturalised  Malayan, worked  with  vigour  and

integrity  and ability in assisting the people  of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



in  the  administration of their government,

Sir, but he cannot know- and he cannot be expected

to  know- how we feel about this matter of  racial

domination   and  racial  inferiority.   And   the

honourable  gentleman from Tanjong Pagar,  who  is

singing  in Oxford accents the dirge of  democracy

in  this  House- he is in a particularly fortunate

position; and having attained it, he does not have

to  worry  about whether he or his  family  should

ever  feel  the inferiority that the rest  of  the

people suffer as a result of colonial rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let us go back to the question of what

can  be done. Everybody tell us anxiously, whether

it  is  true  or not, they say they  are  anxious,

anxious  that 270,000 domiciled aliens  should  be

given  immediate citizenship. I say, Sir,  I  will

give   it   before   the   new   constitution   is

introduced - I will give it now! Section 42  of  the

Colony  Order in Council - I am sorry, Sir, I  am  a

bit  disorganised this afternoon - no,  section  43,

Sir, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Elected Members of the Assembly shall be

persons qualified for election in accordance with

the provisions of this Order"-



<br><br>that does not apply-



<br><br>"and elected in the manner provided by, or in

pursuance of, any law enacted under this Order or

in pursuance of the Singapore Colony (Electoral

Provisions) Order in Council, 1954."



<br><br>So we can make our own laws for election purposes,

and, in fact, we have made Law No. 26 of 1954, the

Singapore     Legislative    Assembly    Elections

Ordinance, whereby we provide for persons who  can

vote. Now, Sir, I say that under section 5 of that

Ordinance, we have the qualifications for  holding

elections. Right? Now, we also have the power,  if

we  so want, to disqualify criminals (have we  not

disqualified  the  undemocratic gentlemen  in  the

democratic  Changi  jail?). We  have  disqualified

those who are under sentence of imprisonment,  are

of  unsound mind, corrupt, etc. But under  section

5,  Sir, we can even make infants elected if we so

like.  What  is  there, then, to prevent  us  from

amending  section  5? We can do  it  in  two  days

without  a Certificate of Urgency - amending section

5 to say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



"includes  all persons domiciled in  Singapore  or

resident in Singapore for the past 10 years";  for

the first elections only - I do not ask that they be

made  permanent;  but the idea is  that,  for  the

first elections, we want to give the vote to these

people. We do not want colonial rule (nobody likes

that), but we have got to suffer it for two years,

may  be three, four, or more, because we must have

these alien Chinese on the list of voters. You  do

not  hope for Lennox-Boyd to put them on; put them

on  here,  now! I will support it. Why  cannot  we

amend  section 5 (1) and say "all persons resident

in  Singapore  for the past 10 years"?  Right,  it

takes  you  two days to pass that. Then,  oh,  how

long  does  it  take to get them on the  electoral

roll?  You  see, Sir, those who have goodwill  can

get  things  done quickly, but those who  pretend,

will   find  a  lot  of  objection.  One  of   the

objections is: How long will it take to  get  them

on  the electoral roll? Six weeks, I say, because,

gentlemen, nobody has got to go and register!  The

beauty  of  this suggestion is that  we  have  the

Identity  Card  system - bless  the  Identity   Card

system;  we have the Identity Card system and  all

the  names are registered. Let the Chief Secretary

correct me - he has got all the information and  it

should  not take more than six weeks to  pick  out

everybody   who   has  10  years'   residence   in

Singapore. So it takes you six weeks to  get  your

electoral roll out after two days, and that  makes

44 days. Let us imagine the miracle taking place - I

always   have  faith  in  miracles,   Sir!   After

all -[Interruption]- you  laugh,  but  did  not  the

Chief  Minister  yesterday accept our  motions  on

corruption? Is he not perhaps going to accept  the

amendment  to  the Clerical Workers Bill  that  we

should  legalise strikes? Amen to that.  Sir,  why

should  not  we believe in miracles? I believe  in

miracles;   I  am  hoping  that  this  effort   to

resuscitate Lazarous will be successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to go back to the people of

Singapore.  In  any division in  Singapore,  I  am

prepared  to stand against the gentleman  who  has

the majority of votes, and I say to him: I will go

to his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



constituency   if  he  will   go   back   to   his

constituency, and I will challenge him there-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Accepted!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Does the Member for Cairnhill

consider this really relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I heard him say, Sir, that he

accepted it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I rule it as irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I will say that we can amend

this   Elections   Ordinance,  and   provide   for

domiciled  aliens to be on the electoral  roll  in

six  weeks. We can have it open for objections for

another  six weeks, and we can be ready  in  three

months.  It  is to be remembered that  though  Mr

Lennox-Boyd promised us a State of Singapore  last

year,  we  are  now having a new  constitution  by

Order in Council; so we do not have to worry about

going  to Parliament - we are remaining a colony  by

Order  in  Council, and an Order  in  Council  can

easily  be prepared within three months. There  is

no  need of our worrying about an amendment to the

British  Nationality and Status of Aliens Act  for

the  simple reason that this Bill is not providing

immediately  for aliens to become  citizens - it  is

providing  to give them the right to vote  at  the

first  elections. And in due course - as  the  Chief

Minister   said,  it  takes  time  to  amend   the

Nationality Status Act, and it takes time to  open

the registration bureau, it takes time to register

230,000  people  and we should  have  at  least  a

year - (and  I  myself agree they  should  have  two

years) - they can register, after having  voted  for

the  new  Assembly  and the new  constitution,  as

citizens of a new State instead of registering  as

citizens  of this still Colony of Singapore.  Now,

Sir,  this  will be objected to - I  shall  have  to

answer  objections, since I am  the  mover  of  an

amendment and I have no right of reply - it will  be

objected  that those aliens will have to take  the

oath of allegiance. That is the only objection  of

some  validity which I can foresee, and the answer

is  very simply this: if a man is evil-minded,  if

his loyalty is elsewhere,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



no  oath of allegiance can make him change. But  I

do not believe that there are many of those people

among  the 270,000 whom we seek to attract as  our

citizens.  I  know them and I say I  believe  that

they  are men of stability, men of sincerity, that

they are loyal to this land; and I cannot envisage

any  real danger in giving them the right to  vote

in  the  first elections before they can take  out

citizenship  papers, the right  to  vote  for  the

first  elections  without taking  out  any  oaths,

without registering themselves, just by virtue  of

the fact that they have been 10 years in Singapore

in    accordance   with   their   Identity    Card

registration form which indicates their residence.

Sir,  it  is  simplicity itself,  just  as  it  is

simplicity itself whereby the Singapore Delegation

has   destroyed  and  suspended  merdeka  by  that

paragraph  27.  I say it is simplicity  itself  to

restore life into this constitution and still give

an  opportunity to this nascent democracy to  take

form,  by making it possible for all these  people

to vote, and to vote now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Cairnhill

please continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I will say this. Last year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



I  frankly did not consider that we had failed. We

were  seeking,  and  seeking  with  sincerity,   a

tremendous  advance, something  that  was  in  the

nature of a Holy Grail for us. Sir, a setback  and

a  failure at the first trial is not a failure.  I

do  not  consider that we failed. We had bulldozed

our  way to a very short distance of the goal. The

ball  was still in motion; the position, Sir,  was

excellent;  and  the prospects were  perfect.  But

today,  Sir,  today I consider I had  failed,  and

this  is my failure: This Report before the House,

the  subject  of the motion, this is  my  failure,

because  you  cannot go back  on  what  they  have

signed  away,  not at the moment, not  until  this

abortion  is  in force and a new people,  the  new

people, the new representatives of Singapore, have

the   opportunity  themselves  to  undo  what  the

Mission has done, if in fact it is not too late. I

myself fear this, Sir: I fear that my motion  will

be  lost.  I have seen, and I intend to  prove  to

this  Assembly, the lack of enthusiasm on the part

of  Government  for an early election.  I  believe

that  it  will  continue or seek  to  continue  in

office until the full length of its legal term  in

April 1959. I believe it will seek to continue  in

office  thereafter  by Order  in  Council  of  the

Colonial Office. And I believe that, thereby,  the

seeds of democracy which we sought to nurture will

wither  and  die,  and  that the  alternative,  an

alternative  that  bodes ill for  Singapore,  will

then  be the only means of change. Sir, I did  not

accept what I was given and I was not sorry; I did

not  accept what we were given because I  believed

that   more  was  necessary  and  more  could   be

obtained.  I  have faith in the men  of  Singapore

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if, on the other hand, it is true that the

reason given for the delay in new elections is  to

give  a  vote to those new citizens - I  shall  deal

with  the  question tomorrow - we can  achieve  that

now.  And  I  say we should achieve that  now,  by

simply amending the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Ordinance,   that  we  could  quite  easily   hold

elections in July. In the new Assembly at least we

will  have  a fresh outlook, at least we  can  say

that the people have put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



in  democratically elected persons who remain  in

office for serving the people and not merely  for

purposes of holding power. It can be done; it can

be  done  today. It can be done and it should  be

done.  If we want to maintain and attract respect

for  democratic processes, which means  that  the

people  have their own form of government,  which

should  be their government, one which  they  are

prepared to accept - we can only do that by  giving

them  an  opportunity for an election. Otherwise,

Sir,  if  we refuse them this, we refuse them  an

improvement  in their colonial status  which  the

new  constitution  does give. Although  it  is  a

colonial   constitution,  it  does  improve   the

conditions  of  struggle  of  the  people,  their

opportunity  to  make their voice  heard.  If  we

refuse this amendment, it means that we intend to

deprive  them  of the opportunity to  have  those

better  conditions  now, and that  we  intend  to

impose  our  desire to continue sitting  in  this

Assembly  and  holding office for the  people  of

Singapore  irrespective  of  their  welfare   and

wishes.  If we do that, we deal a mortal blow  to

any hope of respect for democratic processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have pointed out that my main

argument, my main objection, to this constitution

was   that  we  will  be  handing  over  internal

security to a body outside the control of and not

responsible to the people of Singapore.  To  that

extent,  Sir, it is a farce to speak about  self-government  with  all powers and  privileges.  In

fact,  this is a radical alteration of a  greatly

prejudicial character to the one Britain  offered

us  last  year. And in addition to this,  we  now

have  a so-called Consultative Inter-Departmental

Council which will have a right to order our Head

of   State  to  enforce  its  will,  and  a  High

Commissioner who will have power to order and  to

enforce his will in respect of matters which they

deem   to  be  within  their  realm  of  external

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second objection of ours which I raised

was that this was an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



essentially   colonial   constitution.   Sir,   our

original hopes were for a status of freedom which

would  have  the  respect  of  our  fellow  human

beings. Sir, last year, we said in our memorandum

to  the  British Government - and this  the  P.A.P.

also signed - on page 22 we said that we have every

right to be as independent as any other member of

the   Commonwealth  in  spite  of  our  area  and

population.  We see paragraph 4 at  page  22  and

then,  Sir,  at page 47 - on which also the  P.A.P.

has  now  changed its views and said we  are  too

small to be independent - this is what we said:

(This was delivered to the British Government on 1st May, 1956):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(3) We are firmly convinced that the people of

Singapore  have matured to a point  where  it  is

essential  for  their healthy  growth  that  they

should  be  free  to  shape  their  destiny.  Our

geographical position and racial content offer an

inspiring  challenge  and unique  opportunity  to

make  our  contribution to the concept of  inter-racial  amity and cooperation and the  growth  of

democratic  institutions. We can be  adequate  to

our   opportunities  only  if  we  are  free   of

controls,  however well meant, which  prevent  us

from  finding our feet through the normal process

of trial and error with all the risks inherent in

living."



<br><br>We can even now -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.
