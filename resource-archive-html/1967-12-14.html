<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[5th December, 1967], "That Parliament approves the

financial  policy of the Government  for  the  year

1968.". -[The Minister for Finance]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

surplus  in  next year's Estimates of  Revenue  and

Expenditure  of  $30.28  million,  tabled  by   the

Finance  Minister  for the young Republic,  without

the loss to any sector of the economy or community,

and an overall economic growth of eight per cent in

the  first  nine months of 1967 as  compared  to  a

population growth of 2.5 per cent, once again shows

a  great  step forward in the relentless effort  to

develop  our  national economy. Sir,  this  surplus

does  not  fall from the sky. It is the  result  of

careful  planning by the Government and the  desire

to  see it through by the Government and the people

the   employers,  the  workers  and   the   various

communities of the society at large. Sir, our  hard

work,  particularly during the last two years,  and

the fruitful result that follows give us reason for

joy.  It  has added more confidence to our economy,

both  internally and internationally.  This  is  an

inspiration  to us all and we should strengthen  it

by  increasing efforts in the years ahead. For  the

moment we begin to be complacent, that will be  the

moment  when  we begin to dissipate  away  in  this

unceasingly turbulent region of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two years ago when independence was forced

on  us  and many people were pessimistic about  the

future,  we  were not in despair. Very  few  people

then  would  have the courage to say that  such  an

achievement  could be accomplished in  so  short  a

period  of time. Sir, today we have proved  to  the

world  that,  though  we  are  a  small  State,   a

determined   people,  equipped  with   the   proper

education  and training, and under the impetus  and

dedicated  leadership  of our  present  Government,

can, I have' every confidence, lead the march to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



progress  and  prosperity and build a non-Communist

democratic,   socialist   nation.   Sir,   it    is

particularly heartening to note that not long after

our independence came the restoration of diplomatic

and  trading  relations with  Indonesia.  This,  as

stated  by  the  Finance  Minister,  is  the   most

important of the three main reasons for the present

buoyancy of the economy. Import and export of  many

commodities  in our trade with Indonesia  have  not

only  been restored to the pre-confrontation  level

in  volume, but have also surpassed it. Increase in

exports to South Vietnam and the enormous inflow of

Hong   Kong  capital  were  also  the  major  items

contributing  to  the  good  performance   of   our

national economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the lengthy Budget speech of

the  Finance Minister was dominated by his  concern

over  the  growing  unemployment  problem  and  the

proposed   retrenchment  of  some  16,000  citizens

employed in the British bases within the next three

and  a  half  years,  and the  ways  and  means  he

proposed  to overcome them. As it is, the  Republic

faces  an increase of about 25,000 employable young

people  annually. According to the sample Household

Survey  of  the  University of  Singapore  Economic

Research  Centre, 52,630 were unemployed out  of  a

total   of  slightly  more  than  half  a   million

employable,  that  is,  about  10  per  cent   were

unemployed,  and  there is a  growing  increase  of

unemployed   every  year.  Sir,  this  is   further

aggravated by the impending retrenchment of workers

in the British bases and we will probably suffer  a

drain  of about 100,000 economically active  people

in  various  categories of labour within  the  next

three  and a half years. This will indeed make  the

situation very acute. But it cannot be denied  that

given   a  situation  like  ours,  even  the   best

government  in the world cannot solve  the  problem

entirely in a few years. Sir, our Government has at

least  tried  to  reduce the problem  with  a  high

percentage  of  success  within  a  bearable  limit

through   expansion   and   diversity   of   trade,

industrialisation and the opening of  new  avenues,

such as tourism, to create more jobs. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



Government and the citizens themselves have to work

very hard for their survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has suggested a number

of ways to overcome the unemployment problem which,

when  fully accomplished, will find jobs for  about

43,000  people every year for the next  few  years.

But  he  has  never touched on how  to  assist  the

farmers  to  get  cheaper fertilizers  and  cheaper

multi-feeds so that they can produce more goods and

our   people  can  enjoy  cheaper  vegetables   and

livestocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take particular interest in the Minister's

indication of the tourist trade. As far  as  I  can

understand, the Minister has based his calculations

in  the promotion of the tourist trade chiefly,  if

not  solely, on the building of first-class  hotels

to  create  employment for about 9,000 people  over

the  next three and a half years. I do not see  how

this   can  induce  tourists  to  visit  Singapore,

although  it cannot be questioned that  such  ultra

modern  accommodation  does  make  them  feel  cosy

during  their stay. But surely they are not  coming

here  from  thousands of miles away  just  for  the

purpose  of  making themselves comfortable  in  the

hotels?   Neither  do  I  believe  that  they   are

interested  in  helping us solve  our  unemployment

problem. Sir, to make a success out of the  tourist

trade,  I  suggest  that  the  main  factor  to  be

considered is how to attract tourists and  not  how

to  create  jobs out of tourism, and when  we  have

succeeded  in this respect, then our services  will

automatically  be  in  demand,  resulting  in   the

creation of direct or indirect employment.  Sir,  a

tourist  will ask himself how much he gets  out  of

his  spending in the Republic and what he gets  out

of  it,  and if he finds that it is not  worth  his

money, not only will he not come again but many  of

his  friends  will be encouraged to  go  elsewhere.

Sir,  it has always been said that we lack the kind

of    first-class   entertainment,   services   and

facilities found in places like Bangkok, Hong  Kong

and  Japan.  Other than their first  trip  here  on

business, very few people would want to visit  here

again.  Therefore, some kind of inducement must  be

added to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



existing ones to make the tourists stay longer  and

visit   here  more  often.  In  fact,  considerable

efforts  have been made by the Government  and  the

various   business  communities  to  encourage   an

increase  in  the number of tourists  having  their

holidays  here.  But I would say  that  it  is  not

enough. More efforts and more planning must be  put

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us are happy to note that the Finance

Minister  has decided not to increase any tax  next

year  and yet is able to spend more in next  year's

development.  On the whole, the 1968  Budget  is  a

very big New Year gift to the two million people of

this young Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully endorse my support of the motion

tabled by the Minister that Parliament approves the

financial  policy of the Government  for  the  year

1968.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

I do not wish to dwell at length on the question of

economy, because in the past few years we have seen

a  lot of news on this topic being published in the

newspapers.  We  have  also  seen  how  our   local

merchants  have  praised  our  wise  Minister   for

Finance for being able to table such a Budget  like

this one before us. I must, however, stress that we

must pay more attention to the spirit and principle

of the Budget than to its details. I would now like

to remind the Government that since the expenditure

and revenue for next year are balanced, I hope they

will  make  use of the stable economy to  pay  more

attention  to  the  interest of the  labourers  who

constitute a large part of our population,  and  to

implement  as  quickly as possible the Government's

policy in relation to the labouring class in  order

to  reduce  in the shortest time possible  the  gap

between  the  rich  and the poor  so  that  we  can

speedily achieve a democratic, socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should say the 1968 Budget is satisfactory

to all. There are many things which are encouraging

to us, one of which is that next year the expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



and  revenue will balance  and  there  is  no

increase  in  taxation, which  would  have  been  a

burden  on  the  people. Just as the  Minister  has

pointed out, our economy is progressing as  it  has

in  the  past.  There has been an  eight  per  cent

increase  in national income. This is  not  only  a

surprise to many experts, but it also makes us feel

proud of our economic achievements because we  have

achieved quite a lot in the economic field. We  can

say  that ours is a unique case in South-east Asia,

and we are enjoying a high standard of living. That

goes  to show that a country must have a judicious,

democratic,  socialist leadership  and  enlightened

economic  measures  before it  can  achieve  social

stability,  economic prosperity and a rise  in  the

standard  of living of the people. I am  sure  hon.

Members  will all agree with me that this  type  of

economic  policy should not only create  prosperity

but   also   achieve  stability.  So  any  economic

measures adopted by the Government must be based on

our  platform for nation-building and on our spirit

of revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to remind the Government that while

we,  as  representatives of the people, are working

towards  a  democratic, socialist, egalitarian  and

multi-racial society, we must realise the tasks and

the  responsibilities the people have entrusted  to

us.  I  feel that any work in nation-building  must

aim  at  the  highest achievement and  the  highest

ideal,  if we deviate from this path, it will  mean

that  we  are deviating from the interests  of  the

people and we will lose their support. Without  the

base formed by the general masses of the people, we

will not be able to carry out our policies and  our

efforts  will  be in vain. We must let  the  people

understand  that  the  dynamic  force   which   has

generated  our  present  economic  prosperity   and

stability  is something which we should  understand

and which is meaningful. I remember on the 20th  of

February, 1959, the Deputy Prime Minister gave  the

reasons why the P.A.P, had received the support  of

the  people.  He said that most of  the  people  of

Singapore were labourers and were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



being  exploited. They supported  our  aim  for  an

equal  and just society and our policies for  equal

opportunities  in employment and other  fields  and

they  wanted to have a better standard  of  living.

The  merchants  also supported us  because  of  our

integrity  and anti-corruption campaigns and  other

effective  administrative measures. They  supported

an  honest  and  clean government  which  would  be

conducive to their economic interests so that  they

could  live  in  peace.  The present  Minister  for

Finance,  namely, Dr Goh Keng Swee, at  that  time

said  that  the economic policy of the  P.A.P. was

mainly  aimed  at getting the best things  for  the

majority  of  our  people,  namely,  security   and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am saying all this in order to show the

economic challenge before us so that we may analyse

seriously  our  work  in the past  year.  Everybody

knows that the P.A.P. Government ever since it came

to  power has carried out revolutionary work in all

fields, and everybody knows our achievements.  What

we  have been able to achieve has enabled to create

a  stable society and a prosperous economy and this

clearly  shows the efficiency of our Government.  I

would  like  to  avail myself of  this  opportunity

today  to  remind  the Government to  redouble  its

efforts  in  its tasks, fired by its  revolutionary

spirit, as it has been in the past, and serve  this

country  and  implement its  economic  policies  in

order  to  bring  equality to all sections  of  the

people:  in  other words, to close the gap  between

the  rich  and  the  poor. As  everybody  can  see,

Singapore  is prosperous and very progressive.  But

we  should not look only at the optimistic side  of

the  picture and neglect the other side of it.  The

other  side is one of the platforms of the P.A.P.'s

manifesto, i.e., to bridge the gap between the rich

and  the  poor,  and to establish a  non-Communist,

democratic, socialist, fair and just society  where

there is no exploitation of man by man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said all this in order that all the people

concerned can pay more attention to this so  as  to

bring to realisation all that we have hoped for. We

should also allow our younger generation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



to  understand our problems and our tasks.  We  all

know  that most of the consumers are in the  middle

and   lower  income  groups.  These  consumers  are

purchasers.  They  must have  a  good  standard  of

living  before  they can spend more.  Although  the

average income of the workers has improved somewhat

more than before, generally speaking, however,  the

degree  of improvement is very small. Although  the

market for consumer goods is quite active, most  of

the  goods  are  purchased on hire purchase  terms.

Many consumers, after acquiring such consumer goods

on  an  instalment  basis,  later  find  themselves

unable  to  pay the whole amount due. So  they  get

into  difficulties because of lack of  money.  From

these instances, we can see clearly that though one

side  of  the  picture  represents  our  nation  as

prosperous, on the other side of it, however, there

are  still  the workers whose purchasing  power  is

limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to suggest is that

when   we   talk  about  individual   income,   the

accumulative  income of an individual may  increase

his purchasing power, but there are instances where

the method of taxation may not channel capital into

productive fields. The people are generally  paying

taxes,  but the rich are still able to evade paying

what  they should pay. So this has brought about  a

greater  difference between the rich and  the  poor

and  a  certain  amount  of economic  imbalance  in

society, with the result that there may not  be  an

equal  enjoyment  of the services provided  by  the

country.  The  poor will be struggling  forever  in

dire   poverty;  the  rich  will  be  richer;   and

therefore  the line between the rich and  the  poor

will be more marked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an outstanding problem with regard to

urban renewal. Everybody wants to look forward to a

better  future, but the upheavals caused  by  urban

renewal  cannot escape our attention. Urban renewal

schemes  should  achieve social  progress  and  not

cause  any exploitation of the people. They  should

not cause the people any inconvenience. But we have

seen that many people have been forcibly removed as

a result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



of  urban renewal schemes. These people - especially

the  hawkers  and  small merchants  - have  suffered

quite  a  lot  economically as a  result  of  urban

renewal  schemes.  Although we have  allotted  them

shops,  they normally fight shy of taking  them  up

because  of the high rentals. They just admire  the

shops  without  daring to rent  them.  Yet  we  are

encouraging  the capitalists to take  part  in  our

urban   renewal   schemes  by  giving   them   more

favourable terms. Of course, nobody can  accuse  us

of  not  encouraging  them to invest  in  order  to

increase  our  economic prosperity. We  are  giving

them  a  lot of encouragement and favourable terms.

For  instance,  we grant them tax exemption  for  a

number of years, good sites for development, better

attention   and  facilities.  From   this   glaring

example,  the people are given the impression  that

we  are granting better facilities to the rich  who

are availing themselves of Government assistance to

achieve their own purposes. On the other hand,  the

small  merchants and hawkers have more or  less  to

close  shop after they have been forcibly  evicted.

This  situation  can he described  as  an  abnormal

development.  In  other words, we are  helping  the

rich  and  doing nothing for the poor.  Thus,  this

problem  is not being looked into properly  by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to express the hope that

our   Government  will  thoroughly  carry  out  the

objectives  in  their manifesto in a  revolutionary

spirit  in order to bring about a democratic,  non-Communist  socialist society  and  to  redress  the

balance  between the poor and the rich. I hope  the

Government  can put forward suggestions to  achieve

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy with regard to the

encouragement  of foreign investments  should  also

take account of the interest of the small merchants

and  hawkers so that there can be equal development

among  all sections of our population. I am of  the

view  that  the  Government should set  up  a  loan

organisation, for instance, to help taxi-drivers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



We  know that their taxis are  mostly  on

loan or on hire, and some of them purchase them  on

hire purchase terms at very high interest. So their

monthly expenses are very heavy. In addition,  they

have  to maintain their families. Very often,  they

cannot  continue to pay their instalments  half-way

and  their vehicles are taken back by the  sellers.

So  this  loan organisation can in a  way  help  to

solve part of the problems of the taxi-drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small merchants who are evicted as a result

of  urban  renewal  should also be  helped  by  the

Government to resettle in new shops by a scheme  of

service. The Government should help to re-establish

their   businesses  through  some  form  of  loans,

because  we  know  that even the  large  commercial

firms   have   to   depend  on   larger   financial

organisations to back them up. So this is a  factor

that will affect our economic prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the Government can set up a

corporation to enable the people to invest  in  it,

to  encourage  them to buy shares of various  firms

and  industries.  Thus the investors  will  not  be

confined to just a small group of people. This will

help  the masses to take part in investment schemes

and   become  shareholders.  If  there   are   more

investors,  there will be more funds  to  replenish

our  financial resources and to help carry out  the

Government's  economic  policies.  It  is  also  in

keeping  with the Government's economic  plans  and

the  nature  of  our economy so that  our  national

wealth  can be more equally distributed  among  our

people. This will help them to achieve a better and

equal socialist society earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my suggestions. At the same time, I

would also like to express my support for the  many

good points in the Budget Statement of the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it would indeed be

difficult   to   find  a  newly   independent   and

developing nation, particularly in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



this part of the world, whose Budget Estimates show

a   surplus   and   whose   revenue   exceeds   its

expenditure. It is a truism to say that every newly

independent and developing nation inevitably  finds

it  necessary  to  raise income  tax,  import  tax,

property  tax  and various taxes  of  one  kind  or

another  or to obtain loans from foreign  countries

or,  if  not,  to  sell one of the islands  in  its

territory   in   order  to  finance  its   national

expenditure. There was a time during  the  Lim  Yew

Hock regime when the Singapore Government found  it

necessary to sell Christmas Island in order to  get

money  to  overcome  the deficit  in  the  national

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore, ever since it came under the

P.A.P. rule, has steadily progressed in prosperity.

Its  social  services  have improved;  its  housing

problems  which posed a major problem at  one  time

have  now  been successfully overcome; every  child

born  is  assured of a place in school, no  matter

whether  he stays far or near; industrial  disputes

between  employers and employees are decreasing  in

number.  All  these achievements  are  due  to  the

dedication, sincerity and hard work of the  leaders

as  well as to their correct leadership in striving

towards  the  goal of progress and  prosperity  and

harmony  among its multi-racial citizens. Moreover,

the  Minister for Finance is an acknowledged expert

in  economics.  That  is why  Singapore  today  can

justly be proud of the successes it has achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is usual, every time the Minister for Finance

presents the Budget Estimates, for every sector  of

the public, from the businessman to the worker,  to

become  apprehensive and wonder whether there  will

be any increases in taxes. But this time the public

were much relieved when it was announced that there

were  to  be  no increases in taxes for the  coming

year.  If there are those who are somewhat  worried - the  number  is  not big - it  is  because  of  the

devaluation  of the Pound Sterling. But  I  believe

that  they  too will be relieved to know  that  the

economy of Singapore is not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



stable but improving from time to time, as has been

stated by the Minister in his policy speech on  the

Budget for 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the facts he gave was that the use of

granite  continues  to  increase  due  to  building

construction - construction of new roads and  repair

of  old roads - an increase of two and a half times.

Another  economic  indicator,  which  the  Minister

found interesting to watch, was the increase in the

number of motorcycles and scooters registered. Five

years  ago, the average was 548 per month, but  for

the last three months the average was 1,258. So too

is  it the case with the construction of factories,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the examples mentioned

just  now  are as yet no cause for satisfaction  to

me. The increase in the use of granite to build new

roads - to nearly 130,000 cubic yards per month  - is

of    little    benefit   to   Kampong    Kembangan

Constituency.  To  date,  the  roads   in   Kampong

Kembangan are still full of pot-holes and unfit not

only   for   vehicular   traffic   but   also   for

pedestrians. The fact is that requests and  appeals

have  incessantly and repeatedly been made  to  the

Ministry,  but unfortunately all to  no  avail.  So

today  you find that about 80 per cent of the roads

in  Kampong  Kembangan are still in a sorry  state.

Moreover,  during  the present rainy  season,  with

Christmas coming soon, to be followed by  Han  Raya

Puasa  and  Chinese New Year, you can be sure  that

the  residents  of Kampong Kembangan,  who  are  of

various  races  and  religions, will  be  observing

these  days  with an air of despondency and  gloom,

even though taxes are not raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance was elated to note the

increase in the number of motor-cycles and scooters

registered  in the past three months, an indication

that skilled artisans and white-collar workers  are

also benefiting from our economic expansion. I  am,

however,  sad  when I think of the number  of  car-owners

who  have found it necessary to sell  their

cars  because of the increase last December in  the

cost  of petrol, car tax, and driving licence fees.

Furthermore, they have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



pay for parking in the city, to the extent that car-owners, even if they are flat dwellers, have to pay

to park near their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the reasons for the increase in

the  number of motorcycles and scooters registered,

rather  than  that the increase is due to  economic

expansion.  Car owners have to economise,  and  the

simplest and cheapest way is to sell their cars and

buy motor-cycles and scooters instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the increase in the number of

new  factories, admittedly this is good because  it

provides  jobs for the unemployed. But my complaint

is  that  a number of these factories are built  in

residential  areas, such as Kampong  Kembangan.  My

constituency is a residential area, but  industries

such  as  sawmills, iron foundries, etc, are  fast

growing  in  number, like mushrooms after  a  heavy

rain.  All  this affects the peace and tranquillity

of  the  residents in my constituency. Quite  often

the  power  supply is disrupted on account  of  the

heavy  machinery, and the noise emanating therefrom

disturbs the tranquillity of the neighbourhood  and

is  another  nuisance to the children who  wish  to

study  their lessons at home. Roads and drains  are

damaged.  Far  from being regularly maintained  and

repaired,  these roads and drains are now subjected

to constant use by heavy vehicles which pass to and

from the factories, causing even greater damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, although the figures and indications

which   point  to  our  economic  development   are

interesting, as stated by the Minister for Finance,

nevertheless  I,  for one, am still  not  convinced

that  the  people of Singapore will not  experience

increased taxation in 1968. In the first place,  if

the Minister is unable to anticipate the number  of

Government   officers  going  into  retirement   as

evidenced in the Supplementary Estimates for  1967,

which was debated last Monday, I do not see how  he

is  able  to  anticipate  that  the  collection  of

revenue will exceed expenditure for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



1968.  In  the  second place, the Minister  himself

stated   that   he   expected   another   set    of

Supplementary Estimates for next year. Whereas  the

surplus  for  1968  is only to  the  tune  of  $0.3

million, the Supplementary Estimates for 1967  was

for   more  than  $5  million.  Thus,  the   Budget

Estimates for 1968 are at best vague. It is not  as

yet  certain that the people of Singapore will  not

experience tax increases in the coming year.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, much praise has been  given  to  the

Budget  speech  of  the Finance  Minister  - by  the

ordinary   man   in   the   street,   by   bankers,

industrialists,   traders,, and   merchants.   The

speakers before me have also praised him, and I  am

sure  the speakers after me too, will be resounding

these  praises, if I were to add even more praise,

I  am afraid the Finance Minister might not be able

to bear the burden. And so, if I do not join in the

chorus, then I think it does not deserve praise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget speech on the financial policy of the

Government for the year 1968 can be divided broadly

into  three  parts. Firstly, the  Finance  Minister

surveys  the  progress for the year;  secondly,  he

analyses  the  problems of the ensuing  year;  and,

thirdly,  he tells us what he proposes to  do  with

it.  As I sat listening to his survey, I could  not

help  feeling  very  proud  of  being  a  Singapore

citizen. Mr Speaker, Sir, I assure you it was  not

on account of the language of the Finance Minister,

whose language was indeed restrained and sober.  My

pride  swelled  from the facts the Minister  reeled

out one after another. Everything was up - trade was

up,  not  only in value but even more so in volume,

and by a staggering 15 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a very recent Colombo Plan report

quoted  in  the local Press, only two countries  in

Asia  had  an increase in their share of the  world

trade. These are Singapore and South Korea, bearing

in  mind that we flourish (to use the words of  the

Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



Minister)  entirely  on skill  and  expertise.  The

distinction in trade is something to warm  all  our

hearts.  The number of ships using our harbour  has

gone up, and so has the tonnage. Bank deposits  are

up.  So  has  building construction gone  up  - both

public and private. There was even a short shortage

of  cement. Receipts from tourism are up, and there

is  a  grave shortage of hotels which we are trying

very  hard to remedy. Manufacturing output has gone

up,  and industrial investment is also up, so  much

so  that the Economic Development Board has to have

a crash programme in factory construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our achievements for the year

have  really  been impressive and  satisfying.  But

what  is  more gratifying is that not only have  we

kept  up  with economic development which began  in

1959, but we have also distributed the uses of our

increasing  wealth  in a more  just  and  equitable

manner.  Since  1959, in spite of rapid  population

increases,  the  per capita income has  risen  from

about  $1,200 to about $1,700, or by about  42  per

cent. At this figure we certainly have a per capita

income exceeded only perhaps by Japan in Asia. This

alone will mean very little to the common man if he

does not get an increasing share of the use of  the

increased wealth. As the Minister has observed - and

on which I can personally testify - not only has the

number  of cars but also the number of motor-cycles

and  scooters  has  gone up very rapidly.  All  the

factories   in  Jurong  that  I  know  of   provide

substantial  parking  lots  for  motor-cycles   and

scooters of the ordinary worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If further proof of a better life for the

ordinary worker is required, one need go no further

than  to  any of the vast subsidised public housing

estates  and  observe the living conditions  there.

One  will  see radio and television sets in  nearly

every  home.  One will see the car  parks  full  of

cars,  motor-cycles and scooters.  The  only  thing

that  one perhaps will not see is a boy or girl  of

school-going age not in school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very satisfying matter is the continued

improvement in the industrial relations climate  in

Singapore.  This is no doubt one of  the  important

factors  in our economic progress during the  year.

According  to  figures  published  by  the   Labour

Ministry,  man-days  lost  on  account  of  strikes

dropped from a peak of 411,000 in 1961 to 44,000 in

1966.  Figures for this year are not yet available.

But   from  what  we  know,  except  for  the  Hume

Industries strike, there does not seem  to  be  any

major   work   stoppages.  The  better   industrial

relations  climate today may be attributable  to  a

reorientation  of  basic  thinking   between   both

management  and labour circles. There  has  been  a

marked  willingness on both sides to place national

interests,  and  therefore  of  the  general  good,

before any other interests, and there has developed

a  new  mood  where  both  sides  are  increasingly

anxious to sit down and reason rather than to fight

it  out.  This  is  especially  so  in  the  Jurong

industrial complex, it is here, I think,  that  the

workers deserve a special compliment; not only have

they and their leaders, with rare exceptions, shown

a remarkable degree of responsibility in industrial

relations,   but  they  have  also  widened   their

activities   into   the   social,   cultural    and

recreational fields. In these activities, I am glad

to  note  that  the  management has  willingly  co-operated  by  donating funds. If the good  work  is

sustained, I am confident that before long Jurong's

leisure hours will be as vigorous as during working

hours.  The Economic Development Board also deserve

a  compliment.  I have heard from both  labour  and

management  leaders that had it not  been  for  the

understanding  and support of the  Board,  progress

would have been very much less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the problems of the coming year,

we find that in spite of the advances we have made,

unemployment will still be a threat to the core  of

our  social  fabric.  As the Finance  Minister  has

rightly  pointed out, if Singapore has not done  so

much as it did in stimulating economic growth,  the

situation would have been much worse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



But  now  with  Britain's military withdrawal,  our

problem  - again to quote the Finance  Minister - has

been  severely  aggravated. According  to  him,  by

1971,  16,000  people  will be  retrenched  by  the

British.  We  have  already 52,000  unemployed  and

every  year  we  have 25,000 people coming  out  of

schools  looking for jobs. Thus if we are to  solve

our  unemployment problem completely,  the  Finance

Minister  tells us, we have to create  43,000  jobs

every year for the next three years. This is indeed

a  gigantic task calling for prodigious efforts. In

industry, figures, of course, vary from factory  to

factory.  It  takes generally at  least  $3,000  to

create one job. If we are to create 43,000 jobs  in

industry, we will need $1,290 million in investment

every  year.  If  we compare this figure  with  our

gross national product estimated for 1966, at about

$3,200  million, we will see the magnitude  of  our

task.  In  other words, the gross capital formation

will  have  to be more than one-third of our  gross

national  product.  The Economic Development  Board

estimate that in 1966 gross capital formation ranks

at about 14 per cent of gross domestic expenditure.

To  put it bluntly, even doubling our efforts  will

not  be  good enough. This is, of course,  assuming

that  all  jobs  are  created in the  manufacturing

sector.  In other sectors the cost of jobs  may  be

lower. The Finance Minister estimates that some $45

million  put into new hotels may create some  2,500

jobs. This works out to some $18,000 per job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the trading sector, because capital is turned

round  very much faster, the cost of jobs  will  be

lower,  and it is here that we should try to expand

with as much vigour as, if not more vigour than, in

the  manufacturing sector. I, therefore, hope  that

the trading agency proposed by the Finance Minister

will  not  confine itself to servicing  the  export

needs of our manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our unemployment problem is a

very  severe one. The Finance Minister has outlined

brave and decisive steps to be taken to solve that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



problem.  We  wish  him  all  success.  There   is,

however,  one  aspect he has  not  dealt  with.  If

Singapore can mobilise enough resources to meet the

problem,  then  he is, of course, right  to  ignore

this aspect. I refer to the rather large number  of

people  who  are  not citizens and who'  work  here

under  the  work permit system. I do not  know  the

exact  figure.  But I understand it  to  be  around

20,000. The Finance Minister, in referring  to  the

retrenchment  of  Base workers,  stated  that  only

citizens arc our responsibility. The question I now

pose is whether the employment of these 20,000 non-citizens  is  our responsibility. I call  upon  the

Government to review constantly the policy  on  the

granting of work permits. I have every sympathy for

people  north of the Causeway, and I would be  very

happy  to  see  them  being able  to  get  jobs  in

Singapore  if our own citizens are not  unemployed.

But this is not the case and it is not made easier

by  the  tariff wall raised by their Government.  I

think this House should accept the basic philosophy

that  there  can  be  no common market  for  labour

without  a common market for the output of  labour.

The  Budget for next year has been described by the

Finance  Minister  as a continuation  Budget.  Some

newspapers   have  described  it  as  a  standstill

Budget. This term, I think, is a misnomer. Only the

rates of taxes stand still. Revenue and expenditure

are  anything but standing still. They go up by 8.7

per cent. Many countries have to run very hard with

tax  rates  in order to keep still. In  Singapore's

case, with unchanged taxation, revenue is estimated

to increase by a welcome $56 million and, as usual,

the  Ministry of Education takes a huge  bite  from

revenue. It is estimated to spend nearly a  quarter

of  the  Republic's budget. If the figure of $151.6

million for 1968 is to he compared with that of $60

million  for  1959, the progress in  the  field  of

education  is  apparent.  Expenditure  has   almost

trebled, while the population has increased by less

than  one-fifth. No other evidence is as  clear  as

this  of a socialist budget. Similarly the Ministry

of Health, with the Hospital and Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



Health  Divisions,  expect  to  spend  some   $70.6

million.  Compared with the 1959  figure  of  $28.4

million,  the  increase shows  again  the  mark  of

socialism.  And what has socialism brought  us?  In

spite  of  the  turbulence in the few  years  since

1959,   our   country  has  prospered.   Everybody,

irrespective of race, colour or creed, has  a  more

equal  start and everybody has a better life. Every

child  has  a  free place in a primary  school  and

every  sick  person can get free medical attention.

Any person in misfortune can get public assistance.

Consumption  of  electricity and gas,  the  obvious

indicator of a better life, has more than  doubled.

At  the  same time, the infant mortality rate,  the

obvious  indicator  of  an  inadequate  life,   has

dropped  from about 35 per thousand life births  to

about  25.  Mr Speaker. Sir, we have before  us  a

good budget, a socialist budget.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  a parliamentary  democracy  all

measures  of  the  Government  must  be  tabled  in

Parliament  for discussion before they are  passed.

This  is  to  give  the Opposition  Party  and  the

Members of Parliament an opportunity to discuss all

measures  which  will reflect  the  wishes  of  the

people.  In  Parliament as it is now, there  is  no

Opposition Party. The Opposition Party make use  of

youngsters between the ages of 18 and 19  to  carry

out   disturbances  in  the  streets,  while   they

themselves usually hide in the day time. They  have

thus  lost  the support of the people.  So  in  the

present  situation  where there are  no  Opposition

Members  of  Parliament  in this  House,  we,  as

Members of Parliament of the Government Party, have

to  take up the responsibility of the Opposition to

examine  all measures tabled by the Government.  We

must make an examination of all Bills, measures and

motions.  We  must  make  a careful  and  searching

analysis  of  all these and our views must  reflect

the  wishes and will of the people. We must act  as

the voice of the people. We must bring the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



people's voice into this House. We must air all our

views on this basis. We must carry out all this  in

the  most objective manner. We must give our  views

to  all  these measures before us and supervise  in

the execution of the various proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members of Parliament on this side are

now   taking   up  the  responsibilities   of   the

Opposition.  They  give views and  make  criticisms

which  are  constructive. So it is  different  from

what  took  place  before in this  House  when  the

Opposition    Party    just   made    irresponsible

criticisms, destructive in a way, of any Government

measures  and  Bills.  They  tried  to  blame   the

Government for every proposal or every misdeed  and

they  tried  to  depict them as being undemocratic.

They described Government measures as impracticable

and even went to the extent of describing Singapore

as a place unsuitable for human habitation. But the

present  so-called Opposition here  will  make  its

criticisms  in an objective manner.  They  will  be

constructive and will reflect the views and  wishes

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of Parliament acting as an Opposition

Member here, I would like to give some of my  views

on the Finance Minister's Budget for 1968. First of

all,  let  me congratulate the Finance Minister  on

being able to produce a Budget in which there is no

proposal  for  a  tax  increase.  This  Budget  has

received the support of people in various walks  of

life because there is no taxation next year. It  is

a  piece of good news to all of them. They have all

welcomed  this  Budget.  After  congratulating  the

Finance    Minister,   I   must   express   certain

reservations  on his Budget. I cannot  support  the

motion  without any reservation merely because  the

Budget  does  not  propose any  tax  increase.  The

Minister for Finance has pointed out in his  Budget

Statement  that  he  does not propose  to  increase

taxes.  This shows that Singapore's economy is  not

under  the  manipulation of  any  foreign  economic

force. It also shows that Singapore has put to good

use  all  its  social and economic  facilities  and

services. It also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



shows  the maturity of Singapore's society and  the

strength of its economy. Normally the income  of  a

country  depends  on two factors.  One  is  natural

resources and the second is human resources. But in

such  a  tiny  island like Singapore there  are  no

natural resources. So to hope for natural resources

is a day-dream. Therefore, the economy of Singapore

should  depend  on  the  creation  of  new  natural

resources.  From  the  Budget  Statement   we   can

understand the economic situation better. This will

help us to carry out our tasks and to face the  new

situation. Sometimes we find it easier to know than

to practise. But on other occasions it may prove to

be  just the reverse. It is not easy to be sure  of

what  is  correct and what is wrong. The  practical

thing  is  that since the Budget is before  us,  we

must try to carry it out successfully. There is  no

time to discuss whether it is easier to know or  to

practise,  or  the  other way round.  We  must,  in

carrying out our economic policy, achieve a certain

measure   of   success   in  order   to   implement

Government's economic policies. This will  have  to

depend  on  the  efforts and  co-operation  of  the

people with the Government. The people want to have

a productive life and to live meaningfully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to increase economic activities and to raise

the  living standard., how to solve the problem  of

an increasing population and to meet their material

needs,  how to solve the unemployment problem  - all

these are questions which we will have to face  and

solve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to enumerate all the items in

the  Minister's financial statement,  but  some  of

them  need our special attention. First of  all,  I

would  like to give my views in an abstract way  on

his   Budget   Statement.  The   present   economic

situation  should  not make us too  complacent.  We

must  redouble  our efforts and  strive  harder  to

strengthen our economic position in order  to  meet

our  increasing  material needs and demands.  There

has  been  an  improvement in the living  standard.

Taxation does not worry us now. But the increase of

population



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



is   quite   a   problem.  It  will   create   more

unemployment. According to the Minister's  figures,

the  number of unemployed, is more than 50,000,  on

top  of which there will be retrenched workers  and

others  coming in to make up the number. From  this

we  can  see  that  the unemployment  situation  is

rather  serious  in  our country.  Moreover,  as  a

result  of  the  British military  withdrawal,  the

unemployment situation in Singapore will be  worse,

because  the  withdrawal will  reduce  the  British

military expenditure in Singapore and cut down  our

economic  activities. It will also mean a recession

of  the  economy. It is not a problem to  be  faced

lightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see anything in the Minister's Statement

giving  a clear-cut policy to resolve this  problem

by  allotting another item of expenditure  to  meet

the  reduction in the British military  expenditure

in  Singapore.  Because of all these factors,  more

people  are unemployed. In addition to this, 18,000

people  will be retrenched by the British  military

forces. There will be 25,000 youngsters who will be

leaving  school  to join our labour  market.  These

youngsters  are full of life. They are enthusiastic

and  keen  to render their services to society,  to

take  part in economic activities and to serve  the

country and the people. <br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should try our best to create employment

opportunities  to  enable  them  to  fulfil   their

wishes. The Government has already done its best in

mobilising large sums of money and other  resources

to  create  employment opportunities for them.  But

these  employment  opportunities  cannot  meet  the

actual demands of the unemployed. This is a serious

problem.  According to the Minister,  in  the  next

three  and a half years, as a result of the British

military withdrawal, about 16,000 workers  will  be

retrenched.  On top of this, there will  be  25,000

youngsters joining the labour market in addition to

the  50,000 odd who are already unemployed. But the

Government   has   not  paid   attention   to   the

agricultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



workers  who are under-employed at the moment.  The

Government's   efforts   in   creating   employment

opportunities can only provide jobs for 5,000. What

about  the others who are unemployed? In  spite  of

Government's efforts, it is only able to  create  a

limited number of jobs for the unemployed. In other

words,  Government's efforts are not sufficient  to

meet  the  demand of the existing unemployed.  What

about  those  middle-aged people with  families  to

support who will be retrenched? Sir, because of the

various   problems  now  existing,  we  cannot   be

overjoyed with this surplus Budget. In the case  of

a family, it will have to plan its budget according

to its income. But it is different in the case of a

Government.  A family cannot budget its expenditure

more  than  what  it  earns. In  other  words,  the

expenditure  of  the  family  must  be  within  the

expected  in-come of the family. If the  income  is

sufficient,  then  the  family  can  increase   its

expenditure. If the income is not enough,  then  it

will have to curtail its expenditure by some means.

But  the budgeting of a country is not exactly like

this. It is not based merely on the income, because

the budgeting will have to depend, on the needs  of

expenditure  in  various fields. We  cannot  reduce

expenditure  on social services such  as  education

and  health because of shortage of revenue. We must

maintain  a  certain level of expenditure  for  the

social  services.  I support the  Minister  in  his

budgeting  in  such fields as health and  education

because  the  expenditure  allotted  to  them  will

enable us to have a healthy and educated generation

which will in turn make our future generations more

economically active and useful. This will  in  turn

benefit  the  economy  of  Singapore.  And  I  must

congratulate  the  Minister  for  Finance  on   his

farsightedness  in allotting such a  large  sum  on

education  and  health.  I  must  agree  with   his

budgeting in these spheres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must not be complacent with

our present economic achievements. We must also try

to  re-solve our unemployment problem. At least  we

must be able to reduce the number of unemployed  to

the level that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



it will not endanger social security. Before we can

achieve  this,  I  can  only express  my  qualified

support of this surplus Budget.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, from

the  Budget for 1968 presented by the Hon. Minister

for  Finance,  it  is evident  that  the  level  of

production   has  gone  up  and  the  economy   has

progressed  in  many spheres. It is  gratifying  to

note  that the G.N.P. has increased by 8  per  cent

over that for the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has given three reasons

for  the good performance of our economy. They are:

first,  growth  of  trade with  Indonesia;  second,

expansion  of  exports  to  South  Vietnam;  third.

substantial  increase in the flow of  capital  from

Hong  Kong. These three reasons are not the  direct

results  of  the conditions prevailing in  our  own

country. By a coincidence of circumstances, we  may

be  having  today a favourable condition.  However,

when circumstances change, conditions will cease to

favour  the  growth of our economy and output.  For

instance,  when the present conditions  of  war  in

South  Vietnam  change,  we  may  not  be  able  to

maintain  the  present level  of  exports  to  that

country.   In  the  same  way,  when  the  cultural

revolution and labour unrest subside in Hong  Kong,

the  Hong Kong industrialists who have invested  in

Singapore's  industries may pull out their  capital

and  return to that colony. Or they might gradually

reduce  the  production level  in  Singapore  while

increasing  it in Hong Kong. In such a  case,  this

will adversely affect our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many types of industries have been opened in an

effort  to increase the Republic's production,  but

we  do not have any raw materials to meet the needs

of  our factories. We are dependent at all times on

foreign  countries for the supply of raw  materials

for the use of our factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Finance, five years

ago  before  the  number of U.S, troops  in  South

Vietnam  was increased, our trade with that country

was in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



range  of  $50 million to $60 million per year.  In

1965,  the  value of our trade with  South  Vietnam

rose  from  $110  million to $256 million.  It  now

stands at $300 million. Five years ago, there  were

only  10,000 to 15,000 American soldiers  in  South

Vietnam.  At  the moment, there are nearly  500,000

American soldiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the American people themselves are

demonstrating  in front of the White House  against

the   stationing   of   U.S. troops   and   direct

involvement   in  the  Vietnam  war.  Under   these

circumstances, if the American troops withdraw from

Vietnam  and peace returns, we should bear in  mind

that  our  $300 million export boom will  be  wiped

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the warning given by the Minister for

Finance that the withdrawal of British troops  from

Singapore  in the 1970s will very much  affect  our

economy.  It  gives consolation  to  learn  that  a

special  unit  has been established  in  the  Prime

Minister's  Department to study plans  to  put  the

base  to productive use in order to counteract  the

ill   effects  of  the  British  withdrawal,   like

unemployment and economic difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has dealt elaborately with the question of unemployment. A count of identity cards has given the figure of unemployed as 43,405. As a result of the withdrawal of British troops, another 12,000 people will lose their jobs. In addition, every year 25,000 youths, after

completion  of  their  schooling,  will  enter  the

employment   market.   To   meet   the    situation

successfully, the Republic will have to generate an

additional  $80  million  expenditure  each   year,

create  18,000  additional jobs a  year  to  absorb

those  presently  unemployed as well  as  the  Base

workers  expected to be retrenched,  and  create  a

further  25,000 new jobs a year for the youths  who

will be hunting for jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these pressing demands, it is imperative

that  we  should  expand the volume  of  trade  and

increase the industrial output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, who has dwelt on the growth of

trade with Indonesia, has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  anything about our trade  with  Malaysia

and  other neighbouring countries. This creates the

impression that we do not have any trade relations

with these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must bear in mind that the growth of trade

with countries like Indonesia and South Vietnam  is

due   to   the  prevailing  conditions   in   those

countries.   We  must  find  ways  and   means   of

strengthening   our   trade  relations   with   our

neighbours so that, even under peaceful conditions,

our economy will be strong and stable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is a small island with no

natural resources, we have a wide sea around us  to

exploit.  With the co-operation of our neighbouring

countries, we should strive to do deep-sea  fishing

and  turn  our attention to producing and exporting

various kinds of sea food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that plans to expand the

Jurong  Shipyard  with a view to  building  medium-sized ships are being studied with the help of some

Japanese firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that our economy will get a jolt on

account of the British troop withdrawal, especially

when we are only in the second year of independence

and  tussling with the problems of unemployment and

productivity. True, like Aden, Malta and Gibraltar,

Singapore   was  once  the  centre   of   economic,

commercial and military enterprises of the  British

imperialists.    Under   the   changed    political

conditions,  Singapore  cannot  continue  to  be  a

pillar   of   British  imperialism.   Even   though

Singapore  cannot continue to be the political  and

military  centre for the British, the Republic  can

be  an  important base for the expansion of British

trade  and  commerce  in South-east  Asia.  British

troops  may be withdrawn completely from Singapore,

but Britain may not be able to find another country

which  will  be as friendly and as co-operative  as

the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should try to employ the

retrenched  Singapore citizens in the  Base  itself

after it is converted to civilian use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the withdrawal of British troops,

more  land  will be available to the Government.  I

suggest  that  the  Government use  the  land,  for

increasing   productivity,  including  agricultural

production.   The  unemployed  may   be   gainfully

employed in the land available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Minister for Finance should be

congratulated  on presenting not only  a  realistic

Budget but also on discussing frankly the problems

facing  the  nation  and  enumerating  clearly  the

course  of  action  proposed to  he  taken  by  the

Government.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  Minister  for  Finance  delivered  his  Budget

Speech  on  the Estimates for 1968 on  the  5th  of

December.  It  immediately won the acclaim  of  the

business  community. They are all agreed that  this

is  a far-sighted and, wise economic policy of  the

Government. It is also an indication of our  stable

economy.  The  main feature of the Budget  is  that

there is no tax increase and that there will  be  a

surplus  of  about $30 million. The stable  economy

and  industrial progress can be attributed to  the

following factors. Firstly, our political stability

with  a  favourable  investment  climate  which  is

rarely  found in other South-east Asian  countries.

Secondly,  our  economic incentives and  facilities

for  industrial investors. Thirdly,  our  excellent

geographic    position    and    other     economic

infrastructures.  Fourthly,  industrial  peace  and

excellent   co-operation  between  management   and

workers  and  their  desire to increase  industrial

efficiency. It goes without saying that we must try

to maintain these four factors and strengthen them

so as to enable our economy to advance steadily and

to  bring  prosperity  and a  higher  standard  of

living for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his review of our national economy, the

Minister for Finance came to the conclusion that we

have  been able to achieve an increase of 8.7  per

cent  in  our  G.N.P. According to  him,  this  is

rarely achieved in the newly emergent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



Afro-Asian  countries. They have only  achieved  an

increase  of about three to four per cent in  their

G.N.P. This shows that our economy is thriving  and

flourishing. In order to have economic progress, it

is  not  only necessary to have competent political

leadership  in  the  economic  field  but  also  to

promote  a  spirit of thriftiness and industry.  If

the  people  are  lazy, disunited and  extravagant,

this  will  lead  to  an  economic  recession.  Our

national   task  is  to  promote  the   spirit   of

thriftiness, industry and discipline in our  people

not  only in their private lives but also in  their

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also glad to note in the speech that

tremendous  progress has been made in  our  pioneer

industries.  This  can be shown  in  the  following

figures. In 1966, there were 97 pioneer industries,

but  this  year we have 126 industries - an increase

of  30 per cent. In terms of capital investment  in

1966,  the figure was $293 million. The figure  for

this  year is $336 million - an increase of  25  per

cent.  Last year, there were 11,000 people  working

in  the pioneer industries but this year the figure

is 13,5000 people - an increase of 22 per cent. This

shows the tremendous progress that has been made in

our  pioneer  industries, in recent months,  almost

every  day  sees  new factories  being  opened.  In

November, ten factories were opened with a  capital

of $25 million, the greatest of which was the sugar

refinery. The sugar produced by this sugar refinery

is not only sufficient for local consumption but it

can  also  be exported to other countries  to  earn

foreign exchange.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have better prospects of our industrial

development. For example, many investors from  Hong

Kong  have come here to invest their capital  which

runs  to  $50 million. Many East European countries

have  also expressed their willingness to come  and

set  up  factories here. These facts  indicate  the

bright  prospects  of  our industrial  growth.  Of

course, industrialisation, apart from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



strengthening  our  economic  position,  will  also

provide  more  employment for the people.  In  this

respect,  we  have  achieved  good  results  and  I

believe  that  with greater effort we will  provide

more jobs for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech, the Minister for

Finance  also  revealed  that  there  has  been  an

increase  in  our  external trade from  January  to

September last year. In 1966, our imports  amounted

to  $5,530  million. The figure for  this  year  is

$5,956  million - an increase of about $425 million.

This  was due to our increased exports to Indonesia

and  Vietnam. This was made possible because of the

fact that we have won independence and have adopted

a non-aligned policy in our foreign affairs. But we

must  be  aware  that the international  market  is

highly competitive. If we want to sell our goods in

the international market, apart from adopting a non-aligned  policy and establishing friendly relations

with other countries, we must also try to lower the

cost of our production. If we can sell more of  our

products,  there is no cause for our  manufacturers

to  worry about their profits. We must also try  to

raise  the  quality of our products. I  have  often

said  that  our local products are not as  good  as

foreign goods and that, therefore, the consumers do

not  want  to  buy them. If this is  so,  then  our

manufacturers  must try their best to  improve  the

quality  of  their goods in order to  compete  with

other foreign goods on the international market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although in the past one year

there  has  been  an increase  of  7  per  cent  in

national  income and an increase of 8 per  cent  in

trade,   we  should  not  be  complacent   because,

according  to a disclosure of the Finance Minister,

there has also been an increase in unemployment. So

we can see that there are three kinds of increases,

although the last kind of increase is not  so  very

good  and I believe it is not an increase  that  is

welcome  to  our Finance Minister. Our problem  is:

how can we solve it? The Finance Minister has given

these  figures: firstly, there are  at  the  moment

52,630



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



unemployed   persons  according   to   the   Sample

Household  Survey which, according to the Minister,

is more reliable. Secondly, in the next three and a

half  years the run-down of British military  bases

will give rise to about 12,000 unemployed, persons.

Thirdly, every year we have about 25,000 youngsters

entering the labour market on leaving school. These

problems are a challenge which our country  is  now

facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a solution to these problems, the

Minister has offered three ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) generate an additional $80 million

expenditure  each year to offset the  reduction  of

British military expenditure;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) create 18.000 additional jobs a year to absorb those who are now unemployed and to provide

work for base employees expected to be retrenched;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) create a further 25,000 new jobs each year

for  the  teenagers coming of age and  looking  for

work.'



<br><br>But  after  offering all the solutions,  he  asked,

"Can  we do this?" Mr Speaker, I want to ask:  how

can  we  do this? First, according to the Minister,

we  have  to generate an additional expenditure  of

$80  million, My question is: where and how are  we

going  to  spend the money? Is it the intention  of

the Government to invest the money in industry,  or

to  assist  the present industry, or to  set  up  a

bigger  dockyard,  say, in Sembawang  or  in  other

parts  of  Singapore? Have we got  a  comprehensive

plan  for all this? I hope I can get an answer from

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the creation of 18,000 jobs for the

unemployed  and  the creation of a  further  25,000

jobs for the new job seekers. That means a total of

43,000 jobs per year. How are we going to create so

many  jobs?  According to the Finance Minister,  we

have  only been able to create about 5,000  jobs  a

year  in  industries,  which include  the  building

trade,  tourism, and manufacturing  industries.  So

the  jobs  created  are far, far below  our  actual

needs. But according to him, in spite of all  this,

we   have   every  confidence  in  overcoming   our

problems.  I entirely agree with his view,  because

at  the  present  moment our  Economic  Development

Board is on the proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



course and we are able to face this challenge.  But

I  feel that we should do all we can to marshal all

our  natural  and  human  resources  in  order   to

overcome all these problems. I would like to  offer

four proposals for the consideration of the Finance

Minister who, I hope, will pay particular attention

to what I have to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we should immediately look into the

possibility  of  agricultural  expansion,  such  as

setting  up  animal husbandry in  the  neighbouring

islands. We  must  not  overlook animal  husbandry  because

this  industry  gives about a few million  dollars'

income  to Indonesia. By creating animal husbandry,

we can give more jobs to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should look into the question of

growing  seaweed. Dr Tham Ah Kow, who is the  head

of  the  Fisheries  Division of the  University  of

Singapore,  has said that there are  many  uses  to

which seaweed can be put. According to him, seaweed

is  edible  and some kinds of seaweed can  be  made

into  cosmetics  or  even  preservatives.  In   his

estimate,  if  we have about 1,800  acres  for  the

growing  of  seaweed, we can  earn  more  than  $10

million  in foreign exchange per year.  This  is  a

good  way of increasing our national income, and  I

do  not  know  whether  the  Government  will  give

serious consideration to this proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should vigorously expand our fishing

industry.  We are an island State and we must  make

use  of  our geographical position for our economic

growth.  The people of Singapore consume a  lot  of

fish,  and we depend on various countries for  fish

which   amounts  to  75  per  cent  of  our  actual

consumption per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must expand our tourist trade

because  a lot of countries in the world depend  on

tourist trade for their national income and foreign

exchange. These countries include Japan and Hawaii.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Mr Speaker, the present Budget is a

very  progressive and praiseworthy one because  the

main items of expenditure are on education and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



social services. This is a sign of the Government's

efforts in the creation of a welfare State,  and  I

believe  that  with all efforts put  together,  our

national   economy  will  progress  even   further,

thereby  bringing us nearer to the  creation  of  a

prosperous, a more fair and equal society, with all

the  comforts for our people. Finally, let me  read

you a poem in the vernacular language in praise  of

this Budget. The lines are as follows: -



<pre>

            Tributes to the Budget of 1968,

            Men in commerce and industry have paid,

            Delighted are the people in general,

            With a painless Budget which they hail.

</pre>



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> In

Mandarin?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I will speak Mandarin when it

comes  to the turn of the Minister of Defence;  not

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the

Budget.  It is a Budget in keeping with the present

circumstances of Singapore's political and economic

growth. The Minister for Finance has really made  a

realistic  appraisal  which  is  reflected  in  his

"standstill  budget". Mr Speaker, this  is  not  a

matter of "I support you" or "You support me".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one particular feature in the Budget

which  I  wish  to  comment  on,  rather  than   to

criticise, and that is, the increased provision for

the  defence and security of Singapore.  There  are

some   people  who  question  the  wisdom  of   the

Singapore   Government  in  maintaining   a   large

military  force. In their opinion,  the  island  of

Singapore  cannot be defended against any  external

invasion  by  a determined enemy. Such people  miss

the   whole   point  by  not  agreeing   with   the

Government's policy in maintaining a large security

force. The principal purpose of maintaining such  a

force, as I see it, is to strengthen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



and  maintain internal peace and order and  not  to

guard  against external aggression. The need for  a

large  security force to maintain internal law  and

order  is not so far-fetched, for recently we  have

witnessed  how  a  handful of determined  agitators

could  cause  widespread disorder in a neighbouring

country  on the pretext of currency devaluation  by

the   Malaysian  Government.  We   saw   how   some

irresponsible  elements were able to  stir  up  the

emotions of the public against law and order, which

resulted  in  a communal conflict. Therefore,  Sir,

the  preparedness to guard against such a situation

arising  in  Singapore itself amply  justifies  the

maintenance of a large security force. There is  no

need to stress the importance of keeping peace  and

order  in  Singapore. As the Minister  for  Finance

himself  has  stated in his Budget  Speech,  it  is

vital  for  Singapore's industrial  development  to

encourage   the  inflow  of  foreign  capital   and

investment,  because such an inflow will  not  take

place if Singapore has no political stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also my intention to make a few

remarks  on the Ministry of Education. I note  with

gratification  that  more  than  one-third  of  the

Budget is devoted to social services, which include

education.  The  importance  of  education  to  the

Republic  of  Singapore cannot be  over-emphasised,

particularly as the only natural resource  that  is

present in Singapore for its industrial development

is  skilled  labour. In this respect, I  regret  to

observe  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  or  the

Government,  does  not  appear  to  pay  sufficient

attention  to the exploitation of our only  natural

resource.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture I must pause and say that I do

not  know whether the Minister for Finance  or  the

Minister  for Education is responsible for  such  a

state  of  affairs  where  our  educational  system

continues  to  churn out more white-collar  workers

than  blue-collar  workers  who  are  essential  in

manning  our  increasing number of  factories.  The

fact is that in comparing the total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



number  of secondary grammar schools with  that  of

vocational  schools  in Singapore,  I  notice  that

there  are  far  too  few  vocational  schools   in

existence to train technicians and artisans. Sir, I

have also glanced through the Development Estimates

for  1968. Although the Minister has made provision

for   $4,204,520  for  vocational   institutes   as

compared  with $5,937,120 for primary and secondary

schools, no doubt he has good foresight because  he

feels  that  if  we are going to industrialise,  we

have   to   have  more  technicians  and  artisans.

However,  the  number  of  vocational  schools   in

Singapore  today is still very much less than  that

of  grammar schools. The need for highly  qualified

technical  specialists is not so  pressing  as  the

need for relatively less qualified technicians  and

artisans:  yet our educational system is geared  to

the  production  of  specialists  rather  than   of

technicians.  I  do not know why there  is  such  a

situation   in   the  midst  of  cur   attempt   to

industrialise  our  economy. It  may  be  that  our

educational authorities do not have the  energy  or

imagination  to reorientate our educational  system

to   meet   the  changed  economic  and   political

circumstances in Singapore. Or it may be  that  the

Minister   for  Finance  has  not  paid  sufficient

attention or has not devoted his attention  to  the

establishment of more vocational schools, which  is

the  reason why such schools cannot turn out enough

competent technicians and artisans. If this is  the

case,  it  may  result in employers  having  a  low

opinion  of  the  training  given  by  the  present

vocational schools. This leads to a vicious  cycle,

that  is, employers do not want to employ graduates

of  our  vocational schools because of  their  poor

training, and students wishing to seek admission to

such   schools  are  hesitant  for  fear   of   the

difficulties  of  getting  employment  after  their

graduation.  Sir, is it because of the poor  demand

of   our  vocational  school  graduates  that   the

educational authorities or the Minister for Finance

feel  justified  in their policy  of  treating  the

vocational schools as poor cousins of the secondary

grammar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



schools? In this connection, I also wish to comment

on  the  bias  of  employers against  the  locally-trained   graduates.  I  know  that  the  Singapore

Government has done its best to boost the morale of

the  locally-trained graduates by giving preference

to  the employment of locally-trained graduates  in

Government  departments and statutory boards.  But,

unfortunately,  it  is  not  the  case   with   the

employers  in  the private sector who  continue  to

value  foreign diplomas and degrees more  than  the

local ones. It will not only be in the interest  of

the  locally-trained  graduates  but  also  in  the

interest  of Singapore as a whole if the Government

makes   a   strenuous  and  determined  effort   to

eradicate  the  private sector employers  of  their

bias  against the products of local education which

is  by  no means inferior to the product of foreign

education,  judging by the success of  Singaporeans

in foreign educational institutions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the Budget  for

1968  which deals comprehensively with the economic

situation  of  Singapore today.  Much  thought  and

effort  appears  to have gone into the  preparation

and  presentation of the Budget for 1968. A  layman

such as I, where economics is concerned, would find

it  very  difficult to criticise such  a  realistic

Budget.  While I am full of praise for  the  Budget

which  gives  a proper emphasis to the  problem  of

internal security, as a trade unionist. I  wish  to

bring  to  the attention of this House a  topic  to

which  passing  reference was made  in  the  Budget

Speech. What the Minister for Finance has said  was

"jobs  lost by contraction of industries or closing

down  of  established  firms  for  one  reason   or

another." And what I wish to point out is that  one

of  these reasons, if not the principal one, is the

necessary  consequences of  Singapore's  effort  to

industrialise  its economy. With the conversion  of

Singapore's hitherto entrepot oriented economy to a

manufacturing industry oriented economy, it  is  to

be expected that the change in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



the  economic activities must be reflected  in  the

utilisation  of  capital and labour  in  Singapore.

Unfortunately, labour is not so mobile  as  capital

and cannot adapt itself as easily to the change  in

economic activities. Members of the House are aware

that one of the first steps which Singapore took in

conjunction with its industrialisation projects was

to    legislate   for   the   protection   of   the

manufacturing industries in Singapore by  imposing

import quotas, import duties and other restrictions

on   the   flow  of  foreign  manufactured   goods.

particularly those of the range in competition with

locally-made  goods.  The  result  is  that   those

import/export  houses which deal  with  imports  of

foreign  manufactured  goods  now  being  made   in

Singapore  find that their volume of  business  has

diminished  and  their profits have disappeared  or

turned  into losses. Their reaction is to cut  down

or  retrench their staff in order to preserve their

profits or minimise their losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this comment today, my purpose is not

to   voice   any  complaint  about  the   necessary

retrenchment of workers as a result of  Singapore's

industrialisation programme, but  to  persuade  the

Government  to  mitigate  the  suffering   of   the

retrenched workers and their families as far as  it

is  humanly possible. What I seek to bring  to  the

attention of this House is to point out that  these

workers,  on top of their losing their  careers  in

which  they  have  spent the best  years  of  their

lives, find to their disbelief that they have  also

to  pay income tax on the retrenched benefits which

they   have   received  from  their  employers   as

compensation  for loss of career. This  failure  to

grant  exemption to retrenched employees on  income

tax  liability  in  respect of  their  retrenchment

benefits  is, I say, a great injustice  to  workers

who, through no fault of their own, find themselves

without  employment and are not  likely  to  obtain

alternative  employment within a  short  period  of

time during which their small retrenchment benefits

may  tide  them over. As a matter of  fact,  it  is

probable that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the retrenched workers will never  obtain

alternative employment because, by reason of  their

age,  they  are too old to be trained for different

occupations.  The  matter  of  retraining   workers

retrenched    as    a   result    of    Singapore's

industrialisation   programme    for    alternative

employment in the pioneer industries is,  I  regret

to note, not dealt with by the Minister for Finance

although he has taken great pains over the  problem

of retraining workers retrenched as a result of the

withdrawal  of  the  British  military  forces.  I,

however,  will  not confuse this House  by  further

reference to any retraining scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of relief for income tax in respect

of  any lump sum payment for loss of employment is,

as  far  as  I  understand  it,  dependent  on  the

discretion of the Comptroller of income Tax. If the

opinion  of the Comptroller is that such  lump  sum

represents  the  gratuity  payment  for   permanent

retirement  from employment, then the recipient  of

such gratuity is not liable for any income tax.  On

the   other  hand,  where  the  lump  sum   payment

represents  monetary  compensation  for   loss   of

career,  as in the case of retrenched workers,  who

in the opinion of ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I must draw the

Member's  attention  to  Standing  Order  82  which

provides that this debate should be confined to the

general   principles  of  Government   policy   and

administration as set forth in the Budget Statement

and  as indicated in the Main Estimates. The  point

the  Member  is making can, I think, very  well  he

made  under  the  amendments to Head  0807  (Inland

Revenue)  when we consider the Main Estimates.  The

present  debate  is  not the appropriate  place  to

criticise  a  matter of detail, as  the  Member  is

doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, the Minister for

Finance  did  make  a  passing  reference  to   the

impending  retrenchment  of  employees  of  British

Bases, and I was just referring to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



fact  that  he  has  omitted any reference  to  the

employees  retrenched  as a result  of  Singapore's

industrialisation  programme although  the  Finance

Minister,  in his Budget Speech, made reference  to

this industrialisation programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no objection to a broad

criticism,  but if the Member is making a  detailed

criticism   of   the  principles   on   which   the

Commissioner of inland Revenue guides  himself,  on

the  question  of  possible  relief  to  retrenched

employees,  the  appropriate place would  be  under

Head 0807. The detailed criticism now being made is

out of order in the present debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I accept your ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do proceed with the rest of your

speech. Mr Rodrigues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigues:</b> The rest of my speech, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  about the Comptroller of Income Tax,  and

the  hope that the Minister for Finance will  relax

the  strict  law  on payments arising  out  of  the

coming  retrenchment of the workers of the  British

military  bases  and  the  future  retrenchment  of

workers   due   to   Singapore's  industrialisation

programme. I hope that after union negotiations  on

benefits the workers be relieved from income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Under Head 0807, the Member for Bras

Basah  has an amendment to reduce the vote for  the

item  for  the whole head and I think it  would  be

appropriate  to  make  your  remarks   there,   Mr

Rodrigues.  But if you are not making  any  further

general  comments under Standing Order 82,  I  will

call the next Member who wants to speak.



<br><br>4.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, when it comes to the end of the year,

people  pay particular attention to Parliament.  It

is  mainly  because they want to know  whether  the

Government  will propose any tax increases  in  the

Budget for the coming year. Generally speaking, the

Government Budget should provide at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



least    for    the   maintenance   of    efficient

administration,   social   services,    educational

facilities and a large sum of expenditure  relating

to  security  and foreign affairs of  the  country.

There will then be a review of whether revenue  and

expenditure will balance. Fortunately the people of

Singapore  are under the guidance of  a  democratic

socialist, clean, honest, incorruptible and  highly

efficient  P.A.P. Government which has endured  two

years  of  independence. The Republic of  Singapore

does  not only exist but also continues to progress

and  prosper. The standard of living of the  people

is   also  improving.  This  augurs  well  for  the

germination  of  a  new  generation  of  democratic

socialists   in  this  newly  emergent  independent

country  of ours. At the same time, it  is  also  a

victory   for  the  democratic  socialist  economic

policy of the Government, and also tolls the  death

knell   for   the  exploiting  private   capitalist

economic  policy  and the Communist belt-tightening

economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Budget of the Finance Minister was

introduced in this House and there was no  proposal

for  a  tax  increase next year, all the people  of

Singapore were elated. They praised it.  It  was  a

stimulant to them. People in all walks of life,  be

they  merchants or hawkers, need not have to  worry

about  the  increase in prices  of  consumer  goods

because of tax increases and they need not have  to

worry  about  any economic recession.  The  working

class,  whether hawkers or wage-earners, also  need

not  have  to  fear an increase in  the  prices  of

consumer goods because of tax increase. At the same

time,  the Budget also serves as concrete proof  to

foreign investors that Singapore's economy is  very

stable  and sound: its political situation is  very

stable:  and  Singapore  is  a  haven  for  foreign

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, I have just said that this is

only  the  germination of democratic socialism.  We

must  go  a step further and irrigate and cultivate

the  shoot  of  democratic socialism  in  order  to

enable the shoot to blossom into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



flower  and achieve the highest ideal of  socialism

- from  each  according to his ability and  to  each

according  to  his need. In order to achieve  this,

all the citizens of Singapore should stand firm  on

their   respective  positions  and  redouble  their

efforts  in  order  to  ensure  the  security   and

economic  progress of the country. I  believe  that

with  the  co-operation and joint  efforts  of  our

people, our economy will grow year by year and  our

national  revenue will increase year by year  which

will  be  followed by social stability and economic

prosperity and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as democratic socialists, we are dedicated

to  the  establishment  of an  egalitarian  society

where  there is no hunger, no shortage of  material

supplies  and where the people can live  peacefully

together.  Therefore, the figures  of  unemployment

disclosed  in  the Minister's Budget Statement  are

rather  alarming.  This  really  is  a  very  grave

economic problem. The number of unemployed  persons

is  52,630,  which  is 9 per cent  of  our  working

population of 124,025 persons. So this is  not  far

away  from  the  danger line where  there  will  be

social    insecurity   and   social   disturbances.

Therefore, we cannot close our eyes to it  and  sit

idly  by without doing anything. The difficult  and

onerous task before us should not be borne  by  the

Government  alone.  It  is  not  enough   for   the

Government alone to resolve this problem. It  needs

the  co-operation of people in all walks  of  life.

Otherwise, when the river overflows its banks, when

the  danger line is overstepped, it will mean  that

our  whole  country and all the  people  will  face

disaster.  Sir, in order to prepare for  the  rainy

day,  we  must take certain measures. I agree  with

the  Member for Havelock. We must devise some means

to  solve our unemployment problem. I suggest  that

the  Government should create more hawker sites  or

bazaars  and  provide loans to  the  unemployed  as

capital for their business. The loan should be free

of  interest  in  order  to assist  them  in  their

livelihood. Secondly, the Government should set  up

some  kind of national factory in order to use this

cheap  labour. The Government should also legislate

to put these unemployed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



persons in various commercial firms to work. If the

Government  can do all this, it will  not  only  be

able  to  create  more  and new  opportunities  for

employment,  but  will  also  be  able  to  lay  an

optimistic  foundation  for  our  future   economy,

thereby  automatically resolving  our  unemployment

situation with ease.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is convenient to take the

suspension now. I suspend the sitting and will take

the Chair again at 5.20 p.m.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  first congratulate the Minister for Finance

and his Ministry on the excellent work done and the

fruitful  results obtained during  the  year  under

review. Hon. Members should not forget that much of

this   work  was  done  by  the  previous   Finance

Minister,  the Member for Cairnhill, who  held  the

reins   of   finance  since  our  separation   from

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has been told that there has been

continued  expansion  of  our  economy  this  year.

Astronomical figures were cited which were not only

impressive   but  also  revealing  and  astounding,

particularly  to the layman. In the Minister's  own

words,  the  total amount of cargo  discharged  and

handled  this year compared with that of last  year

showed  an increase of no less than 15.3 per  cent.

The  number  of  ships using our harbour  shows  an

increase of 8.8 per cent over last year. The volume

of  bank  deposits in the first ten months of  this

year shows an increase of no less than 29 per cent.

The  number  of new buildings commenced  this  year

shows no less than a 66 per cent increase over last

year  and  private  construction  was  particularly

active, showing a 94.5 per cent increase, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these increases are achievements of no

ordinary  dimensions  and  the  Minister  and   his

predecessor  certainly deserve  to  be  thanked  by

every  citizen of Singapore. It is perhaps a little

disappointing  to  note that some  of  the  reasons

given  for  the  good  performance  of  Singapore's

economy  this  year  were due to external  factors,

such  as  growth  of  trade  with  Indonesia,   the

expansion  of  exports to South  Vietnam,  and  the

flight  of Hong Kong capital and industrialists  to

Singapore.  While  it  may  he  safe  to  say  that

Indonesian  trade  is relatively  stable  and  will

increase  even  more in the future, the  other  two

avenues  of trade may suddenly conic to an end.  In

this  light,  Sir,  the great  increases  mentioned

earlier  appear  partly to be the  result  of  good

fortune for us following the ill luck of others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my humble observation as a layman that the

Minister has unfortunately not touched upon certain

aspects  of  growth  in our economy  which  can  be

directly  controlled by ourselves. Such aspects  as

encouragement  of  local primary produce  seems  to

have  been  overlooked. I am  not  unaware  of  the

efforts put in by the Primary Production Department

in this respect, but certainly there must be plenty

of  arable  land  for the increased cultivation  of

vegetables  and  the rearing of poultry,  pigs  and

even  cattle. In countries that are short of  land,

efforts  are  made  to  intensify  cultivation  and

improve the breed of livestock. This will not  only

help  us  to  conserve foreign  exchange  but  also

provide  more  employment  opportunities  for   the

farmers  in the rural areas. I therefore hope  that

the  Minister  in his Annual Budget  Statement  for

1968 will be able to add to his formidable list  of

millions, the millions more from eggs, chickens and

pigs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn my attention to

our  industrialisation programme. The Minister,  by

providing  incentives  and all  kinds  of  taxation

benefits, has been able to attract foreign  capital

into  the State to set up new factories in  Jurong.

Throughout the years we have read in the newspapers

or seen on television a Minister either laying the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



foundation  stone  for a new factory  or  making  a

speech  at  an official opening of a factory.  Such

factories have been able to provide some employment

but  only  in  the  region of a  few  thousand  and

certainly have not created enough jobs to cater for

the needs of all school leavers. The setting up  of

these  factories and the creation of new employment

should keep our trade unionists like the Member for

Bras  Basah and the Member for Telok Blangah happy.

But  it is most disappointing to note that the bulk

of the population, i.e., the consumers, have to pay

more  for the goods which they purchase. I  realise

that  in order to protect local industries,  quotas

have  to be placed on imported goods and prices  of

imported  goods have risen. But what  really  takes

the  cake  is the fact that the prices  of  similar

local  products are no cheaper. They are  sometimes

even dearer, though by no means of the same quality

as imported goods. This has a direct bearing on our

cost  of  living  and one begins to wonder  whether

these  new factories are set up to help the  people

of   Singapore   or  to  help  the  industrialists.

Admittedly these new factories contribute  in  some

way  to  lessening  the unemployment  problem,  but

cannot  something be done to keep down our  rapidly

rising  cost of living? While it may be  right  for

the  Government  to provide tax exemptions,  export

incentives  and other protective measures  such  as

quota  restrictions, which result in  increases  in

the  prices of imported goods. I see no reason  why

prices of locally-produced goods should follow  the

prices  of imported goods. To say the least,  their

quality is, in most instances, not even better than

the  imported goods. We have local boxes of matches

which   sometimes   do  not  light   except   after

considerable  application  of  friction,  and  even

cigarettes which result in sore throats and coughs,

much to the benefit of our doctors, even though  we

are  assured  that  the tobacco  is  100  per  cent

Virginia!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker. Sir, I respectfully

urge   the   Hon.   Minister  for  Finance,   while

consolidating  on  his Ministry  millions,  not  to

forget the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



thousands  that are being lost in the  artificially

inflated cost of living.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  a  saying, "Time and tide waits  for  no

man". True enough, the life of Parliament for  this

session  is  coming to its end and with  it,  fresh

elections  would be held next year when the  people

would  vote  for  another group of Parliamentarians

into this House. I do not mean that an entirely new

group will fill the seats in this House. By this, 1

mean  the people, the electorate, will give another

mandate  to  the  Government  to  continue  to   be

responsible for the general welfare and  well-being

of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are gathered in this august Chamber to

debate  the financial policy of the Government  for

the  year 1968 for which its introduction was  made

by  the Finance Minister in his Budget Statement to

this House on the 5th of December this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has termed this

Budget   as  "a  continuation  Budget".   Well,   a

continuation Budget has no painful effects  on  the

people in the sense that there are no new taxes for

the people to bear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy has grown rapidly with the result

that  it will sustain next year's Budget. This  has

been fully explained by the Finance Minister in his

Statement. I propose to leave other aspects in  the

Budget to my colleagues, the Back-Benchers.  On  my

part I propose to deal with several special aspects

pertaining to the financial policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Details of revenue as contained in the

Estimates  of  Revenue  and  Expenditure  of

Singapore for the year 1968 as contained  in

Paper Cmd. 26 of 1967;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The acute problem of unemployment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The tourist trade;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Unemployment caused by the military run-down

of the British bases in the mid-70s;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Industrial growth; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first point, I have gone into the

Main  Estimates in detail and would be grateful  if

the  Minister would enlighten the House  with  more

details. In particular, I refer to the Estimates of

Revenue,  Class I, Code 113-121 under  the  subhead

"Payroll  Tax".  The  estimated  revenue  is  $10.7

million and, according to the previous Minister for

Finance,  such revenue collected would be  utilised

for  the  benefit of the unemployed.  I  think  the

House  would also like to be informed of the  total

amount  of  revenue  in  respect  of  payroll   tax

collected by the Finance Ministry this year and  to

what  good  use has it been made of to  assist  the

unemployed. Also, what schemes would the Government

introduce to assist those unemployed? So far, to my

knowledge, no details have been given regrading the

utilisation of the payroll tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to my second point which is the

unemployment problem. This problem is  not  recent;

in  fact, it has existed for more than a decade. It

became  so acute in the Fifties that in the general

elections of 1959, the P.A.P. romped home  with  an

overwhelming majority of 43 out of the 51 seats  it

contested. Why was this so? Everybody was given  to

understand that the P.A.P. would be able  to  solve

the  major problems then in existence, for  example

housing  and education and political stability.  In

the  fields  of housing, urban renewal, development

in  the rural areas and education, a bouquet to the

Government is well deserved. Everybody agrees  that

great  strides and progress have been made in these

fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unemployment today still poses the most

serious  social problem. The Finance  Minister  has

gone  into  this  problem in great detail.  He  has

traced that - I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in spite of rapid population growth, the

increase  in unemployment has been from  29,600  in

1957 to 52,630 in 1966.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember well that the Minister for Labour, in

reply  to my question on unemployment, stated  that

employment  is  on the increase and the  figure  he

gave to the House then was in the region of 70,000.

He  also  assured this House that the  Ministry  of

Labour  would find ways and means of reducing  this

high figure through the institution of courses like

catering, hotel management, etc. in order to reduce

not  only  this  figure but  also  to  provide  the

necessary avenues to the know-how in such sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The seriousness of the present position must not

be  underestimated, for the present level  of  some

9.7  per  cent of the work force, has not very  far

removed  the  danger level where social  discontent

may provoke instability.'



<br><br>I fully agree with him on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coupled with this, is the "un-employment

created  by  the reduction of British  Forces"  and

this    will   aggravate   the   already    serious

unemployment problem. One then asks,  "How  do  you

propose  to  go  about solving this  problem?"  The

Finance   Minister  states  that  the   answer   is

"industrial  growth" for it remains  our  principal

weapon  to  provide more income and  employment.  I

would  say  that that is quite true,  but  I  would

further ask, "How many unemployed would such growth

be able to take in?". We must bear in mind the ever

increasing  population  of the  unemployed  and  to

quote  the  Minister  again when  he  said  in  his

Statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With the prodigious efforts we put in and the

vast   sums  of  money  and  resources  which   the

Government  had been channelling towards increasing

the  growth of manufacturing industries,  all  that

has  been achieved is a net increase of some  5,000

jobs each year.'



<br><br>He went on further to state:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Clearly this rate of increase is inadequate to

meet our future needs. It has not even absorbed the

increasing  numbers  of young  people  looking  for

jobs.'



<br><br>He further stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To counteract the effects of military reductions and

to reduce the number of unemployed persons, we will have

literally to redouble our present efforts to promote

industrial growth.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed heartening to note that the

Government  is  fully  aware and  understands  this

serious problem. I would say that we must not  only

redouble our efforts but to "retreble" our  present

efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have solved many other social

problems,  I  think we should concentrate  on  this

problem  and  find ways and means of providing  the

unemployed with employment. This remains  the  main

headache of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways of reducing unemployment is the

tourist trade. This is the factor which "will  come

as  a  very  welcome element generating much  local

expenditure  and  providing  a  large   volume   of

employment," so says the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourist industry, to my mind, should be

further developed. It is one aspect that will bring

us  a  lot of benefit and good. In other words,  it

should  be  commercialised as in many countries  in

Europe. To develop this industry, we should bear in

mind  the facilities available. I think the present

facilities are insufficient and in this respect the

Tourist  Promotion Board should come  in  not  only

with the idea of promoting tourism but to find ways

and  means  of  developing tourism. Some  countries

depend largely on the tourist industry and I do not

see why Singapore should not exploit it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tourism, I think there are tremendous

potentialities which remain to be tapped. 'With the

construction  of five first-class hotels  totalling

1,509   rooms,  2,500  persons  will  be  employed.

Another  16  hotels  are under construction  giving

prospective employment to 3,500 people. And for the

next  three years, they will generate an additional

9,000  jobs  directly  in  these  hotels.  That  is

according  to the Finance Minister. He also  states

that "they constitute a very welcome impetus to our

economic  growth." Here one can see the  importance

that  tourism  can have for us if we tap  its  rich

resources. However, Government participation is not

enough   and  those  involved  in  tourism   should

understand  and  exploit  it  not  only  for  their

benefit but also for the benefit of the country  as

a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I come to the problem of unemployment

caused by the run-down of the British Bases in  the

State in the 1970s. How do we go about facing  this

problem?  To find jobs for some 12,000 at the  rate

of  3,400  each  year is another  problem  and  the

Minister has accepted this as our responsibility to

our  citizens affected by this run-down. Since  the

British Government has already made known to us and

to   the   world  in  its  White  Paper   regarding

withdrawal, I hope the Government will get down  to

work  on this immediately, in conjunction with  the

Labour Ministry, and put up a White Paper on it, as

this problem is already affecting the minds of  all

those  employed in the Bases. Their main  question:

"What  steps will our Government take to assist  us

in  our plight that will come within the next  five

years?" I have also in mind to ask the Minister for

Finance  whether he will explain  an  item  in  the

details of Revenue, Class I, Code 160-000, and that

is, Current Transfers from Abroad, where a sum of $

3.675 million under "United Kingdom Mitigatory  Aid

on account of Services Rundown" will be paid. As  I

understand  it,  Sir,  the Government's  policy  on

foreign aid is that we do not want aid freely so as

to  tie  our hands and feet in pursuit  of  a  non-aligned  foreign policy. Therefore, this mitigatory

aid needs to be explained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has pointed out that industrial growth remains our principal weapon to provide more income and employment. I admit that undoubtedly the Government has been vigorous in encouraging industries, but I would like to add that trade is still vital to us and must be further developed. It

may  not be a provider of employment, but certainly

it is an important digit of our economy. Therefore,

I would suggest that trade ties with more countries

be  pursued. I observed that there have  been  many

trade delegations undertaken both by Government and

the   traders  themselves.  I  have  in  mind   the

establishment of more trade agencies. We  can  have

them in our embassies or otherwise. In other words,

we  need  to  build a better sales organisation  in

trade and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



for  our  industrialisation  programme,  i.e.,  the

factories.   I  am  not  saying  that   our   sales

organisation is no good. Far from it. But I  am  of

the  opinion that we should build up a  good  sales

organisation, both local and abroad.  Let  us  say,

for example, a factory may be producing first-class

products,   but   if  it  has   no   proper   sales

organisation, I am afraid the sales would not be up

to  expectations  after all. Hence,  the  need  for

Government to consider this matter, as it is within

their  scope,  and  this of course  will  help  the

industries a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this, Sir, I would like to know

whether previous suggestions for the setting up  of

agencies, like quality control agencies and  credit

agencies by the Government, have been looked  into.

If  they have been looked into, what steps in  this

direction  have  the  Government  taken?  This,   I

believe, would increase the volume of our trade and

also   the  technical  know-how  of  the  developed

countries, especially those in the engineering  and

ship-building fields. I have in mind to suggest  to

the  Minister  for  Finance  that  more  industrial

development scholarships be awarded, for I am  sure

they would be repaid manifold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now, Sir, refer to Defence expenditure as

contained  in  the  Statement.  With  the  ultimate

withdrawal of the British Forces and Bases from the

Republic  by  the mid-70s, we are  faced  with  the

question  of  having to defend ourselves.  We  know

that  we cannot depend on the British to defend  us

after  1975. Hence, the increase in expenditure  on

Defence.  The Minister has made it known that  this

increase, I quote, "in the Estimates is to pay  for

the  implementation of this Plan".  I  take  it  to

mean.  "the  establishment  of  a  total  of  seven

Infantry Battalions which, with supporting arms and

services,  would  provide  the  elements   of   two

Infantry  Brigades." I fully support this in  terms

of   maintaining  our  survival.   I   think   this

expenditure is modest. Most countries in the  world

have armies of their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



and  they even have defence pacts with neighbouring

countries, e.g. N.A.T.O, and S.E.A.T.O. I would ask

whether   we  could  have  defence  alliances,   in

particular,  with the countries in South-east  Asia

so  that  South-east Asia would be a more  peaceful

place.  I  believe  this remark  should  have  been

directed  to the Minister of Defence, but  I  think

the  Minister for Finance, who has been  privileged

to  be the Minister of Defence for two years,  will

comment on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Sir, I think I would be wide

of  the  mark  if  I do not hand a bouquet  to  the

Minister  for  Finance for introducing  a  painless

Budget for next year. He has taken pains to explain

to the House the serious problems lying ahead of us

and what steps have been taken to try to solve such

problems.  In other words, he has been  both  frank

and  honest in his Budget painting which has  given

all  of  us  a clear and good picture of  what  the

situation would be like in the foreseeable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, may I congratulate the Finance

Minister  - though  he is not present  now - for  his

Budget Statement, and I fully support the financial

policy of the Government for 1968.



<br><br>5.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  from the financial statement of the  Minister

for  Finance, we see that over the last  two  years

the independent Republic of Singapore has made much

progress   in  economic  fields.  Our  economy   is

progressing  by leaps and bounds. The Minister  has

not  proposed any new tax increases, and this shows

that  our economy is very sound and stable. I  also

believe  that  it  is  due to the  efforts  of  our

Government and the people as a whole that  we  have

achieved  this  state of the economy.  However,  we

should  not  be complacent. We should redouble  our

efforts  to  seek  greater  means  to  promote  our

economic  development and growth, so as to  further

improve  the standard of living of our  people.  We

should  not be complacent for what we have  already

achieved. Our country is a regenerating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



one.  We  are self-reliant, and we should seek  our

own  economic development ourselves.  We  must  not

depend  on others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop our national economy,

I would like to make some suggestions  to

the  Minister for Finance. First of all, we  should

set  up a Central Bank in our country. Now that  we

have  our own currency, a national Central Bank  is

very  necessary  at  this  juncture.  We  owe   our

livelihood  to  trade which  is  one  of  the  main

sources of sustenance of our country. And in  order

to  place  our commerce and trade on a very  stable

and  firm  grounding, we should have a  very  sound

currency to back it up. At the moment, our currency

is  quite  stable  and sound among  commercial  and

financial circles which have full confidence in it.

So if we do not do what I have suggested, then some

people  may  begin  to lose faith  in  it.  So  our

financial system is still not good enough.  I  feel

that  a  Central  Bank  is  one  of  the  necessary

requirements  of  our  country  for  our   economic

development. It is not enough for a country to have

big  or small financial institutions such as banks.

There  should  be a Central Bank to  organise,  co-ordinate   and   control  the   various   financial

institutions   and  to  direct  and   channel   the

investments of our capital so that the idle capital

of  the  people  can  be  channelled  into  correct

investment  fields and put to better use.  A  sound

economic  system  will  enhance  the  prestige  and

stability  of  our currency. It will boost  up  the

confidence of the people in our currency.  It  will

also  bring prosperity to our commerce and increase

our industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also paid great attention to tourism. There have been quite a number of people coming to our country on holiday. This will increase our economic prosperity. So tourism is an important item in our economy. Many tourists find difficulty in getting hotel

accommodation when they come here, as mentioned  by

the  Minister for Finance. A few months before they

come   to   Singapore,  they  should   book   hotel

accommodation in advance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



Why   should  we  not  try  to  encourage  economic

development in this field? We should make more  use

of  our  limited space to build hotels  vertically.

Hotels  can be constructed skywards. There will  be

many   storeys   and  rooms  to  accommodate   more

tourists.   This   will  create   more   employment

opportunities.  We  know that  the  Government,  in

promoting  and encouraging industrial  development,

has given a lot of incentives, for example, a five-year  tax exemption period. I feel that if we  want

to  encourage the development of tourism, we should

also formulate certain programmes to encourage  the

tourist  promoters  and  people  in  this  line  of

business  to  develop tourism. A  large  hotel  may

employ  more than 1,000 persons. The tourists  will

be  attracted by the warm reception given to  them.

Tourism is a labour intensive field of industry. We

must  give  concessions to the tourist trade  which

will  also earn for us foreign exchange which  will

in turn help our economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should also not overlook the

industrial sites in Jurong, Redhill, Tanglin  Halt,

Kallang  Basin, Kampong Ampat, etc.  These  estates

have  all  had surprising development and have  won

the  praise of many trade delegations from  various

countries. These industrial estates have left  them

with  a  very  deep  impression of  our  industrial

development.  Our  main  aim  is  to  resolve   our

unemployment  problem and to seek  a  new  line  of

living for our future generation. This aim is  very

proper   and   necessary  but  there  are   certain

industrialists and manufacturers who have made  use

of the incentives given by the Economic Development

Board  to fish in troubled waters. They have raised

the  prices of local products and this has  led  to

more  people  being unemployed. This has  caused  a

great  loss to the Government in respect of revenue

and taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to elaborate further. These

manufacturers have put in their capital to  set  up

factories.  They have received from the  Government

concessions and incentives, such as a five years'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



tax  free  holiday.  The  Government  has,  in  the

interest  of  local  manufacturers,  levied  double

taxation  by way of tariff against imported  goods.

The  Government has also set up a committee to look

after the local products. Also the machinery to  be

used  by the factories will be exempted from import

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government is also encouraging

Government departments and statutory boards and all

people  to  buy our locally-manufactured goods  and

exempt  almost all raw materials from import  duty.

But  after these manufacturers have produced  their

goods,  they not only cannot compete with  imported

goods  in  quality but also in price. Their  prices

are  many  times  more than those of  the  imported

goods. Take, for instance, matches. Before we  have

any  factory manufacturing matches, we could buy  a

packet  of matches for 20 to 30 cents. Every packet

contains  10  boxes of 80 to 90 sticks of  matches.

But  the  Government, in order to  implement  their

taxation  policy  on  imported matches,  and  after

there  are  local manufactures, has levied  $96  on

every  carton of matches imported. Because of these

high  tariff duties, the local people have  stopped

buying  imported matches. But the price of locally-produced  matches has increased  to  45  cents  per

packet.  So this is much dearer than the  price  of

the  imported matches. The quality of our  locally-manufactured  matches is also inferior.  Every  box

contains  only  about 50 sticks. And because  there

are  no  imported matches to compete with  locally-manufactured matches, the consumers suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example, white sugar. The situation

is the same. Since a sugar refinery factory was set

up  in  Singapore, the Government has levied tariff

duties  on  imported sugar amounting to four  cents

per pound. Sugar imported from Taiwan and elsewhere

has  disappeared  from the market. Locally-produced

sugar has replaced it. But regrettably the locally-produced sugar costs 41 cents per katty. Raw  sugar

has to be bought from abroad and the people have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



to  pay more for this and so the cost of living has

gone up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also levied tariff duties on

other  imported goods so that importers have  found

it  difficult to import foreign goods and  to  sell

them  on  the  market locally.  Thus  our  workers,

hawkers,  lorry  drivers, porters, lighter-men  and

other  people  are  adversely affected  because  of

price  increases in many consumer goods. The number

of  jobs  created by these manufacturing  companies

and  newly-established  industries  cannot  compare

with the adverse effects of the increased prices of

locally-made  goods on the population.  On  top  of

this,   our  locally-manufactured  goods  sometimes

cannot find a market locally. As a result, some  of

the   factories  will  have  to  close  down.   The

Government  will  also lose a lot of  revenue  from

this  source.  In the end only a few  manufacturers

will  benefit  from  the  Government  policy.  Such

manufacturers not only enjoy a period of  exemption

from tax, but also other benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just said that we cannot deny that

industrialisation has made some progress.  But,  on

the  other  hand, we must not disappoint our  local

manufacturers.  The point that needs  consideration

is   how  to  guide  them  towards  the  industrial

objectives we have in mind and to adopt the correct

and  proper  measures to go about it. The  Minister

has  mentioned the National Steel Industry and  the

Jurong  Shipyard. These two institutions  have,  on

the  one  hand, tried to lower their prices locally

and  tried to better the quality of their  products

in  order to compete in the international market so

that our people will benefit as a result. These two

institutions are good examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those speculative so-called

industrialists,  we should set up  a  committee  to

investigate  them. We should reconsider  the  quota

system  and the tariffs against imported goods  and

matters  relating thereto in order to  lighten  the

burden  of  the  people and to increase  Government

revenue in order to safeguard the interest  of  our

country  and the people. Sir, I support the  motion

by the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Minister  for  Finance  has

introduced a new Budget in this House. This can  be

said  to be a product of the stormy season we  have

experienced.  With the devaluation of Sterling  and

the  withdrawal of the British Military Forces from

Singapore,  the  fact that we  are  still  able  to

produce such a Budget without any tax increases  is

really  a meritorious achievement. As an economist,

our  Minister for Finance has not achieved this  by

magic.  On the other hand, he has given us a  clear

picture of the economic position. The Supplementary

Budget for this year has exceeded $10 million,  but

next year's surplus will be $30 million. If we have

to  have  another  Supplementary Estimate  for  $10

million,  then we will lose some $700,000.  I  hope

the  Minister for Finance will not juggle too  much

in  this budgeting business, as it appears to  some

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our aim in the economic field is mainly to

resolve  our  unemployment problem.  When  we  talk

about  the  financial  policy  introduced  by   the

Minister for Finance, we should measure its  merits

in  relation to the unemployment problem.  We  know

that  in the past, our efforts in industrialisation

have  resulted in the provision of 5,000  new  jobs

every  year. But every year in Singapore there  are

25,000  school  leavers who  will  be  joining  the

labour  market. So by comparison, the  solution  of

the unemployment problem is still unresolved and we

are  under heavy pressure to resolve it. I hope the

Minister  for  Finance  can  explain  whether   the

continuation  of our industrialisation  policy  for

the  next  few  years will create  enough  jobs  to

resolve  the unemployment problem. If  there  is  a

saturation point in employment opportunities,  then

I  hope  there will be a clear-cut announcement  on

our policy in solving this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the basic policy of industrialisation, we

should  try  to diversify our economy in  order  to

cope with the situation. From the Minister's Budget

Statement,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



we can see that in 1957 the people engaged in

agriculture  and fisheries numbered 31,500  people.

By  1959, the figure was reduced to 22,800. In  the

period of a few years, the number has decreased  by

9,000.  Every  year there has been  a  decrease  of

1,000.  So  this figure is one-fifth of  the  5,000

jobs that we can create every year. This shows that

our  industries at the moment are not able to  play

the   role   that  is  expected  of   them,   i.e.,

industrialisation  replacing  all  other   economic

activities    to    provide   enough    employment.

Industrialisation  has  been  progressing  but  the

activities  of the fishing industry and agriculture

have  decreased  in  intensity. If  this  situation

persists or even worsens, then there is much  cause

for  anxiety about the future. We fear that certain

events  that  have taken place in  some  developing

countries may happen in our country. The unemployed

in  the rural areas will rush to the urban area. If

such an event takes place in our country, then  the

achievement    we    have   so    far    made    in

industrialisation    may    be    minimised.    Our

industrialisation programme may,  instead,  provide

opportunities  for a change of occupation  to  some

people  who are looking for jobs. That is  not  the

fundamental way of solving the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is undergoing rapid changes during

which  some  kinds  of  economic  activities   have

experienced  certain distractions  in  one  way  or

another.  When  we  develop  housing  estates   and

promote urban renewal projects, when we change  the

living  environment of the people, we have  not  at

the same time changed their economic livelihood and

surroundings.  For instance, when  farmers  in  the

rural  areas  were shifted from their farms,  their

economic  livelihood  was  not  changed.  In  other

words, they were moved to a new environment as fish

out  of  the water in such a situation. This  is  a

problem we should look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Minister's statement, I notice that he

wants to promote exports in foreign markets. But he

has  not  enumerated  with any  certainty  the  new

measures  to  be taken in the present situation  of

Sterling devaluation. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



currency has not been devalued. This may be a  good

sign  and  is  encouraging. On  the  one  hand,  we

encourage industrialisation and promote exports. On

the other hand, we have been receiving more foreign

investments,  especially  from  Hong   Kong.   Much

capital  has been flowing into Singapore from  Hong

Kong.  According  to  a British Under-Secretary  of

State,  certain Commonwealth countries also  intend

to  invest in Singapore and Malaysia. This  can  be

said   to   be   a  great  encouragement   to   our

industrialisation programme, especially as it  will

be   adding   to   our  admirable   atmosphere   of

production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also pay attention to foreign markets.

If  we  can  have better organised export promotion

offices abroad, then our locally-manufactured goods

will  have a better future. But there are no clear-cut  proposals in the Minister's statement in  this

connection. Perhaps we can avail ourselves of  this

opportunity  to  ask  him to  try  to  explore  the

prospects  of a common market when it is convenient

for  him to do so or whenever an opportunity  comes

to    him.    We   can   start   with,    say,    a

Singapore/Malaysia  common  market  or  a  regional

market.  We  know  that  our  internal  market   is

limited, and especially in this age of regional and

common market agreements, it is very necessary that

we  should  take  measures to  establish  a  common

market.  Of  course,  we  must  not  expect  to  be

disappointed like Britain in her desire to join the

European Common Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention, in particular, that from

the  statistics we have come across,  we  see  that

there  are  thousands of unemployed  people.  These

statistics  can be classified into two  categories.

One  category is from the Sample Household  Survey.

The   other  category  is  derived  from   national

registration.  These statistics  vary  to  a  great

extent. So the Minister, as an economic expert, has

chosen  one of the two to be the more reliable  one

to base his source of information. But personally I

feel   that  these  statistics  are  not   entirely

reliable because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



there  are workers who, even when  they  are

employed,  report  that they  are  unemployed.  The

number  of  unemployed persons  registered  at  the

Labour   Exchange  may  not  reflect   the   actual

unemployment situation because certain  people  who

are  in receipt of public assistance want to  claim

that  they  are  out  of  job.  So  they  will   be

classified  as unemployed. Pirate taxi drivers  may

also say that they are unemployed so that they will

have  room for manoeuvre in order to get a  licence

or  a  permit  for  their  taxis.  There  are  also

numerous  such cases. Some people like to  disclaim

that  they are employed for various reasons. Others

who  want to get new jobs go to the Labour Exchange

and say that they are unemployed. So the statistics

that  are  available  at  the  moment  may  not  be

completely reliable. We hope that the Minister will

carry out a comprehensive survey so that we can  be

told  with  certainty the actual number of  persons

unemployed. We will then be able to ascertain  that

there are not so many people unemployed. But if the

unemployment  figure includes some people  who  are

actually  employed, it will give  us  a  false  and

alarming  picture.  This may have  a  psychological

effect on our people. I hope the Minister will look

into this.



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Budget for 1968 has once  again  brought

great  relief to the people of Singapore  as  there

will  be no increase of taxes or new taxation.  The

Minister  for  Finance has been able to  frame  the

Estimates  of Expenditure for next year within  the

expected  yield of the existing taxes.  Compliments

must  be given to our Minister for Finance for such

a realistic and well-balanced Budget for the coming

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement in Parliament on 5th

December, the Minister for Finance dwelt at  length

on the economic growth of the Republic and compared

the achievements this year with the achievements in

1966.  He attributed this steady growth of  economy

to three main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



reasons,   namely,  the  growth   of   trade   with

Indonesia,  the  increase  of  exports   to   South

Vietnam,  and  the  increased  flow  of  Hong  Kong

investments into the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will be a stumbling block to our

sturdy growth of economy by the mid-seventies  when

Britain is expected to run down her military  bases

in Singapore. The new problems that will arise will

be  the  retrenchment of about  32,000  people  now

working in these bases and the consequent reduction

of   local  expenditure.  Undoubtedly,  these  will

adversely   affect  our  economy.  The  people   of

Singapore,  I  am  sure,  are  confident  that  our

Government will be able to solve these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is already the sixth year

since  Singapore  embarked on the industrialisation

of our local economy. There has been generally good

progress  in  our industrialisation  programme.  In

1966,  there  was a total of 165 pioneer  firms  of

which  111 were in production. The total number  of

persons  employed by these pioneer firms is  11,000

which  can rise to 19,000 when these pioneer  firms

are in full production in two or three years' time.

The  annual census of manufactures gives the  total

number  of  persons  engaged in  the  manufacturing

industries  for  the  year  1966  as  52,000.   The

difference of 41,000 is, therefore, the  number  of

workers   engaged   in   non-pioneer   firms    and

established  enterprises.  This  figure  does   not

include, according to the Minister for Finance, the

small backyard enterprises which account for a very

substantial   number   of   persons   working    in

manufacturing  industries. It  is  evidently  clear

that   the  non-pioneer  firms  as  well   as   the

established enterprises are still the main provider

of    employment   in   Singapore.   The   backyard

enterprises  or  small  industries  must  run  into

several thousands in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small industries, in fact, are the pioneers

of  all  pioneers in our industries. Some of  these

small  industries are well-established and of  long

standing.   They   are  being  neglected   by   the

Government and very little assistance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



whether  financial or technical, is given to  them.

The Economic Development Board has in the past made

no  effort  to  encourage the small  industries  in

Singapore  to expand their establishments.  It  was

not  until 1964 that the Light Industries  Services

was  set  up within the Economic Development  Board

and  efforts  were then made in this respect.  Even

with  the  establishment of  the  Light  Industries

Services,  these small industries are not  deriving

much  benefit  except  in  the  form  of  technical

advice.  For  instance,  I  know  of  a  few  small

manufacturers  who  wish to  apply  for  industrial

sites  or factories in the Kallang Basin Industrial

Estate to meet their expansion needs; they are  not

given  the  sites. Instead, the factory  sites  are

often   given  to  the  pioneer  firms  or  foreign

investors. The Minister for Finance confirmed  this

when he said in his Budget Statement that there was

a  crash programme to build more factories to  meet

the requirements of Hong Kong industrialists as all

available factories have been taken up by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 or 1961, the Economic Development Board

sent   out  sets  of  application  forms  to  local

manufacturers   inviting  them  to   submit   their

requirements for industrial sites and also to  make

known  their  expansion needs. I believe  this  was

meant  only to conduct a survey of potential  local

industries. As far as I know, nothing concrete  has

turned  out  from  these  applications.  In   fact,

industrial  sites  are mostly  offered  to  pioneer

firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that the Minister for

Finance  should  request the  Economic  Development

Board  to  look into the needs of the  local  small

industries  and  to  assist  them  to  expand   and

modernise   their   establishments.   These   small

industries  require  as  much  attention  from  the

Government as the pioneer firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

drawn  our  attention to the decline in  activities

relating to agriculture and fishing. In 1966,  only

22,800 persons were engaged in these activities  as

against 40,200 in 1957. The reasons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



for  the  decline are the smaller scale of  fishing

and  more  land used for industrial and residential

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the development of the fishing

industry,  it  is now gratifying  to  note  that  a

Fisheries  Training Centre is now being established

to  carry  out  research into the  potentiality  of

marine  production and modem technique in  fishing.

This  will  help considerably in deep-sea  fishing.

There have been many efforts in the past to develop

deep-sea fishing but without success. Now that  the

Government   has  offered  export  incentives   and

training facilities, there is bright hope in future

for  deep-sea fishing to thrive. In fact, Singapore

can  be  a good home-base for the fleets of fishing

trawlers  operating  in  the  Indian  and   Pacific

Oceans.  There are also ample ice plants with  cold

storage facilities to store catches of tunas  while

awaiting  transhipment  to foreign  countries.  The

tunas  which are in abundant supply in these oceans

are  in  popular demand in the U.S.A. and  European

countries.  From  deep-sea  fishing,  we  can  also

develop   marine-product   canning   and   fishmeal

industries.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  our  kelongs  and

obsolete  methods of fishing must give way  to  new

and  modern techniques in fishing. This again  will

provide employment for those who wish to engage  in

fishing activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are embarking on

industrialisation, we should not neglect our  crop-growing  agriculture  and  horticulture.  Today  in

advanced  countries like Japan and  Britain,  every

inch  of  land  is fully utilised for  crop-growing

apart  from  its  use  for  industrial  and  social

development. In the Development Estimates for 1968,

very  little provision is made for agriculture  and

horticulture.  Hitherto,  the  Primary   Production

Department  has  been concentrating  on  live-stock

rearing known as animal husbandry and has neglected

to  encourage  market  gardening  or  crop-growing.

Though  Singapore has no agricultural base, we  can

still  have substantial primary incomes from  crop-growing. At present, the vegetable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



gardeners, fruit- and flower-growers must run  into

thousands of families in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot the husbandry and method of cultivation of

horticultural  crop  or  non-plantation   crop   be

improved   by   better  techniques?   The   Primary

Production  Department or the Economic  Development

Board should seriously look into this and embark on

a programme of improving the methods of packing and

marketing of fruits and vegetables. I can quote two

such  crops which, once commercialised, can  derive

substantial  income. One is tobacco  which  can  be

easily grown on small plots and subsequently  cured

and packed for sale. Another is the orchid industry

which,  if  commercialised, can  become  a  dollar-earning  industry for export trade. Other  examples

like  rambutans, chiku and durians, which are grown

freely  in  our  tropical  climate,  can  also   be

commercialised  and introduced overseas  by  highly

technical methods and deep-freezing. Surely,  these

are   sources  of  primary  income  which  can   be

developed  by  commercialising and  industrialising

through modern techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my fervent hope that the Minister for

Finance   will  take  steps  to  ask  the   Primary

Production  Department or the Economic  Development

Board   to   make   a  full  study  of   developing

agriculture, so that more primary products  can  be

exported  to  bring in more income to  enhance  the

standard of living of our farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1968.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think the Budget presented by the Minister

for  Finance to this House on the 5th of this month

can be characterised in the Minister's own words as ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a normal continuation Budget with no major

innovations   or  changes  both  in  the   Ordinary

Estimates and the Development Estimates'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



That  being so, there will be little to say on  the

Budget  except to congratulate the Minister on  his

frank   and  detailed  analysis  of  the   economic

situation facing Singapore in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sombre situation created by the run-down of the British bases in Singapore. This grave

economic   situation  is  fully   appreciated   and

squarely  faced  by the Government  and  plans  are

afoot to contain it if not to overcome it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comforting to note that the present Finance

Minister  is the very person who, as the  architect

of our industrialisation programme, was the master-mind  responsible for turning Jurong from  a  swamp

into the modern industrial estate that it is today.

The run-down of the British bases has presented  us

with  three problems - one, the aggravation  of  our

unemployment   problem  by  the   retrenchment   of

personnel at present employed at the British bases;

two, the reduction of spending in Singapore leading

to   a  possible  decline  in  our  gross  national

product;  three, an increase in defence expenditure

made necessary by the British military withdrawal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last problem, that is, our increased defence

expenditure, is the least of all the three problems

because  it was anticipated when the defence  plans

of  the  Republic were first framed some two  years

ago;  and  we  must  once  again  congratulate  the

Finance  Minister, who as the then Defence Minister

was  responsible  for the framing  of  the  defence

plans, on this masterpiece of anticipation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Finance Minister, the total

local  expenditure of the British  military  forces

amounted  to no less than 14 per cent of our  gross

domestic  expenditure  in  1966,  and  the  reduced

spending  would mean an accumulative  reduction  of

some two per cent of our gross domestic expenditure

in  each  year. However, this does not  present  an

insurmountable  problem if  we  remember  that  our

gross  national product grows at the rate  of  some

six  per cent per annum. It would, therefore,  only

mean  that  our  gross national  product  will  not

increase at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



rate that it was wont to do. Rather, it will be  at

a   slower  rate  provided,  of  course,  that  the

reduction  in  spending is not too sudden  that  it

could  not  be absorbed by the growth of our  gross

national product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far the gravest problem that confronts us is

the  aggravation of the unemployment problem caused

by  the  British military withdrawal.  The  Finance

Minister has spent considerable time in his  Budget

speech  on this problem. It is an enormous  problem

and I need only pose it in another way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the present figures of unemployment were to be

maintained and not increased, at least 30,000  jobs

must  be created each year. If the figures were  to

be  reduced to 3 per cent of the working population

by 1971 - and the figure of 3 per cent, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  considered by economists to be  the  best

figure  at which to keep unemployment - some  40,000

jobs  a  year will have to be created. A  realistic

plan  has been proposed by the Finance Minister  to

solve this problem, and details have been given  to

this  House.  The  magnitude of  this  problem  was

clearly  and frankly stated. Perhaps we could  only

hope  to  contain it. And if that is to be done  at

all,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am sure  our  Government

will be able to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on three matters which arose

during  last year's Budget debate, but about  which

the  Government  appears to have taken  no  action.

These  are (1) export insurance, (2) rent  control,

and  (3) unemployment insurance. During last year's

debate  on  the  Budget,  I  echoed  a  very   good

suggestion  from the hon. Member for  Punggol,  who

first  proposed  the creation of  an  export-credit

guarantee  agency.  I  would once  again  urge  the

Minister  to  give  serious consideration  to  this

suggestion.  In  this  year's  Budget  speech,  the

Minister for Finance referred to the creation of, I

quote [col. 459]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'an international trading agency of some kind

which  will relieve the manufacturers in  Singapore

of  many of the problems connected with the  export

of their products to overseas markets.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



The  Finance  Minister went on  to  say  that  this

problem was receiving very close attention  in  his

Ministry but that he would say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'no more than that the implementation of this

policy may well result in far-reaching arrangements

in  the  structure and pattern of our international

trade today.'



<br><br>I  am  not too sure that this international trading

agency  will  embrace  the export-credit  guarantee

agency.  I  spoke about it last year,  but  as  the

Finance  Minister  has been deliberately  vague  in

this  matter,  I can only hope that  he  will  take

account  of what I say here and seriously  consider

the   establishment  of  some  sort  of  an  export

insurance scheme which, in my opinion, would be  of

great help in our search for export markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Budget debate, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have also suggested that the Government should take

a  look  at the present legislation regarding  rent

control.   It  is  my  opinion  that  the   present

legislation   on  rent  control  is  impeding   the

development    of   building   and    construction,

especially  of commercial buildings. In his  reply,

the   then  Minister  for  Finance  said  that  the

Government would look into the matter. May I  quote

from  Hansard that part of the Minister's reply  on

this  subject? This is Hansard, Volume 25,  No.  9,

column 673, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...we are thinking along the lines of setting up

a   tribunal  in  order  to  be  able   to   settle

compensation  payable for removal  for  development

purposes.'



<br><br>I  would  like  to  know from the Finance  Minister

whether  this matter has now got past the  thinking

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of unemployment insurance, Mr

Speaker, Sir, this matter was first raised in  last

year's  Budget debate by the hon. Member for  Telok

Blangah.  In  his reply, the then Finance  Minister

said,  and  I  quote once again -this is  the  same

issue of Hansard, col. 674:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Serangoon - is it Serangoon? - Telok Blangah, yes. Mr Speaker, he proposed that

we  should look after the unemployed by bringing in

a national unemployment insurance scheme. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



can assure him that we are trying to get an actuary

to   work  out  unemployment  insurance  for   this

country,  and  so far we have not been  successful.

But  I  hope during the course of next year  to  be

able  to put up a scheme for consideration  by  the

Cabinet and by this House.'



<br><br>Perhaps  the Minister for Finance can tell us  when

such a scheme can be established. Such a scheme  is

important. The Finance Minister realised the  grave

social  implications of a man who has a  family  to

support  being  out of work, when he  said  (and  I

quote  again - this is in the present Budget  speech

at col. 450):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While we can expect teenagers to spend another

year  or  two  living with their  families  without

experiencing  undue hardship, the  older  ones  who

have  lost their jobs and are trying to get another

create  both  an economic and a social  problem  of

some importance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be asked: where will the money come

from? The Finance Minister, of course, is the  best

person to answer this question. Perhaps it could be

by   voluntary  contributions  from  the   workers.

Instead of paying 5 per cent of the salary  to  the

C.P.F.,  perhaps  a  worker  may  be  persuaded  to

increase  his  contribution  to  10  per  cent.  Or

perhaps  the money could be raised from  additional

taxation,  for example, on hard liquor. I  am  sure

nobody would complain about additional taxation  on

liquor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget speech of last year, the then

Finance  Minister promised to bring in  legislation

to control finance companies. It has taken one full

year  for  this  to materialise,  and  the  Finance

Companies   Bill  is  now  before  the  House   for

consideration on the 21st of this month. I  do  not

wish  to say anything on it at this moment.  But  I

had  assumed that the control of finance  companies

would  also  mean the introduction  of  legislation

regulating hire purchase transactions which are, in

fact,  part  of the business of finance  companies.

Unfortunately  this has not been done  and  we  are

still  left with the existing law on hire purchase.

As  you  are  well  aware, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

existing  law is complicated and uncertain,  and  I

think it is high time the Government brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



in  legislation  to  regulate hire  purchase  which

affects the lives of so many of our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Estimates for next year, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note that out of a total

of  $646.4 million Ordinary Expenditure,  about  45

per  cent  will be spent on social services.  These

are  for Education, Health, and such like services.

This  is  as  it should be. A socialist  government

like the P.A.P., pledged to create a more just  and

more   equal  society,  must  spend  more  of   the

expenditure  on social services. As a socialist,  I

would,  of  course, like to see  more  money  being

spent  in  social  development,  but  we  must   be

realistic  and  take account of the grave  economic

situation  facing us. I for one, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

am  thankful for the $39 million to be spent on the

development of social services in the coming year.



<br><br>6.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Finance  Minister,  in  presenting   the

financial  policy of the Government to this  House,

could   be  regarded  as  presenting  the  election

manifesto  to the people of Singapore. Compared  to

the  financial position of the State in 1959 before

the  Finance Minister first presented the financial

policy for 1960, which was then in a most unhealthy

position  - one  would say a gloomy  position  where

certain  economic measures had to  be  taken  which

were quite painful to some people - the position now

looks not only very healthy and encouraging, but we

have  as  at  1st  January, 1967, assets  totalling

over $628 million, which is twice as much as what we

had in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, I need not mention the

assets of the other statutory boards - the Singapore

Housing   and  Development  Board,  the   Singapore

Telephone Board, the Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has given a very clear

picture of our future in presenting the Budget  for

1968, the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



of  unemployment,  the necessity  to  create  jobs,

firstly,  because of our young population  that  is

going into the employment market, and, secondly, as

a  result of the run-down of the British Bases  and

the  reduced  spending arising out of this.  It  is

encouraging  to note that the Finance Minister  has

recognised  the tourist industry as an  alternative

measure to offset the effects of the rundown of the

British Bases. The tourist industry - or to be  able

to  understand the tourist industry, I think it  is

important  to  know  that "tourists"  are  normally

associated  with  American tourists,  and  American

tourists  plan their tours at least a  year  ahead.

One  of  the basic facilities which will  encourage

tourism     is    adequate    first-class     hotel

accommodation.  In  this  respect,   although   the

Minister  has  sounded an optimistic  note  in  his

Budget Statement of five new hotels coming up which

will  give an additional 566 rooms, another 16  new

hotels  giving  another 2,089 rooms,  with  another

nine more under consideration having 1,240 rooms, I

would say these are inadequate to meet the needs if

we  are to stimulate tourism. With the exception of

a   few  of  these  21  projects,  they  cannot  be

considered  as first-class luxury hotels.  What  we

need  in Singapore are hotels with the capacity  of

between 500 and 1,000 rooms, and this would involve

large  capital investment, and no one would  invest

in  these  large  concerns unless  more  attractive

incentives  are considered by the Government.  This

is  proved  by  the  fact that  the  "Golden  Mile"

projects have not brought in any firm investors. As

I  understand the approach to these projects  would

have to be by Beach Road, as it cannot possibly  be

through  Nicoll Highway because of the vast  amount

of  traffic  there, and as the Planning  Department

cannot give an assurance that the old houses  along

Beach  Road  would give way, I think  most  of  the

investors  are  not  so keen in bidding  for  these

projects. I would request the Minister for  Finance

to  consider  again the question of incentives  for

first-class luxury hotels as this would not only be

needed by tourists but there is a need in Singapore

whenever large conventions are held.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also quite rightly mentioned the manufacturing industry which is labour intensive. In this respect, I would also like to ask him not to forget the establishment of engineering servicing which is very labour intensive. We have the Keppel Dockyard and the

Jurong  shipyard.  There is a  proposal  about  the

Naval  Base  Dockyard when it reverts back  to  the

Singapore Government. I would also ask the Minister

if  he could seriously look into the possibility of

an  aircraft engineering maintenance service  which

is  very successful in Hong Kong and which  we  can

establish  very successfully in Singapore  too.  At

the   present   moment,  maintenance  of   aircraft

servicing is being done by foreign airlines and  is

earning  them very good revenue. This  is  paid  to

their  Head Offices, on which I believe  no  income

tax  is  derived by the Singapore Government.  When

the British withdraw from Seletar, I think it would

be  ideal  to  look  into the possibility  of  such

services.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.08 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a constant need of

increasing the revenue of our State for social  and

development purposes. Either we raise taxes  or  we

increase our economic growth. To raise taxes  would

be  painful,  but the better form  of  raising  our

revenue would be through economic growth. One point

which I would like to point out to the Minister for

Finance  is  that there are still large numbers  of

people occupying State land for which they pay very

uneconomic rent. The occupiers commercialise on the

occupation  of  this land and make easy  money  for

themselves.   Since  revenue  is  needed   by   the

Government,  I  suggest that  the  Ministry  should

consider reverting this land back to the State  for

more  economic purposes. This will be  a  means  of

raising  further revenue for our State.  With  this

note, I support the financial policy which has been

presented to this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir, from all accounts of what hon. Members in this

House have been saying and from what the newspapers

have  been writing, this has been a popular budget.

Under  the shower of congratulations which  it  has

been  my  embarrassment to receive,  I  would  have

liked   to   think  that  the  pleasure   over   my

performance  was  the  result  of  a  logical   and

penetrating analysis of our problems and the clear-cut  recommendations  for their  solutions,  but  I

suspect that that is not the real reason. The  real

reason why people are happy is that there has  been

no  increase in taxes. In a long career as  Finance

Minister,  I have come to the conclusion  that  (a)

people  do  not  like to pay taxes,  and  (b)  they

dislike  paying  increased taxes  even  more.  Sir,

while this attitude is understandable and, in fact,

one  can sympathise with it on occasions in a  non-professional  capacity, I must  confess  that  this

kind  of  thinking is illogical. I do  not  pretend

that  I  can  convince all hon. Members or  convert

them  to  my point of view. But I will do my  best.

People  do  not mind spending more money on  motor-cycles, scooters or cars or presents for their girl

friends, this, that or the other. They do not  mind

this because they get something in return. And  yet

they  object  to paying more taxes. When  they  pay

more taxes, they are merely spending more. It is  a

collective   expenditure  on  services   that   are

provided  by  the Government - more education,  more

health  services, more defence measures, more  post

offices, this, that and the other. While it may  be

true that the best things in life are free, in  the

practical affairs of men they have to be paid  for.

And  when  people pay more taxes, it does not  mean

that the taxes go into my pocket or the pockets  of

my colleagues. They are spent on providing more and

better services to the public. So this aversion  to

paying   more  taxes,  one  hopes,  will  gradually

diminish   as   rationality   in   human   thinking

increases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to the points raised by hon. Members.

First,  I  think  I have to clarify  the  statement

which  I  made in my Budget Speech. The  result  of

great effort in promoting industry in Singapore has

been 5,000 additional new jobs. That is what I have

said   in   my  Budget  Speech.  This,  of  course,

depressed many hon. Members. The Members for  Bukit

Merah,   Thomson,   Sembawang   and   Punggol,   in

particular, said that only 5,000 additional jobs is

not good enough. It would not help us. Where are we

going?  Now,  what  I  should have  said  is  this.

Members  should bear in mind that these  are  5,000

new jobs only in the modern sector of industry, the

bigger firms. There are more jobs generated in  the

smaller sector of industry which has to support the

operations  of  the bigger firms. And,  of  course,

there are jobs generated in the service industries,

in  buses,  in consumer goods and retail shops,  in

cinemas  and so on, where these 5,000 people  spend

their  money. So, in fact, when you get  5,000  new

jobs  in  the larger industries, you might end:  up

with  a  total of 15,000 jobs perhaps when all  the

repercussions of their expenditure are worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because so many Members were depressed with the

prospects  of creating more jobs in industry,  they

thought   that   agriculture  might   provide   the

solution.  This is the point of view taken  by  the

Members for Changi, Sembawang, Thomson, Bukit Merah

and  Anson.  I  find it is rather odd  because  the

whole history of the last ten years has shown  that

agriculture,  far  from increasing,  had  been  the

diminishing sector of the economy. In the last  ten

years there has been a reduction of something  like

10,000  workers in agriculture. So I  am  afraid  I

find  it difficult to be convinced that there is  a

great  future in agriculture so far as the creation

of new jobs is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with the Member for Mountbatten

that  there are good prospects in deep-sea fishing.

In fact, in the last few years there has been quite

a  considerable expansion in the fishing  fleet  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards horticulture, i.e., the planting of

fruit  trees, I think that occupies a lot of space.

I do not know whether it is economic to justify it.

The  growing of orchids, of course, is a very  good

industry to expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have touched on tourism.

Unfortunately,    there   seems    to    be    some

misunderstanding on this subject.  The  Member  for

Changi,  for  instance, said that  building  hotels

does not attract tourists. That is absolutely true.

The  mere fact that you build hotels does not  mean

that people will go there and occupy them. In fact,

in  Singapore  what  has happened  is  that  it  is

because  so  many  tourists are  coming  here  that

hotels  are being built. So the idea is not  merely

to create jobs. People do not put $5 million into a

new  hotel just to give jobs to unemployed  people.

They  put  up  that  amount of money  to  make  big

profits,  and profits will be forthcoming  only  if

the  tourists  turn  up. And for  various  reasons,

tourists   have   been  coming  to   Singapore   in

increasing  numbers. No one really knows  why  they

come here. The Tourist Promotion Board has given no

convincing reasons. If I am asked why are  tourists

coming  here, I would say it is for the same reason

that some people climb Mount Everest - because it is

there.  I  cannot think of any better reasons.  But

let  us not look a gift horse in the mouth, as  the

saying goes. Let us give the tourists a jolly  good

time  and  hope  that they will come in  increasing

numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley had the wrong notion

on  this subject. He said that we did not get  good

tenders  for  the  "Golden Mile"  projects  because

people  were not sure where the coastline would  be

along Beach Road. As my colleague, the Minister for

Law and National Development, had explained to this

House,  the reason why there were no good bids  for

the  "Golden Mile" projects was that they are  very

large investments. People did not have the time  to

form consortiums to bid. In other words, there just

was not enough money for that. And my colleague  is

taking action to form or encourage the formation of

consortiums.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members have drawn attention to a very vital

part  of  our future effort if we are to  meet  the

challenges  ahead, and that is the need for  thrift

and the need to mobilise domestic savings. This was

the  point  made by the Members for  Sembawang  and

Delta. I will underline what they say. I have taken

note of the suggestion by the Member for Delta that

we  should find some means of absorbing the savings

of  the small man and channel them into useful  and

productive lines. I think it will be possible to do

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has made a number of

points. He has referred to past statements made  by

me  and  my  predecessor about considering  certain

measures. He wants to know what is being  done.  He

has mentioned four items, namely, export insurance,

rent  control,  unemployment  insurance,  and  hire

purchase legislation in relation to the control  of

finance  companies. May I deal with these  subjects

in  turn  as  they  are of some importance?  Export

insurance was brought up by an hon. Member in  this

House. I cannot recollect who.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Telok Blangah.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, the Member for Telok

Blangah.   No   one,  of  course,  has   given   any

undertaking that we will introduce legislation  for

export insurance. There has been thinking and  some

research on this subject in the Ministry.  We  have

studied  what  other countries  are  doing  and  we

probably will continue to study for some time. I am

not sure that we can take the scheme as it is being

worked  out in England or in Germany or in  Holland

and  apply  it here. The reason is that  I  want  a

fairly  safe system whereby the Singapore  exporter

and  the  importer,  who is  somewhere  else  in  a

country  which I will not name, will  not  come  to

some collusion to rook the Government. If that kind

of  difficulty can be got over, then maybe there is

something in this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on rent control, the Member for Choa Chu Kang

asks.  "Have we passed the thinking stage?" So  far

as  I  am concerned, the answer is I have not  even

reached the thinking stage. Nevertheless, I promise

to  apply  my mind to this subject, but I  give  no

assurance whatsoever that any action will be  taken

on this so that the Member may not be able to quote

me at the next Budget session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hire purchase and finance companies. The Member

for  Choa  Chu Kang wants legislation  to  regulate

hire  purchase. I really wonder, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

whether this deserves any priority. There is a  lot

of work to be done. II a consumer is thriftless and

wants to buy a car or a refrigerator or a motorbike

on  iniquitous  terms,  why  should  we  help  such

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is robbing!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As the Latin tag says, "caveat

emptor".  Why should people not develop more  self-reliance?   Why   should  they   not   make   these

calculations themselves? I make this point  because

in my previous stint as Finance Minister I did have

this  subject  studied, and a draft on  control  of

hire  purchase was sent to me. But it was  such  an

enormous  document  that I never  went  beyond  the

first  page. So in view of what I have said,  quite

frankly,  I  do  not think this deserves  priority.

Although,  mind  you,  if  public  opinion  is   so

strongly  of the contrary view, then I am  prepared

to change my mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards unemployment insurance, I am afraid

this has really come on the rocks. The Member asks,

"What  has been done?" Actually we have not allowed

the  grass to grow under our feet, and there is  in

the  Labour  Ministry  today  an  expert  from  the

International Labour Office. But I must ask Members

to  consider  that  in  the  next  few  years  many

thousands of people would be thrown out of job from

the military bases and, quite frankly, this kind of

unemployment  is  going  to  wreck  any   insurance

scheme. My view is that conditions have changed and

it may well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



be  that we may have to wait quite some time before

the normal situation arises which will enable us to

proceed with unemployment insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a number of minor points and I am through.

The  Member  for  Farrer Park has asked  what  will

happen  if the war in Vietnam comes to an  end.  I,

for one, will cheer very hard and, quite frankly, I

do  not  think any great calamity will  befall  our

economy  for the reasons which I have explained  in

my  Budget Speech, namely, that of the $300 million

worth  of exports to Vietnam, 80 per cent  of  them

consist of petroleum and petroleum products. I  can

assure  the  Member  that the refineries,  if  they

cannot  sell their products to the U.S.  Forces  in

Vietnam, can sell them elsewhere. So to the  Member

for  Farrer  Park, I say do not fear. All  will  be

well.  He need not have any guilty conscience about

our making money out of other people's miseries and

misfortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have come forward with suggestions

of how we can get round our economic problems. I do

not want to appear ungenerous or ungrateful, but  I

must say that some of these proposals are just non-starters.  I  regard  them as quite  illusory.  For

instance,  a common market was proposed.  Who  does

not  want a common market? But are you going to get

it?  This  is a pie in the sky. So let us keep  our

feet on the ground and not bank on very speculative

propositions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then some Members said that we should help

everybody  - the hawkers, taxi-drivers, small  shop-keepers, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



unemployed, and so on. Of course, we should try  to

help everybody. This is the most proper attitude to

take.  But  does  it mean that the Government  must

dish out money just because somebody is in trouble?

I  do not think so, because if we were to engage in

this kind of activity, I assure you that the Budget

would  not  be balanced and we would  have  to  get

taxes  from somebody to pay these people. So  I  do

urge  these  hon. Members - mind you, I  grant  that

their hearts are in the right places and that  they

are  very  dedicated and genuine  socialists  - that

this is not the way to get our economy on the move.

The objective is not to get money from somebody and

give  it  to  others.  This is  charity.  The  real

objective is to create new wealth so that everybody

will have more of it and useful work to do into the

bargain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the proposal to grow seaweeds. I do

not know; I am not an expert on growing seaweeds or

growing anything for that matter. But I think as  a

pie in the sky, this really takes the cake!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the Government for the year 1968.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>
