<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Communications (a) how

has  the pilot project allowing traffic to turn left on  red  at

some of the traffic lights been progressing; and (b) whether his

Ministry  will  consider extending it to  more  or  all  traffic

lights.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Dr Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Left Turn On Red scheme has been successful in

reducing  the  delay of left-turning traffic  at  the  junctions

where  it  is implemented.  On average, more than half of  these

vehicles  are  able to clear the junction during the  red  light

period.  The scheme has been extended to a total of 58 locations

island-wide.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme requires motorists to come to a complete stop to

look  out  for any pedestrian or vehicle before proceeding  with

the  left  turn.   However,  there  have  been  instances  where

motorists  failed  to  do  so.   I  would  like  to  take   this

opportunity  to remind motorists to take due care and  make  the

left  turn  on  red only when it is safe to  do  so.   LTA  will

monitor  the  practices  of  motorists  in  this  regard  before

extending the scheme to other junctions.

<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE ON SINGAPORE'S COMPETITIVENESS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [23rd

November, 1998],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the strategies and policies set

out   in   the   Report   of   the  Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness,  contained in Paper Misc. 3  of  1998,  as  the

basis   for   strengthening  Singapore's  competitiveness.".   - [Minister for Trade and Industry].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

for  the  last  few  days, you have listened to  many  colourful

speeches.  There will be 18 more after me and I hope you will be

able to have a keen ear in terms of what would be expressed.   I

am  sure,  Mr Speaker, you will be able to write a thesis  after

that!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like, first of all, to commend the members of

the  Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness for mapping out  a

very  good  comprehensive strategy to meet Singapore's  economic

and  future challenges.  The Report sets out the direction   and

we  have  got  various inputs.  The members have indeed  done  a

significant job in compiling a very comprehensive report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to also commend is the very effective and

immediate  measures taken by the Government  to  implement  with

immediate  effect  the  cost  cutting  measures  to  boost   our

competitiveness.  The measures are very significant and  I  hope

all  Singaporeans will rally behind the Government  to  see  how

they  can  support  a  plan which can  be  implemented  to  help

Singapore  to be viable and to be able to meet the more  serious

challenges ahead.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a plan is not sufficient but I think we will

have  to  examine why Singapore is one of the countries in  Asia

that  is  not  seriously  affected and  dislocated  by  economic

problems,  unlike many other places.  I think most  Singaporeans

tend  to  take this for granted, that things are going well  and

therefore  there  are less issues that we are  challenged  with.

The  Government  is able to look after these issues.   They  are

capable  people  to  think of solutions.  I  feel  this  is  not

realistic,  Sir.   It is very important that we  go  behind  the

reasons  as to what makes Singapore less affected by the current

economic problems.  This analysis is very important so  that  we

can  understand  the  fundamentals that  can  be  challenged  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like, at the outset, to state that political

stability  is one of the cornerstones in our capacity to  remain

afloat, and I see that we have also taken this for granted.   We

should  look  at  the political mess in many  of  the  countries

around  the  region  and the world.  There  are  many  so-called

democracies which have very good plans, good ideas, but many  of

these have not been implemented.  Many people in these countries

are  affected  and many of them have no capacity or  ability  to

influence such decisions that have been made, and many of  these

people  have  suffered  grave  economic  injustices  and   grave

problems  and regression in terms of their standard  of  living.

And  all these are issues that we need to examine and appreciate

in the context of why we have been able to manage effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what becomes very important when we are faced with a

recession  is our capacity to maintain good political  stability

and  cohesion.   When  resources are limited,  there  is  always

competition for resources, and the less able will not be able to

get  the  kind of resources which they require for their living.

So  what is most important in this respect is that I would  like

to urge employers to seriously examine the approaches they adopt

in  the  employment of workers, in ensuring that their practices

are  not discriminatory in terms of race, language and religion.

This is very important in the context of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>

Singapore, because we are a multi-racial society.  If we believe

in  the  principle  of meritocracy, then I think  employers,  in

times of recession and economic problems, must be very objective

to  ensure  that  we deal with the problems of retrenchment  and

unemployment  on  the basis of merit and objectivity.   This  is

very important.  Otherwise, we will upset the equilibrium of the

multi-racial society that we live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also have to look at the whole issue about

good  leadership in social institutions.  Unless  and  until  we

ensure  that  we  have good people managing our  various  social

institutions, we may not be able to discharge the kind of  plans

that we have.  And what is important for us Singaporeans is that

we  have  to  ensure that we continue to have people  with  good

leadership,  good  personal  integrity  and  honesty  to  manage

various   social  institutions.   Because  these   very   social

institutions, by their nature, are institutions that  will  make

our  society viable.  It is not sufficient to say that  we  need

good social institutions, but it is important to ensure that  we

need  to  nurture  and  have good people who  can  manage  these

institutions.    We  should  induct  good  people   into   these

institutions   so  that  they  can  continue  to   manage   them

effectively in the interest of the majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we also need to look at a good plan to manage

issues  ahead.  And the CSC Report is an effective plan in  that

we  have been able to mobilise various people to work on it  and

come  up  with various ideas that we can marshal and, hopefully,

with  the implementation of these ideas, we will be able to make

a  further stride in dealing with the economic problems that  we

face.   So  good plans do require good people and good political

context to manage and implement them.  Without these precursors,

the  best  ideas that we have will not see any fruition  and  it

will  not  have  any  impact on the social lives  and  to  solve

various social problems that we may face in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need to look at is to see how the CSC Report

could  address a number of issues which have been left  out.   I

foresee that the issue of prolonged

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>

unemployment  needs to be re-examined very closely,  because  we

have  depended on full employment as a form of social  security.

This is good as long as full employment lasts, but we never know

through  prolonged recessions, what impact this  would  have  on

people who are less skilled, semi-skilled and others who may not

be  able to find themselves employable.  We need to examine  the

assumptions of full employment very critically, and  in  future,

if  we run into a prolonged recession, there is a need to assess

how  people  who cannot be employed for a long time would  still

have a way to manage their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prolonged unemployment is one of the issues that we

need  to examine and the CSC has not examined this issue  fully.

We  have  to  look at what can be done, particularly  for  older

workers who would remain unemployable for a long time.   We  may

argue that there are retraining funds available to upgrade them,

that  special funds would be available and set aside  for  their

training,  but I think the issue at hand is their employability.

In  some circumstances, it may not be possible for them to  find

employment  itself because work institutions may not necessarily

take  them.   I feel that there is a need to look at either  the

trade  union level where some funds are set aside to  deal  with

the upgrading of these workers in order to solve their long-term

employment needs and problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue the CSC Report has not addressed is the

challenge of the older workforce.  This would be one of the more

serious  challenges  that we are likely  to  face  in  the  next

decade.    And  with  an  older  workforce,  would   we   remain

competitive?  This is a question we need to examine.  We may not

become  competitive,  provided they  have  the  capacity  to  be

trained and upgraded and to move into job areas which would deal

with  information technology.  So I feel that with  a  declining

population  which is below replacement,  the issue  will  become

very grave in the near future, and we have to look at how we can

maintain  a more robust workforce.  This means that we  have  to

recruit more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>

talents,  more  semi-skilled and skilled workers  to  enter  our

workforce.   I  see  this  issue requires  to  be  studied  more

closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has set up the STAR Committee

to  look  at these issues and, hopefully, it will solve some  of

the problems of the greying of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give some comments on the Government

measures  to reduce costs  which have been announced  yesterday.

The  measures  are comprehensive and will help to stimulate  our

economy.    The   measures  are  realistic  because   they   are

implementable  and some of them, in fact, have  taken  immediate

effect.  Hopefully, with the implementation of these measures we

will be able to become more viable.  What is most important  and

gratifying  to  note is that the direction of  the  cost-cutting

measures  which are to be implemented works on the principle  of

shared burden.  I am glad that the cost-cutting measures work on

the basis of those who can carry a heavier burden than those who

cannot.   This is a very good principle and I must  applaud  the

Government for the effort in this direction, because  for  those

who are unable to do so they do sacrifice, but they do sacrifice

a little.  This, at all costs, will enhance our ownership to the

problem.  We will be able to promote the sense of commitment  to

the  various  issues  that we face.   This  in  itself  is  very

important.   People  feel that they can work  towards  a  common

cause  and  we  are all sharing a common purpose  and  a  common

destiny,  and  we  all believe that we want  to  make  Singapore

viable.   Therefore, the question of ownership to  these  issues

that we face has been reinforced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to urge is that we should have been a bit

more  generous  with the lower income group.  The  rebates  that

have  been granted by the Government provide an extension for  a

further period of time in their relief.  But we could have  been

more  generous in increasing the amount of S&C charges  and  PUB

rates.  That  would have relieved further some of their  burdens

because many of them are unskilled and low income workers.  They

will face the greatest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>

impact  in terms of the capacity to manage their lives.   It  is

desirable and our responsibility to see that we can do much more

than what we have given to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area which seems to invite attention is the

levy.  Many working mothers are most disappointed that they have

not  been  given  a  reduction.  All other  companies  that  are

employing foreign workers have been given a reduction.  I  think

working   mothers  employing  domestic  maids   should   deserve

attention  because many of them are working  hard  in  terms  of

helping  to develop our economy and making Singapore viable.   I

do not see any reason why their case could not be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very small proportion of working mothers benefit from the

tax set-off.  A large proportion of them are not benefiting from

the  tax set-off measures.  I think it is not equitable  in  the

sense  that we have over the years increased the levy, but  when

all  other revenues are being reviewed, they should in  fact  be

given  an  opportunity to benefit from the reduction.   In  that

respect, the argument that we want to dampen the demand for more

of  them to employ maids should be re-examined.  I do not  think

the  reason  is  strong enough to support the argument  that  no

reduction has been considered for them.  The issue is that  many

of  them  are in the middle class group, which I would call  the

"sandwiched"  families.  I feel that they should be  considered.

This  is  no  real  logical reason that I can gather  that  they

should  not  be  given due consideration for reduction  of  maid

levy.   There  is a very large sector that would be affected  in

these   trying  times.   I  hope  that  their  case   could   be

reconsidered by the Minister for Manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, the social and economic crisis

that we are all facing is our problem.  It is important that  we

have to work together to fix it.  Unless we can rally around  to

work together and find new creative ways, new approaches and new

solutions  to all these issues, we would not be able  to  tackle

the problem as we hope to do so.  So it is very important for us

as Singaporeans to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>

commit  ourselves  to working together.   I  am  sure  that  all

Singaporeans will rally behind the Government to see what we can

do  in  our  own ways.  Whether big or small, we are all  to  be

counted.   Like  what our Mr Deputy Speaker has said,  small  is

beautiful.   It is not just beautiful, but we are  a  people  of

mettle who can withstand and be counted as Singaporeans.  I hope

we  can  come together and find ways to weather the storm ahead.

By doing so, we will keep ourselves afloat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate on the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been clarified by DPM Lee's response to the CSC

Report  yesterday.   What  the  Government  will  do  now,  very

shortly,  is  quite  clear.  Other points, however,  remain  for

consideration - especially with regard to the medium  to  longer

term  view,  but also on the possible effects of what Government

will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary because, as DPM reminded us,

competitiveness is much more than cost-cutting.   It  is  not  a

single  attribute, but a combination of different elements.   It

is  not  only a question of economics or infrastructure, but  it

has human dimensions, such as education, skill and know-how, the

flexibility  of  our  system and the quality  of  life  and  the

environment  in  our city.  Competitiveness is not  an  absolute

characteristic but a comparative one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, one detail will tend to dominate

discussion,  whether in this House or in the coffeeshops.   This

is the CPF and wage cut.  The cut will touch us all.  It is here

and  now, whereas many of the recommendations of the Report  are

for the longer term, and therefore more abstract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the CPF cut and wage cut may seem like a

magic  bullet.  I doubt this is the intention and I am  sure  it

will  not be the effect.  I am glad therefore that DPM  Lee  has

put   the   cut  and  other  cost-cutting  measures  in   proper

perspective.  They give our companies breathing space, but  only

a regional and global recovery will ensure our future growth and

development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, in making my comments on the Report, I wish to

focus  on  three main areas.  Two are more immediate, while  the

third is for the medium to longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the effect of the cut: can it have unintended

consequences?   Second,  the question of  equity:  how  are  the

sacrifices distributed?  Third, other concerns: what else do  we

need  to  do  to  complement the strategies in  the  Report  for

increasing competitiveness?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut to wages will make people feel poorer. They would

be  even  more reluctant to spend.  Domestic demand may well  go

down.   When  our shops are empty, or filled only  with  window-shoppers,  our business confidence will be affected.   As  such,

there is a danger of a deflationary spiral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, our Senior Minister Lee warned against us

over-reacting to the crisis by saving too much and  cutting  all

our  expenditure.  In the same vein, at the off-Budget measures,

a  number of us called for greater efforts to stimulate  demand.

The  cut to wages does the opposite.  It is akin to an austerity

measure for every citizen and wage earner.  Even the IMF is  now

re-thinking of austerity measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists tell us that Singapore depends two-thirds on

external  demand and only one-third on local demand.  Therefore,

they  do not advise pump-priming.  But even so, it seems  to  me

that  many  small businesses depend largely or almost wholly  on

domestic  demand -  our shops in HDB estates and  Orchard  Road,

our   hairdressers  and  barbers,  our  professionals  and   car

mechanics, our restaurants and food courts.  As such, while  the

absolute  effect  may be one-third, it can  spread  across  many

sectors  and many people and smaller businesses.  If  so,  pump-priming our domestic demand will not help a large amount, but it

can  help quite a number of people.  I would like the Minister's

clarification on this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should act to keep people in our shopping centres and

restaurants. We should act to keep a bounce in their  step.   We

should keep Singapore a city with a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>

buzz,  confident  that  we  will continue  to  be  a  centre  of

opportunity.   I  believe  this  proposed  cut  to   wages   may

unintentionally do the opposite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of "either or". We can do both. We

can  have  the  cuts to wages as well as a package to  stimulate

demand.   We  can  lower cost of living or  income  tax  through

rebates.  Lowering the cost of living in tandem with lower wages

will lessen the pain people will feel.  It will leave some spare

cash in their pockets.  This would feel good for the people  and

be good for the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unintended consequence of the cut that I fear

may be our ability to attract and retain talent.  Much attention

has been given to the cost of manufacturing as compared to other

countries  in  the  region.  But the  Report  itself  calls  for

services  to  be  a twin engine of growth.  For services,  other

comparisons  may  be more appropriate.  It is common  talk  that

wages  are higher in Hong Kong for some professionals, that  the

maximum  on personal income tax is lower, and the corporate  tax

is  lower.  For research and development, another area that  the

Report recommends, there are other comparisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether Singapore is

competing with the right countries for the right kinds  of  jobs

and  the  right sectors.  Our competitive position  should  take

into account not only the economy as a whole, but the benefit of

individuals  living here.  After all, it is not only investments

that  can  move  from one country to another, but  also  people.

Therefore,  it is my concern that with the cut, our  ability  to

attract  foreign talents here, which the Report calls for,  will

be  unintentionally eroded.  Worse, our ability  to  retain  our

existing talents may also weaken.  We need to have talented  and

knowledgeable  professionals, for these would be the  foundation

of  a  knowledge-based economy, and this will  mean paying  them

world class wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the second question of equity. Many are

concerned  about  how the cuts and sacrifices  are  distributed.

The statistics show that Government charges are smaller than the

wage component,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>

only  some 10%.  But perceptions differ.  The old joke  is  that

the  PAP  Government means Pay-And-Pay.  This  demonstrates  the

strength   of  that  perception.   Unless  we  deal  with   this

perception, people will not willingly accept their share of  the

sacrifice.   Instead, there may be a palpable  resentment  among

some sectors about what they see, rightly or wrongly, as an iron

rice bowl in the civil service and in Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we tackle this perception? Ideally, we need

institutionalised  monitoring.  Unlike the wage  cut,  there  is

less immediate impact from other cost-saving measures.  This  is

particularly where measures are given indirectly.  For  example,

where  relief is given to landlords, we should know how much  of

this is eventually passed on to the tenants and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to check Government influence on costs.

Many  others have spoken about GST, maid levy, ERP, etc.  I will

not add to the wish list, since all the goodies we are going  to

get  have  already been handed out by DPM Lee.  I  may  want  to

raise more general concerns.  It is a good and timely move  that

JTC  and  HDB will re-look at industrial land costs.   But  what

about  other  types of land, such as offices,  retail  and  even

residential  property  costs?  We  should  benchmark  all  these

against global competition, of course accepting our constraints.

Other areas the Government must look into are telecommunications

and  electricity.   Monopolies always  have  the  temptation  to

extract the maximum amount from their captive audience.  We  are

opening  up  these sectors eventually to competition.   DPM  Lee

said  yesterday, as regards SingTel, Government must honour  its

commitment  for its monopoly licence.  Fair enough.   But  until

the   day  the  competition  comes,  the  regulation  of   these

monopolies must serve to bring the costs to competitive  levels.

This,  in  the  longer run, is for the good of  these  companies

themselves if they are truly to be world class companies, as the

Report aspires to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can make a more general point from this. How do we grow

the world class companies?  Our strategy cannot be to grant GLCs

or  any  one else fat monopolies in Singapore, so that they  can

extract  excessive profits here, and then venture overseas  with

deep  pockets  drawn from our money.  We must ask the  companies

that  wish to be world class to be lean and competitive, so that

both  their operations here and abroad are world class and  give

value for money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point is about Government statutory boards. I

understand some statutory boards are in the habit of running  up

surpluses  and  yesterday I asked DPM  Lee  if  these  could  be

reviewed and cut.  He explained that some statutory boards, like

the  JTC, must make surpluses because they need to get the  best

value  for  state assets that they alienate.  I agree with  him.

But  there are other boards that are different, and I think  DPM

also  recognised  this.   I would ask that  for  such  different

statutory   boards,   the  surpluses  be  reviewed.    This   is

particularly for those who are supposed to facilitate  business.

For  such  business facilitation, surpluses do not  always  mean

efficiency.  Rather, the surpluses may represent costs extracted

from  businesses and individuals who have little choice  but  to

pay  the  sums  charged.  For Government  to  be  a  truly  good

business  facilitator, the policy should prefer  cost  recovery,

rather  than generating surpluses.  We need to ensure  that  our

Government  agencies are benchmarked to the best  practices.   I

agree with that.  But Government agencies need to add value, not

add costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point on equity concerns the wage cut taken by our

political leaders and top civil servants.  There is a joke about

political leadership and sacrifice.  There is a plane with three

politicians on board - Gandhi, Churchill and a third leader,  Mr

X.   There are also a number of ordinary citizens on board.  The

plane is coming to a range of very high mountains, but the plane

is  struggling to climb high enough to pass safely.   The  pilot

informs  everyone  that  they  may  crash  unless  the  load  is

lightened.  They dump all the bags and cargo, but the  plane  is

still too heavy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this crisis, Gandhi opens the airplane door, shouts,

"For  My  People" and jumps out.  With his sacrifice, the  plane

lightens  a  bit  and  climbs a little.  But  not  enough.   So,

Churchill looks around and goes to the door.  He shouts, "For My

People" and jumps out.  Again, the plane climbs, but still it is

not  enough.   Finally, there is only the  third  leader  and  a

number of ordinary citizens.  The third leader goes to the door,

opens  it,  shouts, "For My People" and throws all the  ordinary

citizens out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee announced yesterday a 10% cut. I think that this

is  enough to show that Singapore does not have leaders like the

third  man in the joke.  Still, many will ask, "Is 10%  enough?"

Percentages  do matter and the public will judge for themselves.

What I want to ask is more a question of the system itself.   Is

the  system  we have of fixing ministerial salaries working?   I

ask this bearing in mind that this is the second year running in

which  we  have  departed from the system.   DPM  Lee  yesterday

suggested  that it was a problem of time lag.  If so, I  suppose

we  can  fix by using more "real time" information about  wages.

But  I  would  like  the Government to consider  an  entire  re-thinking  of  the  system.   Perhaps instead  of  pegging  to  a

handful,  an elite, should the approach be to broad band?   This

could  be  to a larger percentile of wage earners and  it  could

well be more robust and politically acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having outlined my concerns with unintended consequences

and  equity, let me turn finally to other concerns.  I  wish  to

outline  three concerns that, in my opinion, must be  allied  to

the question of competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to improve on natural resource efficiency.

Sir,  an important strategy in competitiveness is to be watchful

over resource input.  If you can produce more from less, you are

more   efficient,   productive   and   competitive.    This   is

particularly  true  when you do not own or  have  automatic  and

guaranteed  access  to  those inputs and resources.   There  are

sound  reasons to be watchful over the use of natural  resources

in Singapore, such as electricity and, especially, water.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>

The Report mentions both.  The Report sees water and electricity

as utilities that must be optimally managed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For water, the Report calls for Government incentives to be

publicised.   As regards electricity, the Report  addresses  the

question of charges for stand-by purposes.  For water, there are

a  few other strategies mentioned such as reducing wastage.  But

more can and should be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can better publicise existing incentives, we may

actually need to have better incentives to publicise.   We  also

need  to  re-look at the policy of pushing up the price.   Price

can  encourage greater efficiencies but only if it is undertaken

in   a  context  that  increases  awareness  and  capacity,  and

encourages  innovation  and  investment.   Otherwise,  a   price

increase  on its own simply leads to a price increase, and  that

will diminish competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of electricity. The cost is of real

concern  to businesses and households alike.  This is especially

given  the  eventual  privatisation of  Singapore  Power.   With

privatisation,  there may come a need to increase  profits.   If

profits  are  tied  solely to the selling of  electricity,  then

there  is no incentive for Singapore Power or any other supplier

to    be   concerned   about   efficiency,   productivity    and

competitiveness.  It will simply try to sell more power for more

money  and  profit.   This  will  lead  to  a  less  competitive

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons to embrace policies that will

encourage  greater  efficiency in the use of natural  resources.

Part  of  these  reasons are environmental.   But  part  of  the

reasons are also economic.  Using off-the-shelf technology, some

companies  are now reporting that they have achieved  what  they

call,  "Factor Four", that is, they double income, while halving

resource  use.   These  private sector innovations  need  to  be

studied  and understood.  They can then serve as best  practices

that we should encourage others to adopt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has an inter-agency committee to examine

energy use in Singapore.  I hope that they will have one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>

on  water.  And I hope that the Government will task this agency

to  look  particularly  at the question of  competitiveness  and

efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that we need to ally competitiveness to is

to  increase  our cooperation.  The thrust of the Report  is  on

Singapore's  internal factors of competitiveness.  We  must  not

forget,  however, the Report is coming amidst a  crisis  of  the

region.  In fact, it is this regional dimension that has delayed

the  Report  and forced it to focus on reducing costs  vis-a-vis

other countries.  While it is Singapore's right to cut costs, we

must guard against an intended perception.  This is that we  are

trying  to  out-compete other countries in  a  negative  manner.

That  is  to  say, we are cutting costs, so that we  will  steal

investments  from our neighbours and force them to  lower  their

costs, or to devalue their currencies again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe this is our intention. Nor do I believe

it  is in our interest to do so.  We cannot be seen to create  a

race  to the bottom.  Our cost-cutting should not be seen  as  a

policy to beggar our neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore call upon our Government to now re-emphasise

Singapore's  cooperation,  in tandem  with  the  Report  on  our

competitiveness.  This aspect of cooperation is a theme  in  the

Report.   It  recognises the external wing and the  need  to  go

global,  as well as regional.  At pages 62 and 63 of the Report,

it  recommends the continuation of strategic flagship  projects,

promoting  tripartite cooperation to attract third countries  to

invest, and using Singapore as a centre for training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important points that bear emphasis in the

present times.  The crisis has caused many Singaporean companies

to lose money in the region.  When we talk of going global, some

may  fear  that this displaces our regional interest and  focus.

Rather,  I urge the Government to send a strong signal that  our

global  diversification is not a retreat  from  regionalisation,

but  an addition and complement to that thrust.  The crisis  has

also  caused some other countries in the region to doubt whether

they will prosper from being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>

open  to  the  world economy, trade and investment.   There  are

rumblings  of  autarchy  and  narrow  nationalism  in  different

countries.   This is especially the case in some countries  that

were newly opening themselves when the crisis hit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that we stand for the belief that free

trade  and  a  connection to the world economy can help,  rather

than  hurt.  Sir, it is timely for us to act on what we believe.

We  should  help  steady other countries in the  region  against

those  who would close their economies and borders.  We can  and

should  do this by helping them better understand economics  and

the ways of business, and increasing their capacity to cope.  We

should  share  our  experiences with them, and  help  train  and

orientate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also help these countries to deal with more immediate

dislocations caused by the crisis.  If asked, we should help our

neighbours  with problems among their poorer and less  well-off.

There  is  just so much a little red dot can do,  as  our  Prime

Minister has aptly said, but what we can do, we should  do.   In

this  respect, I have asked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

how much development assistance Singapore had given to its ASEAN

neighbours  in  the last 18 months, that is,  since  the  crisis

began.  The figure given by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  was

some  S$11.5 million, under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.

I  call  on  the  Government to re-emphasise our  commitment  to

cooperation  and to a win-win relationship with our  friends  in

the region by increasing this amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not look to our immediate self-interests in doing

this.  We need to focus on the longer term interests inherent to

win-win  policies, and try to truly prosper our neighbours.   We

need   to  marry  our  sense  of  being  competitive  with   our

willingness to be cooperative.  If we are tough enough to take a

cut  during these bad times, we should also be caring enough  to

give  more during these tough times, and this will send a strong

signal of our cooperation, and our neighbourliness.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final point I turn to is that of heartware. Last

year,  PM  Goh  spoke about the need to develop heartware.   The

Singapore  21 Committee, of which I am a member, has spent  this

last  year  consulting  the  citizens  and  thinking  about  the

questions of heartware.  Some have wondered why this work should

concern  Singaporeans now when the crisis makes us  worry  about

the  here and now, rather than 21st century.  Yet I do not think

the  question  of  heartware is important, despite  the  crisis.

Heartware is important because of the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the longer term strategies in the Report, I see

areas  in which heartware is the critical component.  One aspect

is  how  we  attract  foreign  talents,  while  taking  care  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, we must help Singaporeans excel and compete. We

must  also  attract  talent from abroad, by being  an  open  and

cosmopolitan city-society.  By "cosmopolitan", I do not mean  we

should  read Cosmopolitan magazine, but rather that we allow  an

active engagement and interaction of people and values.  We need

to  facilitate foreign talent to come into Singapore, by  easing

bureaucratic  impediments, and should increase  interaction  and

understanding  between  Singaporeans and  foreign  talents  that

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second aspect of heartware is how we, as a people, strengthen

the  external wing of globalisation while remaining Singaporean.

This  requires a sense of rootedness.  It requires us to develop

a  sense of being Singaporean and yet also  being "world  ready"

so  that  we  can go out and compete to "plug-and-play"  on  any

stage in the world.  Our companies and families must accept  and

even  promote overseas stints as a feather in the cap of workers

and  family  members.   Government should remove  hindrances  to

going  overseas, such as the lack of double taxation  agreements

and  concerns  over  children's schooling.  Government  agencies

should  keep  in  touch  with  those  abroad  and  foster  their

knowledge and stake in what happens here at home.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we develop a Singapore heartbeat, a sense of belonging, no

matter  where  we  find  ourselves,  this  will  strengthen  our

economic external wing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the question of heartware is important to competitiveness

because  it  includes  fostering creativity and  resourcefulness

among our people.  We need to be a society in which there  is  a

second  chance for people, and in which everyone  counts.   Only

then  will  people be entrepreneurial, and be  willing  to  take

risks,  and  to  be different.  And only then can  we  be  truly

competitive.     Differentiation   is   important.     As    one

entrepreneur, Y Y Wong, reminded me recently, competitiveness on

price  matters most when you have the same product.  But if  you

are  different, and people recognise your product is  different,

you can command that extra dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You then compete, but with an edge. And I think that is the

competitiveness that Singapore should seek - to  be  competitive

but to be different and to add value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and qualifications, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking on the CSC Report after the grand and masterly

intervention by DPM BG Lee yesterday, it is like an anti-climax.

It  is  like  coming to a cinema show soon after  the  hero  has

swiftly  moved in to save the heroine in distress.   The  saving

grace, however, is that after `the hero lai-lo' scene, we can at

least still say, "Some money back, please."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean is that, yes, this is a major exercise at cost

cutting, as it should be, if we are serious about retaining  our

competitiveness,  but the Government has shown  enough  care  to

provide sufficient rebates and reductions in taxes and levies to

give  Singaporeans the cushion they deserve for their collective

sense of sacrifice and effort at overcoming the challenge.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we all know that this is no laughing matter. In

short,  this is no wayang.  The stakes are high.  Our  continued

prosperity  and  social  well being as a  cohesive  multi-racial

nation  depend  on  whether  we can pull  our  economic  strings

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CSC understands this fully, as

reflected  in  its approach, strategies and recommendations  for

both  the short and longer term.  Competition will grow  and  we

Singaporeans  have  a lot to lose in terms of  our  standard  of

living and quality of life if we were not prepared to face this,

in  the words of DPM Lee, "gravest challenge since independence"

squarely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chairman of the CSC, Minister for Trade and

Industry,  Mr Lee Yock Suan, who is also my chief at  Cheng  San

GRC,  is  very well known for his soft- spokenness.  Mr  Lee  is

also  a  man  of  few  words.  He believes in  gentle  but  firm

diplomacy.   But  the  CSC  Report  by  him  and  his  respected

Committee speaks volumes, and `loud and clear' of what Singapore

needs  to  do  to  remain competitive.  We  all  know  that  the

challenges  Singapore  faces in the immediate  and  longer  term

future    are    formidable   but   if   the    well-thought-out

recommendations  were to be implemented, and  implemented  fast,

they should stand us in good stead.  PM Goh Chok Tong's positive

response to the Report to "ask the relevant Ministries to follow

up   promptly   on   these  recommendations"   is   also   worth

highlighting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comprehensive recommendations for the short and longer

term  notwithstanding,  we  have  already  heard  voices  asking

whether  the Report had gone far enough to prepare  us  for  the

real  challenges.   Some, as reflected in the media,  have  even

expressed  disappointment.  These sentiments are not necessarily

bad.   There will always be those who will want Singaporeans  to

be  pushed  to the limits.  Such are the demands of  the  times,

especially in this highly competitive world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example will be the concern whether enough will be done

to produce Singapore's own world class players and corporations.

I  think PSA is a good example of a corporation which is pushing

hard  to  be one and is making good progress, but can we  really

see  more?   More  therefore could be done to help  produce  our

world  class  corporations to compete in this highly competitive

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to go into the nuts and

bolts  of  the Report nor the package presented by  DPM  BG  Lee

yesterday,  but  instead  go to the spirit  of  the  matter.   I

remember, earlier this year, when some of us in this House  were

pushing  for  the  Government to do more to  assist  the  ailing

economy, the latter initially resisted for fear of over-alarming

the  people.   Confidence was and is a premium in difficult  and

turbulent  times.  Even when the $2 billion off-Budget  measures

were  announced,  some felt that they could be "too  little  too

late".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time around, when the CSC proposed a cost-cutting package of $10 billion, the Government went a step

further  with another $500 million cut.  This must be  for  good

reasons.   This  will in no doubt emphasise the gravity  of  the

challenge,  but not without the `cushion effect' for those  that

need  help  most, especially the lower income groups.   This  is

commendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also interesting to note that the CSC was in fact

established in May last year before the July regional  meltdown.

Here,  I am reminded of a Malay saying, "sediakan payung sebelum

hujan"  (or  have your umbrella ready before it  rains).   This,

after  all, is true to what Singapore is well-known for:  to  be

forward looking and we always have to be a few steps ahead.   We

certainly  would not want to be caught flat footed.   Especially

when the thunderstorm clouds (not just rain clouds) were already

gathering  over  the  horizon.   And  if  I  may  add,  ordinary

umbrellas will not do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the challenges facing us call for a

concerted  effort by all parties concerned.  I am glad  to  see,

Sir, that it even moved your Deputy and Member for Marine Parade

GRC, Mr Eugene Yap, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>

speak.  Almost lyrical, on Monday Mr Yap spoke of the dangers of

complacency and endorsed what he called worthy kiasuism.   While

he  used `the infamous Titanic' to illustrate, allow me  to  use

the Maldivian `dhoni' or boat to make my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modest fishing boat is the saving grace for the

Maldivians who know what it means to survive in the atols of the

Indian   Ocean.   I  was  there  earlier  this  month  for   the

Inauguration  of the President, President Maumoon Abdul  Gayoom,

and  I have learnt how they, a population of about 260,000, have

transformed  the  seafaring nation to that of  a  niche  tourist

destination known the world over.  I think we have  two  of  our

companies, Banyan Tree and HPL, having their own very  exclusive

tourist  resorts there.  Without even fresh water, each  of  the

major  Maldivian tourist island resort has its own  desalination

facilities  to  make the industry succeed.  Yes,  most  of  them

still turn to the dhoni, their own traditional boat, and the sea

to earn a living but they also know that those skills alone will

not  suffice.  Air travel and speedboats now rule the waters  of

the tourist lanes of the Maldives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the proud Maldivians see

Singapore's  drive  and competitive instincts  as  a  source  of

inspiration.   They  know what survival  means.   Our  Singapore

workers  too  know  what survival means.   When  sacrifices  are

needed, they would not hesitate to rally to the call.  And  this

is not the first time the workers have shown their mettle.  Yes,

to  quote DPM BG Lee again, "tough times put our mettle  to  the

test"  and  our  workers  were and are the  first  to  show  it.

Whether  it  is  the cut in employers' CPF contributions,  other

wage  costs and training and retraining, the NTUC and the unions

are with the Government and the Singapore people.  Difficult  as

they   may  be,  the  workers  know  the  realities,   for   the

alternatives, more retrenchment and unemployment, would even  be

more painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while acknowledging the workers' sacrifice, I hope the

employers  would  also  do their part.  Yes,  there  are  enough

employers   who  have  shown  that  they  too  are  responsible.

Compliments are also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>

due  to  those  who have shown their care for the  workers,  for

example,  Creative Technology, which has promised to return  the

CPF  savings when the company does well.  But I hope that  there

would  not  be  those which are only too eager  to  exploit,  or

worse,  to  abuse  the situation.  For the latter,  I  think  we

should  expose  them.  The Government, together with  the  NTUC,

should monitor the private sector to ferret out such abuses  and

expose them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure pragmatic Singaporeans will

agree  that  the cost cutting measures recommended  in  the  CSC

Report  and  those  presented by the  Government  yesterday  are

necessary.   And  so  are the numerous other strategic  measures

recommended by the CSC to overcome the crisis.  In other  words,

there  is  no short cut to staying competitive.  Our  companies,

employers  and workers realise that we must be a cut  above  the

others  in  order  to compete.  But we have  to  do  it  with  a

collective sense of purpose.  Show and convince our workers that

the  measures  taken  are equitable  and  fair.   It  may  be  a

painstaking exercise but it has to be done patiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems faced by those workers who are retrenched and

terminated  are  real.   While  there  are  ample  training  and

retraining opportunities, the process will take time  and  there

may  be  practical  problems faced  by  the  workers  and  their

families which need careful handling.  In short, while  the  CSC

Report  and the Government statement yesterday say a  lot  about

what must be done, let us do it with care, with a heart.  It  is

not  just  a matter of dollars and cents, but a human face  too.

Equally  important to the nuts and bolts of the  recommendations

and  the action lines, is the right spirit to make it work.  Our

Singapore spirit of success but in harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since Monday, about 35 hon. Members have spoken on perhaps

twice  as many issues and concerns of Singaporeans arising  from

this economic downturn and recession.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to speak in support of the motion but I will confine

my  remarks  to  areas impinging on the Ministry  of  Manpower's

responsibilities  and the recommendations of  the  Committee  on

Singapore's   Competitiveness   where   it   touches   on    the

responsibilities of my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, DPM Lee had explained that we are facing

the  most  severe  economic crisis since our independence.   The

drop  in demand from our regional trading partners who were more

severely  hit  by the regional economic crisis  had  dimmed  our

growth  prospects.  The regional currency realignment  had  also

affected   our  share  of  the  global  market.   Recession   is

unavoidable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the downturn in the economy has led to a deterioration

of  the  employment situation in Singapore.  In the  first  nine

months  of  this  year,  more  than  20,000  workers  had   been

retrenched.  This is more than twice the number of workers  laid

off  for  the whole of 1997 and is also higher than  the  19,500

workers  who  were  retrenched  during  our  last  recession  in

1985/86.   We have also suffered the first contraction in  total

employment  since the last recession in 1985 over the  last  two

quarters.  Sir, the total unemployment rate had risen from  2.3%

in  June  this  year  to  4 1/2% in September  this  year  on  a

seasonally adjusted basis, indicating an increase in momentum in

the rise of unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has introduced many initiatives to help

retrenched  workers.   We have expanded our  Employment  Service

Department  as  an  additional channel  to  help  retrenched  or

unemployed Singaporeans to look for alternative jobs.   We  have

also  formed a proactive Employment Facilitation Team  to  reach

out  to employers in various sectors to determine their manpower

requirements in the near future and to help them with strategies

to  fill  their  job  vacancies with appropriate  manpower.   In

particular, we seek out employers who are still recruiting so as

to  capture  their vacancies in our job bank.  In this  way,  we

have been able to provide as many as 80%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>

of  the registrants at our Employment Service Department with at

least  one  job referral.  If a registrant is not successful  in

getting the job in the first instance, we have been able to make

follow-up referrals to him.  We have also created a Retrenchment

Advisory  Unit  (RAU) to help employers cope with  the  need  to

downsize as demand for their goods and services shrink.  The RAU

has  already  helped  employers  to  introduce  alternatives  to

outright   retrenchment,   laying  off   workers   directly   by

introducing  shorter  work week, temporary lay-off  and  putting

excess manpower on training programmes and also working out  how

they  could reduce wage costs by reduction of the flexible  wage

component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these measures cannot solve the problem of rising

unemployment   in  this  recession.   Already  the   number   of

registrants at the ESD has exceeded available vacancies,  unlike

in the past when we used to have more than twice as many jobs as

job seekers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can we do in response to this sudden change in

economic  climate?   Obviously,  we  cannot  insulate  ourselves

completely  from  the chill winds of recession sweeping  through

the region.  We are already in fact feeling the first twinge  of

the   biting   cold  brought  about  by  the  external   forces.

Unemployment  has,  as I said, reached 4.5%  in  September  this

year.   This  is  nearly 2.5 times higher than  a  year  ago  in

September  1997.  We have to revitalize our economic  engine  in

order to get us out of the woods.  The CSC's comprehensive study

has  made  it  clear  that our business cost  is  now  too  high

compared  to  our  competitors, as  a  result  of  the  regional

currency  and economic crisis.  We are no longer competitive  in

areas where our neighbours are also vying for market share.   We

must  bring business cost back in line to survive this  downturn

and  to  avoid more painful setbacks such as higher unemployment

rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th October 1998, the Straits Times published a table

compiled  by  the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU)  showing  the

cost of doing business in Singapore versus Hong Kong, Indonesia,

Malaysia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>

and  Thailand.  The EIU concluded that regionally, Singapore was

the  "most expensive country to do business in".  We were  rated

even  more  expensive  than Hong Kong.   What  was  particularly

striking was our wage cost, which was shown to be as much as 1.7

times  that  of  Hong  Kong, 4.4 times  Malaysia  and  15  times

Thailand.   The  hourly  cost  of  labour  in  manufacturing  in

Indonesia was only one-twenty-third of that in Singapore.  While

Singapore need not compete on low cost labour because  we  offer

investors and businessmen many other advantages for operating in

Singapore, we also cannot completely disregard this sudden swing

in   the   region   which  has  severely  eroded   our   overall

competitiveness.  The decline in demand and the higher costs  of

operations  in Singapore could lead to bigger losses  in  market

share for Singapore.  If we do not tackle this problem, it  will

cause  even  more retrenchments and higher unemployment  in  the

years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee has pointed out, total wages and salaries paid

to  workers are a key component of GDP output amounting to  43%.

Whereas  indirect  taxes paid to Government represent  only  10%

while  profits  to  companies take  up  the  rest  of  47%.   So

obviously  any measure to reduce cost of doing business  and  to

enhance  competitiveness must involve adjustments to  wages  and

salaries,   apart   from  reducing  the  indirect   taxes   from

Government.  This is a pragmatic and an effective approach.   By

doing  so, we will be signalling to international investors  and

employers that Singaporeans are adaptable and pragmatic.  We  do

not  cry over spilled milk but get down quickly to build up lost

competitiveness and regain market share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the approach adopted by the Committee on

Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  I applaud the Committee  for

its courage in facing up to the realities and not flinching from

prescribing  bitter medicines.  The Committee had recommended  a

10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF contribution rate  as

well  as  a  cut in wages to achieve a total 15% reduction.   On

CPF, DPM Lee had already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>

announced  yesterday  that  the  Government  accepts  the  CSC's

recommendation and to minimise the impact on homeowners who  are

using  their   CPF savings or contributions to service  mortgage

loans, 6% point of the cut would come from the Ordinary Account.

Contribution   to  the  Special  Account  would  completely   be

suspended.   In  other  words, the 4% point  that  goes  to  the

Special  Account will be cut off. For example, a person  earning

$2,000 a month would see a drop of $120 in CPF savings available

for mortgage repayment and not $200 which is the actual size  of

the  CPF  reduction for a person earning $2,000.  As CPF members

and  their families may need to utilize their Medisave  to  meet

their medical expenses even in an economic downturn, there is no

need for us to reduce the Medisave contribution rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers above the age of 55 whose current

contribution  rates  are  lower, the  rates  will  also  be  cut

proportionately by half as announced by DPM Lee.  In the case of

employees  above the age of 55 to age 60, their  employers'  CPF

contribution rate will be reduced from 7.5% to 4%  (a  round  up

from  3.75%).  For employees above the age of 60 to  age  65,  I

have   previously   announced  that  existing   employers'   CPF

contribution  rate will be reduced from 7.5% to 4%  with  effect

from 1st January 1999 as a result of the proposal to extend  the

retirement  age  from 60 to 62.  Similarly, for employees  above

the  age of 65, their employers' CPF contribution rate will also

be  reduced  from 5% to 4% as a result of the extension  of  the

retirement  age.   In line with the principle  of  proportionate

cut, the CPF contribution rate for this group of workers will be

reduced  to 2% from 4%.  As announced by DPM Lee the  cuts  will

take effect on 1st January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 18% of active CPF members (or 217,057 active

CPF  members) will have monthly CPF contributions that are  less

than  their monthly housing instalments as a result of the  cut.

Out of these members, 165,661 are HDB owners, 46,446 are private

property  owners  and  4,950 are concurrently  HDB  and  private

property owners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the affected CPF members, the Government will allow

the  use  of  savings in their Special Account, apart  from  the

Ordinary  Account, to meet the shortfall in their  monthly  loan

repayment arising from the CPF cut. In addition, there will also

be  separate assistance schemes to help HDB and private property

owners tide over the difficulties of mortgage repayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of HDB lessees, the HDB will put in place

measures similar to those offered in the last economic downturn.

These  measures will benefit both lessees of existing HDB  flats

as  well as affected applicants of new and resale flats.   These

will  include  allowing more working family  members  to  become

joint  owners, thus using their CPF savings to meet the mortgage

repayment.  HDB will also reschedule mortgage loans to a  longer

repayment period, defer mortgage repayment and allowing  payment

of   arrears  by  instalments  for  those  who  have   financial

difficulties.  Applicants for new and resale flats will also  be

eligible  for  these  assistance schemes.  In  addition,  first-timers  with financial difficulties will be allowed to downgrade

to a smaller flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private properties purchased before the CPF

cut,  the  Government will offer affected CPF members a Bridging

Loan Scheme (BLS) similar to that provided in 1986.  The BLS  is

for  CPF  members who have depleted their Ordinary  Account  and

Special  Account  savings for their monthly mortgage  repayment.

The  bridging  loan  will be made available  over  a  three-year

period in the first instance, with the commencement of the first

draw down on 1st March 1999. The quantum of the monthly bridging

loan drawn down will be capped at the amount of shortfall, which

arises directly from the cut of 6% point in the Ordinary Account

contribution rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the burden of mortgage repayment of CPF members

during  this recession, the bridging loan will be offered  at  a

concessionary  interest  rate based on CPF  interest  rate  plus

0.1%.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>

is  significantly  lower than the commercial interest  rate  for

housing loans.  The cut-off age limit for the eligibility of the

loan will be based on the minimum statutory retirement age of 62

years  which  will take effect on 1st January  1999.   Repayment

will commence one year after the end of the three year draw-down

period, with full repayment to be made over a period of 10 years

or by the age of 65, or upon the sale of the property, whichever

is earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BLS will also be extended to HDB flat owners who are

paying  market  interest  rate, and whose  flats  were  likewise

purchased  before the CPF cut was announced.   The  market  rate

currently applies to Permanent Residents, owners of resale flats

whose  household income exceeds $8,000 a month  and  third  time

purchasers of HDB flats.  This is a separate group of  HDB  flat

owners  who  are servicing their HDB loans at the interest  rate

pegged  to that of the Credit POSB's interest because they  have

already had their fair share of the housing subsidy.  As for HDB

lessees who are currently enjoying concessionary interest  rates

(which is CPF + 0.1%) for their outstanding mortgage loans, they

need not apply for the BLS as they can apply for HDB's financial

assistance  package  at  the same concessionary  interest  rate.

Further  details  of  the BLS and the HDB  Financial  Assistance

Programmes will be released separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also aware that the cut in CPF

contribution  rate will have an impact on CPF members  who  have

committed their savings for insurance policies which they bought

previously or who are participants in the education loan scheme.

In  other words, they have borrowed against their CPF savings to

finance either their own education or their children's education

in  institutes of higher learning. To ensure that such  payments

are not disrupted, whether it is insurance or education, members

will  be  allowed  to set aside sufficient CPF savings  to  meet

these  payments  when they apply for the bridging  loan  or  for

HDB's assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will result in a wage saving of some $3.9

billion a year to employers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>

This  will help companies and the economy to regain and  improve

competitiveness  in  the  current economic  downturn.   The  CPF

contribution  rate  will be adjusted upwards  when  the  economy

recovers and when a higher rate of saving will not undercut  our

overall competitiveness.

<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to foreign worker levy. But before doing

so, I should respond specifically to some points made by several

MPs  including Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Peh Chin Hua.  They have

suggested that CPF members should be allowed to draw some amount

of  money from their CPF savings during this downturn.  I  would

like  very much to agree with the Members, particularly  Mr  Peh

Chin Hua, who is also my GRC colleague.  But on this occasion, I

am  afraid that I have to disagree with him and the rest of  the

Members who have made this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always maintained that CPF savings may be released for

living  expenses  if  Singapore runs into a prolonged  and  deep

recession.   The  situation  today  is  certainly  not  in  this

category.  We are not in a prolonged and deep recession as  yet.

While  the economic challenges are more severe than any that  we

have  encountered previously, we should not quickly turn to  the

CPF  account  to support the living expenses for the unemployed.

Most  CPF  members are using their CPF savings to pay for  their

housing mortgages, as I have just explained earlier on.   As  it

is,  with  the reduction in CPF contribution by 10% point,  many

CPF  members  (217,000 of them) would have insufficient  CPF  to

continue their monthly mortgage repayment.  If we in fact  allow

CPF  members to draw from their CPF savings for living expenses,

it  would  mean  that more CPF members would deplete  their  CPF

savings  faster  and  that  would create  a  bigger  problem  in

servicing their home mortgages.  It may even cause some  of  the

home owners to have to lose their homes in the process.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh has made a specific suggestion that we allow jobless

Singaporeans  to draw $150 from their CPF account to  tide  them

over this period.  My response is that if $150 is what a jobless

Singaporean  needs  for  himself  and  his  family,  the  better

solution  is  to  help him find a job.  We still  have  a  large

number  of  foreign workers in Singapore today, working  in  the

manufacturing and service sectors, earning anywhere  from  $500-$600  a month, doing many jobs which Singaporeans up to now  are

reluctant to take on.  In a crunch, jobless Singaporeans may  be

better  off  taking on similar jobs than relying  on  their  CPF

savings to sustain themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do our best to help Singaporeans who are prepared to

take  on such jobs, provided they are realistic about wages  and

the   working   conditions.   Employers  should  also   consider

attracting  unemployed  Singaporeans  by  making  use  of  their

savings  on  the  foreign worker levy when they employ  a  local

worker.  This is, I believe, a far better approach than allowing

the unemployed to draw down on their CPF at this juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the danger of allowing CPF withdrawal at this early stage

is  that  it  would  give some Singaporeans  a  false  sense  of

security.   They may be lulled into not reacting to the  changed

labour  market  situation and remain reluctant  to  accept  jobs

which  pay less or are more onerous.  Some may even become  less

willing to go for skill upgrading and retraining, thinking  that

they  have  their  CPF savings that would tide  them  over  this

difficult period.  This mindset will only delay our recovery and

may  well result in a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In other words,

if  we allow CPF withdrawal, we induce inertia to change and  to

work  harder.   As a result, we remain uncompetitive,  recession

deepens  and  more  and more people become unemployed.   So,  on

balance,  I  think  it  is  better for  us  to  help  unemployed

Singaporeans   find   alternative  jobs,  and   for   unemployed

Singaporeans  to be prepared to take on more difficult  jobs  at

even a lower pay.  The situation has changed.  These are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>

difficult times.  Tens of millions are unemployed in the  region

around us.  We must be prepared to make drastic adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the foreign worker levy, the Committee has

recommended that the foreign worker levy be reduced as  a  means

of  cutting cost of business.  DPM Lee yesterday also  announced

Government's acceptance of this recommendation.  Let me say that

there  are now more than 450,000 foreign workers on work permits

in  Singapore.   This means unskilled and at  best  semi-skilled

workers.  Many companies are still dependent on foreign  workers

for  jobs which locals do not want to do.  In particular, in the

manufacturing  sector, many companies have to  rely  on  foreign

workers to fulfil part of their manpower requirements.  However,

when we cut the foreign worker levy, we should be careful not to

remove  the differential between local and foreign workers.   We

should not cut the levy to the extent that employers are tempted

to  replace  Singaporeans with more and  more  foreign  workers.

Cutting  CPF  for local workers thus gives us an opportunity  to

also  lower  foreign worker levy without widening the  wage  gap

between local and foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to recap, the levy for skilled workers will be reduced

from  $100  to $30 for all sectors with effect from 1st  January

1999.   This is a reduction coming on top of the $100  reduction

which  was  implemented  in April this year.   In  other  words,

within a period of less than a year, we have reduced the foreign

worker levy for skilled workers by $170.  The levy for unskilled

foreign workers will also be reduced by $90 with effect from 1st

January  1999.  This reduction will apply only to  companies  in

the  manufacturing, marine and services sectors to enhance their

export competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy for unskilled foreign construction workers will

not  be reduced.  Construction is a domestic industry and is not

directly  vulnerable  to  international  competition.    Overall

construction costs have in fact come down for all building

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>

types  during this period.  The weighted Tender Price Index  has

fallen by 4.5% in the first six months of this year, partly  due

to falling material costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moreover, the construction sector has remained overly-dependent on unskilled foreign workers. This is the main cause

for  the  very low productivity of the sector.  The productivity

level  of  our construction workforce lags far behind  those  in

countries such as Japan and Australia.  In terms of value  added

per  worker in the construction industry, Australia is 1.5 times

ahead  while  Japan is three times that of Singapore.   For  the

last  three  consecutive  years,  productivity  growth  for  the

construction  sector  has  been negative.   So  far  this  year,

productivity  growth for the sector has declined  by  a  further

2.1%.    Hence,   since   1995,  the  productivity   level   for

construction had actually gone down by more than 15%.   We  need

to take a determined approach to upgrade the skills level of the

construction  workforce in order to achieve  a  breakthrough  in

productivity.   That  is  why  we cannot  reduce  the  levy  for

unskilled foreign construction workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy reduction for skilled foreign construction workers

and  the increase in the levy for unskilled foreign construction

workers, which took effect in April of this year, have  in  fact

resulted  in  improvement  in the quality  of  the  construction

workforce.   The  proportion of construction  workers  who  have

obtained Skills Evaluation Certification rose from 12% in  April

this  year  to  16%  in October 1998.  To reduce  the  levy  for

unskilled  construction workers now will undermine the  progress

that  we  have  achieved  in upgrading  the  workforce  and  the

industry.   Instead, we should provide more  incentives  to  the

construction industry to upgrade their workforce by widening the

gap  between  employing  a  skilled  and  an  unskilled  foreign

construction  worker.  That is why we are cutting the  levy  for

the skilled construction workers by another $70.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from productivity consideration, unskilled

foreign  workers  are  the ones most vulnerable  to  abuses  and

malpractices.  We are aware of labour suppliers who collude with

contractors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>

to  cheat ignorant and unskilled foreign workers.  These workers

had  paid  agents  in their home countries  large  fees  on  the

promise of well-paying jobs in Singapore.  Some end up abandoned

without  a  job and accommodation shortly after they  arrive  in

Singapore.  We have already taken various measures such  as  the

introduction of the levy bond early this year and new allocation

formula, to stem such abuses.  If we were to reduce the levy for

unskilled  construction  workers  at  this  juncture,  it  could

encourage  such  malpractice to grow,  bringing  more  unskilled

foreign  workers into Singapore.  And this would result in  more

social and law and order problems for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the hon. Nominated Member, Mr Chuang,

commented  that  the  levy  differential  between  skilled   and

unskilled  foreign workers had led to an unintended side  effect

of   PRC  companies  having  an  unfair  advantage  over   local

construction firms.  I believe I am correct in this  summing  up

of  what  he said.  He said that because many of the workers  on

the  low  levy  are  PRC workers and they are  employed  by  PRC

construction companies which are better able to manage them, and

that has given the PRC companies an advantage in Singapore.   In

other words, our policy has resulted in an uneven playing field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to correct the observation made by the

Nominated  Member, because I do not think that is reflective  of

the  industry  overall.  It may well have happened  that  a  PRC

company  with skilled PRC workers had been able to tender  lower

and  therefore  won some contracts, but I do  not  think  it  is

reflective of the industry as a whole.  Because I would like  to

point  out  that the lower levy applies not only to skilled  PRC

construction workers but also to skilled workers from all  other

sources.  Our records, in fact, show that PRC workers constitute

only  a  minority of the number of construction workers  on  low

levy,  in  other  words, skilled workers.  Most of  the  skilled

workers  on low levy come from Malaysia, our traditional  source

of  supply of skilled workers, as well as other sources such  as

India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar.  Since April this  year

when we lowered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>

the  skilled  worker levy from $200 to $100, there has  been  an

increasing  number  of skilled construction workers  from  these

countries,  particularly from Malaysia, our traditional  source.

When we subsequently implemented the 20% basic skill certificate

requirement  in August of this year, the proportion  of  skilled

workers  from  other sources increased further, as  new  testing

centres were set up in these countries.  Hence, in the last  six

months,  the proportion of PRC construction workers on low  levy

had, in fact, gone down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that the PRC construction

workers  are  not  solely  employed by  PRC  construction  firms

operating  in  Singapore.  Our records  show  that  there  is  a

sizable number of non-PRC construction companies including local

contractors  that  employ  skilled  PRC  workers.   Hence,   PRC

construction  firms do not have an unfair advantage  over  local

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has always actively encouraged construction

companies   to   employ  skilled  foreign   workers.    If   PRC

construction companies had benefited from the low levy, it shows

that  they  have  heeded our advice and  quickly  taken  up  the

initiative to employ more skilled foreign workers and to upgrade

the  skills of their existing workers.  Indeed, there is nothing

to stop local construction companies from doing likewise.  Local

construction companies are, in fact, in a better position to tap

the  pool of skilled construction workers from Malaysia, in view

of  our  historic ties and closer proximity.  They can also  tap

many   other  sources  of  skilled  workers.   It  is  therefore

unfortunate that some local construction firms, for reasons best

known to themselves, have continued to rely on large numbers  of

unskilled foreign workers despite the many efforts by Government

to  encourage  skills upgrading and productivity  gains.   These

companies only have themselves to blame.  I would strongly  urge

construction companies, both local and foreign, to  employ  more

skilled  foreign  workers  or to upgrade  the  skills  of  their

existing workers, not only as a cost cutting measure but also to

raise productivity and standard of the industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contractors should seize this opportunity with the

reduction  on  the  skill levy to employ more  skilled  workers.

They would not only enjoy the substantial savings in levy, about

$440  per  worker  per month, but also benefit from  the  higher

productivity of the skilled workers.  For Singapore as a  whole,

it  would  also be beneficial as social problems are  minimised.

And  this  approach  is consistent with our  long-term  goal  of

reducing  the  number of unskilled foreign construction  workers

and  to  enhancing construction productivity.  We are, in  fact,

conducting a thorough and comprehensive review of how to achieve

this objective under our Construction 21 study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign domestic workers, many Members have spoken

on this subject and many Members have made passionate appeals on

why the foreign domestic worker levy should be reduced.  DPM Lee

yesterday  already  said  that the key  point   in  cutting  the

foreign  worker  levy is to address export competitiveness.   We

are  trying to help employers.  We are trying to help  companies

reduce  cost of production so that their products can sell  well

in  the international market place and, instead of losing market

share,  they can regain lost market share.  The foreign domestic

worker  levy will not have an effect on the competitive position

of  our  industries,  since  the foreign  domestic  workers  are

employed  by  the  households.  The levy  for  foreign  domestic

worker  cannot  be  reduced at this juncture.   However,  as  an

offset,  working mothers will continue to be able  to  claim  or

enjoy  the double tax deduction for the foreign domestic  worker

levy  which  they  pay.   Several Members have  spoken  on  this

earlier.   Dr  Vasoo  has suggested that  during  this  economic

crisis, it is not necessary to use the foreign worker levy as  a

means of moderating the demand for foreign domestic workers.   I

am  afraid that he is wrong on this score because, as it is, the

number  of  foreign  domestic  workers  has  actually  increased

despite  the  economic downturn.  Yes, the rate of  increase  is

lower  now  compared to past years. But the increase shows  that

the demand is still strong.  Hence, we still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>

need  some  measure to moderate this demand to ensure  that  the

number  of  foreign  domestic  workers  does  not  grow  out  of

proportion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the income of most of the households which employ

foreign  domestic workers far exceeds the cost  of  employing  a

foreign  domestic worker, including the levy.  It  is  therefore

unlikely  that the current wage cut in the end-of-year  variable

component  would  seriously  affect the  employment  of  foreign

domestic  workers in many households.  Members may be interested

to  know  that  more  than  80% of the households  which  employ

foreign  domestic  workers have an income exceeding  $4,000  per

month, not including the employer's CPF contribution.  Even with

the 5-8% cut in wages, these households should still be able  to

retain their domestic workers if they want to do so.  There are,

of  course, some marginal cases, whose incomes are lower.  There

are  also  some employers who have been retrenched and  are  now

jobless.   But  I find it difficult to accept that even  jobless

Singaporeans  are  able to continue to enjoy the  service  of  a

foreign domestic worker. We have to be practical.  Losing a  job

means  making  major  adjustment to one's  lifestyle,  including

getting down to domestic chores, if necessary.  Losing a job may

well  require us to make sacrifices in other areas.   We  cannot

continue to assume that whether we have a job or whether we have

a pay increase or not, we should be able to afford and enjoy the

services of foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, cutting the foreign domestic worker levy will in

fact  not  benefit the vast majority of low income families  who

are  not employers of foreign domestic workers.  It is these low

income  families  who are most in need of Government  assistance

and support during this period of downturn.  Government will, in

fact,  introduce other measures to help the low income  families

cope with the wage cut, as announced by DPM Lee yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in November 1997, my Ministry announced that the foreign

domestic worker levy will be adjusted annually.  We announced in

November  last  year  that  we will  make  regular  reviews  and

announce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>

the  changes in November to take effect in the following  April.

In  view of the economic downturn and wage cut proposed for next

year, we have decided to suspend the levy revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the NWC guidelines, DPM Lee has already announced

Government's acceptance of the new NWC guidelines for 5-8%  wage

cut.  Sir, our ability to reach this difficult decision with the

support  of  workers  will  have a major  impact  on  investors'

confidence in Singapore.  It is a strong signal to investors and

employers  that our workers are willing to shoulder their  share

of   the   burden   to   help  companies   retain   their   cost

competitiveness.  This willingness to suffer  a  wage  cut  will

help  many companies to weather the downturn.  It will  preserve

jobs  for  workers and minimise unemployment.  The NWC has  also

recommended that the wage reduction should as far as possible be

effected  through  the variable component of the  flexible  wage

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduced the flexible wage system in the aftermath of the

1985/86  recession, precisely in anticipation  of  the  kind  of

problems  that we are facing today.  Adjustments to the flexible

wage  system  by  cutting variable components  would  have  less

impact on the monthly incomes of workers and should be easier to

shoulder.  I urge the private sector employers to abide  by  the

NWC  recommendations  to  make the  wage  cut  in  the  variable

component.   I  would  also  urge all employers  to  follow  the

Government's  example  and  apply  the  NWC  recommendations  to

moderate the wage cuts for the lower income employees.   Private

sector employers should make a bigger wage cut for higher income

executives and management staff and a smaller cut for the  lower

income   workers.    The  lower  income  employees   have   less

discretionary  income  and  are more likely  to  suffer  greater

difficulty  coping  with  wage  reduction.   Applying  the   NWC

recommendations will help them to better weather this recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also decided to make a cut in the

civil servants' monthly non-pensionable variable payment.   This

monthly variable payment is missing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>

from  the private sector's wage structure.  We should study this

further to see how the private sector can also benefit from such

a monthly variable component to achieve higher responsiveness to

sudden  economic  changes.   Incorporating  a  monthly  variable

component  in the flexible wage system may help to minimise  the

need  for  future  CPF reduction, which is a much  more  drastic

measure  with  wider implications because people have  committed

their  CPF  savings for mortgage repayment and other  long  term

commitments such as insurance policies.  In fact, this has  been

suggested  by Mr Ahmad Magad in his speech yesterday.   We  will

study  this further to see how it can be extended to the private

sector wage structure to allow for greater flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are grappling with the immediate concerns caused by the

regional economic crisis, we must also be aware of the  need  to

build up capabilities and formulate strategies for our long-term

competitiveness.  If we ignore the challenges that globalization

will bring, we will become even more vulnerable in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the CSC's vision of Singapore as an advanced

and  knowledge-based economy provides a sound basis  for  us  to

plan  our manpower development.  My Ministry supports the  CSC's

two-pronged  approach  to  developing a  world-class  workforce:

firstly,   to  maximize  the  full  potential  of  the  domestic

workforce;  and secondly, to attract foreign talent  to  enhance

our capabilities and competitiveness.

<br><br><i>Maximize the full potential of domestic manpower</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to maximizing the full potential of domestic

manpower, my Ministry is working closely with the Ministries of

Education and Trade and Industry, economic agencies like the

Productivity and Standards Board and Economic Development Board,

as well as industry partners, to develop a lifelong learning

system in Singapore. This system is critical to maintaining the

currency and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>

competitiveness  of  Singapore's  workforce.  It  would  provide

opportunities  and  support  for every  Singaporean  to  undergo

lifelong  learning  for their continued employability.  In  this

system,  the  stakeholders  are employers,  public  and  private

training providers, unions and community organizations  and,  of

course, the workers themselves.   Everyone will play an enhanced

role  in  supporting  the in-employment training  needs  of  our

workforce.   Additional  funding  will  be  allocated  and   new

learning  initiatives will be developed to  encourage  employers

and  workers to engage in lifelong learning.  A national  skills

recognition system will be established to recognize and  certify

in-employment  skills  acquisition.  New  training  technologies

will be harnessed to support this endeavour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kick-start the process of lifelong learning for continued

employability, two national programmes have been put  in  place.

These  are  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP)  and  the

Critical  Enabling Skills for Training (CREST).  Training  under

SRP  leads  to  national skills certification and  every  worker

trained  is placed with a job, either with his existing employer

or  a  prospective new employer.  This ensures that the training

is  immediately relevant.  SRP has been progressing  well  since

its  launch  in  December 1996, as I have  informed  this  House

yesterday.   A  total of about 190 companies have  committed  to

skill certifying more than 10,500 workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, the Government committed an additional $20

million to developing a Skills Development Centre to improve the

training  infrastructure  to support training  activities  under

SRP.   I  am glad to say that the Skills Development Centre  has

already started taking in trainees in November this year.  CREST

is  a  $200  million programme launched by the Productivity  and

Standards  Board.  It is aimed at encouraging the  workforce  to

acquire  core  skills,  which will provide  the  foundation  for

skills  upgrading in all occupations and sectors.  These  skills

are  important in achieving a thinking, learning and  innovative

workforce.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the on-going Manpower 21 planning exercise will study the

recommendations   of   the  CSC  which  pertains   to   manpower

development.    Apart  from  establishing  a  national  lifelong

learning system, the Manpower 21 Committee will be looking  into

how  we  can  enhance  the  workplace environment,  upgrade  the

manpower industry structure, and harness international talent to

ensure  that  the  capabilities of our workforce  remain  a  key

competitive  advantage for Singapore in  the  next  century.  We

should  have detailed proposals from the Committee by the middle

of next year.

<br><br><i>Enhance the attractiveness of Singapore to foreign talent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign talent, Government agrees with the importance of

tapping into global sources of talent to sharpen our competitive

edge  and  overcome  our manpower constraints.   Foreign  talent

combined with a highly skilled local workforce will enable us to

transit smoothly and rapidly into a knowledge economy.  They can

help  us to raise our attractiveness to more MNCs to locate  key

knowledge operations in Singapore and thus enhance our  economic

value-added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore evolves into a knowledge economy, the key

determinants  of  success will be the skills,  capabilities  and

innovativeness  of  our workers.  Increasing global  competition

will put a premium on skilled workers. We will develop our home-grown talent fully with a new strategic manpower blueprint under

the  Manpower  21 planning effort.  At the same  time,  we  must

augment local talent with a flow of international talent.   This

will  provide Singapore with the enhanced capacity  to  generate

high  value added activities which is in tune with the knowledge

era.  Examples of such high-value added activities are the areas

of  e-commerce, wireless communications, automotive  components,

pharmaceuticals  and  chemical industries, where  our  companies

today  still find themselves short of IT and engineering talent,

despite the current economic downturn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must be prepared for the new global competition and

change  our  mindset  and  mode of operations  accordingly.  Our

vision  of Singapore as a globally competitive knowledge economy

and  a world-class workforce has scope for home-grown talent  to

realize their full potential. It will also serve as a magnet  to

attract   international  talent  to  participate  in  the   many

challenging  opportunities  which are  unfolding  with  the  new

economic re-positioning of Singapore.  With an augmented  talent

pool we are in a better position to expand our economic pie  and

have  more gains to be shared by all. We need to grow our  stock

of  talent  to excel in the competition which would  be  brought

about  in  the  future. My Ministry will adopt  a  comprehensive

approach  to  developing  our  own  manpower  as  well  as   the

recruitment of international talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges

because of the current downturn.  Attracting foreign talents  to

Singapore  is one aspect which can be easily swept aside  during

this  period of rising unemployment.  But if we do so,  we  will

only  hamper  the growth in new businesses and industries  which

could play a major role in speeding up recovery.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the region recovers from the current economic crisis,

there will be intense competition for talent.  We must not  wait

for this to happen and then set out to attract our fair share of

talent.   In  fact,  we must try to attract our  fair  share  of

talent  now and take advantage of the inherent strength  in  our

economy  to attract talent at this juncture so as to stay  ahead

in   this  race  and  to  better  position  ourselves  for   the

competition in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recession we are experiencing is a consequence of the

regional  problems.  But we must act firmly  and  positively  to

deal  with  the  new  economic  conditions.   We  have  to  make

adjustments,  including  those  that  are  painful.   The  CSC's

recommendations to cut business costs, including wage cost, is a

sound and viable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>

approach  to  cope  with the loss of competitiveness.   However,

cost-cutting measures alone will not ensure that Singapore would

remain  competitive.  In the longer term, it is the  creativity,

capability,  productivity and enterprise of  Singaporeans  which

will  determine  whether  we  will prosper  in  an  increasingly

competitive  global environment.  As long as our  employers  and

companies,  trade  unions and workers  continue  to  strive  for

productivity improvement and skills upgrading, we need not fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through tripartite cooperation and support, we have been able to

implement cost-cutting measures to overcome the economic  crisis

in  the  1985/86  recession.  Given the  close  partnership  and

strong co-operation between workers, employers and Government, I

am  confident that we will again be able to work hand-in-hand as

a  Singapore  team to meet the challenges ahead,  and  help  our

economy recover speedily from the present crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Clarification from the

Minister,  Sir.   I  have two clarifications.   Can  I  ask  the

Minister, out of the 20,000 workers retrenched, how many of them

are  Singaporeans?  The other is the figure given by Mr  Cyrille

Tan in his speech in this House.  He said that there are 600,000

foreign  workers  in  Singapore.   And  the  Minister  has  just

mentioned that there are only 450,000.  There is a difference of

150,000  between  the figures of the union and  the  Government.

Which is correct?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first nine

months  of  this year, about 20,000 workers had been retrenched.

Overall,  when  companies retrench their workers, they  retrench

them  in the proportion of their workforce.  Companies that have

more  foreign workers will retrench in proportion to the profile

of  their workforce.  So out of that 20,000, on average,  it  is

about  70:30, because that is the typical profile of the foreign

workforce in most manufacturing and service sector

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>

companies.   So  foreign workers will constitute  about  30%  of

those who were retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of foreign workers in Singapore,

my figure obviously would be a more reliable figure.  It is more

than 450,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

In  view  of  the economic downturn, wage cut and  unemployment,

will  the Ministry revise downwards the threshold for employment

pass applications?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in September this year we

introduced a new work pass framework, PQR framework, whereby the

top  talent  would  be under the "P" work  passes  and  "R"  for

restricted,  before the lower skilled workers.  The  "Q"  passes

would  be for the in-between grades of talents that we  need  in

Singapore.   It is a very flexible system.  Although  there  are

wage  criteria such as $2,000 for a "Q" pass or employment pass,

we  are  prepared  to  look  at the background  or  the  working

experience and qualifications of a particular worker and  decide

which  particular pass to grant to the foreigner.   So  in  this

case, there is no necessity to further revise the wage criteria,

because  we  have sufficient flexibility within  the  system  to

cater to the needs of employers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  whether he has got any plans for skills  training

for  the  foreign workers, because they form quite a substantial

workforce  and  some  of  them are educated  but  they  are  not

equipped in English language?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if an employer wants to send

his   foreign  worker  for  training,  we  will  look  into  the

particular training requirement.  In many instances, it can also

be supported.  But, of course, in the context of the work permit

holders, the unskilled and semi-skilled workers, it will  be  so

much better if the employers make a special effort and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>

recruit  skilled  workers  from abroad,  rather  than  bring  in

unskilled  workers here to be trained.  That is why my  Ministry

has  encouraged  the construction industry to  take  up  private

initiative  to set up skill assessment centres in  our  overseas

sources  of  foreign  workers  -  China,  Thailand,  Bangladesh,

Myanmar.   The purpose is for them to screen the applicants  for

work  permits who want to come to Singapore to find out who  are

the  skilled workers and then bring them to Singapore.  I  think

that  is  a  far  better  approach than  to  bring  hundreds  of

thousands of unskilled workers into Singapore and then set about

trying  to  train  them to upgrade their  skills.   The  skilled

workers  are available out there.  Go out there and recruit  the

skilled workers.  It is far cheaper that way, more effective and

efficient for business.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  CSC has made a Report  on  the  economy  of

Singapore  in the past and it has also made recommendations  for

our  present and future economy.  It is a rational look  at  our

economy and I endorse the view of the Committee and also support

the recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking into the past, the Committee made use of the

assessment  of  Singapore's competitiveness by various  economic

consultancy agencies, and it came to the conclusion that if  not

due  to  the  currency turmoil, Singapore's competitiveness  was

ranked  very  high.  We all know that Singapore is not  a  cheap

place.   In  terms of wages, rentals and cost of living,  it  is

quite  high.   So  we  are  able  to,  in  spite  of  all  these

circumstances, maintain our competitiveness in a higher rank, as

stated in the Report, because of the qualitative factors.  It is

because  we have political stability, we have tripartism  and  a

high  degree  of  transparency and pro-business  policies.   The

announced cost cutting package by DPM Lee is the result of  this

qualitative factor in our competitive capability as mentioned in

the Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is a country marching towards a

developed status.  Our cost of production cannot be compared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>

those    in   Indonesia,   Philippines   and   Malaysia.     Our

competitiveness will go through economic transformation  towards

a   knowledge-based  economy  and  strengthen  the   qualitative

factors.   At  the  moment,  in this regional  currency  crisis,

because of the realignment and depreciation of currencies in the

region,  our competitiveness is affected.  So for the short-term

strategies,  the  Report  has already made  recommendations  for

cutting  wages and CPF.  I think these should only be short-term

measures.    When   our  economy  recovers  and  competitiveness

regains,  all these should gradually be restored.  I  hope  that

the  management  will be able to make use of these  cost-cutting

measures  to revive their competitiveness and to increase  their

sales  and market share, so as to help the Singapore economy  to

recover as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in the public debate in cost cutting, the people and

the  unions  have already expressed their support for tripartism

and  they  have  accepted the wage cut and CPF  cut.   But  some

managements have asked for excessive demands.  They  have  asked

for  pay cuts by 30% and some hope that the pay, especially that

of  the  graduates,  be  reduced  to  those  prevailing  in  the

Philippines,  Malaysia and Indonesia.  These are  excessive  and

unreasonable demands and taking advantage of the situation.   As

a  result, the people may doubt their management's sincerity  in

tripartism.   In  my  view, the wage cuts  must  be  within  the

bearable level of the workers.  For those companies that are not

viable  after  these significant cost cutting  measures,  in  my

view, the problems they have are beyond what the Government  and

the  workers  could help.  If that is the case, we should  allow

these non-viable companies to wind up, so that the resources can

be  diverted to the viable companies.  Over the long term,  this

will be better for our workers and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of costs, apart from wages, I think there are

other charges such as Government charges, cost due to Government

policies,  efficiency  in production  and  rentals.   On  wages,

whether we like it or not, it must rise according to the  higher

standard of living,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>

higher standard of education, as well as the progress in society

and  a  higher  value  added economy.  This  is  inevitable.   A

society's progress must bring about a better income and a better

life.   This is progress and advancement of a country that  will

bring  benefits  to the people and that is why we  are  able  to

motivate our people to work harder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look over the past 10 years, the average wage in 1986 was

$1,140 per month per capita, and this has increased to $2,219 in

1995.   This  is an increase of 100%, averaging about  7.2%  per

annum.   If  we  go  by  GDP,  the value-added  per  worker  has

increased  from $32,000 in 1986 to about $71,000 in 1995.   That

means  over a period of 10 years, there is an increase  of  8.2%

per  annum.   If we compare the 7.2% wage increase and  GDP  per

worker  increase of 8.2%, then the average annual wage  increase

over the past 10 years of 7.2% is not unacceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to maintain our competitive edge and to satisfy the

desire  of  workers  to improve their standard  of  living,  our

economy   must,  as  stated  in  the  Report,  go  through   the

transformation  process towards a knowledge-based  economy  with

better  training  of workers,  better education,  more  creative

innovations  and  entrepreneurship, so that  we  can  reach  for

higher value-added of new products.  This strategy for wage  cut

is  one  measure that we have proposed to tide over the  present

difficulties.   After this storm, we should be able  to  restore

the wages and improve the quality of living of our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental is an important component in the cost of operation.

Yesterday, I went to a coffeeshop in my constituency.   I  spent

60 cents on a cup of black coffee.  I made a simple calculation.

How  much  does  rental cost impact on the price  of  a  cup  of

coffee?  I found that it accounts for about one-sixth, that  is,

about 19% of the price.  Rentals have been rising for many years

in  Singapore.   For  one particular year  from  1994  to  1995,

rentals for factories, offices and warehouses have increased  by

about 45% to 50%.  Such a huge increase in rent affects the cost

of  operation significantly.  The ups and downs of  rentals  are

caused by supply and demand situation and also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>

speculation.   I am glad to note the Government is dealing  with

the over-supply of properties and the downward trend in property

prices.   On the one hand, the Government is sympathetic towards

the developers and it has given them property tax rebates, allow

them  a  longer  time to complete their projects  and  free  the

Government  land  sales,  but insists  on  the  anti-speculation

measures  in property announced in 1996.  The Government  should

monitor very closely the price trends in our property market and

continue to adopt the anti-speculation strategies, so that  when

it   reaches the bottom we should start releasing lands to  meet

the  demand.  By doing so, we will be able to avoid this  sudden

rise and fall of rentals, thereby affecting our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, it was announced that, in response to the one-third

drop  in  land price in the past one year,  all rentals  of  JTC

industrial  properties would be cut between 20%  and  40%.   HDB

will  also  cut  their  rentals for  industrial  and  commercial

premises by about 20%.  Unfortunately, JTC offers an increase of

about  4%  of  the rentals per annum for those who asked  for  a

fixed  rental  rate.  I think this will give a false  impression

that future rentals will move upwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Government measures could also cause some cost increases.

For instance, take the construction industry as an example.   In

the  case  of  shortage  in  supply of  labour,  the  compulsory

requirement  for  safety  officers  and  resident  engineers  at

worksites will add to the cost, because companies have to employ

a  lot of non-productive employees at higher than market prices.

The  Report  also referred to low productivity in  the  building

industry.  It was suggested that prefabricated concept  be  used

to  increase  productivity.  I think the  authorities  concerned

should  look  into  this very seriously to  understand  why  the

prefabricated   building  process  has   cost   more   and   the

prefabrication factories are unable to survive before going in a

big

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>

way   for  the  prefabrication  concept.   Misunderstanding  the

situation  will  only add to cost and it is  not  good  for  our

building industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Government measures are closely related to

cost.  We have to ensure that our policies are pro-business.   I

think  it is the only way to go.  With the cost-cutting  package

announced  yesterday,  I am sure the wage  earner's  ability  to

spend  will  be  lowered.  The businessmen will benefit.   I  am

concerned  about those businesses who are providing services  to

our  domestic  market, like the shops, transport  services,  and

hawker  stalls.   How are they going to provide better  services

and cheaper goods? This is very important.  Last week, in one of

the  programmes on radio, some hawkers were interviewed.  Nobody

agreed  or  intended to cut down their prices.  If that  is  the

case, the Government should also consider how we can plough back

the  benefits  from the cost cutting measures  to  our  ordinary

citizens  so that they will also benefit.  One way is to  ensure

that  these rebates are not automatic.  They must apply  for  it

and  show how they are going to reduce prices before the rebates

are  given.   In  this way, when the cost-cutting  measures  are

implemented, our consumers can also get some benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the CSC Report and the announcement of cost cutting

measures   yesterday,   no  mention  was   made   to   high-tech

agriculture.  I think this industrial sector should also benefit

from  the  rental  reduction  from  the  PPD  and  property  tax

reduction from the land office so that they will be able to  cut

their  costs  and  make their products more competitive  in  the

international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, during the good times, we want to clamour for the five Cs - car, condominium, credit cards, career and cash.  Yesterday,  we

saw  DPM Lee giving away five Cs in not so good times, in  terms

of    cash,    care,   career,   credibility    and,    finally,

competitiveness.  Let me try and respond in this manner.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Cash. I think the real cost reduction package is much

welcomed  to  businesses.  There is certainly  no  bail-out,  no

company  buy-outs.   Those who ask for  handouts  are  certainly

disappointed.  But I agree with the DPM that the question is not

how  much more we should give now, but whether there is more  to

give if the situation worsens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Care. I am happy that the package contains measures and

rebates to help the lower income groups to ease the pain of wage

reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Career. I am happy with the Minister for Manpower and the

DPM  for stating that the package, hopefully, will kick in  fast

to  save  jobs.   The  Minister for  Manpower  has  demonstrated

commitment  of the Government to retrain workers and  help  them

find  jobs.  I hope, given the cost reduction, employers  remain

committed to train their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Credibility. The reduction in Government charges and pay

cuts of Government Ministers and civil servants, in my view, are

equitable and proportionate, if seen as a whole.  I would  think

that the Minister's salary would be affected two years from  now

if  the  formula takes place.  But any kind gesture is welcomed.

I  can  only assure the Minister that what he gives in cash,  he

gets more than equal measure in credibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Competitiveness. I think we expect more measures to come in

the  coming  budget.   But  I urge, and  I  think  I  have  some

commitment  that the CSC mechanism can be made part  of  an  on-going process to make sure that we remain competitive now and in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on a few other long-term strategic

recommendations covered by the CSC.  I am quite pleased that the

Committee  comprises  many people in  the  private  sector.   It

demonstrates  the importance of a healthy state of participation

and   consultation   in  decision-making   in   Singapore   from

experienced   and  expert  people  in  the  industry.    Without

participation,   any  attempt  to  critically  examine   current

policies and strategies will be futile

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>

because  it is not only difficult to persuade workers to  accept

the  painful  wage cuts, it may also turn out to be a  worthless

paper  exercise.  If every citizen matters, we must also  accept

the  value, suggestions or inputs of every Singaporean.   But  I

really   wonder  how  much  of  this  model  of  private  sector

participation  is  present at the implementation  level  in  the

Ministries and statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report quite rightly observed that the current economic

crisis  highlighted the importance of Government as  a  business

facilitator.  But it should go beyond just being the  regulatory

authority  and  providing the environment that is  conducive  to

business.   It  should also promote prudent and  sound  business

practices and initiate change as an ongoing process.   Take  the

case  of  JTC,  for  example, where  the  minimum  criteria  for

investment in building, civil and machinery run counter  to  the

preference  and  practices of many businesses.   Why  invest  in

brick and mortar that do not generate income or not vital to the

operating   requirements   of  businesses,   compared   to   the

investments in people, plant and machinery and technology?   Why

use the price mechanism to control design of buildings?  Are the

architects  not supposed to do that?  We should instead  support

industrialists  who can extract the maximum return  for  minimum

investment.   Industrialists  can  provide  the  greatest  value

adding  potential.  But this requires private sector  experience

which,  I  believe,  is  quite  lacking  at  certain  levels  of

Government.   Perhaps, as a long-term strategy,  the  Government

can try seconding some of its officers to the private sector and

encourage more recruitment from the private sector to the  civil

service  and  statutory boards.  Otherwise, we  will  hear  more

calls for committees and commissions.  True, I think we need  to

relook and re-examine our regionalisation process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the CSC's recommendations to extend our external wing.

We  need  to  go global.  But we need to critically examine  our

past efforts at regionalisation and our cooperative efforts with

Malaysia,  Indonesia, China and India where we  have  presumably

had the best chance of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>

success  in  exporting our software, the Singapore's recipe  for

success.  What can we learn from these challenges?  How  can  we

share  with other Singapore companies?  What happens to guan  xi

in  China?  Should we remain engaged in these regions or try  to

diversify our very limited resources globally?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fear, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the crisis may have exposed

the  myth  about our relevance and understanding  of  our  Asian

neighbours  that we are the best partners or agents for  western

companies who want to invest in the region.  What the crisis had

shown  perhaps is that Asia is indeed very diverse.   Sometimes,

we  really  have  very little common with a  Thai,  Filipino  or

Cambodian   as  would  an  American  or  European.   We   behave

differently.  We do not speak the same language.  And sometimes,

some  of our neighbours are not so quite friendly with us.   But

we really need to examine this and maximise our similarities and

make  ourselves more relevant to the region.  We can do a number

of  things  to  ensure that we really are the best  hub  in  the

region,  not only in terms of geography, but in our  ability  to

work  with our neighbours and friends.  For example, having more

Asian  students studying and working in the country,  increasing

exchange  at all levels of society and Government and  introduce

the  teaching  of Asian languages and cultures in our  education

system  and allowing more access of the Asian media, both  print

and  broadcast, into Singapore.  We want to be relevant to Asia.

But we must first ensure that Asia, its people, culture, history

and language are all relevant to everyone of us here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must not lose sight and be distracted by the cost

competitiveness  alone  as  we  benchmark  against   the   newly

industrialised  economies.  We must attract higher  value  added

operations to locate in Singapore and try to invite more foreign

talents to this country.  But the qualitative factors that  help

to  make  Singapore livable becomes also increasingly important.

Competitiveness  includes more human dimensions,  such  as  good

schools, vibrant entertainment,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>

pollution-free  environment and the  intellectual  and  creative

stimulation, the buzz that is present in any global  city.   For

example, if we want to develop Singapore into a media hub, it is

essential that we have a media into and out of Singapore that is

accessible, affordable and convenient, that is not unnecessarily

obstructive.   This  would  mean  easier  access  to  Government

information  and an intellectual environment that  protects  and

values   expression,  disagreement  and  exchange,  though   not

necessarily  dissent, and an active civil society and  a  strong

people's sector.  In other words, Singapore is not only  a  home

for Singaporeans but a much desired destination for foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Minister for Manpower touched on foreign talent.

While  it  is appropriate to expect Singaporeans, including  top

level  executives, to make the symbolic sacrifice  in  difficult

times,  we  have  to  be careful that these do  not  affect  our

attempts  to  attract foreign talent that is perhaps  even  more

necessary now to boost competitiveness.  They may not come  here

if  the  total package of remuneration is inferior to what  they

get  elsewhere.  We must be careful and ensure that  we  do  not

single them out for not willing to bear the same sacrifices that

we, as Singaporeans, shoulder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, SMEs. The crisis has shown a trend for greater

orientation  towards Europe and America in the way they  conduct

business.   Not  only in terms of markets, but global  MNCs  now

require suppliers to adopt corporate discipline and values  that

are  consistent with their attitudes, for example,  the  respect

for   intellectual   property,  labour   rights,   environmental

concerns,  free from graft and corruption, absence  of  age  and

gender  discrimination.  If we want to go global and be a  major

partner  to  European  and  American  companies,  SMEs  must  be

assisted to help them deal with some of these issues which  many

SMEs  may otherwise consider an unnecessary intrusion into their

business affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the recommendations of the CSC and

compliment the efforts of the CSC but also urge that the efforts

they put in be made part of an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>

ongoing  process.   We  have  heard  calls  for  reformation  in

Singapore.   I  hope we have similar reformation in  wanting  to

change mindsets and to ensure that we have to place whatever  it

takes to put our economy back on track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the Minister

for Trade and Industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, consensus building requires trust and patience.  To foreign

observers,  the package of cost cutting measures recommended  by

the  CSC  and the reconvened NWC is remarkable, because  we  are

able  to reach a consensus on cutting wage costs - no less  than

$7.5  billion  of  it.  And we have reached  this  consensus  so

smoothly, it seems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is reaching this consensus an easy matter? Well, just look at

Hong Kong.  You cannot find a better example of a market economy

than  Hong  Kong.  The employers know what to do, but  can  they

effect it?  Hong Kong Telecom has been unable to make its  bonus

payment  flexible,  linking  payment  to  earnings,  let   alone

implement a wage cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is not a command economy, as some Hong Kong officials seem

to  think,  as  reported in Asiaweek.  Ours is  a  system  where

political   and   trade  union  leaders  have  to   face   their

constituents in election by secret ballot at regular intervals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fortunate in this downturn to have leaders in the

NTUC  and  the  unions who went through the  1985/86  recession.

From  that experience, they know that effective medicine  for  a

severe    illness   tastes   bitter.    They    are    therefore

psychologically prepared for tough measures in this downturn and

this time, the measures are in fact more severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985/86, we cut wage costs from the employers'

contribution  to CPF.  It was a cut in savings for  the  future.

For  the  vast majority, disposable income was not cut -  as  we

adopted a wage freeze, and not a wage cut.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, we have gone beyond cutting savings for the

future.  Not only are we cutting employers' contribution to CPF,

but  we  are  also  cutting disposable income.  Fortunately,  we

have,  since  the last recession, put in place a  flexible  wage

system.   It  allows  us to cut wage costs by  cutting  bonuses,

which is less painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a question was asked yesterday: why is it necessary

to  state  how much we should cut wage cost?  Mr Low asked  that

question.  It is a matter of fairness.  Workers are prepared  to

do  their part, accept wage cuts to restore our competitiveness,

but  they need to know how much is really needed.  So first,  we

have  to know how much we have lost in competitiveness.   If  we

assess  that we need to cut costs by 15%, then workers would  be

prepared  to accept a 15% cut in wage costs.  If we do not  have

such a figure, how are our workers to know that what an employer

wants to cut is fair?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round, we have had to depend largely on figures provided by

the Government.  One indicator has been the relative unit labour

cost,  a  comparison  of  our  wage  cost  with  selected  Asian

competitors.  Another indicator has been the weighted change  in

currency realignments, or effective exchange rate.  Both pointed

to something close to 15% to 20% range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, figures provided by employers have been grossly

inadequate.   When  I  mentioned this publicly,  some  employers

reacted  indignantly, saying that for over a year already,  they

have said that Singapore has lost competitiveness, and cost cuts

were  needed.   They protested that they have  even  raised  the

matter  in  Parliament.  Yes, employers have  mostly  asked  for

cuts,  ranging  from  5%  to 30%, but without  providing  cross-country  comparisons on cost items.  This is an example of  what

unionists  mean  when  they complain of a  lack  of  information

sharing.   Fortunately, some employers have provided information

of   cost   differentials  from  their  factories  in  different

locations, but privately.  Some of them provided the figures  to

us at NTUC, some to EDB and MTI.  And these were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>

individual employers.  The figures they provided have allowed us

to gauge whether the macro figures were largely correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not raise this now to re-open the exchange. Rather,

we should learn from this experience.  Employers must appreciate

that we have a better-educated, more discerning workforce.  They

expect greater transparency from employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to establish a number, one which, to the best of

our  ability, we think is right.  It then becomes the guide  for

actual   settlements  at  the  workplace.   We   should   expect

negotiations  at  the workplace - so some  cuts  will  be  more,

others  less  than  15%.   There will  be  negotiations  at  the

workplace  and  employers cannot take it for granted  that  just

because  we have reached this national consensus, that  this  is

something that will be effected without further discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a company is unionised, I am confident that union

leaders  will settle with management rationally, and  they  will

see  to  it that the cuts are fair to the workers.  In the  last

few  months, we have had a lot of discussions within  the  union

movement.   After several rounds of discussions, I  reported  to

the  Prime  Minister and DPM that they need not worry about  the

unionised  sector, but they should be concerned  with  the  non-unionised sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have a figure, which we make public now, how

are  non-unionised workers to know whether the  wage  cut  their

employers  are asking for is fair?  Granted management  in  non-unionised  companies can effect any cuts they deem necessary  as

their  employees have little choice, but what about  the  social

discontent generated?  To face this downturn, social cohesion is

important, as many Members of this House have said.  Naming  the

figure  of  15% is thus necessary to serve as the benchmark  for

all, and remember we have the figure of 30% mentioned once again

in this House in the past two days even after we have reached  a

national consensus in the National Wages Council!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move to implementing the wage cuts company by

company,  let  us not forget to maintain fairness.   The  public

sector  has shown the way.  The cuts in public sector  pay  that

Deputy  Prime  Minister announced yesterday was reached  through

discussions between the Public Service Division and  the  public

sector  unions.  The final figures were agreed to only yesterday

morning.   I  hope  private  sector employers  will  follow  the

example  of  the public sector -  cutting more at  the  top  and

minimising the cuts to low income workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot have escaped the attention of employers that

higher  income civil servants are taking a cut in  monthly  pay,

through   the  monthly  variable  component.   Since  the   last

recession,  the  public  sector  has  consciously  developed   a

flexible   wage  system,  which  includes  a  monthly   variable

component.  It is made up of unconsolidated NWC wage increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the private sector had been as attentive in wage

administration  as the public sector has been,  they  too  would

have  a substantial monthly variable component by now.  It would

not  have  increased  wage  costs, since  the  monthly  variable

component is taken out of a total amount of wage increase agreed

to  under  the  ambit  of  the NWC,  as  a  consequence  of  NWC

recommendations.  When I suggested recently that we should build

up  a  variable monthly component in private sector pay systems,

the   reaction  from  employers  showed  a  singular   lack   of

understanding.  It shows how poorly they have paid attention  to

wage  administration.  Some were guarded in their reaction,  but

others  almost condemned it!  I hope they will now study closely

how   the  public  sector  has  managed  its  wage  system,  and

understand  how they too can build flexibility into  their  wage

systems.  Just as we learnt from the last recession and  put  in

place  a  flexi  wage  system, so too must we  learn  from  this

recession  and  refine our wage system so as to  better  meet  a

future  recession.  I hope it will not happen  but  as  business

cycles go, we know that it will come sooner or later.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the welfare of workers and their families depends on

employment. Employment, however, depends on companies  remaining

viable.  Therefore, the top priority of any Government or  union

in  an  economic  downturn must be to ensure that  workers  stay

employed.   If that requires wages to be cut, we will  cut.   We

have  done so in 1985/86 and we are doing it again.  This  shows

how flexible and responsible unions are in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tripartite understanding we have developed is a

valuable  asset  which we must maintain.  It depends  on  trust.

Each  party  must  play its part to maintain  that  trust.   The

objective  of  this  cost cutting package is to  keep  companies

viable,  restore  their  competitiveness,  so  that  they   will

continue  to provide jobs for their workers.  Labour is  playing

its part by agreeing to wage cost cuts.  Now employers must play

theirs.   No doubt some retrenchments are unavoidable - even  in

boom  times some companies have to retrench.  However, we expect

the  numbers to be reduced.  I am glad that some companies  have

shelved retrenchment plans, because of the cost-cutting package.

We  have got this information privately.  We respect the wish of

these  companies to remain anonymous, but we are glad that  they

are acting responsibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is pleased that two employer groups - the

Singapore   National  Employers  Federation  and  the  Singapore

Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry - have come  out

with  a  five-point action plan to explore new markets,  develop

new  capabilities, boost productivity, help the  unemployed  and

implement the wage cuts fairly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some economists have commented that the cost-cutting

package  does  not address the demand side of the equation.   As

two-thirds of demand is external, what we can do is to lower our

costs,  so  that our exports are competitive.  This is precisely

what  we  have  done.  What more can we do?  Both the  SNEF  and

SFCCI  have  said  they  will be more active  in  exploring  new

markets.  If we can improve on our export performance,  then  we

will  recover.  This, in turn, will pull up the domestic  sector

which seems to be a focus of speakers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>

earlier  this  afternoon.  When we recover, there will  be  more

demand   for  offices,  factories  and  homes,  and   help   the

construction  sector.  I hope that NMP, Mr  Chuang,  understands

that  the  measures help him downstream.  Some of  the  measures

help  construction  companies immediately but  the  full  effect

comes  downstream when we have recovered.  So, also  the  retail

sector.   When  we recover, and the people have  more  money  to

spend,  then  the  recovery  comes.   And  I  hope  the  present

difficulties will spur the construction industry and the  retail

industry  to  finally  do  something  about  the  appalling  low

productivity in both sectors and in the case of the construction

industry, its heavy reliance on unskilled foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my colleague, Mr Lim Swee Say, said yesterday, let

us  forget about painless solutions.  There will be pain.  It is

not  only  poor  company bottom lines, it is also  unemployment.

Though  unemployment has risen, we are fortunate that there  are

still   jobs   available  and  still  adequate.   Although   the

Employment  Service Department of the Ministry of  Manpower  has

more  workers  seeking  jobs than vacancies,  it  is  not  truly

reflective  of the employment market.  The service  provided  is

purely  voluntary.  Not all employers register  their  vacancies

with  the  Ministry of Manpower, notwithstanding  the  proactive

efforts  of the Ministry to seek out those employers  that  have

jobs.   Not  all the unemployed register either.  We know  there

are  companies  still complaining that they  cannot  get  enough

Singaporean  workers,  and many sectors have  large  numbers  of

foreign  workers.   In fact, in my meet-the-people  sessions,  I

still  get  employers coming to me saying that they  cannot  get

workers and asking the Ministry of Manpower to approve the  work

permits.  Provided workers are flexible in their choice of jobs,

they  can  find a job.  Of course, the performance of  the  job-matching  efforts can be improved.  And we will  do  so  through

tripartite effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I must point out that older workers find

it  harder  to  find a job.  Some say that older workers  expect

higher  pay.   Yes,  this  is  one  reason.    They  have   more

commitments, but they will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>

adjust.   What  I think is an equally difficult problem  is  the

attitude  of employers towards older workers.  A mindset  change

is  needed.   So  I  call on employers to give older  workers  a

chance, and I hope the employers' organisations will do more  to

persuade their members to give older workers a chance.   I  know

that many have expressed concern over low income workers out  of

work.   But  I  think, today, there is also a  very  significant

problem  of  the better educated executives who lose their  jobs

and who find it difficult to find re-employment.  So I hope that

they too will be given a chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is natural that the focus of Members has been on

restoring our competitiveness.  Most Members have focused on the

current  business cost problem.  Few have touched on the future,

except  perhaps the speakers earlier today.  But that  forms  an

important part of the CSC Report.  The CSC recommendations  also

map  out  the  future  we want.  It is a  future  based  on  the

knowledge  economy,  of creating higher  value,  which  in  turn

provides workers with higher pay and not lower pay.  Our  future

does not lie in keeping our wage costs down to the same level as

our  neighbours.  Our ambition has always been  to  create  more

wealth  per  person, to give our people a better life  than  our

neighbours.  That is why our wage levels are now higher.  If  we

succeed  in  moving  into a knowledge economy,  let  us  not  be

surprised that our wages will be even higher, compared with  our

neighbors.   But the important thing is this higher  wage  level

must  be  supported  by the higher wealth we  create;  in  other

words, by higher productivity overall and that is what we aim to

do.   Unfortunately,  because of the pressing  problems  of  the

downturn,  there has not been adequate discussion and debate  in

this House on the other recommendations of the CSC Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that over the next few months, we

will  have  more  opportunity in this House  to  debate  on  the

various  recommendations that have been set out.   Now  that  we

have settled what we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>

should  do,  let  us go forward, implement the wage  cuts,  pull

together  as  one  nation and come out of  this  as  quickly  as

possible and then move forward into the knowledge economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek clarification

from  the  Minister  without  Portfolio?   In  his  speech,   he

mentioned that there is a need to announce a percentage cut as a

guideline, so that non-unionised workers will know how much  cut

is   reasonable.   What  about  some  employers  who  take  this

guideline as an opportunity to cut, even though the company  may

still be competitive and there is no need to cut?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is: why is there a need to mandate

a  10%  cut  in  CPF?   Why not leave it to  the  company  as  a

guideline for a cut in wages rather than a CPF cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, what happens if a non-unionised

employer takes advantage?  I think a non-unionised employer  has

to  act responsibly.  While there may be no effective monitoring

system to prevent such abuse, if such employers are shortsighted

and take advantage, what would be the cost?  I think unhappiness

within their companies and a breakdown of trust between employee

and  employer.  When the recovery comes, people will  vote  with

their  feet.   So whilst we may not have an effective  check  on

such employers, I think it is prudent to sound out a warning  to

them that if they do so, it is to their own cost in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards why it is necessary to mandate a 10% CPF cut, if

we  want to touch the CPF, it is a blunt instrument.  If  we  do

not want to mandate a cut across the board, then we have to rely

on  cuts purely on the wage system.  I think that burden will be

too high for our workers to bear.  So if we have to cut part  of

it  from  the CPF, then we have to mandate this 10% cut  in  the

CPF.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. How about

cutting the employee's contribution in CPF so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>

they   can  tide  over  the  period  and  allow  companies   the

flexibility  to  decide  on  the  correct  percentage  of   wage

deduction that will make them competitive, rather than a mandate

across  the  board  of  a 10% CPF cut, whether  the  company  is

profitable or competitive, it is a 10% CPF cut?  Give some money

back  to  the  workers and allow companies some  flexibility  in

deciding.  Do you not think this would be a better alternative?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, this has also been explained by the

Minister  for Manpower.  The focus is on reducing costs  to  the

employer.   That is why we cut the employer's CPF  contribution,

and  not  the employee's.   Give money back to the employees  by

cutting   the  employee's  contribution  and  give   them   more

disposable  income, I think that would only be necessary  if  we

have  a  far  severe recession than now.  What workers  are  now

facing  is  a  reduction  of disposable  income,  not  15%,  but

somewhere in the region of 7%.  So I think this is at the moment

still  bearable.   If more companies were to pass  back  savings

which  they  get from the various cost cutting measures  to  the

consumer, then, in fact, the effect is less than the 7%  cut  in

disposable income.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for

Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to thank Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong

for presenting the Government's response to the CSC Report.   It

underscores  what  the international news  media  and  the  fund

managers  are  saying:  that the Singapore  Government  has  the

talent  and  the  vision to deal effectively  with  the  current

economic  crisis.  Our national leaders have amply  demonstrated

and  exercised  leadership  and statesmanship  in  handling  the

economic  problems we have.  All Singaporeans would, I am  sure,

join us in thanking the Government for the cost cutting package,

including the generous Government rebates and tax cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government is refraining from

cutting  the  monthly wages of the junior staff in Division  III

and IV

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>

levels  and  the  daily-rated employees.  This  shows  that  the

Government is considerate and mindful of the needs of the junior

staff  and  the  lower income group.  This is  indeed  a  caring

Government in action, lest we forget.  I hope the private sector

companies  will also take this into consideration when  they  do

their own wage adjustments, especially for their junior staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government Ministers will forgo the

normal  annual salary adjustment for a second year  running  and

instead take a 10% pay cut.  Our Ministers are indeed leading by

example.  We must all be thankful that we in Singapore have such

good  Ministers, whereas in many other countries  they  have  so

many problems with the economy and the leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no choice but to cut costs, in order to be

competitive against other competing economies.  There is no cure

without  some  pain.  But the Government, we  can  see  by  this

package,  is  trying its best to cushion the impact,  especially

for the lower income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4% out of the 10% CPF cut will come from the Special Account,

and  CPF members will further be allowed to use the balances  in

their  Special  Accounts  to  meet  any  shortfall  in  mortgage

repayment caused by the CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Government is trying its utmost to help

homeowners can be seen in two other schemes: first, the HDB will

allow deferment of mortgage payments, lengthening of the term of

the mortgage loans, and inclusion of more working family members

as joint owners for the purpose of payment.  Second, there is  a

Bridging  Loan  Scheme  for CPF holders  with  HDB  and  private

property  mortgages at the concessionary rate  of  CPF  interest

rate  plus 0.1%.  This is indeed a very attractive and  generous

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public, I am sure, would also welcome the GST

offsets,   utilities  rebates,  public  transport  rebates   and

reduction in hospital charges.  All these will, I am sure, go  a

long  way  to help the lower income groups, especially those  in

the HDB heartland.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some are puzzled or may not understand why, when we have

retrenchment and unemployment, we are establishing the Singapore

Talent  and Recruitment (STAR) Committee, chaired by  BG  George

Yeo.  They may forget that Singapore is not a big country with a

huge hinterland and, in truth, we are a city state, aiming to be

a global city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move forward and compete, we have to attract the best talents

from abroad.  In fact, we need more stars.  Let there be a star-studded  Singapore, whether the stars are local born or overseas

inducted.  Many of our first generation leaders like Dr Toh Chin

Chye, Mr Ong Pang Boon and Mr S. Rajaratnam were indeed inducted

from abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good overseas talents, with their skills, ideas and inventions,

will enable Singapore to compete successfully and thereby create

more  jobs  for  all Singaporeans.  Even a superpower  like  the

United  States  of  America, benefited from wave  upon  wave  of

immigrants,  who  contributed immensely  with  their  ideas  and

inventions to the American economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some businessmen are saying that the CPF and wage cuts are not

deep  enough.   They want another 5 or more percentage  cut.   I

think enough is enough.  I am glad that the Government is taking

a  balanced  approach on this.  Further cuts, I am afraid,  will

drastically cut cash flow and our purchasing power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be adverse effects if more and more held back from

buying or have their purchasing power curtailed, and there  will

be a contraction, instead of a multiplier effect.  There will be

less  money  to go around.  We definitely do not  want  that  to

happen.  Many people will then say, "Money no enough."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social fabric and cohesiveness will also be damaged.

In  the formula, it is possible to cushion the effects of  these

cuts   with  the  NTUC  package,  and  the  Government  measures

announced so far.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has set the pace with a $23 million aid package for

workers,  especially to help those in the lower income brackets.

NTUC Fairprice has cut prices significantly at its supermarkets,

while  NTUC  Income  has a $12 million package  to  help  policy

holders  to  tide over their payments for premiums  and  housing

loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level we, as Members of Parliament,

will do our very best to do placement service for those out of

job, award bursaries and help out those who are in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the private sector companies going to do to help

the  workers to match the measures launched by NTUC?  I am  glad

that  the  Singapore  National  Employers  Federation  and   the

Singapore  Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry  have

announced   that  they  will  step  up  workers'  training   and

retraining  and assist in job placement.  The question  is,  can

the employers do more?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the employers do now, or will not do, will settle the

long  term  relationship with the workers and unions.   For  the

sake  of  our  long  term competitiveness and  our  future,  the

employers  must  be seen to be proactive in helping  workers  in

this   economic  crisis.   In  a  way,  they  will  be   helping

themselves, if they could secure the loyalty and support of  the

workers, and motivate them to give their best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Mr Tan Chin Tuan, the former Chairman of OCBC

Bank,   celebrated   his  90th  birthday.   His   grand-daughter

remembered  that  he  taught her that there were  principles  in

making  money,  and  that making money was  not  everything.   I

sincerely hope, and urge, all our entrepreneurs and businessmen,

to  abide by these wise precepts of Mr Tan Chin Tuan, which were

forged  and tempered by years of experience in both the  private

and public sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those at the helm of business should, in times of crisis

like  this,  uphold and cherish our workers, who are making  the

supreme  sacrifices  in CPF cuts and wage  cuts,  and  some  are

indeed losing their jobs.  Companies should think long term  and

try to retain, retrain and redeploy the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>

workers,  rather than simply retrench them, if they  could  help

it.   If  we  simply cut, and cut off the workers, we  will  not

retain their loyalty and support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepreneurs will do well to follow the example of Mr

Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology, who has pledged to keep the

money  saved  from  the  CPF cuts for possible  distribution  as

incentive or variable bonus, if the company's targets  are  met.

Mr  Sim  calls  it the Creative CPF Bonus Plan.   I  hope  other

employers will also do likewise and do this creatively.  I  urge

companies  that  do  well  and are profitable  to  reward  their

workers accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank the Government for the cuts and rebates in

Government  charges,  like foreign worker levies,  HDB  and  JTC

factory  rentals, income tax, property tax, utilities and  other

service charges.  I hope that this will indeed start a trend  or

habit  for  Government agencies to review their cost structures,

to put all aspects of costs under scrutiny, and examine ways and

means  of cost savings, eg, higher productivity, automation  and

lower  head  counts.  The Government agencies can then  pass  on

these savings to the customers and the public regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we are debating this CSC Report and

deciding  how best to tackle the economic crisis in a  cool  and

calm  manner in this Chamber and not in the streets,  unlike  in

some other countries where there are riots and demonstrations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speaks volumes of our tripartite consensus making

process, of our internal cohesion, and the clear vision and high

calibre  of our national leaders.  Mind you, this is  not  self-praise.   It  would  be immodest of us to  do  so.   Praise  for

Singapore,  and  our  Singaporean way of handling  the  economic

crisis,  came from some unexpected quarters, from those who  are

quick to criticise us and who have been our constant critics  in

the  past.   It came no less, for example, from the Far  Eastern

Economic  Review  magazine.  If I may quote from  our  erstwhile

critic,  the Far Eastern Economic Review stated in its September

1998 issue:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore's quick, organised response to Malaysia's financial

shutdown  could  solidify its place as Southeast Asia's  premier

financial centre.  This demonstrated Singapore's reputation  for

long-term   planning,  a  trait  that  complements   Singapore's

reputation for efficiency."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed vindication and endorsement of our transparent,

non-corrupt,  honest system of Government, and our  emphasis  on

talent and meritocracy, where the best and brightest rise to the

top in the Government and in business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newsweek, an international news magazine, reported, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore, known for its stable, transparent and clean

Government, has managed the financial storm . while remaining  a

player  in  the global market.  The key: unflappable  government

officials, long term planning and prudent fiscal policies."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the South China Morning Post, we compare very well

with  Hong  Kong,  our nearest rival.  The Hong  Kong  newspaper

contrasted  Singapore's  free market  approach  to  Hong  Kong's

decision to intervene in the financial markets.  The South China

Morning  Post commented that Singapore, on the other  hand,  has

won credit for demonstrating a cool, calm and collected response

to  the  region's stormy financial climate and putting in  place

positive long term structural changes, even as its stock  market

falls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC has done a good job. The question is how to ensure

that  the  economic  trends  are monitored  constantly  and  new

measures  are  devised to meet ever changing circumstances.   We

must  make  sure that this tripartite mechanism and relationship

forged in the economic crisis is maintained and indeed geared up

to  meet any new problems so that problems can be nipped in  the

bud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not let such mechanism atrophy. We should not wait

around  for  another  crisis before calling  for  a  review  and

another competitiveness report.  We should keep the mechanism in

place,  keep  monitoring the trends and be always ahead  and  be

more competitive than our immediate neighbours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest therefore that the Government consider keeping the

CSC or some moderated form of the CSC intact, by emplacing it in

a  Government agency or a think-tank with a resource  panel  and

capacity  for  economic monitoring and analysis.  From  time  to

time, Sir, crisis will come, but such a mechanism can enable  us

to  mark  the  trends and gear up to tackle the new  issues  and

devise new strategies and formulas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cost-cutting is only half the story. It would not work if

productivity  is  not raised, if workers are not  motivated,  if

business revenues are not increased, if new businesses  are  not

found, and if new markets are not conquered.  All cuts will come

to nothing. The business itself will be cut off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge therefore to Singapore, and Singaporean

businessmen in particular, is to find new business, to  continue

to regionalise and globalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need new ideas, new business, new markets and new niches. We

must  use this crisis to forge a new spirit of entrepreneurship,

of  daring to do, of never say die, but to fight and survive  in

this  business  jungle.  Darwin would say the  survival  of  the

fittest in the business jungle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Singaporeans can do it. We can make it. We can make

it  happen.  Indeed, this economic crisis provides us  with  the

opportunity to jell as a people as we face the problems squarely

and  overcome  them.   It bonds the people  and  the  Government

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will emerge stronger, with better credit ratings and even

more united and determined to make Singapore an attractive place

for investment and financial transaction.  We are well placed to

become  the  global IT, service and financial hub.   So  let  us

rally  behind  the  Government and go forth  as  one  people  to

triumph over adversity and conquer the new markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of the measures recommended by the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness  and  the  cost  reduction  package

announced by DPM yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has succeeded in presenting Singapore's

current  competitive  position and in setting  out  the  various

strategies  that  should  be  adopted  to  improve  our  overall

position.   I  believe that even in the midst of the  monumental

changes that have swept us and this region during the last  year

and a half, it is timely that we review our strategies for long-term  survival  and  growth.  To focus on the  current  problems

without   regard   for   the  long-term   solutions   would   be

shortsighted, like looking merely at the leaves and  not  seeing

the  entire forest.  In trying to overcome the current  economic

difficulties, we must not be distracted from pursuing  long-term

priorities which are required to remain relevant and to  further

enhance our position in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term measures have essentially focused on cost

reduction  to  help  businesses  survive  the  current  economic

crisis.  I support the urgent need to make immediate adjustments

to  costs  here  in  order  to adapt  to  the  changed  economic

environment.   The  cost reduction package  announced  yesterday

touched  on  a  multitude  of ways in which  business  costs  in

Singapore  could  be  directly and indirectly  reduced  so  that

commercial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>

transactions could take place more efficiently and without undue

wastage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the cost reduction measures, crucial as they are,

during  this  period  do  not provide  the  be-all  and  end-all

solution to the problems faced by our businesses and to increase

their  competitiveness.   The  cost-cutting  measures  are  only

temporary  holding  measures  to give  as  many  enterprises  as

possible  a fighting chance to survive in the interim.   Workers

are prepared to accept and adopt these measures despite the pain

that  will result, but bosses must realise that their businesses

cannot  depend on cost-cutting alone to survive this crisis  and

expect to emerge stronger thereafter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, it is clear, even without the economic

crisis,  that  the  only way to achieve a  globally  competitive

position  is for businesses to undergo structural reforms  which

are not merely based on price but on quality and added value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main causes for the fall in revenue for most

companies is, of course, the reduced demand for their goods  and

services in the domestic and regional markets.  The thing  which

employers  cannot  afford  to do now is  to  simply  sit  tight,

paralysed  with  ignorance  and  uncertainty  into  wishing  and

waiting for the good times to return, hoping in the meantime for

more  cost-cutting measures to be initiated by  the  Government.

As  the Chinese saying goes, a raft in the rapids that does  not

move  forward  moves  backwards.  Even with  reduced  costs,  if

nothing  is done to counter the drop in revenue, profit  margins

would  diminish and eventually disappear if revenue falls  below

expenses, and that business will eventually die, although  at  a

slower pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses must therefore find ways to tap new markets and

increase  revenue.   They must be nimble and responsive  to  the

needs of the market and to the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a simple example, in telecommunications, the Internet is

changing  the way we communicate and the way we source  for  and

retrieve information in a very fundamental way.  During a recent

visit  to the United States, I was pleasantly surprised to  find

public  telephones which had a separate built-in  data  port  so

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>

executives  on  the  move could plug in their laptop  computers.

And with a mere drop of a quarter, ie, 25 cents, they could dial

into  their  head  office's  computer  or  an  Internet  Service

Provider,  retrieve their e-mails, communicate with head  office

and  friends, and even surf the World Wide Web.  During the last

few  days, I examined every public phone I came across,  whether

at  Changi  Airport or Raffles Place, but had not been  able  to

find  one  which allowed me to plug in my portable  computer  to

send an e-mail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the recommendations by the Committee that

manufacturing  and  services should  be  promoted  as  the  twin

engines  of  growth.   Today,  I would  like  to  focus  on  the

manufacturing sector.  Before I proceed further, I would like to

disclose  my interest in the subject as a director of  a  public

listed  electronics  contract manufacturer and  a  director  and

equity  contributor of a start-up technology company.   I  would

like to bring up three points.  The first is for a review of the

GST  structure to facilitate part of the manufacturing processes

to  be  carried  out in neighbouring countries.   Second,  local

contract  manufacturers must be encouraged to provide more  than

merely  a manufacturing service.  And, third, meeting the  needs

of  existing MNCs that have already invested here in  Singapore.

I  hope  the  relevant Ministries and Government  agencies  will

consider these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as a manufacturing centre, our land limitation and highly

skilled workforce have made us too expensive to manufacture  and

assemble  the entire product in Singapore.  I do not believe  we

should  even  try  to  do so.  While we  may  have  the  skilled

workforce  to  do some parts of the assembly work  that  require

higher technology, the low-tech components must be farmed out to

be  done elsewhere, like Johor and Batam, so that we can finally

put  them altogether here in Singapore for export.  This was the

original idea behind the growth triangle.  However, one obstacle

to  this being carried out in practice is the imposition of  the

goods and services tax (GST).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain Singapore's position as a manufacturing hub, I

believe we should refine the present GST structure in regard  to

import  of  semi-finished  products.   Under  the  present   GST

structure, unless a particular supply of goods into Singapore is

meant  for re-export or falls under one of the approved schemes,

like  the  bonded warehouse scheme, GST will be payable  by  the

importer  on the supply.  This does not accommodate the practice

of   manufacturers  who  carry  out  certain  stages  of   their

production  process  outside  Singapore.   When  the   works-in-progress  are  sent  back to Singapore after completion  of  the

relevant  process, these manufacturers will be required  to  pay

GST  on  the semi-finished products which are considered taxable

import  supplies.  Although the GST paid by the manufacturer  at

that  point  can  be re-claimed as input tax when  the  finished

goods  are subsequently sold or exported, it does mean that  the

GST paid on the supply of semi-finished products will be tied up

for  a  period  of  time.  Although GST is  only  3%,  this  can

represent  a  relatively  sizable  amount,  considering  that  a

typical contract manufacturer makes only about 2% to 5%  in  net

margins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is an expedient time to look into possible

changes   to  our  GST  structure  so  as  to  help  our   local

manufacturers to take advantage of the lower costs of production

in other countries within the growth triangle framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is that in order to

provide  value  and  to increase revenue, our local  electronics

contract  manufacturers  must do  more  than  merely  provide  a

manufacturing service.  We must rise up the added value chain by

offering  technological  innovation and  more  complete  product

solutions for customers.  There is a global trend towards  third

party  out-sourcing.  This provides the opportunity for contract

manufacturers  who  have R&D capabilities  to  offer  innovative

product  solutions by suggesting improvements  to  the  existing

products  in  terms of their specifications or by reducing  cost

through new and more efficient production methods.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>

Taiwanese   are  particularly  good  at  this.    However,   for

Singapore,  it  is  easier said than done.  But  the  tripartite

relationship  between  the  big  businesses,  entrepreneurs  and

Government can be a powerful synergistic force to bring about  a

change  in  the  manufacturing industry here.  The entrepreneurs

who  have  new  product ideas, the established  businesses  with

their  financial resources and the Government which can  provide

the necessary infrastructure and assistance should work together

in  a  more  concerted and focused way to allow these  ideas  to

materialise into useful and successful products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that Singapore will continue to depend heavily

on  attracting foreign investments here to provide jobs for  our

people  and  to  maintain growth.  Besides the workers  who  are

directly employed under the payroll of the MNCs, there are  many

other workers who are employed by the multitude of companies and

businesses that depend on the MNCs as their suppliers  and  sub-contractors.   However, in this area, we face stiff  competition

for  investments and jobs from other places.  For  instance,  in

the  consumer  electronics industry, countries and regions  like

Mexico  and Eastern Europe, which are geographically  closer  to

the  huge booming consumer markets of USA and Europe, are  being

considered by MNCs as very attractive alternatives for  them  to

set  up their operations.  Singapore has done well in attracting

new  investments  by  MNCs in the past and  should  continue  to

imaginatively develop and exploit all possible niches which will

make us a world class business and financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are working hard at attracting new foreign direct

investments,  we  should not take for granted those  MNCs  which

have   already  sunk  in  their  investments  here.    We   must

consistently and constantly review the difficulties  these  MNCs

face  in their operations in Singapore and ask ourselves whether

we  are  doing  enough to meet their needs and to  retain  them.

Should  these MNCs decide to end their operations here and  move

elsewhere, they would probably be lost to Singapore forever,  as

having had a bad and painful experience, it will be very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>

difficult  and will take many years before their top  management

can  justify starting up in Singapore again, even if we are able

to remedy the problems at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that in debating the

measures  that need to be taken, we must not forget that,  as  a

developing  economy, Singapore has succeeded beyond all  initial

expectations  through  the  hard work  of  the  people  and  the

Government.  The present crisis then may be seen as  a  test  of

our  true  strength and potential.  Our actions and the measures

we   take   are  constantly  scrutinised  by  foreign  analysts,

economists and international investors and the media.   And  the

consensus  among  these watchers is that we have  a  very  sound

system that so far has withstood the test of the crisis.   There

is  every  reason for us to feel confident that the  Government,

from  its  track  record  -  first in  putting  the  system  and

infrastructure together, and then, in continuing to maintain its

soundness and integrity, will be able to lead Singapore  out  of

this  crisis.   With  this confidence, every Singaporean  should

feel   able   to   give  his  fullest  support  to   the   CSC's

recommendations and the cost reduction package which are  to  be

adopted by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister

for Trade and Industry.

<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE ON SINGAPORE'S COMPETITIVENESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for  the  past one year a remark which Singaporeans  often

make  in  the coffeeshops has been "times are bad".   What  most

people talk about are CPF cut, wage cut and whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>

prices  will go down.  At home, what worries people  is  whether

they could keep their jobs as they have seen their own relatives

and  neighbours retrenched.  Moreover, they worry  whether  they

have enough money to service their mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the nation-wide cost-cutting measures

announced by DPM Lee yesterday as well as the measures announced

by  the  Minister for Manpower, Dr Lee Boon Yang,  in  place,  I

think  we  can rest assured that things are moving in the  right

direction.   After  the  CSC  Report  and  the  National   Wages

Council's recommendations were published, the people's attention

is  focused  on the various cost-cutting measures,  particularly

the  specific  cuts  in  taxes, rentals, CPF  contributions  and

wages.   In  the  forum  page  of the newspapers,  the  dialogue

sessions  and  in coffeeshops, we begin to read and  hear  these

questions  being asked: "Has the Government done  enough?   Have

the  employers done enough?  Have the unions done enough?   Have

the workers done enough?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who mentioned again and again that Ministers

should take the lead in having a pay cut.  There are also others

who  doubt whether senior management staff in the private sector

are  willing to take a deeper pay cut.  Some have asked  whether

companies  which are still making profits should be entitled  to

cut  their  CPF  contributions.   We hope  that  bosses  in  the

private  sector  would  be  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  their

employees, and would not take this opportunity to exploit  them.

On  the other hand, we also hope that there will not be politics

of jealousy in our society.  When we are all faced with a common

problem,  we should put in a concerted effort to seek  solutions

to  these  problems.  We should not wait to see who should  make

more  sacrifice.   Everyone has to make sacrifice  in  order  to

enhance our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, DPM Lee's measures demonstrate another

spirit  in  our society, that is, we should share good  fortunes

and  go through thick and thin together.  Now that we are  faced

with difficulties, do the Government, employers, unions and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>

workers   know  what  our  difficulties  are?   How  did   these

difficulties  come  about?   We should  not  indulge  in  mutual

condemnation.  While we share in good fortunes, we  should  also

bear adversity together.  How do we overcome these difficulties?

It  is  obvious.  We should take measures to reduce our business

costs.   However,  when  we  resort to cost-cutting,  we  should

endeavour to minimise the impact on the poor wage-earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that petrol companies have announced a

reduction  in  petrol  prices.   Singapore  Telecom   has   also

announced  reductions in IDD charges.  We  sincerely  hope  that

Government agencies and the private sector will do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the union side, the NTUC launched a $23 million package

to  help the workers tide over this difficult period.  When this

scheme  was  launched, one reporter asked whether the  miserable

price-cut of 5% to 10% was of any good when people do  not  even

bother  to stop and pick up a 5-cent coin when they see  one  on

the ground.   Having enjoyed the good times all these years, our

people have become so casual about small amounts of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would still appeal to businessmen to pass on the

savings from the cuts in taxes, rentals and CPF by reducing  the

prices  of  their goods and services, even if it is just  for  5

cents  or 10 cents.  If the ordinary people could save 5  to  10

cents each time they go to work by public transport, shop at the

supermarket,  or  to  have a meal at the  hawker  centre,  these

savings  when  added  up could amount to something  significant.

This would in some way help to offset the pains inflicted by the

pay  cut  and CPF cut.  In this respect, the NTUC has taken  the

lead.  I hope the retail sector would also follow suit by giving

discounts  to  their consumers.  The media can  help  by  giving

publicity to those shops which have reduced their prices.   When

consumers know where they could buy things at lower prices, they

would  do  their shopping there.  This would lead to more  shops

giving  discounts or reducing their prices in order  to  attract

customers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this spirit of "every cent counts" that we try to imbue

into  our  children's  mind when we ask them  to  deposit  their

savings  into piggy banks so that before Chinese New Year,  they

could  use their savings to buy new clothes and new shoes.   Our

national  reserve  is  like a "piggy bank".   Some  people  have

suggested that we should dig into the national reserves to solve

our problems.  But I think it is not wise to do so.  I think the

reserves should be made use of only as a last resort.  To do  so

is  like  children using a stick to try and dig out a few  coins

from  the  piggy bank to spend.  If there are other options,  we

should not dig into the national reserves.  We should turn  this

spirit into a Singapore spirit.  We should encourage everyone to

save.   That  we have a huge reserve is a result of our  savings

because we have enjoyed good times for many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people have become used to living in comfort that they tend

to  become grumpy when they are suddenly faced with hard  times.

We  can understand that.  When the sole breadwinner has lost his

job  or  when  the  company  has  gone  bankrupt,  we  ought  to

understand their plight and give them a helping hand.  For those

Singaporeans who have no family members to turn to for help, the

CDCs  and other self-help organisations should step in to render

assistance.   Whether  we  are  civil  servants,  employers,  or

grassroots   leaders,  we  ought  to  empathise  and   be   more

compassionate  with  our  fellow country  men  who  are  now  in

difficulties.   I  hope such message could be  conveyed  to  all

Government Ministries.  We hope, through the present crisis,  we

could  become  more  vigilant and be  more  able  to  cope  with

changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite a real life example that shows

how  a long period of prosperity can cause our people to be less

able  to  cope with adverse circumstances.  Nowadays,  more  and

more  housing estates have covered walkways to link their blocks

to  the bus stops and to shield them from rain and the hot  sun.

However, one resident complained to me that there was no covered

walkway near his block and that it was very hot to walk  to  the

bus stop at noon and when it rains, he could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>

not  go  to the bus stop.  But this resident has forgotten  that

during  the  time  when there were no such  facilities,  no  one

complained  that he or she could not walk to the bus stop,  rain

or  shine.  What you need to do is to walk faster or to bring an

umbrella  when  it  rains.  He seemed  to  have  forgotten  this

instinct  of  coping with changes. A long period  of  prosperity

could  bring  about such negative effects on the mettle  of  our

people.   It is hoped that the present crisis could lead  us  to

realise  the  importance of how to survive through hardship  and

changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the "every cent counts" spirit is

manifested in the various recommendations in the CSC Report.   I

support the motion standing in the name of the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I met a few workers when I went to my office this morning.

I  took the opportunity to ask them what they thought about  the

cost-reduction  package  introduced by  DPM  Lee  in  Parliament

yesterday.  Spontaneously, they said, "Oh, lucky, no need to cut

salary  and I still get to receive the year-end bonus. Not bad!"

So  I  asked them, "What do you think about the 10% cut  in  the

employer's CPF contribution?"  They said, "Oh, we know some time

ago  that  our  CPF  will be cut by 10%.   In  order  to  reduce

business  cost for our employers to survive, we are prepared  to

accept  this  temporary measure, for the sake  of  our  nation."

When  they  are about to leave, they asked me, "As a  Member  of

Parliament, can you help us to get the shopkeepers to bring down

their prices?  Then we will be very happy."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things came to my mind. First, they said, "Oh, lucky, no

need  to  cut  salary  and I still get to receive  the  year-end

bonus."  This proves that when accepting the recommendations  of

the  CSC, the Government has carefully considered the plight  of

our  workers,  and they have also listened to the feedback  from

the  MPs and the public.  I would like to commend our Government

for  making the right decision in not having involved our lower-income employees in this round of wage reduction.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>

Secondly, they said, "Yes, we knew that our CPF is going  to  be

cut by 10%."  On this point, it also proves that our labour MPs,

the NTUC and union leaders have done a good job in explaining to

the  workers  the rationale for this round of CPF  reduction  so

that  all the workers understand why this cut is necessary.   So

when  the  Government announced that the CPF would  be  reduced,

they accepted it spontaneously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when they asked me whether I could ask the shopkeepers

to  bring down the prices of goods, it shows that after reducing

costs  for  the business, the next thing to do is to reduce  the

cost of living.  So today, I will focus on this point, that  is,

hereafter,  how are we going to help the people of Singapore  so

that  they  have a better standard of living and our quality  of

life will not be affected by this economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this, I hereby urge all trade associations,

coffeeshop  owners'  associations and retailers  to  join  in  a

nation-wide sales campaign.  Our Singapore Government  has  been

very  successful  in promoting various campaigns,  such  as  the

Speak  Mandarin  Campaign, the Courtesy  Campaign,  the  Healthy

Lifestyle  Campaign, etc.  We have achieved very  good  results.

At  this point of time, it may be appropriate for us to  have  a

"National Sales Campaign".  Why should we have a National  Sales

Campaign?  Because I think we can achieve three objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we can offset the additional burden imposed on our

workers due to wage-cut measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Christmas, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya are coming.

With all these festivals coming, if we can have a National Sales

Campaign, it will also help to stimulate business activities  so

that our economy could recover faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, through this National Sales Campaign, coupled with

propaganda  by  our Government agencies such  as  the  Singapore

Tourism  Board,   we  could  attract more  tourists  from  other

countries

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>

to  visit  us.   At a time when the other countries  are  having

problems, we can attract tourists to come to Singapore and  shop

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that with these three objectives in mind, we would be

able  to  herald in some good news during this time  of  crisis.

However, to promote such a campaign, we need to have the support

and  help  from all the traders.  When I spoke to a  coffee-shop

owner about the campaign, he told me, "If I reduce 10 cents from

each  cup  of coffee, with a thousand cups of coffee sold  every

day,  my daily income will be reduced by $100.  However, if  the

Government would reduce our property tax, rental, transportation

charges,   we  would  gladly  participate  in  this   campaign."

Eventually,  he  agreed  to  participate  in  the  Bukit  Gombak

Constituency Sales which we are planning to have just before the

New Year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This National Sales Campaign can help the lower-income families

to  reduce their cost of living.  However, if we want to do  it,

we  must  do it in full strength.  I remember once I   consulted

Minister George Yeo on a certain project. After listening to me,

he  said,  "If you feel that you are doing the right  thing,  go

ahead and do it.  I will support you."  This signal that he gave

to  me  was a great encouragement to me.  He gave me  a  lot  of

confidence  and  courage.   Here, I  would  like  to  take  this

opportunity to tell  the traders, the coffeeshop owners, "If you

think  you are doing the right thing, do not be afraid, go ahead

and  do it!"   Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Only then, can

we  get  good results.  The National Sales Campaign may  not  be

restricted only to the retailers, even the banks can join in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Minister for Finance mentioned in a

television  interview that the banks are going to  reduce  their

interest  rates.  If  that is so, the banks might just  as  well

join us in this National Sales Campaign, by announcing a cut  in

the  lending rates.   I think if the bank loan interest rate  is

lowered,  the property market will pick up, and our shares index

can break through the 1,500 mark.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It has already breached 1,500.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It has already done so?

Then,  let us go for the 1,600 mark.  I believe that if  we  can

put  in  a concerted effort, with cooperation between the people

and the Government, we can achieve some good results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to talk about the foreign worker levy. As

the DPM has already mentioned, the foreign maid levy will not be

lowered,  and  I understand the rationale behind  it.   However,

during  a dialogue session of the Feedback Unit, someone  raised

the  point that since some tax reliefs are already in place  for

working  mothers to offset the levy, why not extend this benefit

to the husbands as well.   As taxpayers can enjoy tax reliefs up

to  $8,280 per year for a foreign maid, it may not be a bad idea

to  let  the husband and wife claim the relief between them,  so

long  as  it  falls within this ceiling of $8,280.  Whether  the

husband claims or the wife claims, so long as it does not exceed

$8,280, there is no loss to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the levy on HDB resale flats. Dr Vasoo has raised

this and the Parliamentary Secretary has already explained.  But

I  still hope that HDB would re-consider this matter and   allow

those  who  are living in three-room flats to upgrade to  bigger

flats  without having to pay the high resale levy.  Let me quote

an  example.   In  1997, a three-room flat  could  be  sold  for

$160,000.  To upgrade, the owner would have applied for a  four-room flat which was then sold at about $150,000 by HDB.  But now

three-room flats in the western part of Singapore are selling at

just  $110,000, a drop of some $50,000.  At the same  time,  the

applicant  is  required  to pay a 20% resale  levy  of  $22,000.

Thus, the applicant is left with very little money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that HDB would consider helping these people who want to

upgrade but are now being caught in this economic downturn.   At

the  moment, for a three-room flat, you pay 20%; for a four-room

flat,  you  pay 22.5%; and for a five-room flat and  above,  the

resale  levy is 25%.   I suggest that we reduce the levy by  5%.

Let the resale levy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>

for  a  three-room flat be 15%; four-room flat, 17.5%; five-room

flat  and executive condominium, 20%.  In the early days,  those

who  sold a three-room flat paid only 10% in levy.  It has  been

increased to 15%, and then 20%.  Now that the tide has gone down

but  the  boat is still so high up, I think we should allow  the

boat  to  go  down with the tide.  Let us follow the  trend.   I

think  it  is  more equitable that way.  I hope  that  HDB  will

consider this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is on building up world-class companies and improving the competitiveness of our local

companies  in  the international market.  This is  a  very  far-sighted  and  creative  approach recommended  by  the  CSC.   It

recommended  that many small companies could merge  together  to

form  a  big  company.   But we all know that  in  our  oriental

society,  it  is very difficult  for two or three  companies  to

merge.   In the past it was difficult, now it is also not  easy.

Even  in  the  future,  I  do not think the  prospect  is  good.

However, the Government can take the lead to form a company  and

then invite all the companies in the same trade to join in like,

for  example,  Temasek  Holdings.  We  can  invite  these  small

companies  to  join  in, help each other and  then  form  a  big

company  with strong foundation. After that, invite bankers  and

financial institutes to join in and give financial support,  and

then we have a huge local company which can be developed into  a

world-class company to venture overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the views and feedback from some of the

businessmen.   They say, "Cooperating with Government  companies

can  be  very  frustrating because the civil  servants  who  are

running  the  business are often too rigid and inflexible."    I

would suggest that if we set up such a company and it is managed

by  civil  servants,   let them take care of administration  and

finance.   But  when it comes to sales, business dealings,  etc,

leave   it  to  the  businessmen  to  do  it.   Because  between

businessmen,  they  speak  their own  language.  Only  they  can

understand  the  nuances in the language they use.    We  should

take advantage of their expertise in this area. For example,  if

you talk business with people in certain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>

countries,  whenever you start negotiating, they will ask you to

cheng  shang  ming  biao  lai.    To the bureaucratic  Singapore

civil   servants,  this  simply  means,  submit  your  company's

profile.   But, in fact, what they really meant was "present  us

with branded watches."   When you squarely submit your company's

profile, it will most probably end up in the wastepaper  basket.

But,  if  you are smart enough to hand in your Rolex  or  Omega,

your  chances of success are definitely better. If it is  a  big

project  that  can bring in big money for you,  it  is  probably

worth the while entertaining them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you have cheng shang ming biao (presented them with

branded  watches), the next thing is, they will  invite  you  to

yanjiu,  yanjiu, which on the surface sounds like "consider  and

discuss", but in fact it is just another hint for you to send in

the  yan  (tobacco) and jiu (liquor).   Toe the line,  make  the

right  move, and you get the contract.  If not, then it  is  too

bad, you are out of contention!   If you want to deal with these

foreign  businessmen, you need to have a tacit understanding  of

the  way they operate.  This is something our law-abiding  civil

servants  cannot do.  But our businessmen can do it.   They  are

the experts.  They know how to talk business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has been far-sighted in recommending the eight long-term

strategies.  It is not possible for me to go into every  one  of

them.   Of  course, we may have other opportunities in a  future

forum to discuss all these.  Here, suffice for me to say that  I

support  the  recommendations put forward by the  Committee.   I

like    to   thank   the   Government   for   accepting    these

recommendations.  In  the  past,  many  people  used   to   say,

"Whatever  recommendation that is made, once  you  come  to  the

Government,  they will dilute it by 40%."  But  this  time,  the

Government  did  not  dilute it.   As  a  matter  of  fact,  the

Government enhanced it. The Committee recommended cost-reduction

of  $10 billion but the Government gave another $500 million  to

make it a $10.5 billion package.   This is indeed unprecedented!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for

giving  me this opportunity.  Sir, I rise to support the  motion

moved  by  the  Minister.   Allow  me  to  share  some  of   the

observations which I am going to make this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report is bold and imaginative. Some of our best

minds  in  the  Government, the private sector and the  academia

have  worked long hours to put up this Report.  Those of us  who

have  read this Report feel a sense of gratitude in the way they

have   confronted   the  issues.  The  Report   is   farsighted,

comprehensive and well written.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask this House to acknowledge the contributions

made  by  all the people involved in the Report, from  the  main

Committee to the sub-committees.  It is interesting to note that

most  of  the  members  are from the private  sector.   This  is

encouraging.   It shows the Government's faith  in  the  private

sector,  and this faith has been well rewarded.  This is  not  a

Government  White  Paper,  but  largely  a  product  of  private

sector's efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the goals set out in the Report are achievable. We

all  have  to  work for it.  We are fortunate  that  our  fiscal

management and budgetary measures have left us surplus  in  good

years to meet the difficult years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is some pessimism in some sectors that the

present  economic slowdown will last for a few years.  Some  say

it  is the worst - and I agree with them - economic crisis  that

we  are  facing.   Only  time will tell  how  long  the  present

condition will last.  Much depends on our neighbours as well  as

on Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more optimistic. We can be masters of our own

destiny.   The acid test of a society comes in times of  crisis.

We  are going through such crisis now.  We have gone through the

previous  crisis  and we have overcome.  We  will  overcome  the

present crisis, provided we have the will and determination  and

resolve as a united people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday DPM Lee announced the Government's measures. The

Government has acted very swiftly in facing the

problem.  He has given solutions to the short-term problem,  but

the Committee has also recommended some long-term measures and I

hope the Government will take the opportunity at the appropriate

time to debate them as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage cut has been accepted by the employees. In many

countries,  such  a  move  would have caused  political  crisis,

perhaps  even crisis in the standing of the government,  but  we

are  fortunate.   And it is to the credit of the  NTUC  and  its

leadership  that  it has persuaded the workers  to  accept  some

temporary cut.  It is laudable that there is a stable industrial

climate in Singapore.  Labour, Government and employers all have

worked in achieving this.  The NTUC has done a remarkable job in

getting the workers to accept less CPF and less pay.  Sir, I was

moved  when my fellow NMP, Mr Cyrille Tan, related the  question

of  retrenchment.  He knows the problem because he  himself  has

been a victim.  He painted a graphic picture.  Only a person who

has been retrenched can show this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst the workers are asked to make some sacrifice, I am

disappointed  to read in the Business Times that  the  corporate

world  is not showing the same trend.  Whilst the employees  are

asked  to sacrifice, some of the captains of our corporate world

are  taking more pay, when, in fact, their company's performance

has  declined.  I appeal to the corporate world to be  realistic

and  not  to  be  marginalised by their action.   The  directors

cannot  persuade  the  workers to  take  a  pay  cut  when  they

themselves  are not prepared to live by example.   There  is  no

room for double standards.  Similarly, those companies which are

doing well must reward their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to the financial sector. Our financial

sector is in good health.  Our system is transparent.  Thanks to

the  MAS and its officials.  My complaint is that our banks  are

too  over  cautious.  They are too conservative.  Permit  me  to

elaborate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS does not believe in getting involved in the management

of  credit and bank interest.  It may be so on paper.   However,

it  can - I emphasise on the word "can" - persuade the banks  to

be  more market oriented.  When savings interest rates go  down,

the  banks  must try to lower their interest rates.   The  banks

must  not  be over anxious over loan portfolios.  They must  not

stifle  enterprise.   There may be some companies  that  may  be

going  through difficult times now but they have a potential  of

growth  in  years to come.  They should give a helping  hand  to

them.  They should not recall loans.  They should do so only  as

a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the property sector, Sir. The last two years

have seen property prices decline, in some cases as much as  60%

from the peak.  Nobody knows when we will reach the bottom.  Had

the Government not intervened in 1996, we would have a sad story

today.   Nevertheless, I urge the Government not  to  allow  the

property market to collapse.  It will not be good either for the

property  market  or  for the banks or the  country.   What  the

Government should do is to take away some of the restrictions it

had  imposed  earlier.  I ask the Government to  reconsider  its

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to manpower, Sir, manpower is our main asset. One

area  which we should look at is our birth rate.  Those who  can

afford  should be encouraged to have more children.   We  cannot

forever depend on guest workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to get talent, we should start young. We

should  encourage  the bright students from other  countries  to

come and study here.  They will stimulate our students.  Some of

them  may  want to stay back and even those who return to  their

countries  would be our life-long unpaid ambassadors.   In  this

respect,  companies could offer scholarship.   SIA  has  such  a

scholarship scheme.  I urge other Government-linked companies to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage more international schools to be set up

here.  We have the potential of becoming the educational hub  of

Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the Government's concern in attracting foreign

talents.   Let  me  take  the example  of  the  print  media  in

Singapore.   The  Straits  Times  has  a  number  of  expatriate

journalists.   They have helped to improve the  quality  of  the

newspaper.  Sunanda Datta Ray and Asad Latif are just two names.

They  are senior leader writers, very sensitive positions.   Yet

we  have them there.  Even the American and British print  media

have foreign talents.  The world is looking for talents.  If  we

do not attract them, other countries would do so.  We must never

forget that we are by-products of an immigrant society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very encouraging to note in the Report that the

institutions  of  higher learning are being  asked  to  increase

their  intake.  With the changing of our educational policy,  we

would become a learning nation.  Every individual should undergo

some  form  of training every year.  Our institutions of  higher

learning  are  offering extension courses.  We should  add  more

such courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world is changing fast. We are in the information

technology  age.   It  is imperative that we  have  an  educated

workforce.  Employers must take the lead in job training.  It is

not  just  the responsibility of the Government and  the  labour

movement.  The employers have a role to play.  This mindset must

be changed if we hope to become a knowledge-based economy.

Sir,  we  must  also try to upgrade the skills  of  our  foreign

workers,  for  they form an important factor in  our  workforce.

Many  of  these workers are educated but they may  have  a  poor

command  of  English.   We  could offer  them  some  courses  in

English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which we must review is our retirees and

housewives.   We  have not attracted them enough.   Perhaps  the

labour  market  must examine this because, as the Minister  said

earlier, only 3% of our workforce are part-timers.  3% is a very

small number and is indeed very low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move to tourism, Sir. It is a growing industry.

Whilst we are also attracting talents, we have an edge over  the

other Asian countries.  In short, we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>

export  some  of  our  talents.  Take  hotels.   In  some  Asian

countries,  we still find European and American hotel  managers.

Can  we  build  up  our talents here so that they  could  manage

hotels in other countries?  Better still, build or buy hotels in

these  countries, as some companies are already doing now.   The

trend has already started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, I have spoken and I will speak again on the

question  of tourism.  There is a growing class of tourists  who

are  interested in Asian culture.  Music and art  attract  them.

Our  population   mix is to our advantage.  We should  encourage

musicals,  operas and ballets.  Similarly, we  should  hold  art

exhibitions  and musical performances.  I would suggest  that  a

committee  be  set  up,  as  we have  a  niche  over  the  other

countries.   Sir,  I  was pleased to read this  morning  in  the

International  Herald  Tribune  that  our  cultural  scene   has

actually attracted their attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area and many Members have spoken on this,

ie,  how  to  stimulate  our retail  sector.   While  I  am  not

advocating that we should give spending coupons proposed by  the

Japanese  government, I think there is not enough  money  to  be

spent  in the retail sector.  People do not have the money,  and

even  those who have the money, they are trying to save for  the

rainy  day.   We  must  try to give some help  to  this  sector,

because it forms an important sector of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must not forget our political stability. I agree

with my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, that Singapore is fortunate

in  having  a good government.  We must evolve our own political

system  where the citizens can participate not only in  decision

making  but take some of the burden of the Government.  We  must

strengthen our civil society which is not only prepared to speak

but also do its best for the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is so much to talk and so many Members are going to

speak.  I end my speech with this plea.  Fellow Singaporeans, we

are fortunate that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>

are not as badly hit as the other countries.  Let us put all our

resolve, put the past behind us and try to build a bright future

for  our children.  We can do it and we will do it.  We have the

resources.   We  have  the money and  the  means.   Let  us  all

contribute  our  effort to achieve the  goals  set  out  in  the

Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion has asked the House to endorse the strategies

and  policies  set out in the Report.  I think  the  Government,

Members,  Opposition Members and NMPs must show to  Singaporeans

and the world at large that we are a united and one people.  May

I  ask  the  entire House to give a resounding support  to  this

motion?  It should have a 100% approval from this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong gave the Government's

response   to  the  CSC's  recommendations.   Once  again,   the

Government  has  shown  that it is a  responsible  and  credible

Government.    It  is  prepared  to  take  hard  and   difficult

decisions.   These decisions could not be easily taken  in  many

other  countries.  In times of need, the Government is providing

the  right political leadership to rally and mobilise the people

to  the  common cause.  In the short term, we want our companies

to survive and to save jobs for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition has taken cheap pot shots at the Government

for  failing to foresee the danger signals and taking the  early

pre-emptive steps that could have avoided the sharp  decline  in

the  economy.  The Opposition should understand that  confidence

is an infectious thing.  The most difficult thing about managing

the  economy is the psychology of people.  Every step  taken  by

the  Government is closely watched and interpreted by  investors

and traders, both locally and overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only in the economy that is of interest to the

investors  and traders.  It is politics that has contributed  to

the worsening regional business and trading environment.  For  a

period in the early

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>

days  of  the  regional economic crisis, the  foreign  financial

analysts and fund managers did not make any distinction  between

the situation in Singapore and the rest of the region.  With our

political   leaders  taking  the  lead  to  explain  Singapore's

policies  and  strategies,  foreign investors  and  traders  now

understand that Singapore is different and Singapore got what it

takes to continue to do well despite the political uncertainties

in our neighbouring countries.  In fact, we are taking advantage

of  the adversity of the regional economic crisis and turning it

into  a window of opportunity for Singapore to widen the gap  in

comparative advantage against our competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the new era of information technology,

telecommunications and the globalisation of the economy, we have

to   contend  with  the  highly  volatile  international  market

environment.   We have therefore to be quick and nimble  in  our

response to new changes and developments affecting us.  We  have

to  be  agile and flexible to operate successfully in  this  new

environment and this requires a change in mindset.  All the more

we  need a consensus in the vision for Singapore in the next  10

years.    The   Report   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness  does just that.  The target  set  provides  the

direction  in  which we can all work together towards  a  common

goal.   The aim is to continually improve the standard of living

of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two days, I heard Mr Low Thia Khiang repeatedly

saying  that  it  is  not necessary at this  stage  to  cut  the

employer's  CPF  contribution, as he  thinks  the  economy  will

recover very soon and we need not take the bitter medicine.   He

seems  to  suggest that the retrenchments taking place are  part

and  parcel of working life.  Too bad, you are affected.   After

all,  only  a  small percentage is affected by retrenchment  and

unemployment.   Why  bring in the rest to suffer  together  with

this minority?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, there are more than 1.8 million working persons in

Singapore.  From the selfish point of view, it could be

argued that 90% of the workforce would have no problem retaining

their  jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>

Many could not see the threat of retrenchment  or

unemployment  affecting them.  Possibly, those  working  in  the

public  sector  may  feel this way.  We all  know  that  nothing

remains  static.   There  is always a danger  of  the  contagion

effect.   Even in good companies, people can be affected through

takeovers,  mergers  and acquisitions.  In  good  times,  it  is

easier  to  secure alternative employment.  In  difficult  times

like  this, those retrenched and new graduates may have  to  sit

out for many months before they can find alternative employment.

This is our major concern - to save jobs and to create many more

new  jobs  for our people.  What the Government has done  is  to

promote  shared  values and shared interests.   It  is  also  of

educational value to let every Singaporean know that we  are  in

it  together.  Perhaps the Opposition Members may not  be  aware

that they are promoting selfish attitudes among Singaporeans  to

care about their individual selves.  Perhaps there are those who

believe, like the Opposition Members, that we can take the  more

laissez-faire approach and things will improve naturally towards

recovery.   I  would  rather  that  we  be  safe,  prudent   and

conservative  in  our approach in handling this tricky  economic

situation  in  hand.   Even  with  these  measures,  we   cannot

guarantee  that  we will recover quickly.   So  we  do  what  is

necessary and hope for the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend the action taken by the Government to

help  bring  our economy on an even keel.  I am happy  that  the

daily-rated  employees and Divisions III and  IV  public  sector

employees do not suffer the direct cuts in their monthly salary.

The Government, as an employer, is taking good care of the lower

salaried staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, the public sector employees may

feel  the  most  secure  during this period,  because  they  are

insulated from the experience of those directly affected by  the

downturn in business.  Civil servants are always occupied.  What

more with work being generated for them with Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>

pump-priming  and  revisions  to Government  taxes,  levies  and

charges.   The Government, by its action in cutting the salaries

of  civil servants in Division III and above, is bringing  civil

servants  closer  to  the reality on what is  happening  in  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a cap in the employer's CPF contribution at the

monthly  salary  of  $6,000, it is only fair and equitable  that

those in the higher income category above $6,000 be made to take

a  direct  pay  cut.   I  am happy to note that  the  Ministers,

Members of Parliament and senior civil servants will have  their

annual  remuneration  reduced  by  up  to  10%.   This  is  what

leadership  by example is all about, and the rest of the  people

should be pleased that the right tone is set for them to follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an interesting feature in the package announced by DPM

Lee yesterday is the effort to help our domestic retail trade by

plugging  the leak in our economy, by reducing the exempt  limit

of  GST to travellers.  I believe Singaporeans will support  the

move.  I am sure the retail sector will welcome this gesture  of

the  Government.  I am also sure that the businesses are pleased

with  the  reduction  in  the foreign worker  levy.   The  total

savings  of  $204  million  will  be  an  added  fillip  to  the

companies, especially the manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF has undergone many modifications. We are

introducing many uses for CPF.  I am concerned whether,  in  the

long  term,  CPF  account holders will have enough  to  live  on

during  their  years  in retirement.  Will  the  investments  in

property  and shares allow them to realise good values  in  time

for their retirement?  I would suggest that the Government do  a

thorough   review  of  the  CPF  scheme  so  that  we   do   not

unconsciously  lead to the unintended effects arising  from  the

many uses of CPF accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of human intellectual capital, Mr J. B.

Jeyaretnam yesterday criticised the Government for not reviewing

the  educational system.  I am surprised with his  remarks.   He

must have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>

been  deaf  to the outcry of parents and teachers that  we  have

been  making too frequent changes to our educational system.   I

am  glad  that  he  supports the need to constantly  review  our

educational  curricula  to  keep  up  with  the  times.   It  is

precisely   what   the  Education  Ministry  has   been   doing,

introducing  critical  thinking skills, information  technology,

national  education and even community service into  the  school

curricula. The GPC for Education has always been supporting  the

Government's efforts to bridge the skill and qualification  gap,

to  ensure that graduates and school leavers have the capability

and   competency  to  fit  easily  and  quickly  into  the  work

requirements.   Our  students are already perceptibly  different

today from yesteryears.  They are more confident, articulate and

have inquiring minds.  They are our hopes for the future.  I  am

confident  that  young Singaporeans can benefit  from  the  wide

range of educational courses in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC leaders and the labour movement are to be

applauded  for their hard work to arrive at this consensus.   In

fact,  it is because of their hard work that they have made  our

jobs so much easier today.  After this debate, Sir, this is  the

time  to act.  I am optimistic that our economy will recover  in

the not distant future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand

to  applaud  the CSC for a job well done and the Government  for

its  response  to  the  CSC's recommendations.   I  believe  the

Government's  decisive and comprehensive package,  announced  by

DPM  Lee  yesterday, will bring us out of this  economic  crisis

sooner  and will place us in a better position to handle  future

challenges.   I  would like to mention, in  particular,  that  I

welcome the Government's initiative to cut the salaries  of  the

Ministers by 10%, in spite of the two consecutive years of  wage

freeze.  It is good that our Government has again shown  us  its

readiness to lead by example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with the Government's decision to cut

the employer's CPF contribution by 10%, I am concerned about the

cut of 4% from the Special Account.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>

will mean many account holders will find it harder to attain the

Minimum Sum.  I would like to reiterate that the Minimum Sum  in

the   Special  Account  is  extremely  important  because   life

expectancy of Singaporeans is increasing towards 80 years of age

and many will require their Minimum Sum for subsistence in times

soon  to  come.   I  strongly  suggest  that  the  shortfall  in

contribution here be promptly reinstated at the end of these two

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Government's package of aid to

alleviate  the burden of lower income families.  However,  I  am

disappointed  that  there is no mention  of  any  help  for  the

retrenched.   Sir, I would like to entreat this  House  to  also

consider  the  more immediate and adverse side  effects  of  the

economic  downturn which has left many people unemployed.   Just

last  September, 62,000 workers in Singapore were without  jobs.

Sir,  62,000  may  be  just a number, mere  statistics  to  some

people.   But not to us, because this means that the bad effects

of  retrenchment are affecting too many of our people.  And  the

lives  of these Singaporeans and their family members can indeed

be badly affected, not only in financial terms but also in terms

of  psychological  and social well-being.   The  conviction  and

confidence  to  achieve  that Singapore dream  gets  questioned.

These  people  can  be  left totally demoralised.   Indeed,  the

distress  from retrenchment can be very heart-breaking  and  the

hardship from income loss can be very harsh.  Although this  may

be   especially  so  for  sole  breadwinners  of  families  with

children,  the  hardship will be felt  by  all  members  of  the

affected families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no provision for unemployment benefit in

Singapore and I am not an advocate for one. Welfarism  has  many

down-sides  and  will not work in Singapore.  However,  we  must

have   some   degree  of  humanitarian  and  social   conscience

considerations  from the Government.  We have  built  up  strong

reserves over the years for rainy days, I presume.  Are  we  not

in  the  middle of the storm right now?  Although I  agree  with

DPM's reservation yesterday about our changing from a nation  of

savers accumulating wealth to a nation of spenders depleting it,

I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>

like  to  see a helping hand extended to the families  of  those

retrenched  workers  who are having genuine difficulties,  often

through no fault of their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government could disperse a one-time funding through

the CDCs to tide over the retrenched who are in dire need during

the  two  difficult  years envisaged.  Not  all  the  retrenched

workers  will need the help because some have personal  savings,

some  are  from double-income families and the spouses  are  not

unemployed.   Some would simply not want such aid and  certainly

not  for  the  full two years and so on.  Nonetheless,  even  if

hypothetically,  every single one of the  62,000  retrenched  or

unemployed workers were to apply for the two full years of  $500

per  month subsistence help, the amount would be just under $750

million.  This, indeed, would be a large sum of  money,  but  it

would  be well received humanitarian aid from the nation to  its

very own citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not ordinary times and what can be done should be

done.   I have met people who have been retrenched. They  looked

trapped   and  the  desperation  they  expressed  is  unbearably

profound.   Now,  there  will always be  argument  that  we  may

encourage reliance and complacency as well as ending up  with  a

"dole  queue".   Sir,  I  feel that  these  fears  will  not  be

validated  because the applicants will need  to  apply  for  the

monthly aid and they will, of course, be subjected to satisfying

the  eligibility criteria set out to stem abuse and  dependence.

Moreover,  $500  per month is barely enough for subsistence  and

the majority of people will want to earn more than that in order

to have a better living for themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is a 4 to 1 matching grant of up to $3

million each year from the Government for the CDCs when money is

raised  by the grassroots.  It is not easy to raise funds during

times  like  these.   There is a varying capacity  by  different

constituencies  to raise funds.  The ones that  have  the  least

capability to raise funds may be the ones that need the most  to

support  families in financial difficulties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>

Moreover,  most  of

the money raised for the CDCs in many constituencies have

been  committed to other charitable projects.  In this  context,

therefore,  I  plead  with  the  Government  for  this  one-time

outright funding through the CDCs to help the retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no mention in the Government's response about

the  need  to look into the employability difficulties faced  by

the  older workers in the country.  I share the same concern  as

mentioned by my parliamentary colleague, Dr Vasoo, in this area.

I  believe that skills upgrading of workers is the correct  path

forward.  I also believe that higher technology industries  will

position us better economically in the future.  However,  it  is

necessary  for  us to also consider the social implications  for

the  society as a whole when we try to achieve our  ideals.   We

run  the risk of leaving many of our people completely redundant

and  causing more social ills than necessary.  There  are  about

500,000 lower-skilled workers at the moment and many of them are

above  40 years of age.  Mr Speaker, Sir, how many and how  fast

can  these people be upgraded in their skills?  Retraining takes

time  and not everyone can be upgraded in skills for a multitude

of  reasons.   The  lack of motivation may be  a  reason.   But,

financial  considerations,  the  lack  of  opportunity  and  the

inability   to  master  new  skills  are  even  more   important

limitations.   Of course, we cannot accept such  excuses  if  we

want a more productive workforce.  Nevertheless, while trying to

achieve our goal, the livelihood and well-being of these  people

have  to be considered.  Along the way, we should leave a  niche

section of the economic pie for them.  In this respect,  Sir,  I

would like this House to consider the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lower technology jobs should not be phased out

completely.  They have to be supported and even encouraged until

such  time  when we have trained our unskilled and  semi-skilled

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Employers must be encouraged to hire more older

workers.  Perhaps we need a helping hand from the Government by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>

way  of  incentives  such as (a) linking the  quota  of  foreign

workers  employed  with the number of older Singaporean  workers

employed  or  (b)  special tax incentives  for  companies  which

employ older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On the part of employers again, job vacancies must be

made available or even created for our local workers.  There  is

no  doubt that Singaporeans shun certain kinds of jobs and  tend

to  let  foreigners  fill them.  This should be  addressed,  for

instance,  by  the  use of more prefabricated materials  in  the

construction  industry  or  by the  use  of  automation  in  the

manufacturing  industry, and so on.  Steps taken to  change  the

mindset of employers towards such ideas ought to be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Emphasis on changing the mindset of our local workers

should  also be enhanced.  We need to encourage more of our  own

workers  to  take  up  jobs that have been  designated  as  "for

foreigners  only"  or  jobs  that  are  considered   lowly   and

demeaning.   Being choosy and unwilling to take  on  jobs  below

their expectations in terms of salary or status is probably  the

most  significant mindset change required.  Such mindset  change

will  have  to come in due course because more workers  will  be

competing for limited preferred jobs in the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Skills Redevelopment Programme's efforts towards

helping  companies upgrade the skills of their workers  is  most

laudable.   This  programme  must  be  encouraged  and  promoted

resolutely to encompass more sectors of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our efforts to equip ourselves for this economic

downturn,  I would also like to beseech this Government  not  to

ignore  the  plight of our womenfolk.  I would like  to  commend

these two points for attention:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, women comprise 40% of our workforce and many of

them  bear the burden of having the multi-role of looking  after

the  home,  bringing up children and caring  for  their  elderly

parents.  Many need maids as a result of these responsibilities.

We  need  to help them.  Although the Government is not lowering

the levy for foreign domestic helpers at this juncture,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>

I  would hope for a review later.  A lower levy will go  a  long

way  when  family  incomes  are  to  be  significantly  reduced.

Furthermore, not many working women earn enough to benefit  from

the double tax deduction.  In fact, there were only 17,425 women

who  were  eligible last year, or about only 15%  of  the  total

number of employers of foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, childcare centres and before-and-after-school

care centres have certainly been a boon for more mothers to seek

jobs  and  contribute to the economy.  The importance  of  these

centres is recognised by the Government.  More of them have been

set  up  and  subsidies for working mothers  have  been  rightly

given.   I would like to see attention given here by having  the

subsidies  increased in view of the impending CPF and pay  cuts.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I applaud the CSC's recommendation  to  have

"neighbour  care"  by  extending child  care  subsidies  to  all

working  mothers, instead of restricting them to those who  send

their  children to formal childcare centres.  This would  create

more  jobs  for  the  homebound women  to  mind  someone  else's

children in their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we need to work together as a nation,

with a single-minded wish to see us out of these bad times.   We

will  experience hardship and we will remember the  saying,  "no

pain, no gain".  However, I would like the Government to let the

degree of hardship become a factor in all our endeavours and  to

remember what I would add, "too much pain is no gain too".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,    so   much   has   been   discussed   about   Singapore's

competitiveness.   The cost-cutting packages announced  in  this

House  by  DPM  Lee  was a "sunshine" package.   However,  these

discussions  on long-term economic policies and short-term  cuts

in  business  costs, which will take time to be implemented  and

felt, are not all understood by the man-in-the-street nor  by  a

large segment of Singaporeans not trained in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>

economic  terms.  Their immediate concerns are still the  threat

of unemployment and the impact of wage and CPF cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations evidently will enhance business

competitiveness  but they are pressing ordinary Singaporeans  to

shoulder  the  urgent  responsibility of making  Singapore  more

competitive, by accepting a wage cut and lowering of safety  net

contributions  from employer's CPF contribution.   This  is  the

reality of global competition when we have to cut wages to  stay

competitive, because they form the most significant component in

our operating costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, accepting "tough times" and a harsh business reality,

however, does not wish away the assault of deprivations and  the

pains in people's struggles to make ends meet.  Many MPs had, in

the  last  few days, called for a compassionate gesture  by  the

Government to try its utmost to alleviate the financial pains of

Singaporeans  so  that, as Dr Michael Lim said,  "their  spirits

will not be broken", and I echo their calls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more can we all do for the vulnerable in this crisis?

I  do  not  agree  to using the reserves or,  as  DPM  Lee  said

yesterday, lao ben [         ].  And he had translated  that  to

guan  cai ben [                        ].  That is a little  bit

fatalistic,  and it is like the end of a journey, because  there

is  no  life  in  coffins.   I  would  call  it  a  "reserve  in

perpetuity"  -  there to guarantee generations of  Singaporeans,

our  children and grandchildren the security of having something

there  for  them,  as a last resort.  Take my  own  family,  for

example.  We set up a trust for our children so that if anything

happens  to  us or our fortunes, they have the reserve  to  fall

back  on.   We explained to them that they have to grow  it  for

their  children and grandchildren, in perpetuity.  And if  there

is  a  critical  need, it can only be for  education  need.   We

believe,  if  everything else fails, an education  guarantees  a

job,  and  life.   Therefore, I agree, bu yao  dong  lao  ben  [

],  bu yao da puo man [                                  ].   Do

not  touch the reserves.  It is a psychology of security for the

country.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what can we do? I will highlight five focus areas which

have direct impact which we can still work on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is more of the many commendable programmes

already  started  by MOM and NTUC in areas  of  job  search  and

placement  and skills training for workers.  I am glad  to  hear

from   the   Minister  this  afternoon  about   the   employment

facilitating channels and the retrenchment advisory unit.  Those

are   positive   initiatives.   But  I  would   call   for   the

strengthening   of   three  strategies.   The   first   is   the

strengthening  of job matching channels for older  persons.   We

know  how hard it is for the 35 to 40-year olds to get employed,

because  employers and marketplace prefer younger  workers  with

qualifications.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM has said that if employers are found to have terminated

the  services  of a worker unfairly on account of old  age,  the

Minister  can  order his reinstatement to his previous  job,  or

require  the  employer  to offer monetary  compensation  to  the

affected worker.  Sir, that is very reassuring.  We have read in

the  papers  how hard it is for the 40-year olds to  find  jobs.

The most recent one reported was Mr Shaik Alauddin who could not

find a job for 11 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reasons given in that article were valid - skills

level,  unmatchable  capabilities, low work  adaptability,  etc.

But we have to look closely at our million over 40-year olds and

do  a  skills audit.  In view of the current employers' attitude

and  market demand for fewer workers, who are cheaper but higher

qualified  ones,  it  may mean more "older  persons"  will  have

difficulty  finding jobs.  (And that represents probably  three-quarters  of the Members of the House here in the `50s  who  may

become  potential job seekers!).  We may need  to  identify  the

kind of industry clusters which we can match and train them for.

This category of people still have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>

20  more good years to contribute to society; it is our economic

loss not to employ them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that DPM's response yesterday registered the

same  concern.   May  I  then ask if  we  can  consider  special

incentive schemes for employers who employ older persons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy is to identify more part-time work for

working  mothers.   The  Government  has  removed  some  of  the

disincentives for part-time work in public service  by  allowing

part-time workers to claim the same CPF contributions and  leave

schemes  as  full-time workers on a pro-rata  basis.   Dr  Aline

Wong,  in  a  recent  statement, reported  that  private  sector

companies,  however, have not been flexible in making  part-time

and flexi-time work more readily available to their workers.   I

support  Dr Aline Wong's call for employer groups to  study  how

part-time  schemes  are  practised in  some  countries  such  as

Britain and Sweden, and learn from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we think of setting up a dedicated database to identify the

kind  of part-time work in demand in the marketplace, so that  a

part-time  job clearing house can be set up and a mechanism  for

job  identification,  recruitment and  placement  can  start  to

operate?  The 900 queries for part-time jobs which Minister  Lee

Boon  Yang  reported two days ago provide a baseline for  us  to

identify  what  workers are looking for  and  what  special  job

designs can be customised to absorb them.  This is a good  start

to systematically examine part-time job clusters for the Back-to-Work programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third strategy is more of the excellent initiatives like SRP

and  CREST  which are targeted at 800,000 workers for  the  next

five  years,  but  to  be extended to other  beneficiaries  like

housewives,  older persons, schools, voluntary groups,  etc,  so

that  we truly can become a learning people and thinking  nation

at all levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a call to all employers in the private

sector  at  this  juncture  to  reinforce  the  efforts  of  the

Government   by  creatively  aligning  their  work  and   people

resources in such a way

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>

that  workers, old and young, men and women, can  still  have  a

job, even if need be, on a part-time basis.  For example, we can

adopt a policy of wage cut by reducing two or four work days  in

a month for each staff.  Administered on a rotational basis, the

company carries on business as usual with fewer staff having  to

double  up  and perform cross-functionally.  Freed  from  office

time,  many  staff can now attend to family matters and  go  for

some  inexpensive training courses.  Life will be more balanced,

although  in  some  cases, the salary  cut  can  be  inadequate.

However, it is better that everyone in the company has a  little

less, than a few to lose their jobs completely.  And I also urge

employers  to  pay back to workers, in the form of  bonuses,  in

December 1999 if their companies did well next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second focus is more community-based initiatives like what

CDCs  and  voluntary agencies have developed.  I will  highlight

two strategies.  The first is reaching out to the poor.  Here, I

would  like  to  applaud grassroots leaders  and  volunteers  in

Tanjong  Pagar and Marine Parade and recently Ang  Mo  Kio/Cheng

San  CDCs  for their mission to brief the poor in one- and  two-room  flats on help schemes available to them.  I observed  that

even  among  the  social  service  agencies,  the  knowledge  of

available  resources  for coping with  the  economic  crisis  is

fragmented and poorly understood.  The next obstacle for a needy

person,  after  she  or  he knows where  to  get  help,  is  the

overwhelming procedures involved in getting the help, especially

for  older persons and those who feel threatened by an  English-speaking institution and are illiterate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the myriad schemes offered by

Government,  including CDCs, CCCs, Women's Executive  Committees

and  all  the Family Service Centres and other civic bodies  are

not  sufficiently  publicised  and  disseminated  to  the  needy

families.   This is the reason why I applaud the  volunteers  in

the CDCs for taking the pain to go to the needy homes, listen to

their problems, help to fill up the forms by detailing the  sort

of problems to be tackled and then fax over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>

to  CDC  staff for them to follow up their support  function  by

contacting the relevant authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painstaking exercise, for me, is "grassroots

democracy" at its best.  I hope this effort will repeat in every

constituency.    By  mobilising  all  these  volunteer   groups,

residents  in  the community and CDC staff, we are  revitalising

the "gotong royong" spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy is to bring the bureaucracy to the man-in-the-street like what the CDCs did by setting up an employment

hotline,  employment  information and  exhibitions  in  shopping

malls  and  working closely with MOM to help residents  fill  up

employment  forms.   I  hope more of these will  continue  which

would   clearly  break  up  the  tyranny  of  the  "bureaucratic

leadership"  which  Mr  Chiam  See  Tong  cautioned  us  against

yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third focus is more of what the Government can do in the

area  of  rents, fees, taxes on utilities and assistance schemes

to  help  the  cashflow situation of ordinary folks.   The  cost

reduction package announced yesterday had gone beyond  what  the

CSC  has recommended, for which we should be thankful.  However,

Sir,  another  5,000  more people will  be  losing  their  jobs,

bringing our total unemployed to 25,000, according to recent MOM

estimates.   More  and more bankruptcies were  recorded  in  the

first  eight  months of this year.  What shall these  households

do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Government will consider

releasing  CPF monies to family members to pool their  resources

together  to  pay  for  their house mortgages.   The  presenting

problems,  however, of clients seeking help  in  Family  Service

Centres in the past six months were essentially difficulties  in

securing  employment, in meeting basic needs, children's  school

related expenses and lifestyle adjustment.  The hardest hit  are

single  parents from low income families whose situations worsen

when the search for permanent employment gets harder because  of

the poor job market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the special assistance schemes set up by NTUC, MCD and

MOM  will  respond  to  the critical needs of  these  vulnerable

groups  fast and generous enough.  I would like to know  if  any

emergency fund has been set up for Ministries to have access  to

when  they are called to respond to difficult cases and  whether

the criteria for application for these funds have been broadened

in recent months to meet the needs of vulnerable families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee yesterday urged us to build our "national

resilience" and "social cohesion" to stand together and maintain

a sense of common purpose.  Let us note that people under crisis

and struggling to survive, burning candles at both ends, are too

spiritually  and physically exhausted to be able  to  put  their

mettle  to test.  It is the rest of us who are better  off,  who

must,  in  partnership, stretch our "helping hands" to  pick  up

those  who are falling and slipping - this is truly for  me  the

ethos  of  strengthening our shared experience of adversity  and

struggle.   In the scheme of things, whose helping hand  is  the

firmest  and  the most able to be generous - the Government,  of

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth focus is more of what NTUC Fairprice has done by

cutting down the cost of living by price reductions.  It  was  a

generous  move.  And as a direct beneficiary, I look forward  to

more  cuts  in even more items in January 1999.  I  applaud  the

adoption of NTUC Income for helping insurance policy holders and

borrowers pay their premiums and housing loans, and a whole  lot

of  other measures to alleviate their financial pains.   To  me,

NTUC sets the exemplary standards in proactively moderating  the

impact  of  the  economic crisis on daily  costs  of  living  of

ordinary people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth focus is more stress on fast response time in all

Ministries  by  providing efficient and shorter processing  time

required  for  some  of the assistance schemes  offered  by  the

Government.  Maybe our bureaucracies could consider  engaging  a

corps  of paid part-time residents or retrenched persons  to  do

the tiresome liaison work of attending to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>

applications, giving appropriate information, filling  up  forms

and  completing the follow-up detail actions.  The devil  is  in

the  detail,  as  we  say.  An economic crisis  requires  crisis

intervention  skills which are fast, efficient and effective  to

ensure  that those affected have the information and  access  to

critical services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I have been travelling around in the region

in  the  last six months and most foreigners I met had  conveyed

such excellent remarks about how Singaporeans and our Government

have tackled the economic crisis with remarkable discipline  and

caution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deep disappointment with this Report is its lack of long-term strategic thinking on the value of the social fundamentals

as  social  capital, which is crucial for human development  and

critical for honing a competitive society.  By social capital, I

mean  the  network  of institutions and relationships  that  are

important  for  the productive functioning of  a  society.   The

network  includes the families, community bodies, social service

agencies,  civic bodies which are connected by shared ethos  and

collective memories of a place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible as they are in their contribution in terms of

dollars  and  cents  to  business productivity,  social  capital

provides  the  sealant  in  community  bonding  and  the  social

stability   upon   which   economic   competitiveness   thrives.

Resources  spent  on  people  services  help  to  moderate   the

phenomenon of marginalisation and alienation among pockets of  a

population  that  can  undermine social stability.   The  effort

includes  more financial and employment support to  groups  with

special   needs,   for  example,  the  disabled   and   mentally

challenged;  and  more support across the  board  for  voluntary

organisations which repair the broken pieces of people's lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government truly regards its role just as

important  as businesses, and if the latter are going  to  enjoy

lower  rentals in State-owned enterprises, can it not also grant

free  rent for one year, or perhaps considerable rent deductions

to all VWOs operating on void decks?  I agree with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Koo  Tsai Kee that the 50-50 shared operating costs  between

State  and  the  VWOs is a generous formula  and  in  the  total

operating  costs,  rentals are not a major component.   However,

every  dollar  saved from rentals, averaging at about  $5,000  a

year is a whole lot of money for VWO, and what a relief it is to

save  some  money to run a service programme for the  community.

No   doubt,  we  can  raise  funds  by  organising  fund-raising

activities, but we all know how hard it is to raise  that  extra

dollar.   I hope the Government will give this request a serious

thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another noticeable omission in this Report was the neglect

of   the  family  as  one  of  the  drivers  in  the  millennium

competitiveness, requiring a strategic blueprint in mapping  the

synergy  between the public and private sectors in their efforts

of incorporating the agenda of family needs as part of workplace

reorganisation.   The Report registered, in two paragraphs,  the

value of pro-family work policies, such as flexi-wage and flexi-time  work  schedules.   There  are  many  more  family-friendly

policies to consider, such as childcare infrastructure, flexible

compensation structure, home-working opportunities, etc, that we

need to explore that will enhance productivity levels of men and

women in general, without sacrificing the needs of the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new mindset to organise people resources in both

the public and private sectors that is less discrete, more fuzzy

and  blurred,  but  no  less  ineffective  and  inefficient,   a

perspective  that  is  multi-disciplinary, multi-functional  and

cross-boundary.  Economics, politics, sociology, history,  moral

and  civic studies have to be cross-fertilised to guide the  way

we think and plan agendas for Singapore's competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the competitive Singaporean for the millennium is

someone who is clear in thinking, able to amass and process  the

information  around him, fast on his or her feet to  respond  to

crisis  and adapt to change, quick and hands-on with his  hands,

so that he or she is not just a talker but a doer, and feels the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>

compassion  for the needy and the vulnerable and for  Singapore,

which he or she calls "Home".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires more than what this Report had blue-printed to

produce  the Millennium Singaporean that will be the competitive

agent  to  bring  Singapore to the next higher level.   Engines,

machines  and  electronic  disc drives  are  only  part  of  the

competition.   The  other  part, and  a  major  one,  is  people

resource and their mindsets, values and spirit.  Perhaps the CSC

is  not  the  forum  for  presenting these  laudable  ideas.   I

therefore    propose   that   the   Singapore   21   Committee's

recommendations be used as Part Two addition to  the  Report  of

the  Committee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness,  bringing  into

sharp  focus  the  significance  of  social  capital  underlying

economic  constructs  that  will  make  Singapore  a   city   of

excellence and a society of distinction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do support the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  there  is a Chinese saying,  "Even  a  wise  man

sometimes makes a mistake, while a fool may once in a while come

out  with a good idea."  Having heard some 50 wise men and  wise

ladies  over  the  last three days, let me also  offer  my  non-

wiseman idea on the subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee announced yesterday the cost-cutting package for

Singapore.  Overall, I feel that this is a pro-business package.

Of  course, there are also some measures which may be said to be

pro-people.   But  I  must  say the vast  majority  of  measures

introduced are designed mainly for the benefit of the  business.

In  fact,  the  magnitude  of  some items  of  the  cost-cutting

measures  may  even  exceed  the expectations  of  the  business

community, for example, the foreign worker levy.  As far as  the

business community is concerned, it is good news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, DPM Lee cautioned that this package, though designed

to reduce business cost in Singapore to enhance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>

our  competitiveness, was no assurance of  a quick  recovery  to

the economy because the determinants are external and beyond our

control.   But I have a question, if these external factors, ie,

the  regional economic situation continues to deteriorate,  then

what  should we do?  We need to have  quicker measures to  react

to the new reality.  In fact, this package to tackle the current

crisis  is  just  some short-term measures.   The  Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) was originally set up to  look

into how to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore over the

next  ten  years.   It just so happened that a  currency  crisis

broke  out  very  soon  after the CSC was  formed,  and  it  was

suddenly landed with the responsibility of working out  some  ad

hoc  measures to help our businesses in Singapore tide over  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we do have a designated mechanism, an official

or  formal  mechanism, to deal with the sudden  emergence  of  a

crisis.   So,  with  the  experience gained  from  this  present

crisis,   perhaps we should seriously look into the  feasibility

of  setting up a permanent mechanism, a think-tank sort of body,

to deal with any crisis that may appear from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is something which the Government should consider

very  seriously.   The current crisis has also  highlighted  one

other point and, that is, our forecasts of the overall trends in

the  economy seem to be quite off the mark.  It appears that the

authorities   responsible  for  the  forecasts,  including   the

Government agencies and the universities, have not been able  to

accurately  forecast the trend of economic  development  in  the

region.   It looks like accurate economic forecast is even  more

difficult than weather forecast.  Sir, before anybody can   come

up  with  a more reliable mode of economic forecasting, I  would

suggest  that  the CSC should be kept alive as it  is  a  useful

mechanism to have, particularly when its composition is  a  good

mix  of  representatives from the business world.  Having  their

fingers  on  the pulse of the business world, these  businessmen

can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>

detect   every   movement  in  the  rapidly  changing   business

environment.   They are sensitive to changes  and  know  how  to

respond and react quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when faced with this serious

economic situation, the Ministers and senior civil servants have

decided to take the lead in taking a cut in their salaries. This

is  a very great inspiration to the people, and it has very far-reaching effects.  This is a clear indication to our people that

our leaders are sharing the pains with the people.  The proposed

pay-cuts  to  the  civil servants will save the Government  some

$176 million.  Of course, this is a very significant amount.  In

order  to  ensure that the sacrifices made by the Ministers  and

senior civil servants are made more significant, I suggest  that

the  Government make use of these savings to set up an emergency

fund  to  help the lower-income families which are presently  in

financial difficulties to tide over the current predicament.   I

hope  that the Minister for Finance will agree to this  proposal

of mine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to allocate sums of money from these savings to

the  various  Citizens' Consultative Committees  (CCCs)  welfare

funds  to carry out more welfare work because, with the  present

difficult  situation in our economy, the CCCs  are  finding   it

very  difficult to raise monies for their welfare funds.   So  I

hope  that we can make use of the savings from the pay  cuts  of

the  Ministers and  top civil servants to the CCCs to help their

constituents.  By so doing, I hope and I believe  it  will  also

help  to  strengthen  the  bond  between  the  people  and   the

Government.  This will not only give tangible help to those  who

are in need but also inspire our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the bread-and-butter issues. I hope that

the HDB would seriously consider lowering the selling prices  of

new  HDB  flats,  because over the past few years,  the  selling

prices of HDB flats have gone up quite a lot.  Granted that  HDB

flats  are still considerably cheaper than private developments,

we cannot fail to take cognizance of the fact that the prices of

private  properties  have  already fallen  substantially.   This

will,  in  turn,  affect  the prices  of  HDB  flats.   Besides,

building

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>

materials  and  construction cost have also fallen considerably.

For  example, I understand that the prices of cement,  which  is

one of the very important building materials, have gone down  by

about  30% in the past couple of years.  With such cost  savings

from cheaper building materials and pay cuts of the workers,  it

is  obvious  that the construction costs of HDB  flats  will  be

lowered  and  HDB should pass on these savings  to  the  people,

especially the first-time buyers, the young couples.  Right now,

these  young people have to accept a lower starting pay,  or  to

wait longer to get a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one other matter that we should concern

ourselves  with,  and  that is, with  the  announcement  of  the

Government package, how are we going to ensure that this package

will give real benefits to the end consumers.  For example,  the

hawkers,  the  food courts, and so on, when are  they  going  to

lower their prices so as to lighten the burden on the consumers?

Mr  Ang Mong Seng suggested holding a "National Sales Campaign".

Actually,  shopkeepers  and  hawkers  who  find  their  business

thinning  away are already giving special offers  and  sales  in

desperate attempts to attract customers.  The question  is:  for

those  who  are doing a roaring business, how are  we  going  to

convince  them  to  lower their prices?   I  think  we  can  use

administrative measures and increase competition.  For  example,

the  Ministry  of  Trade  and Industry could  call  up  all  the

business   associations,   the   hawkers'   associations,    the

shopkeepers' associations and remind them that they should  pass

on  at least in part, if not in full, some of their savings from

these  cost-cutting  measures, to the  consumers.   I  think  we

should  also  encourage the NTUC to open up more coffeeshops  at

suitable locations so that there will be more competition in the

retail  food  industry.  This will help to  lower  the  cost  of

living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion as proposed by the Minister for Trade  and

Industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last 14 months, many Singaporeans have experienced

the effects of the regional financial crisis.  Some are affected

financially  while  others  are affected  psychologically.   The

crisis  has  made all Singaporeans learnt one important  lesson,

that is:  `Do not take things for granted'.  Economies can fall,

diplomatic  relations can sour, property and  stock  prices  can

fall, income can reduce, and our quality of life can drop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, many Singaporeans understand that they are much more

fortunate  than many people in other countries.  This  fortunate

situation does not happen by chance.  It is the foresight of our

Government and our prudent management of the economy  that  have

sheltered Singaporeans from the vagaries of the regional crisis.

That is why the Government is now again rallying the support  of

all  Singaporeans to take tough measures to position  themselves

in the global market in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of crisis, all of us must make sacrifices and take a

longer  viewpoint  in  our  actions and  deeds.   In  this  way,

Singapore  will  be  able to cope with  the  crisis  and  emerge

stronger as a more competitive economy in the global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) has indeed

done a very comprehensive study to spearhead Singapore into  the

next  millennium.   Although many visions  and  strategies  were

recommended in the Report, it would be better if more details on

targets and method statements could be highlighted to guide  the

respective Ministries, statutory boards or companies to  achieve

the desired outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government has accepted the cost-cutting

package  to  increase  Singapore's competitiveness.   But,  with

falling  demand  from  regional  economies,  I  would  urge  the

Government  to  take  aggressive  measures  to  strengthen   the

capabilities of our local firms and increase the market share of

their products and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to offer some suggestions for the Government

to consider:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Market Diversification</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with limited resources, Singapore has no

choice  but  to depend on foreign investors and other countries'

economies. Therefore, it is crucial for Singapore to  widen  its

business  dealings  with more countries so  as  to  cushion  the

effects of fluctuating economies in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to identify suitable products and services, which

are  in  demand  in  these markets.  We need to  develop  market

niches.   Potential  areas  include  consultancy  services   for

housing,  industrial park, health, R&D, and education  services.

As  for consumer products, we must form strategic alliances with

MNCs  to  penetrate specific markets.  Singapore has  the  Asian

culture and goodwill to become trustworthy partners of MNCs.   I

would  urge  the Government to set up a task force to  focus  on

strategic alliances with MNCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be successful in market diversification, it is also essential

for  local firms to have strategic marketing.  Many local  firms

are family businesses and may lack the exposure in international

marketing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Trade and Development Board has been searching for

more  new  markets,  we need the expertise of private  marketing

firms, especially our own top marketing firms, to conduct market

research  and  sell  our  products and  services.   I  hope  the

Government can consider engaging the services of local marketing

firms by paying them a retainer fee.  These marketing firms  can

then  be  engaged  by  local firms, on a commission  basis,  for

increasing their sales overseas.

<br><br><i>Building world class companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the idea of nurturing our local companies to be

world-class  companies.  The CSC has proposed that  GLCs  should

kick-start   the  process  as  they  have  the   resources   and

experience.   Although  the GLCs can  take  the  initiative,  we

should also, at the same time, support promising local firms  to

be   world-class  companies.   Doing  business  is   all   about

networking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>

and  business acumen.  To succeed in strengthening our  external

wing, the Government must provide resources and take a stake  in

both  GLCs and private firms to strengthen their competitiveness

internationally.

<br><br><i>Strengthening Small and Medium Local Enterprises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has surfaced some weaknesses in our

SMEs, especially in financial planning and management.  In order

to  play  a supporting or partnership role to MNCs and GLCs,  we

must  upgrade the management capabilities of our SMEs.  Although

there  are  many  Government schemes to assist  SMEs,  not  much

guidance  has  been given to position our SMEs to  be  strategic

partners of MNCs and GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to provide a scheme whereby

SMEs   can  engage  professional  management  firms  to  conduct

management  audit to streamline their operations and  strengthen

their  competitiveness.  These audits should focus  on  building

capabilities  instead  of merely cost  cutting  measures.   Such

audits  must  also  be conducted regularly, maybe  on  a  3-year

basis,  to ensure that SMEs are kept viable and relevant to  our

economy.   We must also set criteria to measure the  success  of

all  Government  assistance schemes in order to make  sure  that

they add value to our local firms and our economy.

<br><br><i>Cost Cutting Measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cost cutting measures are inevitable, we should

seriously  analyse the impact of these measures on Singaporeans,

especially  the  lower  income groups.  It  is  timely  for  the

Government to reconvene the Cost Review Committee to  study  the

public's  concerns  regarding the rising  cost  of  living.   We

should also study the expected standard of living and quality of

life of Singaporeans in the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted by the Asiaweek of 40

cities,  Singapore does not rank consistently high in  terms  of

standard of living and quality of life, especially in areas such

as housing, hospital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>

beds  and cars.  We need to determine a balance between standard

of living, cost of living and quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be the hub of Asia and attract foreign talent, Singapore

must benchmark its quality of life with comparable cities in the

world.  Unless this is achieved, it will be difficult to attract

top foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short term, I hope the Government can cushion

the  impact  of  the  cost cutting package  on  Singaporeans  by

adopting the following measures:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide a one-off 15% personal income tax rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Provide a one-off subsidy for pupils in pre-school and

kindergarten centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Reduce the car park fees for HDB and URA car parks by 15%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide more tax relief for Singaporeans who upgrade

themselves through skills training including professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Encourage banks to allow HDB shops and hawker stalls to

restructure their loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Increase the S&C rebate to HDB residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Increase the National Servicemen's allowance to boost the

morale of SAF servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Exercise more flexibility to allow parents to send their

children to nearby schools so as to reduce their transport  cost

burden.  This could be achieved by having more pupils per  class

or building more classrooms in existing schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>5.50 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like most of

my colleagues and as the last speaker on the list, I too support

and agree with the motion standing in the name of the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Committee represents what is by far the most

comprehensive  study since the mid-80s to address the  immediate

problems and the long-term

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>

strategies  to  keep Singapore on the right track  of  sustained

economic growth and development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in this House, we heard the DPM giving the

Government's response to the CSC recommendations.  The  response

has been most encouraging.  It shows that our Government takes a

very  serious view in dealing with our immediate problems.   The

measures  that have been proposed so far are broad ranging.   It

seeks to deal with our immediate problem of business cost in one

fell  swoop rather than to deal with it in a piece-meal  manner.

These  cost  cutting measures no doubt will cheer  the  business

sector.   This should send a very strong and positive signal  to

our people and foreign investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures introduced by the Government could not have come at

a  more appropriate time.  The regional economic crisis,  as  we

all  know,  has  led  to  a deepening of contrast  in  the  cost

competitiveness of the economies of the region.   The  weakening

of  the  currencies  in  some  of  the  more  severely  affected

countries has made Singapore, which is relatively unaffected  by

the crisis, a much more expensive place to do business in.  This

is  no  good  for us, especially when our economy is  very  much

export  driven.   Just looking at the cost  of  business  alone,

Malaysia,  Thailand and Indonesia, by virtue of  their  currency

depreciation, which in some cases depreciated by more than  100%

against  the US dollar since early last year, are now that  much

more competitive against Singapore's exports.  This, if not  for

the  other political problems that are confronting some  of  the

countries  in  the  region,  would  have  made  these  countries

extremely  attractive alternative places for direct  investments

or relocation of investments from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that cost cutting measures taken by our

Government  will  help  to  provide  immediate  relief  to   our

businesses, cutting business cost alone is not going to  be  the

only  long  term solution to sustaining or improving Singapore's

competitiveness  against the region and the whole  world.   More

must  be  done.  Indeed, this was recommended by the  Committee.

In general, one must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>

go  beyond the symptomatic approach of cost cutting to one where

paradigm  shifts and other strategies would have to be  engaged.

To the credit of the Committee, this was the approach taken.  As

an  example, the Committee has boldly recommended that we should

move  away  from investor protection approach in regulating  the

securities  industry  to  one  where  the  authorities  play   a

supervising  role,  ensuring  that the  market  is  sufficiently

transparent  to  allow the investor to make his own  independent

judgment about investment decisions.  Leaving aside the question

of   whether  or  not  this  is  an  acceptable  approach,   the

recommendation  does  suggest  a rather  radical  shift  in  the

thinking of our policy makers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some ways, our country is now at the crossroads. The

economic crisis has brought upon us hardships for our people and

our  businesses.  Yet, at the same time, there are opportunities

and  challenges  that present itself.  We have  been  relatively

unaffected by the contagion of the region.  Yet, we cannot  rest

on our complacence and not take advantage of this opportunity to

pull  ahead of competition.  In that sense, we should now  seize

this opportunity to redefine some of our economic goals and  the

means by which these goals may be attained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has identified several strategies, by which it is

hoped would help preserve Singapore's status as one of the  most

competitive states in the world.  Most of the strategies did not

come as a surprise.  However, there are also many which are seen

as bold initiatives for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support, in principle, the proposals of the Committee as

set out in the Report.  The vision, as articulated by the

Committee, is one that I agree with, ie, making Singapore an

advanced and globally competitive knowledge economy within the

next decade, with manufacturing and services as the twin engines

of growth.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is easy to identify with the broad proposals of the

Committee,  I do have a number of issues which I would  like  to

raise  in  this  House.  Time does not permit me  to  cover  the

proposals in a comprehensive manner.  I shall confine myself  to

only some of the recommendations.

<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services as Twin Engines</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the importance of manufacturing and services

as  important engines of growth for our economy.  Indeed,  since

independence,  our  high economic growth has  been  led  by  the

manufacturing sector; hence, the emphasis on manufacturing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise manufacturing as providing the engine of

growth, I note, at the same time, our high dependence on  multi-national corporations (MNCs).  We are no doubt grateful to these

MNCs   for  bringing  investments  to  Singapore  and  providing

Singaporeans with employment.  However, we should recognise that

MNCs  are  not indigenous companies.  They are more likely  than

local  companies  to  pull out their investments  and  cut  down

operations in Singapore when it is expedient for them to do  so.

We  have  seen this in the mid-80s and how our employees  became

displaced in the process.  These MNCs do not owe us a living and

we do not expect them to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of manufacturing, we should therefore hedge

against  this  dislocation by continuing to concentrate  on  our

local  enterprises.  We should build on our local  manufacturing

bases.  The Report has quite correctly pointed out that we  need

to build up a strong capability in all parts of the value chain.

Hopefully,  we  can nurture enough local companies  with  strong

capabilities  that  will  provide an alternative  base  for  the

manufacturing  sector.  In this regard, we have  much  to  learn

from  Taiwan  where the strength of the local small  and  medium

enterprises  have  helped  to shelter the  country  against  the

forces of contagion which have affected the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recognise the need to strengthen our local

manufacturing capability.  We should do more to help  our  small

and  medium  enterprises (SMEs).  We recognise  that  our  SMEs,

because of their size, have inherent limitations.  I have spoken

to many operators of SMEs and their feedback has a very familiar

ring  about it; limited access to funds, stiff competition  from

Government-linked   companies,  and  a   perception   that   the

Government does not take them seriously enough.  I took  a  look

at the participants of the CSC Report and I was sad to note that

a  committee  as  important as this, and for all the  importance

that  we  have attached to local companies, we have not included

the   Association  of  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  in   the

Committee.  Sir, I think this is a glaring omission.  I must, at

this  moment, declare my interest in the matter as a  member  of

the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we have various incentive schemes for the small

and  medium  enterprises.  However, the feedback I got  is  that

these  schemes are rather difficult to apply for.  The  red-tape

that  the  applicant  has to go through is discouraging  enough.

Take, for instance, the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.  Will

the  Minister  kindly enlighten us on the extent  to  which  our

local  companies have been successful in applying for  financial

assistance through the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme in  the

last six months?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have often heard the lament from our local

businesses that every time they are reasonably successful in  an

area  of  business,  the big local boys,  in  the  form  of  the

Government-linked companies, will either come  to  compete  with

them, often unfairly because of their sheer size, or to buy them

over.   We  have  seen this before, whether it  is  in  property

development,  construction or even in the pastry business.   The

net effect of competition from the larger companies has been  to

crowd  out  the smaller companies.  Sir, we should,  as  far  as

possible, refrain from doing this if we are ever going  to  give

these  small and medium enterprises a fighting chance.  I  would

therefore urge that the new economic promotion agency

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>

should  not repeat our oversight of concentrating on big foreign

investments  to  the  exclusion  of  the  smaller   players   in

Singapore.

<br><br><i>Strengthening the External Wing</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing the external wing as a means to hedge against

the risk of over reliance on the local economy is often seen  as

a  sound and effective strategy of our Government.  It has  been

more  than five years since we heard and, for some, heeded  that

call.   During that time, I can say that the experience of those

who have ventured overseas has been rather varied and different.

Some  have found their investments profitable; most others  have

found the going tough.  Singaporeans, in their venture overseas,

have tended to rely on areas that they are most comfortable with

and   perhaps   with  the  most  experience  in.   Consequently,

Singapore  investments overseas are most visible  in  industrial

parks,  hotel developments and office complexes.  Unfortunately,

these  are  investments  that call for substantial  infusion  of

capital  and with long clawback periods for the initial  capital

injection.   The  extended period of time required  makes  these

investments  rather vulnerable to the vagaries of  the  internal

and external economies and politics.  When these companies first

ventured overseas, little did they realise that dealing with the

local  governments and appreciating the extent  that  the  local

politics  can make a difference to the extent of the success  of

the venture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our Suzhou Industrial Park, for example. This is

often  seen  and  is, in fact, often touted as the  flagship  of

Singapore's regionalisation programme overseas.  If we  look  at

the  development of the Suzhou Industrial Park,  we  have  every

reason  to  be proud of its standing as representing  everything

that  Singapore  stands  for.   Yet,  it  was  not  without  its

difficulty.   Some  years ago, we realised to our  consternation

that  the  Mayor  of Suzhou was undermining our  development  by

promoting a rival industrial park there.  It took the efforts of

our  Government and the influence of our Senior Minister Lee  to

put  our position firmly with the Chinese that they cannot  take

us for a ride.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suzhou Industrial Park has the support of our

Government.   What  about the other private Singapore  investors

who  answered the call of our Government to go overseas and  who

run into difficulties with unreasonable and bureaucratic foreign

officials?   Can our Government be there for them?  I  note  the

recommendation  of  the Committee to encourage  local  investors

overseas  to  pool their resources together.  Sir, this  is  not

enough.   We  should  have  strong Government  backing  for  our

overseas investments.  This may be given through the setting  up

of  specific Governme nt agencies, other than TDB, which can  be

relied  upon  to  assist our investors in a more dedicated  way.

This can include, for instance, helping them to resolve problems

at  the  Governmental  level.  For countries  like  Vietnam  and

China,   businesses  are  often  carried  out  with   government

agencies.   If  a  framework  can  be  established  whereby  our

Government  can lend some official support and is  able  to  use

that to get the cooperation of their counterpart in the relevant

places  in these countries, I believe it will help our investors

go a long way with their investment.

<br><br><i>Building world class companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended that to be globally

competitive, we need to be able to build up a stable of our  own

world-class  companies with core competencies that  can  compete

effectively in the global economies.  To kick-start the process,

it  is  recommended that Government-linked companies with  their

present  size, core capabilities and share of talents, are  best

placed  to lead the drive to kick-start the process of  building

world-class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that we should build up a stable of

world-class  companies, nurturing our own  companies  to  attain

world  class  status is not the only way.   In my  speech  at  a

Budget debate, I had argued that we could have leap-frogged  the

process by taking over some of the companies with leading  brand

names in the world.  This may be more advantageous than trying to

nurture world-class

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>

companies, as this gives us almost immediate  access

to   markets   and  also  the  cutting  edge  in   technological

developments.   Rather than inventing the wheel, we  should  buy

the  wheel  and make further improvements to it.   We  have  the

money for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, choosing our Government-linked companies to lead in

the  process  of  creating world-class companies raises  certain

underlying  issues about these companies and  their  roles.   We

know that Government-linked companies play an important role  in

the  development  of  our economies and have,  to  some  extent,

helped  build  our national profile in the global economy.   Our

favoured son, Singapore Airlines, for instance, has always  made

us proud as an example of a world-class carrier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore Airlines is but one of the more

prominent  example of the many Government-linked companies  that

we have in our stable.  Over the last decade, numerous companies

and  subsidiaries  linked to the Government have  been  spawned,

especially   when  Government  functions  and  departments   are

increasingly being privatised and corporatised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-linked companies are unusual and in a way

different  from  the  ordinary  private  sector  companies.   In

shareholdings  and  management,  these  companies   have   close

linkages  to  the Government.  For many of these companies,  our

Government  holds  a substantial portion, if  not  all,  of  the

shareholdings  in  them.  Their corporate  management  is  often

staffed  by  those  who are seconded from the civil  service  or

those  who  had  retired from the civil  service.   Their  close

association  with the Government has given these companies  some

advantages   in  their  dealings  with  clients  and   financial

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Government-linked companies are listed in the

stock exchange and are thus subjected to the requirements of the

stock exchange to observe the on-going process of corporate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>

disclosures  of  information.   This  requirement  of   relative

transparency provides some amount of discipline on the  part  of

the  company and is often seen as a principle of good  corporate

governance.   In  a sense, shareholder and market accountability

helps to protect the shareholders' interest in their investments

in the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is fine with listed companies. The question

remains about the unlisted ones.  For these companies, which are

not  listed on the stock exchange, the perception is  that  they

may  not  be  subjected to the same discipline of accountability

and  control as the listed ones.  The conduct of these companies

is  quite naturally not as transparent as those that are  listed

on   the  stock  exchange.   There  is  not  enough  information

filtering through about these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of ordinary companies, it is understandable

that  there is some amount of privacy that must be observed,  as

these are private shareholders' funds.  In the way in which  the

private limited companies have developed, it is meant to provide

the  benefits of limited liability without at the same  time  of

having  the  undue  burden  of  disclosing  too  much  corporate

information  about the company, other than perhaps the  accounts

filed with the Registry of Companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are some who feel that private

limited  companies of the Government are not  private.   Because

the  funds held in these companies are those which belong to the

public,  there is some expectation that these companies be  made

more  transparent through greater disclosures to the public  and

adopting  good principles of governance, which in this case  may

include  indexes, for example, to show the extent of the  return

on  capital, and subjecting the managers to the same  forces  of

the  market discipline of hire and fire.  This will provide some

assurance  to the public that even private limited companies  of

the  Government are properly run.  I am not saying for a moment,

Sir,  that  these companies are not properly run.  On the  other

hand, I will be the first to say that we have some of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>

best  companies  in this stable.  However, as the  saying  goes,

justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that these concerns have been generated in

recent  months by the high profile failures and acquisitions  of

some of our Government-linked companies.  The concern that I  am

expressing is that unless we can impose a framework for  greater

discipline  among these companies, we may be exposing  ourselves

to  greater weaknesses by encouraging these companies to  become

world-class  companies.  Spectacular world-class  companies  may

also   suffer  from  spectacular  world-class  failures.   These

companies  are  not  created overnight  by  pouring  in  massive

capital  alone.  Therefore, I would cite caution in the  way  in

which we approach this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one more point that I would like to touch on

before moving on.  Over the years, we have engendered the growth

of   Government-linked  companies  that  are   multi-disciplined

conglomerates.  We have GLCs, for instance, that have  interests

ranging from shipbuilding and repair to food retail outlets.  In

recent years, it became fashionable to form property development

companies.  The fact is that many of our GLCs are into  property

development and are often in direct competition with each other.

This  form  of  competition has resulted in  needless  waste  of

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we get lost in the myriad of investment activities, we

should  ask  ourselves whether each GLC should seek to  redefine

itself in terms of its core mission rather than reaching out all

over, like the proverbial octopus.  I would argue that our  GLCs

should   take  a  step  backwards  and  re-examine  its  mission

statement.  To avoid wastage from unnecessary competition,  GLCs

should restructure its group holdings, get rid of its peripheral

businesses  and be single-minded by concentrating  on  its  core

business  and  competition if it wants to compete on  the  world

stage as a world-class company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its sectoral report, the Committee recommended a number

of  strategies to help make Singapore a premier financial hub in

the  region.  Among some of the strategies recommended  included

the  point  that  financial institutions should  be  allowed  to

assume  higher  risk  profiles that they  are  comfortable  with

within  prudential  limit.  Along with the  suggestion,  it  was

stated that the authorities should move away from protecting the

individual  investors  to  focusing on protecting  the  industry

against systemic risks.  The Committee also reported that  over-protecting investors from specific asset risks also means losing

out on potentially lucrative opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the stand taken by the Government

has  always  been on the basis of caveat emptor.  It also  means

that  it  is  not the business of the Government to ensure  that

every  investment  made  by its people  will  be  rewarded  with

success.  While I agree with that principle, I would submit that

there  is a difference between allowing the people  to make  the

final  choice of business as opposed to maintaining a  framework

to  ensure information flow which is backed by legal sanction if

necessary, to allow investors to make the appropriate choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Under our present laws, it would be an

offence for anyone to offer securities to members of the  public

without  complying with the necessary requirements of disclosure

through  a  prospectus that must be filed with the  Registry  of

Companies.   The Act sets out the type and nature of information

that   must  be  provided  in  detail.   The  purpose  of   such

requirement, presumably, is to ensure that investors get  enough

information about the company to make intelligent choices.  Such

requirements serve to protect the investors well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, such policy of investor protection does not

seem  to  be  applied uniformly.  We seek to  protect  investors

under the Act in their investments in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>

securities.   However,  there  seems  to  be  a  gap  in   their

protection  when it comes to property investments overseas.   We

see  many  of  these  sad  stories in respect  of  our  people's

investments in China.  I remember, in the early days some  years

ago, when China projects were first launched in Singapore, there

was  an  air  of excitement.  For land scarce Singaporeans,  the

prospect  of  owning  a piece of sizable real  estate  in  China

cheaply  and  at  a  price  which was  extremely  affordable  is

something which is very attractive.  I remember saying to myself

then  that  it seemed a little anomalous that while we  required

people who sell securities to members of the public to make such

detailed disclosures in the prospectuses,  such requirements are

not necessary for people who sell properties in Singapore.  I do

not  think  the  developers who promote these projects  have  to

swear   statutory  declarations  about  the   truth   of   their

advertisements,  neither  were they required  to  file  complete

details  about their companies or its track record,  or  provide

performance bonds to any trustee in respect of the promotion  of

their  developments.   Yet,  at  that  time,  there  were   many

Singaporeans who went to such exhibitions and bought  properties

purely on the basis of scale models of developments.  I remember

telling myself that some of these investors could get themselves

into trouble because of these relatively lax requirements.  Some

years  later,  I was right.  These days, it is not uncommon  for

people  to  complain about how they have been short  changed  in

their  property purchases in China, and the sad  truth  is  that

there is very little they could do about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that while we may want to concentrate on

focusing  on  insulating our industry from  systemic  risks,  we

cannot,  at  the same time, neglect our moral responsibility  of

having   to   protect  our  own  investors  against   the   more

unscrupulous promoters.  On the contrary, I would argue that  we

should review our laws to see how we may strengthen our laws  to

protect our investors even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the strategies recommended by the CSC and the

measures introduced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>

by  the  Government are indeed comprehensive and broad  ranging.

Our  journey has only just begun.  However, while the  Committee

can  point us to the direction which Singapore should take,  for

many  of these strategies, there is substantial work to be done.

I have no doubt that our Government would be able to rise to the

occasion.  I would urge all the people of Singapore to, at  this

time, close rank and stand behind our leaders as we work to pull

Singapore  out  of this most serious challenge in recent  years.

Together, we will succeed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all Members who have spoken

in support of the motion and for their strong endorsement of the

recommendations of the CSC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all, except possibly the Opposition Members, have

strongly  supported the recommendations, and this  is  extremely

encouraging  for  the  CSC  members  and  all  others  who  have

contributed to the work.  In fact, it is difficult to understand

why the Opposition Members are not supportive, because it is  so

obvious  that the economy is in crisis and that it is  necessary

for all Singaporeans to pull together to ride out this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee has said, we are facing the toughest crisis

since  independence.  So it is important that we  do  the  right

things  and send the right message to the investors and stay  on

top of the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy that the Government has accepted the Report

and all the key recommendations.  In fact, the package of short-term  measures  that  the Government has announced  exceeds  the

expectations  and the quantum is $10.5 billion,  which  is  more

than  the  figure  of $10 billion that the CSC  recommended.   I

think  the feedback from the ground is that people are generally

quite happy, including those who have been critical in the past,

because  they  did  not know what were the details  and  because

there was perhaps insufficient explanations at that time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the feedback, in fact, there was hardly any

dissenting voice.  One criticism that came to mind is the one by

Mr Peh Chin Hua, that the quality of the paper was too good.  If

that is all, then I think we are on the right track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee explained yesterday why we are taking this package

of  measures  and  why our position seems to have  changed  from

February  when  we  were still thinking that we  could  register

maybe  between 2.5% and 4.5% growth this year.  He has explained

that  the  whole world has changed.  In fact, just a  few  weeks

ago,  people were worried that there could be a global  economic

melt-down.  Because of the measures taken by the Federal Reserve

in  cutting  the interest rate and that the IMF package  is  now

being  put  together for Brazil, people are now  breathing  more

easily.  But I do not think we are out of the woods yet.  So  we

need to do our best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked how we arrived at this figure of

15%  cut  in  wage cost, whether it was based on  hard  numbers,

political bargaining or judgment.  The truthful answer  is  that

this  is  a gut feel.  It is based on our best judgment  of  the

situation,  based  on data that is available  and  also  on  the

understanding  of  the  overall  economic  situation   and   the

competition that we are facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, those companies which are now faced with a sharp

fall  in  demand  from the region, and these  are  mostly  local

companies, are the ones which are most severely affected.  As Dr

Wang  Kai Yuen has mentioned, the response that he got fell into

two  groups:  the local firms which are mainly directed  at  the

domestic  market  and the regional market.  They  are  the  ones

asking for more measures because their demand has fallen off and

they  are faced with cash flow problems and they need more help.

So they are the ones who are probably asking for the 20%-30% cut

in  their  cost.  On the other hand, some of the multi-nationals

who are here are in fact very pleased that we have been able  to

do  this.   And  Singapore is probably the only country  in  the

world  that  has  been able to mobilise everybody,  the  masses,

through our trade unions,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>

with   our   strong  tripartite  cooperation,  and   cut   wages

voluntarily,  including the CPF.  So this is  a  strong  message

that  we are sending to investors, that Singapore is a different

kind  of country.  We face up to the problems together,  and  we

are  determined  to  work together as a  team  to  overcome  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met somebody from one of the top multi-national companies

just  a  couple  of  weeks ago, and it was  his  first  time  in

Singapore.   He  is  from one of the top 500  companies  in  the

world.   He was utterly impressed and he said, "It is fantastic,

you  know.   You  have  this Singapore  Inc.  approach."   So  I

explained to him our measures and so on.  I hope at the  end  of

the  day, he is going to put in more investments into Singapore.

In fact, his question was: where are the workers?  So I told him

that  we  now  have a relatively high unemployment rate  and  we

intend  to allow more foreign workers in, if necessary,  and  we

are  upgrading the industry all the time.  For projects that  we

want,  like  this  particular project which is in  the  computer

area,  we  would try and free up the market and  allow  in  more

workers.   So,  as  I said, I hope we will get some  investments

from that company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the MNCs which have links with the region, which have,

for example, subsidiary companies in Batam, and they are able to

continue  operating,  they are less affected  by  the  financial

crisis.  These companies are able to take advantage of the lower

cost as a result of the devaluation of currencies, and they  are

happy.   There  are also other sectors like the shipyards  which

are  doing  all  right because their costs are local  and  their

revenues are in US dollars.  So they find that they are now more

competitive  because they are competing with  Middle-east  yards

and the currencies of the Middle-east are still strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having said all that, I think the general feeling of

the  Ministry  and  our statutory boards is that  we  have  lost

competitiveness.  The key figure that stands out is this loss of

market share in the US.  As I mentioned in my speech,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>

kicking off this debate, our share of exports of electronics  to

the  US has fallen by about two percentage points, from 9.3%  to

7.3%, over a period of only 1 1/2 years or so.  So that is  very

worrying for us because electronics form a very major sector  of

our  economy, especially in the manufacturing sector,  and  they

employ  many  workers.  For the exports of non-oil  manufactured

products, of that figure, more than 60% are electronics.  So you

must be able to compete in that area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the figures, we have seen increases in market share

from  countries like Mexico, because of the NAFTA  factor,  from

the  Philippines, even from the PRC, even though they  have  not

devalued  their renminbi.  It shows how competitive their  costs

are.   In  the case of the Philippines, they were under the  IMF

regime  until recently.  They have not had the excesses  of  the

other   neighbouring  countries.   So  their  economy  is  still

functioning and I believe they are now very attractive to  quite

a  number  of  investors.   We see, for example,  that  Japanese

companies are going there to manufacture disk drives,  and  they

will offer stiff competition to us here.  Most of our disk drive

manufacturers  are  from the US and we are one  of  the  biggest

manufacturers in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the feeling is that we have a gap over them in terms of

capability,  in  terms  of supporting industries,  in  terms  of

efficiency, but the gap is narrowing.  We have to cut our costs.

Basically, the decision is that this time round, we must do a re-calibration of our costs downwards - wage costs and  other  cost

factors - and especially the land cost factor.  Because the  way

the  property market has been booming, it causes a lot of ripple

effects,  not  only  in  terms of  the  market  rates  that  the

Government will have to try and peg for our industrial land  but

also  in  terms of the other effects, the way they work  through

the  system, since land cost is a factor in every area,  whether

it is transportation or utility, or what-have-you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment is that we do have to do a re-calibration, and

that  is why we came up with this figure.  I think 15% is  about

right,  not too much, not too little.  Of course, we  only  know

when we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>

implement and we see what is the outcome.  And if we have to  do

more,  then we must do more.  But if we do better than expected,

then there could be corrections, there will be better bonus  for

employees and so forth.  Basically, this cut of 15% of wage cost

will  bring us back to the level of 1994, and at that  situation

we  were still very competitive.  In fact, the economy then  was

growing  close  to 10% rate and the worry was  that  the  labour

market was getting too tight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to look at this is that in 1985, when we had a

similar recession and the GDP declined by about 2%, the CPF  was

cut  by  15 percentage points, and that is equivalent to 12%  of

wage  cost.  This time round, the assessment is that the  crisis

is  more severe because it is a world-wide problem now.   So  we

have to take more drastic measures.  If you look at the currency

values  too,  the  neighbouring currencies have  depreciated  by

about  20%  to  30% between 1st July last year  and  the  latest

figure,  as  compared to Singapore of about 12%.  The currencies

have  recovered  recently but we still have this  gap  over  the

neighbouring countries of about 15% or so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have given Members some idea of how we sort of did a

gut feel, assessed the situation, and came out with this figure.

We  do  not  want to overdo it because it is a balance.   If  we

overdo   it,  then  people  become  very  depressed   and   very

pessimistic, and this could also dampen the demand in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to this point about the printing cost being too

expensive,  I was thinking, when I listened to the Member,  that

if  we  had spent less money on poorer quality paper,  it  would

have  meant less business for the printers.  So it is a balance.

Do  you  want  to  save  cost or do you want  to  stimulate  the

economy?  So we have to strike a balance here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is true that this $7 billion cut of wage

cost  may  have some dampening effect on the economy.  Of  that,

about  $4  billion  will be CPF.  So there is no  withdrawal  of

funds  from the economy.  But the balance could result  in  some

withdrawal of funds.  So I hope the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>

Minister for Finance will consider this factor and bring forward

some  stimulatory projects in the new budget and go for a bigger

budget  deficit,  so that we will be able to  keep  the  economy

going.  The world-wide signal now is that it is time to reflate,

but at the same time, we must be able to compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a criticism from quite a few Members that these

measures came too late.  I have to answer this criticism because

I  have been very involved in the whole process.  If Members may

recollect,  the  Prime Minister said, as far  back  as  November

1996,  that  he felt that our costs were getting  out  of  line.

Therefore, he was suggesting that we should have a committee  to

review the cost situation.  And that is how the CSC came  to  be

formed  in May.  We could have formed it earlier but, of course,

we  had elections and all the process that we had to go through.

So this Committee was formed in May.  And when we first started,

all of us were looking way ahead.  The economy was booming away,

labour  was tight, turnover was high, job-hopping was a problem.

But  when this crisis came in July, the whole situation changed.

Now the worry is about unemployment rather than job-hopping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cast your mind back, at that time, the whole situation

was  in turmoil.  The currency market and the stock market  were

very  volatile.  Everybody was very careful and anxious  not  to

upset the market.  You do not want to send the wrong signal  and

say,  "Oh, things are going to be terrible!"  Because  then  the

market  would  really go down and it would be a  self-fulfilling

affair.  So when we came out with figures on GDP projections, we

tended   to  be  careful,  to  be  realistic,  but  not   overly

pessimistic.  So, at that time, we felt that we might  still  be

able, with our momentum of growth from past years, to make maybe

3%  growth.  So the package of measures were tailored  for  that

situation.  It was kind of a measured approach.  On hindsight, I

still  think  that was the best way to do it.  Now that  we  are

convinced  that  the storm is really on us  and  it  is  a  very

serious problem, our costs are really out of line, we have  come

out with a very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>

big  package of measures.  And we still have reserves  left,  in

case we have to do some more because the crisis is not over yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members mentioned the problem of liquidity. The feeling here is

that, generally, there has been no problem of liquidity squeeze.

I  think  DPM  Lee,  in  some answers  to  oral  questions,  has

explained that, in fact, the bank lending has continued to grow,

although at a slower rate.  The problem has been that the  banks

are now naturally more cautious, and rightly so, because some of

them are so exposed in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have liberalised the Local Enterprise Finance

Scheme,  and I am glad to report that in terms of the short-term

lending  for export factoring, for working capital,  the  demand

and  the quantum of loans have really gone up.  But in terms  of

loans  for  fixed assets, naturally companies are cautious.   So

the  quantum has not gone up that much.  The difficulty here  is

that we do not want to have a situation where our civil servants

try  and  second-guess  the bankers.   The  bankers  assess  the

applications  and they decide whether they are worth  supporting

or  not supporting.  As it is, we are sharing half the risk, and

we   are  giving  the  entire  spread  of  2 1/4%  on  both   the

Government's share as well as their share entirely to the banks.

That  means they are earning a spread of about 4 1/2%  on  their

loans.  It is, I think, adequate for the purpose.  But they have

to  assess whether it is worth their while and safe for them  to

lend.   In  cases  where the borrowers feel  that  they  deserve

something  better, they can go and see PSB,  and  then  PSB  can

perhaps  talk  to  the banks and discuss and see  whether  their

assessment is correct.  At the end of the day, the decision must

be  made  by  the  banks.  Having said  that,  we  are  open  to

suggestions.  We  are studying this all the  time.   If  we  can

liberalise this further in a safe way and extend this scheme  to

more sectors, we will be happy to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been concern for the retail sector, the sharp

decline in demand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>

as a result of the fall in tourist arrivals and the reduction in

local spending.  Here, I think it is important for us to go  out

and  get  more  business.  A short while ago, I was  just  at  a

function to present the Tourism Awards and I announced that  the

Singapore Tourism Board would be spending $30 million more  next

year in its marketing efforts.  This will be on top of the usual

$80 million per year that they spend on marketing.  So it is  an

increase  of 40%.  This will tie in with the new programme  they

have  to launch to welcome the new millennium.  And I hope, with

this  effort,  we  will be able to increase  our  share  of  the

tourism market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key thing here is that it is not enough just to cut cost.

We  must  all go out and try and get more business through  STB,

the  Trade Development Board and EDB, and they are all going  to

work that much harder to try and get business for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Members have spoken eloquently about the needs of the

individuals.  I think this is very important.  We not only  must

ensure that our costs are competitive but also that the needs of

individuals  who are affected are taken care  of.   One  way  of

doing  this  is through the CDCs, as mentioned by  quite  a  few

Members.  I personally will be in favour of providing more funds

to  the  CDCs.   But,  again,  this depends  on  the  Ministries

concerned.  Remember that I am talking here as Chairman  of  the

CSC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few speakers, including the last Member to speak, Mr Sin Boon

Ann,   have   been   quite  critical  of  the  Government-linked

companies.  I think some of the comments are valid.  Some of the

GLCs  have, in fact, strayed from their core business.  That  is

why  the  CSC  has come out with this recommendation  that  they

should focus on one area.  Even the big companies, like Sony and

others  have come to realise that they have gone into  too  many

areas.   They have gone into movies.  They have gone into  what-have-you  and realise that they have to go back and  concentrate

on  areas  which they know well, because there is only  so  much

managerial resource.  If you spread your management too  thinly,

then you cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>

look after the business properly.  So the recommendation of  the

Committee  is  that  the GLCs should refocus and  spearhead  our

efforts into particular areas and, hopefully, they will be  able

to  lead  us  in our regionalisation drive as well  by  bringing

along the supporting industries and the others.  This is an area

which,  I  believe,  Temasek Holdings will be looking  carefully

into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I want to touch on briefly is this long-term

vision  which  Members  have  supported  generally.   It  is  an

ambitious  but, I believe, achievable vision.  But it  may  take

longer than 10 years, I agree.  Some Members have said that,  in

fact,  this  vision is not entirely new and that is  also  true.

Because we have been going on this track all this while  and  it

goes  to show that we are on the right track.  I remember  that,

as far back as 1969, not quite 1969 when I joined EDB, but early

1970s,  we  were  already  talking  of  having  brain  services,

promoting  brain service industries.  So here, we  are  back  to

knowledge industries.  We have done a lot since then,  the  kind

of  manufacturing that we have gone into, wafer fabrication  and

all that.  We have moved into more knowledge and skill-intensive

areas,  and that is the correct thrust.  It is good for us  that

we  maintain this core of manufacturing.  I think Hong Kong  has

come  to realise too late.  They are hollowed out.  They  pushed

all  this to Shenzhen and elsewhere and even though that is part

of  China, and they are part of China, they have to compete very

hard.   And now, what is the role for Hong Kong?  That is  their

worry.  And that is why the CSC recommended that we should  have

both   manufacturing  and  services.   In  fact,  the  two   are

complementary.   A  lot  of the services actually  are  for  the

manufacturing,  whether  it  is  transportation,  logistics   or

financing.   So  our aim should be to promote  high  value-added

services and manufacturing together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key areas that we will have to strive for is to

try  and  develop  technopreneurship.  This is  the  idea  of  a

knowledge  economy  and  we  are studying,  of  course,  Silicon

Valley, looking at how Taiwan does it, how Israel does  it.   We

are investing a lot of money in R&D.  The question is: can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>

we  realise  more  returns from that?  It is good  to  build  up

capabilities and it is very important.  But, eventually, we must

be  able  to  have our own start-up companies,  float  them  and

develop our own indigenous companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to mention that the Government is taking

this  effort very seriously.  The Government has decided to  set

up a committee chaired by DPM Dr Tony Tan.  There is a committee

known  as  Technopreneur 21 Ministerial Committee (T21MC)  -  we

have  all  these acronyms nowadays - chaired by DPM Dr Tony  Tan

and  there will be three other Ministers on this Committee.   My

colleague, BG George Yeo, will be Deputy Chairman and the others

will be Mr Lim Hng Kiang and RAdm Teo Chee Hean.  So you can see

that  it is a very high-powered Committee.  The intention is  to

give  this  area  a big push because I think this  area  of  the

future, it has come with the development of computers, with  the

development  of IT.  We have Singapore One.  We  are  trying  to

make more use of it.  I think we are really at the cutting edge.

The question is whether we have the talent.  Can we attract more

people  to  come here?  Can we link up with other countries  and

achieve synergies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is one big area. The other area will be in the life

sciences.   Nowadays, it is possible for researchers  to  screen

drugs, millions of drugs in a short period of time.  So now with

all  these new areas of cloning, cloning of heart tissue and  so

on,  these  will  be new growth industries  of  the  future.   I

realise there will be a lot of ethical problems as well.   These

are growth industries and we should not miss out on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the investment in R&D, the setting-up of Science Parks,

setting-up  of  Incubator  Units,  providing  support   to   the

technopreneurs  who  are  usually more  scientifically  inclined

rather than businessmen, holding their hands in business, and so

on.  These are things that we are putting in place.  And with Dr

Tony Tan and BG George Yeo who are very keen in this area, I  am

sure we will see some progress in this sector.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is getting late and I do not want to prolong this

debate.   I  just  want  to  thank all  the  Members  for  their

contributions.  I am sure all their ideas will be considered.  I

cannot  answer all the points today.  But the officers  who  are

watching  the closed circuit TV have been carefully taking  down

all  the notes and all the points will be considered and,  where
