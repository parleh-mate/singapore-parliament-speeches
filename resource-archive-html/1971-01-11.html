Health  if  he  will take the necessary  steps  to

expedite the setting up of a multi-purpose  health

clinic  in  Toa  Payoh, taking into  consideration

that  more  than 100,000 residents  stay  in  that

area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a Maternity and Child

Health  Centre  is to be established  at  the  Toa

Payoh Housing Estate. According to the Housing and

Development Board, the building is expected to  be

completed by March or April 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health does not, however,

propose  to establish an outpatient dispensary  in

the area as it is Government's general policy that

the  outpatient dispensary services should not  be

further   expanded.  Further  expansion   of   the

outpatient  service may result in the  overlapping

of the services provided by general practitioners.

There   are   now  adequate  numbers  of   general

practitioners practising both within  and  without

the Toa Payoh Housing Estate.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths

and   Fees)  Act,  1968,  empowers  our   overseas

missions  to  provide  consular  services  and  to

receive   fees  for  the  performance   of   these

services. The rates for the levy of fees  are  set

out in the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Fees)

Order, 1970, which was published in the Gazette on

2nd October, 1970. The consular services performed

overseas   are  similar  to  those   provided   in

Singapore  under a number of legislative measures.

The  schedule of fees chargeable overseas follows,

therefore,  the schedules which are applicable  to

Singapore. The Singapore schedules of fees can  be

amended  or  varied by individual Ministers  under

the respective legislation and such changes become

effective by publication in the Gazette.  However,

under  the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths

and  Fees) Act, 1968, it is the President and  not

the  Minister for Foreign Affairs who is empowered

to amend or vary the schedules of rates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



This  amending Bill, therefore, seeks  to  provide

for  uniformity by giving the Minister for Foreign

Affairs   similar   powers  exercised   by   other

Ministers in respect of fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<div align="center"><b>PREVENTION OF POLLUTION OF THE SEA BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our port is a fairly busy one, it is vital

that we adopt measures to prevent the pollution of

our harbour, territorial waters and shore lines by

ships  and  shore  establishments.  Unless  we  do

something  now,  the  increasing  problem  of  oil

pollution  may  become  unmanageable.   The   main

sources  of  oil pollution are tank  cleaning  and

bilge   pumping.  Land  establishments,  including

shipyards, also contribute to the contamination by

indiscriminate  disposal of waste into  rivers  or

seas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the problem has revealed that the

existing laws are inadequate and that it would  be

to Singapore's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



interest and advantage to accept the International

Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of  the

Sea  by  Oil,  1954.  The purpose  of  this  Bill,

therefore, is to enable effect to be given to  the

Convention  and to make provision to  prevent  the

pollution  of  Singapore waters by oil  and  other

substances.   This   Convention   prohibits    the

discharge  of  oil from ships and  tankers  except

under   certain   well-defined   conditions.   The

Convention  requires ships to maintain Oil  Record

Books  which  may  be inspected by  a  contracting

government   when  the  ship  is  in   its   port.

Governments  are to promote the provision  of  oil

reception facilities for ships, oil terminals  and

shipyards. All these are provided for in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now summarise briefly the main

provisions of the Bill. It shall be an offence for

a  Singapore  ship to discharge oil into  the  sea

outside  our territorial limits, and for any  ship

to  discharge oil into Singapore waters. If oil is

discharged  from a place on land, the occupier  of

that  place  shall be guilty of an  offence,  and,

similarly, if oil is discharged from any apparatus

used  for transferring oil from or to a ship,  the

person  in charge of the apparatus shall be guilty

of an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7 of the Bill, any person who

throws  refuse,  garbage or  trade  effluent  into

Singapore  waters shall be guilty of  an  offence.

Very  stiff  penalties are being provided  in  the

Bill, e.g., a person contravening clause 7 will be

"liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding  ten

thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding  two  years or to  both  such  fine  and

imprisonment".  Members of this  House  will  note

that under clause 5 special defences are provided,

i.e.,  when  a person is charged, it  shall  be  a

defence  to prove that the oil was discharged  for

the  purpose of securing the safety of  the  ship,

cargo  or life or that the escape of oil  was  not

due to want of reasonable care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1954 Convention recommended that governments

should   encourage   the  establishment   of   oil

reception  facilities  for ships.  This  is  given

effect in Part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



III  of  the  Bill  which  empowers  the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority to provide  such  facilities.

The Minister is also empowered to make regulations

to  require  ships to be fitted with equipment  to

prevent  or reduce the discharge of oil  into  the

sea.  Regulations may also be enacted  to  require

masters  of  ships  to  keep  records  or  matters

relating  to oil. Restrictions are placed  on  the

transfer  of oil from or to a vessel at night.  It

shall be the duty of the owner, master or agent of

a vessel or occupier of a place on land, to report

any escape of oil into Singapore waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions

including  power to detain a vessel  suspected  of

discharging  oil or garbage, etc., into  Singapore

waters.  The  Minister is generally  empowered  to

make  regulations for preventing the pollution  of

Singapore waters, including requirements  for  oil

refineries  to store detergents and  equipment  to

deal  with  any  pollution of our waters,  Persons

responsible for polluting our waters are liable to

pay  for  the cost of removing or eliminating  the

pollutant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the provisions of this Bill appear to be severe, it is because we regard the problem of pollution of the sea as a major problem for us and strong measures are necessary to provide effective control of a difficult subject. By and large, ship-owners and other operators have

shown a reasonable sense of responsibility in  the

matter, but, unfortunately, there are some parties

for  whom only strict application of the law would

appear  to be the means for ensuring some form  of

discipline.   I  appeal  to  the  whole   shipping

community to make a concerted effort to co-operate

with us in keeping our seas and marine environment

clean and pollution-free. For those who choose  to

be  recalcitrant, may I sound a note  of  warning,

and  it  is  this - that we will not  hesitate  to

apply  the  full force of the law  to  any  person

found  contravening the provisions of  this  Bill,

i.e.,  the power to detain suspected vessels  will

be exercised without hesitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the

Minister on introducing this Bill. At the  moment,

although the problem of pollution of our  seas  is

not  serious, there are already signs that it will

be.  Therefore,  the fact that the  Government  is

ready  to introduce this Bill in order to be  able

to   take   positive  steps  to  prevent   further

deterioration is a far-sighted policy.  There  are

many  countries  which are already facing  serious

problems  of sea pollution. For example, in  Tokyo

the  pollution of the sea is so serious  that  the

fish  die. So we can say that this Bill is a  far-sighted policy to maintain a pollution-free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are taking positive steps to make Singapore a

clean garden city. On the one hand, we bring about

better  living conditions for our people, and,  on

the  other hand, we attract more tourists  to  our

country. As we have spent a great deal of time and

effort  to  keep our roads clean, we  should  also

take  steps  to  keep our Singapore waters  clean,

otherwise our livelihood will be affected by their

pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that we are a port. At the moment, we

are  the fourth biggest port in the world, and  we

are  improving and expanding in size. One  day  we

may  become the third greatest port in the  world,

or  even  the second. So any steps taken  in  this

direction  are necessary. I believe the people  of

Singapore  will  support the  Bill  and  keep  our

waters  and  our  port  clean.  I  hope  that  the

administrators  in the departments concerned  will

carry out the policy effectively so that we have a

beautiful and clean port.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I would

just  like to ask a small point. The Bill concerns

the  pollution  of the sea. I am  just  wondering,

what is the position in regard to the pollution of

the  air by vessels in Singapore waters? I do  not

think  that  this  point  is  covered  under   the

Environmental Health Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe

in  dealing with matters in stages. This is a Bill

for  the  prevention of pollution of the  sea.  We

shall  in time deal with the atmosphere above  the

sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance, 1963,

came  into  force early in 1964. Experience  since

then  has  revealed a number of  difficulties  and

inadequacies in the law. The Bill now  before  the

House  seeks to rectify this situation  by  making

appropriate  amendments to the Ordinance  so  that

the  Authority  can  operate  and  carry  out  its

functions more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill enables the Authority to

dispose  of  goods  which  have  remained  in  its

custody longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



than  the stipulated time, in any manner it thinks

fit, instead of by auction only, which is the case

under  the  existing section.  This  amendment  is

necessary to ensure that the much needed space  in

the  P.S.A.'s godowns are put to proper  use,  and

also to provide for operational flexibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 specifically empowers the Authority to

make  regulations  relating to the  towage  of  or

assistance  to  vessels, the sale  and  supply  of

water  in  the  port,  as  well  as  the  use  and

licensing  of  harbour  craft.  In  addition,  the

Authority  can exclude or limit its liability  for

anything done under any such regulations made.  To

discourage   contravention  of  regulations,   the

maximum  penalties  have  been  increased.   These

amendments  are intended to control the activities

of  marine  craft within port limits, to  minimise

pollution  and  to  ensure that  the  fresh  water

supplied is not contaminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4, the Authority is empowered to

recover costs for the the removal of any vessel or

aircraft  sunk, or any other obstruction  stranded

or abandoned in the port or in any approach to the

port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to amend section 88 of the

Ordinance, which is somewhat obscure. The  section

is  repealed and re-enacted with modifications for

greater clarity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9, the Authority is protected from

all   liability  in  respect  of  the   discharge,

reception, storage or removal of any cargo subject

to any general or particular average. Furthermore,

the  Authority  will not be liable  for  any  act,

omission  or default of any stevedore  or  workman

employed by the Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 allows the Authority to own and

operate  vessels for providing any of the services

which  the  Authority is required or empowered  to

provide.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



introduction of a new Part Villa, the Authority is

empowered  to  raise  and  remove  any  vessel  or

aircraft sunk. This, to my mind, is very necessary

in  view of the fact that over the last two  years

there  have  been  quite a  number  of  collisions

within  the  harbour  limits.  On  at  least   one

occasion  I think the salvage operations proceeded

very  slowly. Members of the House may recall that

on 19th March, 1969, a vessel by the name of Kuala

Kangsar  sank  within the harbour limits.  Despite

considerable efforts made, the ship was not raised

until 2nd September, 1970, a delay of a year and a

half.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new provision I presume that the

P.S.A, will now take a rather more active part  in

all  salvage operations, such as the one  which  I

have quoted. The one aspect which occurs to me  is

that  our existing facilities for salvage  do  not

seem  to be very adequate in Singapore. Is it  the

intention of the P.S.A, to set up a salvage corps?

Or  is it the intention that a salvage association

be formed, as is the practice in some other ports?

I shall appreciate the Minister's clarification on

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Looking at the Bill as

a  layman,  it  does  seem to me  that  there  are

certain   ambiguities.  The  Bill  mentions   only

"vessel  or aircraft sunk". What about the cargoes

in  the  vessels? Will the Authority be authorised

to raise and remove the cargoes from the vessels?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Jalan Kayu has raised a good point, with  his

insurance  expertise! I can assure  him  that  the

reason why this Amendment Bill has been introduced

is  to  give added powers to the Port of Singapore

Authority to ensure that cases like the sinking of

the  Kuala Kangsar will not be allowed to  lie  on

the  bed  of the harbour for too long a time,  and

that greater efforts will be made by the P.S.A, to

get things moving. It is more than likely that the

P.S.A, will have its own salvage unit. It is  only

when  the P.S.A, feels that there are more salvage

operations than it can handle in the circumstances

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



the  commercial field will be invited to undertake

the salvage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of whether sunken cargo

comes  within the ambit of this provision, I shall

put   this  question  to  the  Solicitor-General's

Office  for clarification, and the Member will  be

supplied with the information in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that the White Paper on the

Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  of

Singapore (Command 21 of 1970) was tabled in  this

House on 21st July, 1970, and I would particularly

draw  attention to paragraph 4.4 which  stated  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the aim of the Ministry [that is, of

Communications] to allow only four  bus  companies

to  operate  the domestic public bus  services  in

Singapore, as from 1st January,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



1971.  To  this end, the  Omnibus  Services

Licensing  Authority Ordinance  will  be  suitably

amended  to give OSLA additional and wider  powers

so that it can function as a proper Road Transport

Authority.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in pursuance of this objective that the

Bus  Services  Licensing Authority Bill  has  been

drafted to provide for additional and wider powers

so  that it can function as a proper and effective

Road Transport Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Omnibus Services Licensing

Authority Ordinance, 1956, which was adopted  from

the  Municipal Ordinance (Cap. 133), 1936  Revised

Edition,  contains provisions which,  to  say  the

least, are outmoded, both in form and content.  In

the  past  when  the public transport  system  was

under  the monopoly of a single undertaking,  both

the  Municipal  Ordinance or the Omnibus  Services

Licensing  Authority Ordinance may  be  considered

adequate  legislation  to  govern  the  issue   of

licences  for bus services. The Singapore Traction

Company of 1925 was then the only large public bus

company with the ability and resources to meet the

needs  of  the bus travelling public. However,  as

the  demand for better and more efficient services

became  evident  over  the years,  the  relatively

small private Chinese bus companies, who were once

content  with  operating  only  a  "mosquito"  bus

service  over the rural routes, began  to  show  a

greater  interest in this field, as  evidenced  by

their  growing investments, firstly, in new buses,

and  later, their applications for new  routes  in

areas  where  the S.T.C, services were  unable  to

provide such services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst desiring to provide the public with a more

adequate  and better public bus transport service,

the  Authority  (O.S.L.A.) was,  however,  greatly

hampered by the provisions of the existing Omnibus

Services  Licensing  Authority  Ordinance,   1956,

which,  inter  alia,  imposes  upon  O.S.L.A, the

obligation to consider the interests of the S.T.C.

when  granting new routes, including those  within

the  city central area. Traditional routes of  the

S.T.C, granted before the coming into operation of

O.S.L.A, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



1956  were  also to be renewed, as  of  right.  In

addition, no route operated by the S.T.C, could be

withdrawn,  even if it was inefficiently  run.  No

condition  could also be attached to  any  of  the

S.T.C.'s  authorised routes. Neither are any  fees

payable in respect thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not all. Under the Singapore Traction

Ordinance,  1925,  the company  is  exempted  from

paying licence fees in respect of its vehicles. In

its place, the S.T.C, pays to Government a royalty

of   5   per  cent  of  its  gross  receipts   and

contributions of two cents per car mile run, which

works out quantitatively to be far less than  what

is  being  paid  by the Chinese bus  companies  in

respect  of  their licensed buses. The  S.T.C, is

also  empowered  to license its  own  drivers  and

conductors so that even the Registrar of  Vehicles

has no authority whatsoever to withdraw or suspend

their  vocational  licences  for  any  breach   of

conduct.  Government  has also  lost  considerable

revenue  over  the  years because  the  S.T.C, is

exempted from paying the usual customs import duty

and   additional  registration   fee   which   are

applicable to the other bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large crowds waiting helplessly at bus stops

during  peak  periods in the  city  central  area,

which  are mainly served by the S.T.C., is a clear

indication that the S.T.C, has failed in its  task

to  provide  an adequate public bus service.  This

state  of affairs is not of recent origin but  has

been prevalent over a long period of years. It is,

therefore, no wonder that the `pirate' taxis  have

emerged  to  fill the need, having regard  to  the

existence of an unsatisfactory public bus  service

in Singapore for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the publication of the White Paper in the

middle  of  last year aimed at the eradication  of

the  `pirate' taxis, and the repeal  of  both  the

Singapore  Traction Ordinance (Cap. 111)  and  the

existing   Omnibus  Services  Licensing  Authority

Ordinance,   the   new   Bus  Services   Licensing

Authority  should then function as a  proper  Road

Transport Authority. Clause 13 provides for  that0

The privileged position of the S.T.C.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



must  go  and it will have to compete on an  equal

footing with the Chinese bus companies, which have

amalgamated  or are in the process of amalgamation

into three regional groups -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Western group comprising:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Kampong Bahru Bus Service (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Keppel Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>already  amalgamated themselves on 16th  November,

1970, as the Amalgamated Bus Co., Ltd.



(b)   The Eastern group comprising:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Changi Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Katong Bedok Bus (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Paya Lebar Bus Service (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Ponggol Bus Service (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>also  amalgamated  themselves  on  10th  December,

1970,  to  be known as the Associated Bus Services

(Pte) Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) But, unfortunately, the Northern group

comprising:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Easy Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Green Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Tay Koh Yat Bus Co. (Pte) Ltd.,



<br><br>were a little tardy and were not able to meet  the

deadline   of  amalgamating  themselves   by   1st

January,  1971,  and are still in the  process  of

amalgamation  to become the United Bus  Co.  (Pte)

Ltd.  Not  very  united, to begin  with!  I  wish,

however, to assure the House that this matter will

be finalised soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members refer to paragraph 4.3 of the White

Paper, it will be noted that the dominant position

of  the S.T.C, has been eroded over the years.  As

at  30th April last year, out of a total of  1,087

operating  buses, the S.T.C, had 404 or less  than

40  per  cent of the total bus fleet of Singapore,

whilst  the Chinese bus companies had 683 or  more

than 60 per cent of the fleet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me to draw the attention of

this House that over the last eight months, whilst

the  size of the S.T.C.'s operating fleet remained

static,    the   Chinese   bus   companies    have

substantially increased their bus fleets, so  much

so  that  the S.T.C.'s fleet as at 31st  December,

1970,  stood at less than 30 per cent of the total

bus fleet - a drop of ten per cent!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Members of this House that,

subsequent to the publication of the White  Paper,

I called up a delegation of three Directors of the

S.T.C.  (which  included  its  Chairman)  on  15th

September,  1970,  and  drew  their  attention  to

paragraph 4.15 of the White Paper which stated  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`4.15 STC to be reorganised



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bus services are a public utility, it is cleat

that  unless STC takes strong steps to  reorganise

itself,    the    Ministry   [the   Ministry    of

Communications] will have no alternative,  but  to

intervene. If Chinese Bus Companies (which on  the

whole are showing profitable results) are required

to  reorganise  themselves  through  amalgamation,

there  is  no reason why SIC should be allowed  to

drag its feet, when bus commuters are so vocal and

critical  of  the  performance of  STC,  for  many

years.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also made clear to the S.T.C. Directors

that  with  the  proposed  reorganisation  of  the

public bus system with uniform legislation and bus

fare  structure, the S.T.C, would lose its present

privileged position and be treated as just one  of

four  bus  companies, after  the  10  Chinese  bus

companies  have amalgamated themselves into  three

larger groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is also proposed to increase the

membership of the Authority from three to six, and

membership is also not to be restricted to  public

servants,  vide  clause 3.  Under  clause  5,  bus

licences are to be made renewable for a period  of

three years instead of one year, as at present. As

the  present practice of bus companies working out

their  own routes and applying for same  has  been

found to be unsatisfactory, provision is now  made

for  the new Authority to determine the routes and

to  invite  applications from  the  bus  companies

concerned. The cost of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



advertisements and expenses involved will have  to

be  borne  by the successful applicant.  Temporary

licences  for any purpose can also now be granted,

vide clause 7 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority is to be given the power to

require  bus companies to furnish to the Authority

their   audited  accounts  in  the  form   to   be

prescribed. This comes under clause 9. Offences in

the  nature  of  breach  of  conditions  are  also

punishable by increased fines, vide clause 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the opportune moment for mc to inform

the  House that the study on the co-ordination and

rationalisation  of  the  then  existing  117  bus

routes,   to   be  undertaken  by  the   Transport

Consultant, Mr R. P. Wilson, Traffic  Manager  of

the  Municipal  Tramways Trust of Adelaide,  South

Australia, as stated in paragraph 4.5 of the White

Paper  was completed on 26th November, 1970.  When

making copies of the Wilson Study available to the

bus  companies on 15th December, 1970, I indicated

to  them that before Government proceeds with  the

implementation  of  the Wilson recommendations  on

11th  April, 1971, we would, however, like to have

the  benefit  of  their views  for  consideration.

These  should  be  submitted not later  than  15th

January, 1971, i.e., within this week. It  is  our

intention  to  release the Wilson Study,  together

with full details of the implementation, not later

than  the  middle  of February, so  that  the  bus

commuting  public would have two  months'  advance

notice of the proposed major reorganisation of the

bus services before it comes into effect early  in

April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, the Bill now before this

House can be regarded as not only being timely but

most  appropriate,  so that  my  Ministry  may  be

giver!  The  necessary  legislative  backing   and

"teeth"  to carry out its onerous task of  a  long

overdue major overhaul of our public bus transport

service, and to usher in the dawn of a new era for

a more rational, adequate and effective public bus

service for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to make a few observations  on

clause  8  of the Bill. Will the Minister consider

making it an offence for bus drivers to stop their

vehicles   along  the  route  without   reasonable

grounds,   thus  causing  inconvenience   to   the

travelling public? There are some instances  where

bus  drivers in certain Chinese bus companies make

it a habit of stopping their buses along the route

when  one  of  their  buses  is  involved  in   an

accident, whether it is a minor or a serious  one,

and  to  lend  moral or physical  support  to  the

driver  involved in the accident. We have recently

heard about the skirmishes that took place in  Toa

Payoh  when buses from two companies stopped their

services  for  a period of more than  four  hours,

thus   causing   serious  inconvenience   to   the

travelling public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  a  small point to inquire of the Minister

for  Communications. I cannot agree more with  the

Minister  when he said that it is high  time  that

the   Singapore   Traction   Company   should   be

reorganised.   Usually   in   the    process    of

reorganisation,  the workers are mainly  affected.

In  other words, reorganisation is going to reduce

the  number  of  employees. I wonder  whether  the

Minister can assure this House that in the process

of reorganisation, the employees of the S.T.C, can

be  assured their job security. We should not make

them  suffer  because of the inefficiency  of  the

operations  of  the  S.T.C, throughout  all  these

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

with what the Member for Toa Payoh has said on the

regrettable  incident which took place  in  Lorong

One  a  few days ago. I believe for some time  now

the  residents  of Toa Payoh have  been  grumbling

about  the  inadequacy of bus  services.  I  think

there   are  now  more  than  one  hundred   buses

operating  in  Toa Payoh since the  reorganisation

took place last year. Before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

I can comment further on the Member's  query

on  whether steps can be taken against bus workers

who   fail   to  man  the  buses  and  provide   a

satisfactory service, perhaps it would  be  better

to  wait  until the Wilson Study is published  and

certain  recommendations  will  then  have  to  be

considered  - it is only a month - and that  would

be  the  appropriate time for  me  to  answer  his

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the plea from the Member for Bras

Basah  that  we give an assurance that,  when  the

S.T.C, is  reorganised, the workers will  not  be

made  to  suffer for lack of job security.  I  can

assure  him  that that will be one of our  primary

tasks. In the course of reorganisation, one should

see  to  it that the S.T.C, workers do not suffer.

But  I  must  add to that a warning. A bad  worker

cannot  take  cover behind that  sort  of  shield.

Ultimately,  if  he  fails to  improve  after  the

reorganisation, I think the axe will have to  fall

on  him. But at the first stage of reorganisation,

I  think  it  would be fair to say  that  we  will

ensure  that everyone who is working will  have  a

job.  But thereafter he will have to pull  up  his

socks if he wants to continue in that job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of this Bill is to provide for

more effective eradication of "pirate" taxis. This

will  be  effected under clause 4 of the  Bill  by

making   "pirate"  taxi  operations   a   seizable

offence,  i.e.,  "pirate" taxi  operators  can  be

arrested on the spot, without warrant, detained at

the  police  station, and produced  in  court  and

charged  the  next day without the  time-consuming

process  of  applying for and issuing summons  for

them to appear in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that this amending

legislation was contemplated in paragraph 7.6  (d)

of  the White Paper on Reorganisation of the Motor

Transport  Service  of Singapore  (Command  21  of

1970)  as one of a number of strong measures which

"will  be  taken  by  Government  to  squeeze  out

`pirate'  taxis from our midst" as from  1st  July

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another object of this Bill is to introduce a

new  "ticket" system in respect of certain traffic

offences to be prescribed by the Minister. Such  a

system  provided under clause 5 of the  Bill  will

reduce  the enormous volume of paper work involved

under  the  present  procedure of  processing  all

reports  of  traffic offences at a central  office

and then issuing offers of composition in cases of

compoundable offences which form the vast majority

of  reported  offences. Under the proposed  ticket

system  a  police officer may issue  a  prescribed

notice on the spot to the offender, or affix  such

notice  on  the  vehicle  concerned,  which   will

specify



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



the  offence alleged and the fixed penalty  to  be

paid. The offender is generally given two weeks to

pay  the  penalty, and if he does so,  no  further

proceedings  will  be taken against  him  for  the

alleged  offence. However, should he fail  to  pay

the   penalty   or   to  furnish  a   satisfactory

explanation, he will then be liable to prosecution

for  the  alleged  offence.  For  this  purpose  a

traffic  ticket summons may be issued against  him

by   a  police  officer  not  below  the  rank  of

Inspector. The Minister is empowered to make rules

to  prescribe  the  offences to which  the  ticket

system  will apply and to provide for  any  matter

incidental to such a system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill also seeks to amend section

32 of the Ordinance so as to remove any doubt that

furnishing  false or misleading information  under

this  section will be an offence and  to  increase

the  penalty for an offence under that clause.  To

facilitate the use of information furnished  under

this   clause,  it  is  also  provided  that  such

information may be used as evidence, without proof

of signature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also extends the period during which a

notice of intended prosecution must be given  from

14 days to 30 days, vide clause 3 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain consequential amendments under clause 6

of  the  Bill  are being made as a result  of  the

repeal   of   the  Singapore  Traction   Ordinance

(Chapter   III)  by  the  Bus  Services  Licensing

Authority Bill, which has just been considered  by

the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Jurong Town

Corporation Act, 1968, in the light of  experience

gained  over  the last 2« years. These  amendments

are in addition to those which were introduced, as

a   matter  of  urgency,  under  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  (Amendment) Act, 1970,  in  September

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill sets the 4th day of

September,  1970,  as  the  date  of  coming  into

operation of the 1970 Amendment Act. Members  will

recall  that the 1970 Amendment Act empowered  the

Jurong  Town Corporation, among other  things,  to

raise  loans  from  outside sources.  The  present

amendment before this House is necessary  to  give

legal   validity  to  the  signing  of  the   Loan

Agreement between the Jurong Town Corporation  and

the  Asian  Development Bank on the 5th September,

1970.  The  Bank agreed to lend the Corporation  a

sum of US $8.3 million to finance the expansion of

Jurong wharves. It is proposed to set the 4th  day

of September, 1970 - the day immediately preceding

the date of signature of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



Loan  Agreement  -  as  the date  of  coming  into

operation   of   the   Jurong   Town   Corporation

(Amendment) Act, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 13 of the principal Act

which  lays  down  the duties and  powers  of  the

Corporation.  Paragraphs  (a) ,  (b)  and  (c)  are

drafting  amendments. Paragraph (d)  empowers  the

Corporation  to  sell or lease  flats,  houses  or

other  living accommodation. This is necessary  to

enable the Corporation to undertake the housing of

workers in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are references, in sections 17, 21, 23, 24

and  25  of  the principal Act, to a "Jurong  Town

Corporation  Fund". It is proposed, under  clauses

4,  5,  6,  7  and 8 of the Bill, to delete  these

references  and  substitute  references   to   the

Corporation itself, as the principal Act does  not

actually  provide for the setting up of  a  Jurong

Town Corporation Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 alters the manner of appointment of the

Corporation's auditor. Section 21 of the principal

Act  provides that the Minister shall nominate for

every   year   an  auditor  of  the  Corporation's

accounts. It is proposed that, as in the  case  of

other  statutory bodies, the Corporation's auditor

should  be appointed, not by the Minister  but  by

the Corporation itself with the concurrence of the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 23 of the principal Act

so  that  the Corporation will now be required  to

submit  its  annual statement of accounts  to  the

Minister  and  the  auditor will  be  required  to

submit  separately his report on the statement  of

accounts. Both the statement of accounts  and  the

auditor's report thereon shall be published in the

Gazette.  This  introduces  a  measure  of  public

accountability  and  is  an  improvement  on   the

existing provision which only requires the auditor

to   certify   the  Corporation's   statement   of

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 24 of the principal Act

to  make  it clear that the accounting records  of

the   Corporation   should   distinguish   capital

transactions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



from revenue transactions and that moneys received

by  way  of loans should be shown separately.  The

marginal note is amended because the provisions of

the  section deal not only with bank accounts  but

with accounting records as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 27 of the principal Act provides that

the  Corporation may invest any money standing  to

its   credit  in  any  trustee  securities.   This

provision   is  unduly  restrictive  and   it   is

proposed,   under   clause   9,   to   allow   the

Corporation, with the approval of the Minister, to

invest in shares of any private or public company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, which introduces a new section 27A in

the  principal Act, allows the Corporation to form

subsidiary  companies for the purpose of  carrying

out  any  of the functions of the Corporation.  It

may  be  desirable  in certain circumstances,  not

only  in the interests of flexibility of operation

but  also of financial accountability, to separate

some  of  the  Corporation's  functions  from  the

others  and to entrust them to companies in  which

the  Corporation  would have a majority  interest.

Members will notice that, under subsection (3)  of

the  proposed  new section 27A, the operations  of

such   companies  would  be  subject  to  detailed

supervision by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12, which introduce another new

section  in  the  principal  Act,  confer  on  the

Corporation the exclusive right to the use of  the

symbol  which is set out in the proposed  Schedule

to the principal Act. This symbol has already been

in  use  for some time and is, I am sure, familiar

to all Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Loans (International

Bank)  Ordinance,  1958, of  Malaysia,  which  was

extended  to Singapore in 1964 when Singapore  was

part of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Ordinance enables the Government and

statutory   authorities   to   borrow   from   the

International   Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development,  and  also  for  the  Government   to

guarantee  loans  made by the  Bank  to  statutory

authorities.  The  Ordinance also  lays  down  the

manner in which such loan and guarantee agreements

may  be  concluded. The purpose of  the  Bill  now

before  this House is to extend the provisions  of

the  Ordinance to cover loans made  by  the  Asian

Development   Bank  to  the  Government   and   to

statutory authorities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that a number of loan

agreements have recently been negotiated with  the

Asian  Development  Bank and, whilst  the  present

constitutional   and   legislative    powers    of

Government are sufficient to enable the signing of

such loan agreements, the Asian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



Development Bank has requested that it be accorded

the  same status as the World Bank under the Loans

(International Bank) Ordinance, 1958. This is felt

to   be  justified  in  view  of  the  significant

assistance that is being accorded Singapore by the

Asian Development Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date the Asian Development Bank has agreed to

lend  a  sum  of  US$20.5 million to  finance  the

expansion of Singapore International Airport.  The

Bank has also agreed to grant two further loans -~

one  of  US$3 million to the Government to finance

the  expansion of Ngee Ann Technical College,  and

the   other  of  US$8.3  million  to  the   Public

Utilities Board, with the Government as guarantor,

to  finance  the  Kranji  /  Pandan  Water  Supply

Project. The date for the coming into operation of

the  proposed amendment has been fixed at the  1st

day of December, 1970, so as to cover the loan for

the   Singapore  International  Airport  Expansion

Project and the other two subsequent loans which I

have  mentioned. The amendment will also serve  to

provide  a  more  satisfactory  legal  basis   and

machinery   for  future  loans  from   the   Asian

Development Bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the purpose of my motion is already clear to Members from the Prime Minister's speech on the Second Reading of the Civil List and Pension (Amendment) Bill which was taken at the last sitting of Parliament.

the  Act  (No. 10 of 1970) came into operation  on

6th   January,  1971.  It  therefore  now  becomes

possible   to   grant  a  pension  to   the   late

President's  widow  as well as  to  his  surviving

children of such amount or amounts and subject  to

such  terms  as Parliament may, by its resolution,

determine.
