<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   the

Government will adopt a hands-off approach in the development

of   the   telecommunications  and   information   technology

industry,  especially in the industry's pricing  of  services

and marketing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a fully

liberalised  and  competitive market environment,  the  Info-communications  Development Authority of Singapore,  or  IDA,

will be moving towards regulating with a lighter touch.  This

will allow more freedom for telecom operators to innovate and

compete in terms of pricing and marketing.  However, IDA will

continue  to uphold the key regulatory requirements  of  fair

and  equitable inter-connection, inter-operability  and  open

access so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>

consumers  can transparently and seamlessly communicate  with

others  regardless  of whichever network  they  are  directly

connected  to.  Only then will consumers truly  benefit  from

competition  in a multi-operator, multi-network  environment.

IDA  also recognises that there will be a transitional  phase

as  we  move towards a fully liberalised environment.  During

this  period, it will still be necessary for IDA  to  keep  a

vigilant  watch over the industry to facilitate the entry  of

new players.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, press reports seem

to  suggest that our telecommunications policies are  falling

behind Hong Kong and that we are playing catch up.  Will  the

Minister like to comment on that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I am not too sure exactly what

Mr  Chng is referring to.  But if he is referring to the fact

that  we are now opening up the market fully with effect from

1st  April 2000 instead of 2002 whereas Hong Kong has a fully

liberalised  environment, then it is true.   We  cannot  hide

from  the  fact  that we have stipulated a deadline  for  the

opening  up  of  the market and this deadline was  stipulated

when  we  first  privatised Singapore  Telecom  and  when  we

invited  tenders  for  the  second  fixed  line  network   in

Singapore which was set in 1996.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TELECOM AND CABLE & WIRELESS HKT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Proposed merger)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will  explain the rationale for the merger between  Singapore

Telecom  and Cable & Wireless HKT and whether there  are  any

long-term security concerns due to the dilution of Government

controls.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

he   will  state  the  Government's  position  regarding  the

proposed  merger  between  Singapore  Telecom  and  Cable   &

Wireless  HKT,  and if there are any plans to  safeguard  our

shareholders' interests in the proposed merger in the face of

adverse reactions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>

from certain quarters of the business community in Hong Kong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, before I ask Question No. 2, I

wish  to  declare my interest as an independent  director  of

Pacific Century Development Limited.  Question No. 2, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos

2 and 3 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the proposed merger is

driven  purely  by  commercial considerations.  The  combined

entity,  which  would  become one  of  the  leading  regional

telcos,  would  be better positioned to face  the  challenges

posed    by    the    rapidly   globalising   and    evolving

telecommunications industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential dilution of Government's shareholdings in

SingTel  should  not pose security problems.   Concerns  over

security   confront   telecommunication   markets   worldwide

whenever mergers and acquisitions of telcos, whether  foreign

or  local, take place.  However, these security concerns  can

be adequately addressed through the regulatory framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings and SingTel believe that the merger

will  create  value for the shareholders of both SingTel  and

Cable & Wireless HKT.  As with all commercial companies, they

take into account the interest of its shareholders, including

minority  shareholders, when making any  business  decisions,

particularly major ones involving mergers and acquisitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not intend to institute any specific

safeguards  for shareholders, as the investing public  should

exercise  prudence in their investments.  The  caveat  emptor

applies to all investments, including investment using CPF as

well as those under Asset Enhancement schemes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I have two supplementary

questions.   The  first question is, if this  is  strictly  a

commercial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>

deal,  press  speculation is that it is more than  commercial

but  political as well, especially in our case,  one  of  our

Ministers  has approached the Hong Kong government on  behalf

of SingTel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that Government's shareholding in

SingTel  will  continue to be diluted  as  a  result  of  the

loyalty  shares issued to current shareholders.  Which  point

will  the  Minister feel comfortable that we need to  improve

the  framework to make sure that Government still has control

over SingTel?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, on the first question, I

am  in  no position to comment on these speculations.   These

are  pure speculations on the part of the media.  As  far  as

the  Singapore  Government is concerned,  this  is  a  purely

commercial  consideration.  The fact that  Government  has  a

major shareholding is irrelevant in this particular case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, whilst the proposed merger may

dilute the Government's shareholding it should not affect the

security  concerns.   This is because the Info-communications

Development Authority has already put in place provisions  to

safeguard  national  interest.  For  example,  as  a  licence

condition,  telecom operators will be required  to  cooperate

fully with relevant Government agencies for the provision  of

national security and emergency services.  We will cover this

particular problem through the regulatory requirements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like

the  Minister  to  clarify.   Since  the  public  listing  of

Singapore  Telecom,  the share price  has  fallen  below  the

listed  price.   I  would  like to  know  whether  sufficient

efforts have been taken by Singapore Telecom and the relevant

authorities  to  restore  the  confidence  of  the  Singapore

shareholders to achieve the original purpose, ie, to  enhance

the scheme to give Singaporeans a stake in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, I do not see the relevance of your

question to the Questions which are on the Order Paper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> In the light of the proposed merger,

we  know  that  SingTel's share price has  fallen  below  its

listed price.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I think share prices will

have  to reflect what the market demand is and Government  is

in no position to influence it directly.  I am confident that

SingTel  management  has done all it can  to  strengthen  the

position  of SingTel but the Member should realise that,  all

telecom  monopolies as SingTel was, are subject to  extremely

strong  competitive  pressures as a result  of  deregulation.

The  same situation has happened in all countries where share

prices  of monopolies tend to take a major hit because  their

overseas  IDD  calls  are  usually  the  ones  first  hit  by

competition.   As  far  as SingTel is  concerned,  they  have

expanded overseas into many areas, Belgium, UK and Australia,

and  Members  have  read in the press  that  they  have  made

several  moves  to  acquire  other  telcos,  but  with  mixed

success, unfortunately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not get the second part of the question. Can the

Member repeat it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> SingTel was the first of a series of

Government  enterprises to be privatised and it was  part  of

the  Asset Enhancement Scheme.  The drop in its share  prices

will reduce public confidence in this scheme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> In the case of SingTel, the

public was granted a discount of the original price and  with

the  loyalty  shares the effective price paid by shareholders

is  a  lot lower than $3.60.  But I think the basic principle

is that Government cannot protect the price of shares.  As  I

mentioned   earlier  in  my  reply  to  Mr  Chng's  question,

investors  must make their own judgment and I  still  believe

that, in the long term, SingTel is a good investment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, since Pacific Century

Cyberworks  is  also  bidding for a  share  of  the  Cable  &

Wireless  HKT,  I would like to know what is  the  Ministry's

position on that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Ministry has no position on

this.   This  is an independent bid from a Hong  Kong  entity

and,  like  all proposals, it is being put on  the  table  in

competition with the SingTel deal.  I have no comment on this

particular case.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENTS IN BINTAN AND OTHER RIAU ISLANDS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry whether

the  recent  riots in Bintan Island have affected Singapore's

investments in that and the other Riau islands and what steps

will  the Singapore Government take to prevent or lessen  the

chances  of  further riots taking place as Singaporeans  have

their investments there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  is his Ministry's assessment on  the  current

political  and economic situation in Indonesia, and  how  his

Ministry will continue to encourage Singapore businessmen  to

invest in Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, Question No. 4.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, can I have your permission to answer

Question Nos 4 and 5 at the same time, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Thank you. The political

situation  in  Indonesia has improved since the  presidential

election  in October last year.  President Abdurrahman  Wahid

enjoys  domestic political legitimacy and wide  international

support.   The present Indonesian leadership is possibly  the

best combination under the circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the present government inherited multi-faceted

problems  when  it  assumed power last  year.   The  security

situation  has  not fully stabilised.  There are  still  many

social problems.  Racial and religious violence continues  to

break  out from time to time.   These problems faced  by  the

government  are  complex and cannot be resolved  in  a  short

time.   The  President is trying to address and  resolve  the

many challenges it now faces.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Indonesian economy, it is showing a tentative

recovery.   Real  GDP  is  expected to  register  a  flat  or

slightly  positive  growth in 1999, after contracting  nearly

14% the previous year.  The consensus forecast for GDP growth

for Indonesia this year is about 3-5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Prime Minister led an

international   business   delegation   to   Jakarta   as   a

demonstration of our confidence in Indonesia.   PM  Goh  also

announced a package of economic assistance measures  to  help

catalyse   Indonesia's  economic  recovery.   For   Singapore

businessmen, there is the $400 million loan financing  scheme

administered by the EDB through participating Singapore-based

banks.   This  scheme is to encourage Singapore companies  to

look  for  commercially  viable opportunities  in  Indonesia.

When  these  are identified, these companies  can  seek  loan

financing   at   competitive   interest   rates   from    the

participating Singapore-based banks.  The risk of  the  loans

will  be  shared  between the Singapore  Government  and  the

participating  banks.   A  seminar  was  just  held  on  18th

February  to  elaborate on the details of  the  scheme.   The

response was very good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other elements of the assistance package include a

US$500  million Singapore Co-Investment Fund  for  the  major

Singapore   Government-linked  companies  to  support   other

foreign  investors who may be interested in  acquiring  IBRA-held  assets  and other financially viable investments.   Our

Tourism  Board will also implement a $2 million  Tourism  and

Marketing  Package  to  help Indonesia  restart  its  tourism

promotion activities.  At the same time, we will continue  to

work   with   the  Indonesian  authorities  to  enhance   the

investment climate in the Riaus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our investments and efforts, we hope to create a

positive   catalytic  effect  that  will  help   to   attract

additional  investment  funds from other  foreign  investors.

However,  ultimately, whether the businessmen will decide  to

invest  in  Indonesia  depends on  their  assessment  of  the

prospects.  They will choose to invest in places  where  they

and their investments are safe and their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>

operations  can  carry  on  uninterrupted.   They   will   be

monitoring if the current Indonesian leadership pursues sound

economic  policies  and  if there  is  political  and  social

stability within Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is unfortunate that the issue of land

compensation at the Bintan Industrial Estate has  resurfaced.

When  development  works  by  the  Indonesia-Singapore  joint

venture  company on the Bintan Industrial Estate  began  more

than  five  years ago, compensation for the  land  was  fully

settled and the land was free of encumbrances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent demonstrations at the Bintan Industrial

Estate  have  resulted in losses for the companies  operating

there  as  work  had to be stopped.  They have also  affected

tourist  arrivals,  and undoubtedly, the  livelihood  of  the

people  in  Bintan as well. The disturbances,  if  unchecked,

would  not  only  affect investors in the  Estate,  but  more

seriously,  it  would dampen foreign investor  confidence  in

Indonesia.   Singapore's ability to  act  as  a  catalyst  to

enhance investor confidence in Indonesia and help bring  back

foreign investment there would be curtailed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has conveyed to the Indonesian

authorities, at various levels, the importance for  Indonesia

to resolve the problems.  However, the disturbances in Bintan

should  be  seen  in  the context of the other  incidents  of

social  unrest  elsewhere  in  Indonesia.   President   Wahid

himself  has  said  that the recent outbreaks  of  unrest  in

Indonesia  were  the  product of  a  conspiracy  against  his

government.   The Indonesian authorities have indicated  that

disruptive  elements from other parts of Indonesia  had  been

involved  in Bintan.  They recognise the nature and potential

impact of the problems and have taken swift action to end the

disturbances.   We  will  continue  to  closely  monitor  the

situation in Bintan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have three

supplementary  questions. Firstly, has the land  compensation

issue  been  resolved there? Secondly, what is the population

of Bintan and what percentage of the population has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>

given  jobs  by  the  investments there?   Thirdly,  has  the

Singapore  Government  or  its  linked  companies  helped  or

assisted  the private investors to provide social needs  such

as medical clinics and schools for the population there?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as we

are  concerned,  the issue of land compensation  was  settled

when  the land was acquired before the industrial estate  was

established.  The land, as I had said earlier,  was  free  of

encumbrances.  Whether the money in fact went to  the  people

from  whom  the  land was taken, that is  something  for  the

Indonesian  side  to  resolve, and I believe  that  they  are

taking  actions  in that direction.  But as I also  mentioned

earlier,  Jakarta suspects that there were political elements

involved in the disturbances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the population of Bintan, I do not have it with me

now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> It is 600,000.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> 600,000 according to Mr Chng

Hee  Kok.   We  provide employment in the  Bintan  Industrial

Estate  and in the tourism area for some thousands, maybe  at

the  most ten plus thousands. Do we provide facilities there?

Where  we are located, we do provide some facilities  to  the

workers and to the surrounding areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> In respect of the $40 million

regionalisation finance scheme for Indonesia, the  rules  are

quite  rigid  and I would like to know whether  they  can  be

relaxed   somewhat  to  include  the  purchase  of   existing

Indonesian  under-capacity companies so  that  the  Singapore

businessmen  do  not need to use new funds  to  build  a  new

factory or to purchase new equipment because there are  quite

a  lot of under-capacity companies.  I would like to ask  the

Minister whether this could be considered in this scheme.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had a

seminar with many Singapore businessmen last week. It was  so

heavily subscribed that we had to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

reduce  the  number  of  executives which  each  company  was

allowed  to  send for the seminar.  Comments had  been  made.

Their  feedback is now being analysed and we will  liberalise

the  rules  as  much as we can, but without losing  sight  of

prudential   considerations.  We  must  be   aware   of   the

unstructured   investment  environment  in   Indonesia,   the

difficulty  of  enforcing contracts, and we must  not  forget

that  public monies are involved here.  But where we  can  be

liberal, we shall try to be.

<div align="center"><b>RESTRUCTURING STATUS OF POWER INDUSTRY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  he  will give an update on the  status  of  the

restructuring of the local power industry, particularly  with

regard to the introduction of competition to both electricity

generation and supply, and whether there is any intention  to

limit the number of players in each segment.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1995,

the  Government  had taken several steps to  restructure  the

electricity  industry, starting with the  corporatisation  of

the  Electricity and Gas Departments of the Public  Utilities

Board  (PUB) to form Singapore Power Ltd (SP) on 1st  October

1995.    To  facilitate  competition,  Singapore  Power   was

structured   as   a  holding  company  with   five   separate

subsidiaries,  namely  two generation companies  (PowerSenoko

and  PowerSeraya),  a  transmission  &  distribution  company

(PowerGrid), a supply company (Power Supply) and a  piped-gas

company (PowerGas).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another power station being built in Tuas was put under

a  separate  company, Tuas Power Ltd (TP), owned directly  by

Temasek  Holdings, so that it could compete  against  the  SP

generation  companies.   To  facilitate  competition  in  the

generation and supply sectors, the Singapore Electricity Pool

(SEP) was established as an exchange for trading electricity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided in March 1999 that the next step

in  restructuring the electricity industry was for  Singapore

Power to fully divest its generating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>

companies to Temasek Holdings in 2001.  This will bring about

ownership  separation  of  the  generators,  which  are   the

contestable  part  of the market, from the  transmission  and

distribution network, which is the non-contestable part.  All

generators will have a level playing field.  The transmission

and  distribution  network will be  regulated  tightly  as  a

natural  monopoly.   In the year 2001,  there  will  be  four

competing  generation  companies,  PowerSenoko,  PowerSeraya,

Tuas Power and SembCorp Co-gen.



<br><br><i>Review of Industry Structure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more countries have now liberalised their

electricity  services.  As a result, electricity prices  have

dropped significantly.  Consumers have benefited with greater

choice, better product innovation and better service quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the competitiveness of our electricity sector,

MTI  will further liberalise the electricity market with  the

aim  to  put  in place a fully competitive market.   We  have

engaged  a consultant to carry out a comprehensive review  of

the electricity industry and to recommend how competition  in

the  sector  could be further enhanced.  The  consultant  has

just  completed  its  review and we are  now  evaluating  the

changes recommended by the consultant.  We will announce  the

changes once we have obtained feedback from industry players.



<br><br><i>Number of players</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently no limit on the number of players in

the   generation  and  retail  sectors  of  the   electricity

industry.    Companies  that  want  to  generate  or   supply

electricity in Singapore can apply to the PUB, the Regulator,

for  a public licence.  The PUB will evaluate the application

to  ensure  that  the  proposed  project  complies  with  our

technical  requirements, rules and regulations  to  safeguard

system  security  and that the applicant  has  the  financial

capability and technical expertise.  A public licence will be

granted  if these requirements are met.  There is no plan  to

impose any limit on the number of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>

players  in  the  future.   With the  liberalisation  of  our

electricity  market, the number of players in the  generation

and supply segments will be determined by market forces.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, notwithstanding

the  experience  of the other markets of falling  prices,  is

there  a  philosophy  that we would  adopt  with  respect  to

pricing which will serve to preserve the interest of domestic

consumers as well as from the perspective of the overall cost

competitiveness of Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Our intention is, within the

next  two  years,  to move towards as free  a  market  as  is

possible  and adopt an ideal framework with marginal pricing.

We  believe that the interests of consumers are best  met  by

allowing  market forces to put pressure on the generators  to

reduce prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask

whether, in the review of the market, will the study  include

the  desire for greater efficiency in order to curb excessive

use  of power and to encourage greater efficiency in the  use

by industry as well as households?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I do not think we should put

ourselves in the position of deciding who has a greater  need

for  power. From our perspective, the best way is to use  the

market  mechanism to decide who has a greater need for  power

according to what he is prepared to pay.  In other words,  to

let  the  market  mechanism operate  rather  than  to  impose

additional considerations as to who should get power at  what

prices, depending on whether they undertake activities  which

are socially worthy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Perhaps I was misunderstood. What I mean

is that Singapore has one of the highest climate-change gases

already  and that in creating a market for energy generation,

we  run  the danger of creating a market where you  use  more

power,  you  get more profits.  I am wondering whether  these

dangers will overall affect Singapore's standing in such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

community  as well as our efficiency. Would these factors  be

taken   into  consideration  in  creating  this  market   for

competition?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am sorry. I did not quite

catch what you said earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I clarify myself? In the generation

of  power, there would be release of climate-change gases and

other  pollutants which would affect both the global  climate

as well as our local environment.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> You are referring to

greenhouse gases?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, greenhouse gases.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We observe all international

regulations  on this and whatever we do, we will  conform  to

international standards and we will play our part as part  of

our    international   responsibility   but   within    those

constraints, let the market operate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> I wish to declare my interest as a

director of Singapore Power.  My question to the Minister is:

will  he  allow  Genco's to supply power  to  the  Grid  from

outside  Singapore, for example, Malaysian independent  power

supplier?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I think we should allow the

importation  of  power on a selective basis  by  taking  into

account  the needs of energy security in Singapore.   We  are

already  connected to the Malaysian Grid, but not  as  if  we

were part of the same grid, but in an emergency, we supply to

them, they can supply to us. We should be able to do the same

with Indonesia too one day, depending on the economics.   But

at  all times, we must take into account the fact that energy

security is our own responsibility which we must safeguard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> If we free up the market completely,

it  is  going  to  be hard to be selective about  who  should

supply and how much to supply, is it not?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Cross-boundary electricity

flows  are  completely  within our  powers  to  regulate  and

control.  Is that your question?  I am not sure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> No. My question really is that if

they are prepared to supply power at a much lower price,  how

do  you  determine  that the Singapore consumers  should  not

benefit  and  at the same time keeping in mind the  long-term

interest of Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We will take these factors

into  account.   If  power  is available  very  cheaply  from

Malaysia and the quality of that supply can be assured,  then

we should surely in our own interest consider it.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister

whether  a  watchdog  body,  which  comprises  consumers  and

operators,  could  be  set up to ensure  that  consumers  are

protected, like in Hong Kong where they have a watchdog body?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The agency having principal

responsibility for this would be the Public Utilities Board.

<div align="center"><b>STANDARD OF MEDICAL AND HEALTHCARE PRACTICES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if his

Ministry will take steps to allay the fears of the public and

reassure  them  that  we  have (i)  first-world  standard  of

medical   and   healthcare  practices;  and  (ii)   effective

regulatory  bodies in place to ensure transparent  audit  and

inquest of medical errors or negligence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore  has  achieved a  high  standard  of  medical

practice by:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) providing a comprehensive network of well-equipped

and accessible health care facilities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) ensuring our health care professionals are well-trained and qualified through a well-established system of

statutory registration and accreditation;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) ensuring that clinical practice is evidence-based

and benchmarked with current best practices; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) enforcing compliance with standards through the

licensing of all health care establishments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high standard of medical practice in Singapore is

well  reflected in the good outcomes of medical care we  have

achieved which are comparable to the best medical centres  in

the   world.    We  track  benchmark  performance  indicators

regularly.   For  example,  our mortality  rate  for  cardiac

bypass surgery is 0.8% which is comparable to the rate of  1%

in major cardiac centres in the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key component of the tracking and regulatory system is

the National Medical Audit Programme (NMAP) implemented since

July 1998 for all acute hospitals.  The NMAP is the framework

for  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  clinical

outcomes.   From  the  NMAP,  we  can  obtain  a  comparative

assessment  of  the  clinical performance indicators  of  our

acute  hospitals.   The NMAP also monitors  critical  quality

assurance  processes  in  the  hospitals  such  as  infection

control,  review of tissues removed at operation,  review  of

complications of interventional treatment, in-patient deaths,

adverse    drug    reactions,   audit    of    post-operative

complications,  and  the audit of ICU  care,   Through  these

quality  assurance  processes, potential medical  errors  are

detected and investigated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any death resulting from medical treatment is reported

to the Coroner for thorough investigation.  Inquiries held by

the Coroner are open to the next-of-kin of the deceased.  Any

person  found  criminally negligent for  the  death  will  be

liable for criminal prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals are required to conduct a Committee of

Inquiry  to  investigate any adverse event arising  from  the

management  of a patient, eg, severe adverse drug  reactions.

The  objective of the Inquiry is to determine if the  patient

had  been  managed  correctly, and to recommend  measures  to

prevent the recurrence of any deficiency detected.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will appoint external audit committees from

its  panel  of  medical expert advisors  to  investigate  and

review  deaths  and serious incidents due to medical  errors.

This  will ensure that we learn from our mistakes and prevent

a recurrence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is professional misconduct associated with a

medical error, the disciplinary process is undertaken by  the

Singapore  Medical  Council.  The process  is  retransparent,

thorough and objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, the current standards of medical practice

in  Singapore  are comparable to reputable centres  overseas.

Medical errors resulting in deaths and serious injuries  here

are  rare,  but  when they occur there is  an  effective  and

objective  system to ensure that such errors  are  adequately

investigated   and   steps  are  taken  to   prevent   future

occurrence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister how many deaths were there in Singapore in the  past

10  years  due  to medical errors, and how many doctors  were

implicated as negligent?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I am sorry I do not have the

numbers here.  I will send the numbers to the Member.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he would

consider  mandatory reporting to the Ministry  of  Health  by

doctors on all medical errors including near misses, with the

assurance  from  the  Minister  that  this  is  a  matter  of

investigation so that certain improvements could be  made  to

correct  any  individual or system deficiency,  and  not  for

litigious proceedings?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I have explained in my answer,

there  is  a comprehensive system for reporting and follow-up

investigation.  We do this in a very comprehensive way  under

the medical audit programme.  So this is already in place and

any medical errors are reported and investigated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, with due respect, we do not have any

system  that requires all doctors to report  medical  errors,

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is a question of definition. Our

processes,   as   I  have  explained  in  my  answer,   cover

investigation of all the tissues which are taken  out  during

an   operation,  it  also  covers  any  severe  adverse  drug

reactions.  These are the key areas where medical errors  can

occur, and all these are followed up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards "near misses", it is a question of how one

defines a "near miss".  Medicine is not pure science.  It  is

both  science  as  well  as  art.   You  act  based  on   the

information available at that time.  Post-operation, you  may

discover  that  there were other information which  were  not

available.  So hindsight is always 20 upon 20.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we have in place a comprehensive system.

If  the  Member  has any further suggestions of  how  we  can

improve, we will be very happy to look at these suggestions.

<div align="center"><b>EPIDEMICS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a) what are the precautionary measures taken by  his

Ministry  to  prevent the spread of epidemics,  such  as  the

influenza  outbreak, to our much-travelled  and  much-visited

Singaporeans, and (b) whether steps are being put into  place

to  ensure that an adequate supply of vaccinations is  always

available in hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Health has a

comprehensive  and  well established surveillance  system  to

monitor  and detect epidemics, including influenza outbreaks.

This  enables the Ministry to take the appropriate preventive

and  control measures, including giving health advice to  the

public on precautionary measures, when necessary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenza is a self-limiting illness and patients

usually recover within a week.  In temperate countries,  when

epidemics occur during the cold winter season, the elderly as

well  as  children and adults with chronic medical conditions

such as heart and lung diseases, are at higher risk of having

serious  complications.  They are therefore advised  to  have

annual   influenza  vaccinations  as  a  preventive  measure.

However, in tropical countries like Singapore where influenza

occurs   throughout  the  year,  influenza   vaccination   is

generally not introduced on a routine basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently no recommendation from international

health  agencies, such as the World Health Organisation,  for

countries  to restrict travellers and visitors from  outbreak

areas.    The  Ministry,  however,  has  advised  travellers,

especially  older adults, going to countries  with  influenza

epidemics, to protect themselves with influenza vaccination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenza vaccination is available at Tan Tock Seng

Hospital,  Changi  General Hospital and  many  other  private

clinics.  While it is difficult to anticipate the demand  for

vaccination, over the years, the hospitals have maintained  a

sufficient supply of vaccine to meet the demand.  The  recent

increase in local demand for vaccination due to the influenza

epidemic  in  the West is unprecedented.  This, coupled  with

the  world-wide shortage of influenza vaccines, has led to  a

temporary  shortage  in  Singapore as  well.    However,  the

hospitals  have put in the orders for new vaccination  doses,

and  1,000 doses of such vaccines arrived last week.  Another

3,000  doses  will  arrive this week.  So,  the  shortage  is

overcome.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, will the Minister consider a more pro-active approach regarding giving information to our public

whenever   the   Ministry  detects  an   imminent   epidemic,

especially  to  inform  the susceptibles  to  go  for  either

vaccination or even immunicable injection?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Basically, the system has two

components.    One  is  whether  there  is  an  epidemic   in

Singapore, and we have a tracking system where we look

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

at  the  attendances in the hospitals,  polyclinics  and  the

private clinics, to see whether an epidemic is imminent or is

already  here.  If there is, then, of course, we put  out  an

advisory to advise the Singapore public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component is, of course, overseas epidemic,

and it only affects Singaporeans if they travel to that area.

For this, we also put up advisories as and when necessary  if

the epidemic is of a very severe nature in the countries that

Singaporeans  are  likely  to  travel  to,  and  then  advise

Singaporeans  to take vaccinations if they are travelling  to

such areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, could

the   Minister  clarify  whether  there  are  any  statistics

available  as to the loss to the economy in terms of  workers

taking leave during a flu epidemic?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We love to do many, many studies. We

will do this if it makes any sense or it gives us the numbers

to  do  something  about it.  In Singapore,  colds  and  flus

happen  throughout the year.  To some extent, our  population

builds  up some immunity.  When there is a very bad outbreak,

we  take  precautions.   We  send out  advisories  to  advise

Singaporeans to avoid crowded places, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how useful it is to know how much is lost to the

economy, I think that leaves to be seen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to follow up on

the  question  by Dr Lily Neo.  I refer to the more  specific

issue  of  the recent flu epidemic which occurred in  America

and,  I  believe, also in Europe.  Did our health authorities

know  about  this flu epidemic that happened in  America  and

Europe and, if so, did they take any steps to prevent the flu

coming to Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First of all, I do not take it upon

myself  to  find out when an epidemic occurs  in  the  US  or

Europe before the Health Ministers there.  We keep track with

all the  various agencies around the world and it is part  of

professional cooperation that we keep each other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>

informed   where  epidemics  are  imminent.   Similarly,   my

Ministry  keeps  in  touch with its counterparts  around  the

world.   So, when an epidemic has broken out or is  imminent,

it is professional practice to keep each other informed.  And

our  job  is  to let Singaporeans know and we  send  out  the

advice  so  that  those who are travelling to such  countries

could take the precaution of being vaccinated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission of such epidemics, particularly flu

epidemics, from temperate countries like the US to  Singapore

is  limited, unless we have huge numbers travelling there and

coming  back  to spread the flu around Singapore.   For  this

particular  epidemic,  for example,  we  have  not  seen  the

transference  of  the  epidemic to  Singapore,  but  we  will

continue  to take precautions and if the numbers do build  up

in Singapore, then we will advise the public accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  what advisory has the Singapore health  authorities

given  to  its  citizens,  because I  recently  travelled  to

America  and  I  went  straight into  this  flu  epidemic  in

America.  I came back and I suffered that flu for one  month.

I did not receive any advisory.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I will send a doctor to take a look

at  the  Member!  Is he cured?  If he is not, he  should  not

come to this crowded place.

<div align="center"><b>BY-ELECTION FOR JALAN BESAR GRC</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

he  has any new reason for not holding a by-election for  the

Jalan Besar GRC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, the reasons for not holding a by-

election in Jalan Besar GRC were fully debated in this  House

on 6th July 1999 when I responded to the motion raised by the

NCMP.   The  Prime Minister does not have any new reason  nor

does he need one for not holding a by-election in Jalan Besar

GRC.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Parliamentary Elections Act was amended to

provide   for   Group   Representation  Constituencies,   the

Government decided not to make it a legal requirement to hold

a  by-election  when  an  MP vacates his  seat  for  whatever

reasons.  This is to be fair to the other MPs in a GRC.  They

should  not  resign simply because a member in  the  GRC  had

vacated his seat.  It would also prevent them from being held

to  ransom  by an MP who may threaten to resign for  whatever

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of Parliament for Jalan Besar GRC were

elected  both  as  a team and as individuals.   The  existing

members will continue serving the whole GRC.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, at the risk of your ruling that  the  Minister

need  not  answer this, may I know why the Prime Minister  is

not  here  to answer this question?  After all, elections  is

his  responsibility, and not that of any  Minister.   But  my

supplementary question is this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am certainly ruling against that

question.   It is not relevant to the Question on  the  Order

Paper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have a supplementary question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I thought you would rule against it. Is

the  Minister,  speaking for the Prime Minister,  aware  that

when   the  Party  first  raised  this  question,  the  Prime

Minister's   reply  was  that  Singaporeans  could   not   be

distracted  from  the  grim  tasks  of  recovering  from  the

recession.  That was the only reason given.  He did not  give

any other reason.  I know that on 6th July 1999, the Minister

found  lots  of  other reasons, but I want to know  from  the

Prime Minister what is his new reason.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The Prime Minister can delegate any

Minister  to  reply  a  question on his  behalf.   The  Prime

Minister does not need to give a reason for not holding a by-election.  He had given one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

reason  before, and there are other reasons too.  But,  as  I

have  said,  the  law provides that it is  up  to  the  Prime

Minister  to  call  for a by-election for any  vacancy  in  a

constituency.  It is up to him.  That is in our law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask why is the Prime Minister not

obliged to give a reason to Parliament?  Is he accountable or

not accountable to Parliament?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the law does not provide for a

compulsory  calling  for  a by-election  whenever  a  vacancy

arises.  That is the power of the Prime Minister according to

the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I repeat my question? What is the

reason?   The  law  does  not prohibit  the  filling  of  the

vacancy.   The  Constitution  demands  that  the  vacancy  be

filled.  What is the reason for not filling the vacancy?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Can the Member quote me the Article in

the Constitution that demands a by-election be called?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister look up Article 49 of

the Constitution?  I read this on the 6th July debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, since the Member quotes Article

49,  maybe  he  can read Article 49 for us  so  that  we  can

understand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will certainly read it. Article 49

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant [may I repeat, the

seat of any Member other than a non-constituency Member,  has

become  vacant]  for any reason other than a  dissolution  of

Parliament,  the vacancy shall be filled by election  in  the

manner provided by or under any law relating to Parliamentary

elections for the time being in force.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not crystal clear? It states that the vacancy

of  any  Member other than that of a non-constituency  Member

shall be filled.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Article is very clear that a

by-election is to be called in accordance with the  law,  and

the  law  is the Parliamentary Elections Act.  If the  Member

does not know, read up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>

section  24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections  Act.   It  is

there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister appreciate that

section 24(2A) is purely procedural?  The substantive Article

is  Article  49.  In any event, the Article takes  precedence

over any law in any other Act of Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Article 49 is very clear that a

by-election  would be called in accordance with  any  written

law.   The  written  law for  election is  the  Parliamentary

Elections Act.  If the Non-Constituency Member feels that the

Government has violated the Constitution, then he should take

the case to the court and seek a redress there rather than to

raise  this here from time to time hoping that one  would  be

called so that he can try again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask why does the Prime Minister

not  openly admit that he fears a defeat at the hands of  the

Opposition?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think the Non-Constituency

Member is rather presumptuous that we are afraid of a defeat.

I  do not think we are ever afraid to confront any issue, but

when there is a need to, we will do it.  But the law does not

provide for compulsory by-election.  The Prime Minister  does

not think there is a need for it, and that is it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would he like to put it to the test?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, he will have another chance to

have  a  crack  at  it.  He could choose any constituency  he

wants at the next general elections.

<div align="center"><b>POLICING OF PARKS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Home Affairs what steps are being taken to police the various

parks  that are used by joggers and others so as to ensure  a

safe environment for them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the

National  Parks Board, Police and the community  are  jointly

responsible for ensuring safety in our public parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police, in addition to park rangers, regularly

patrol  public parks, to project their presence.  The  Police

also carry out anti-crime operations whenever necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police cannot be everywhere all the time to prevent

and  deter  crime.   Members of the public should  also  play

their part and take proper precautions, such as not going  to

secluded  or  poorly-lit places when they  are  alone.   They

should  also  report  to the Police or the  park  authorities

whenever they see suspicious persons lurking in the vicinity.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Is it not true

that recently there was a case where a jogger was attacked in

broad  daylight  and, as a result, suffered  fatal  injuries?

Would  that not be regarded as a particularly worrying  thing

for us to look again at the security in the parks?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Our sympathies are with the

family of this girl on the incidence of this crime.  It is  a

heinous crime.  But the point is this:  The overall situation

in the parks is safe. That is an important point to note.  In

fact,  over  the last two years, only seven out  of  the  228

rapes  were committed in the parks and playgrounds.   All  of

them were committed, except for one, by persons known to  the

victims.  While  the incident is something  that  all  of  us

deplore, the point is that unless you take unnecessary  risks

in our parks, it would be quite safe to use our parks.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the nature of this

crime, and perhaps the nature and manner in which it has been

reported  by  the media, has left an indelible impression  in

the minds of the public with respect to the general security,

notwithstanding the recent crime statistics

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>

and  their  improvement.   The question  is  this:   can  the

Ministry  and the police do more to reassure the public  that

matters are indeed under control?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, certainly, police on the

ground in the various divisions know where patrols need to be

done.  Indeed, with the new Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC)

set  up,  more  patrols have been projected  on  the  ground.

Police's estimation is that last year about 4% more in  terms

of  police projection was on the ground.  We should leave  it

to  the  police to exercise professional judgment  where  the

patrols  should be mounted.   As I have said, I am sure  they

do  regularly  patrol parks.  If there are  parks  out  there

which  are  secluded, police presence will be felt.   I  have

been  told that, in fact, at the particular park in question,

ie,  the  Bukit Batok Nature Park, police patrols are mounted

there.   Having said this, let me also say that while  police

will  certainly do its part, the community can  also  do  its

part.  For example, under the CSSP, there is a park, ie,  the

Bukit  Purmei  Park,  where the community  has  also  mounted

patrols.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our parks are safe. But, as in anywhere, if a

person  is not aware of the risk and danger, even walking  at

night  -  of course, we are very safe here - if it so happens

that  you are at the wrong place at the wrong time, a heinous

crime can also take place.  Our parks are safe.  Let me  give

that  assurance.  Police is mindful that there is a need  for

them  to  be aware professionally of areas in the  park  that

need  patrol and yet, at the same time, the call  is  to  all

Singaporeans  to  also  take this call  to   heart  not,  for

example, as I have said, to be alone in secluded places or at

night.   At  the  same time, on the ground,  under  the  CSSP

programme, if community leaders like yourselves, working with

your  grassroots, feel that certain parks need more  patrols,

you  can also, working with the police, work out arrangements

which will benefit park users.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, while I am aware that

the police force is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

constrained  by limited human resources, would  the  Minister

consider  greater  use  of  alternative  approaches  such  as

surveillance  cameras in the more secluded places  to  ensure

safety  and  to  give greater comfort and confidence  to  the

people using such secluded places?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, certainly. When I said

CSSP,  I have cited park patrols only as one example.   Other

examples can be considered, such as surveillance cameras  and

lighting  up  certain  areas of the park  which  need  to  be

lighted  up.  I think that if we are proactive, more  can  be

done.   What I am saying is that certainly police takes  this

case  in  hand  and the message that is being sent,  and  the

importance  of police patrols.  The presence of park  patrols

is  also important.  At the same time, all of us can also  do

our  part,  as users of the park, to be mindful  of  possible

dangers  and risks and, also working with grassroots  leaders

on  the  ground, take whatever steps that can be helpful.   I

thank  Mr Sin for this suggestion, as he himself has done  in

Tampines,   about   the  use  of  surveillance   cameras   in

appropriate settings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Would the Ministry consider setting up

a   DNA  database  of  known  or  convicted  criminals  as  a

deterrence?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> DNA, in fact, is being used

now,  where  appropriate, to identify or match  the  culprit.

The  Member is right in that currently we do not have  a  DNA

database.  Police is looking into the possibility of  setting

up such a database.

Question time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister says that the

overall  situation is safe, but if you look at the facts,  it

is not so.  Rape, in fact, is on the increase.  In fact, this

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to establish a

statutory  board  to  be  known as the  Defence  Science  and

Technology

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>

Agency.   The  new  Agency is to be formed from  the  Defence

Technology  Group in the Ministry of Defence,  together  with

parts  of  the  Defence Administration Group in the  Ministry

dealing  with  science and technology.  The  Agency  will  be

charged  with the responsibility of providing the most  cost-effective and appropriate leading-edge technology to the SAF.



<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to briefly trace the history of the

Defence Technology Group and its roles in supporting the  SAF

since the beginning of the Republic of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Technology Group had its origins in the

Logistics  Division of the Ministry of Interior and  Defence,

set  up in 1966.  Defence industries were set up in 1967  and

research laboratories in 1972.  MINDEF was the first Ministry

to  embrace  IT with the set up of the Systems  and  Computer

Organisation in 1979.  Today, the Defence Technology Group is

a  smart  defence  equipment buyer as well  as  a  leader  in

applying  new  technologies  to  defence  applications.    It

performs  a wide range of functions for MINDEF and  the  SAF,

ranging from research and development to maintenance support,

procurement  to  defence  industry  development.   Under  the

prevailing  system,  the  SAF concentrates  on  training  and

operations,  while  the  Ministry  of  Defence  provides  the

manpower  and financial resources as well as the  procurement

and technological support.



<br><br><i>Rationale for Statutory Board</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I explained in Parliament in March last

year  the rationale for the formation of the statutory board,

which I would like to reiterate this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has always been, and will continue to be

critical  to  the  SAF  in the 21st century.   Technology  is

advancing  at  a rapid rate.  As new technology  and  systems

emerge,  existing ones become obsolete.  To ensure  that  the

SAF  maintains  and sharpens its technological  edge,  MINDEF

needs to be able to respond more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

quickly  and flexibly to technological change.  Yet, it  will

be  impractical for MINDEF to simply continue to  expand  its

engineering   talent  pool.   This  will  only  distort   the

deployment of the national engineering resource.  Instead  of

simply  growing  larger, we have to do  things  smarter.   To

transcend  our  manpower limitations, we need to  effectively

tap  on  external engineering expertise from either local  or

overseas organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet these challenges, it is imperative that we

find  new  ways of repositioning and re-organising ourselves.

At  present, the DTG in MINDEF undertakes the whole range  of

technology functions, from policy formulation to acquisition,

maintenance  and  development.  Although this  structure  was

suitable for the build up of our capabilities in the past, it

is  not  optimal and cannot provide the degree of  nimbleness

and flexibility that will be required in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, MINDEF has decided to form a new statutory

board  to  provide  a more flexible and nimble  framework  to

implement defence technology policies and plans.  MINDEF will

then  be  better  able to concentrate on  the  core  Ministry

functions of policy, planning and resource allocation.



<br><br><i>Formation of DSTA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Agency is to be formed by merging all the

procurement  and science and technology-related  entities  of

the Ministry of Defence.  It will serve as an agent of MINDEF

and  the SAF in achieving their scientific, technological and

equipping goals.  These entities have about 2,400 staff.  The

corporatised DSO National Laboratories, which has  about  900

staff,  will  remain a corporate entity; but its  supervision

and  control  will  be transferred from  MINDEF  to  the  new

Agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will retain responsibility for oversight

and  control  of  the new agency to ensure that  the  desired

results are achieved.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Key Provisions of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the key aspects of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill, read together with the First

Schedule,  provides  for the constitution  of  the  Board  of

Directors  of  the  Agency.  The Minister  for  Defence  will

appoint  the Chairman and directors of the Board.  The  Chief

Executive  of the Agency will be appointed with the  approval

of the Minister, under clause 10.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the mission and functions of the

Agency.   The  Agency shall harness and exploit  science  and

technology,   and   provide  technological  and   engineering

support,  to meet the defence and national security needs  of

Singapore.  Its broad functions are to advise the Ministry of

Defence  on  all  matters  relating to  defence  science  and

technology,   to  provide  defence  science  and   technology

services  and  facilities  to  MINDEF,  and  to  promote  and

facilitate   the   development   of   defence   technological

capability in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the powers of the Agency. Among other

things,  the  Agency will be empowered to form companies  and

participate in joint ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 13 pertain to appointments of the Chief

Executive,  officers  and employees of the  Agency.   Special

provisions  have  been  included to  guarantee  the  Agency's

continued operations, especially in times of emergency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 14 to 21 are the financial provisions. The main

source of funding for the Agency will be in the form of  fees

for services and functions performed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22 to 29 provide for the transfer of property,

assets,  liabilities and employees to the Agency.   Property,

assets  and liabilities as may be determined by the  Minister

for Finance will be transferred to the Agency.  A substantial

number  of  MINDEF  and SAF employees currently  employed  in

MINDEF,  the SAF, and in the DSO National Laboratories,  will

be  transferred  to the Agency.  They will be transferred  on

terms not less favourable than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

what they were enjoying immediately before the transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 30 to 34 are general provisions. Clause 32

provides for the preservation of secrecy.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have always recognised the role of

technology as an important force multiplier to give  the  SAF

the edge.  It is vital that we be proactive and innovative in

exploiting  technology.  The Bill before the House  sets  out

the  legislative  framework to establish the Defence  Science

and  Technology Agency.  The Agency will be nimble to respond

quickly  to  changes  in technology,  so  that  the  SAF  can

continue to receive cost-effective technology support to help

it maintain its strategic edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

GPC   for   Defence   and   Foreign  Affairs   supports   the

establishment  of the Defence Science and Technology  Agency.

However,  we  wish to raise some points of  concern  in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is timely to establish the Defence Science and

Technology  Agency as the integrated body  for  defence  R&D,

technology, IT, communications, command, defence procurement,

and land and estates matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no doubt the right move to put all under one roof,

with  an  integrated management and command, with  a  central

focus  and  direction.  It will  maximise,  I  am  sure,  the

synergy, resources and impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater flexibility, it will be easier for the

Agency  to attract, nurture and retain the best talents,  and

enlarge  the  talent  pool.  Talent is the  critical  factor.

With  the  right strategy and deployment, the R&D talent  can

tip the scale between victory and defeat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Agency has a pivotal role in the defence of

Singapore,  especially  in  this technological  and  IT  age.

Defence  research, development and related preparations  will

indeed decide the outcome of war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology alters the course of war. The machine gun in

the  First  World War, the tanks and aircrafts in the  Second

World War, and the precision guided missiles in the Gulf  war

changed  the  face of warfare.  Next it will be  the  digital

battlefield and cyber warfare.  The Agency can therefore give

the  SAF  the  comparative advantage,  the  cutting  edge  in

technology, communications and IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Agency does its job, we will win the war before

the  first  shot is fired.  Better still, such intensive  and

thorough  preparations will deter any  potential  enemy  from

waging  war against us.  The strategy of deterrence is indeed

our best bet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with what Sun Tzu, the best known Asian

strategist said 2,000 years ago, that the best strategy is to

win  without fighting, and to out-plan and out-manoeuvre  the

enemy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise two points for consideration and

clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the `no strike' clause which stated that "No

employee  of  the Agency shall go on strike or  instigate  or

initiate  others  to  take  part  in  or  otherwise  act   in

furtherance  of  any industrial action."   I  appreciate  the

sensitive nature of the work of this Agency, and that we must

not  and  cannot  afford strikes and  disruption  in  such  a

critical area.  I appeal to the Agency management not to  use

this  clause  as a fig leaf but to take it as a  calling,  as

their special responsibility, to place an even higher premium

and  priority on good employee-management relationship.  They

should  take care of the interests and welfare of  all  their

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Agency to put in place procedures for

handling  staff  grievances  and appeals  and  provide  ample

opportunities for staff dialogues and counselling.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask whether this prohibits the employees from

joining the NTUC union or the general branch of the NTUC, not

for  industrial actions, but for welfare purposes and for the

wide range of benefits of NTUC membership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is that the Agency will present

its  annual  report to a committee, appointed  by  the  Prime

Minister, instead of to Parliament.  This is indeed a special

provision, necessitated again by the sensitive nature of  its

work.  I hope the persons appointed to this committee will be

thorough in their scrutiny and fearless in their enquiry, for

the good of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I welcome the

introduction of this Bill which will see the creation of  the

DSTA  which  has  evolved  out of the  restructuring  of  the

Ministry  of  Defence's Defence Technology  Group.   It  will

certainly  become a one-stop Agency to advise MINDEF  on  key

matters as laid out in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly endorse the statement of the GPC

Chairman for Defence and Foreign Affairs on the pivotal  role

of technology, how it will help one to win wars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Deputy Prime Minister to

consider  the following matters in respect of the Bill.   The

first matter that I would like to raise is on the composition

of  the board of directors under clause 5(1).  Sir, the First

Schedule  states that the persons who can be  appointed  must

have  public administration experience or be involved in  the

defence, science or technology field.  Sir, I would urge  the

Minister to consider the scope of those who would qualify  as

I  feel  that it would be unduly restrictive if  one  was  to

restrict appointees to these two categories.  With the Agency

aiming to be nimble and something that would be similar to  a

corporatised  agency,  it  will  be  appropriate   if   other

individuals who may qualify should be considered and co-opted

as directors of the board.  Perhaps, some CEOs in the private

sector

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>

who  may  be  able to contribute good corporate  practice  or

certain  business practices can be incorporated as  directors

to  the  board.  I would urge that the clause in the Schedule

be  amended  to also include a clause to say that "any  other

individual  whom  the Minister deems appropriate  or  fit  to

serve as director".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise another issue under clause

11(2)  which requires an employee to work for the  DSTA  when

the  Minister so orders.  Sir, I am not sure that this  is  a

provision worth inserting as it is no good trying to keep  an

employee whom you have tried to persuade to stay but refuses.

So why keep a body if his soul is not in it?  Sir, the courts

have  long  hesitated  to supervise such  clauses  as  it  is

something   very   difficult  to  supervise  and   implement.

Perhaps, the Minister may wish to delete the clause  and  try

persuasion and provide incentives for such employees to stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another clause which is clause 11(4), prohibits

strikes and industrial action.  Naturally, some are concerned

as  to  whether it is something that infringes the  right  of

every worker in Singapore and whether we are compromising the

rights  of  workers  in Singapore.  I would  have  been  much

happier  if  the  mechanism on how workers' rights  would  be

protected in the DSTA could have been spelt out either in the

Bill  itself  or as a Schedule to the Bill so that  employees

within the DSTA can feel comforted that their grievances  and

problems  can  be heard by the management in the  appropriate

way  and  some resolution sought in the most appropriate  way

within  the  organisation.  Sir, I look forward to  the  DSTA

working out an arrangement, together with the involvement  of

the  trade  union movement, NTUC in Singapore to ensure  that

workers within the DSTA are adequately protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that I would like to raise is on the

question  of  accountability to Parliament.  Sir,  clause  19

recognises  that  the  Minister  dispenses  money  given   by

Parliament  to DSTA.  But nowhere in the Bill do  I  see  any

accountability to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>

Parliament.   The Bill requires under clause  30  the  annual

report  of  the DSTA to be given to the Minister for  Defence

and  he, in turn, will hand it to a committee to be appointed

by  the  Prime  Minister.  Who sits in this committee  to  be

appointed  by the Prime Minister is unclear and nowhere  does

it say that Members of Parliament will be represented in this

committee.  As Parliament dispenses funds to the Ministry  of

Defence  and in turn they dispense this fund to the  DSTA,  I

would  urge that this committee to be appointed is  one  that

takes  into  its ambit people from different fields  who  can

supervise the work of DSTA and ensure that the funds  of  the

DSTA  are  properly  used and some of the  research  that  is

undertaken  by the DSTA is  appropriate to the needs  of  our

defence  forces.   I  would also urge  the  Minister  to  see

whether there could be certain instances where the report  of

DSTA  could  be given to Parliament.  Because in  the  United

Kingdom  there  is  an equivalent agency called  the  Defence

Research   Agency  which  indeed  provides  its   report   to

Parliament on what exactly it does, not in specifics, but  at

least a broad picture of what exactly it does so that Members

of Parliament can see what exactly this organisation is doing

and in particular whether the fund and research that is being

undertaken   are  appropriately  and  properly  used.    Sir,

naturally,  as  the body that approves the  money  for  DSTA,

Parliament  will be interested in ensuring that  these  funds

are effectively and efficiently used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that I am concerned with is clause

32(3)  which states that a ministerial certificate stating  a

matter  to  be  secret will be deemed secret  and  cannot  be

disclosed  to Parliament or any other person.  Sir,  I  am  a

little  uncomfortable, as I am always wary of the  judge  and

jury being the same person.  It may perhaps be appropriate if

the  secrecy  of  the matter is verified by  a  third  party,

perhaps  even  by a committee to be appointed  by  the  Prime

Minister  under clause 32, which hopefully will  not  be  one

that is totally dominated by the Executive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those comments, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  strengthening of national security deserves the  support

of   every   Singaporean   and  I   therefore   support   the

strengthening of national security and what this Bill aims to

achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference that this Agency will make heavily

depends on the quality and the motivation of people who  work

in  this  Agency.  I support what the Minister said that  you

need  to have talent and talent that can work smart.   So  in

reviewing the Bill, I have looked at how this Agency tries to

look  at  staff matters, the people who work for this Agency.

I am glad that they spend more than one part devoted to staff

matters  and staff moving to this Agency from elsewhere  were

given  an assurance that they would not lose out in terms  of

remuneration and recognition of service.  As employees  of  a

statutory  board, I assume that they can be  a  trade  union,

they  can  get  representation rights and these are  positive

things.   However,  there are some aspects of  the  provision

that  do  not  really give the right signal that  people  are

valuable, can be trusted and can be treated as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some concerns on those provisions and I would

like  to  express them.  I am referring to clause 11(2)  that

empowers  the  Minister to compel an  employee  to  carry  on

working even if he or she has tendered in her resignation  as

well as clause 11(4) which prohibits employees from going  on

strike  or  to  take industrial action.  When  employees  are

unhappy,  they  normally  express it  by  voicing  out  their

complaints.   In most places, when they are not  heard,  they

leave.  So we say that you either voice it or if it cannot be

heard,  you just leave and exit.  This Bill puts restrictions

on both.  And I ask:  is it really necessary?  Are we sending

the right signal?  Is our existing law not adequate to handle

differences  that may arise between an Agency,  or  for  that

matter,  any employer, and its employees?  Someone who  wants

to  leave  and  he is asked to carry on is an unhappy  worker

which  will  not  contribute  to  morale  and  general   work

environment of the workplace.  So why is he leaving?  And if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>

there  was  a  union, he could articulate  his  concerns  and

aspirations  of workers which can be addressed early,  wisely

and reduce the chance of a trade dispute arising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming on to clause 11(4) on strikes and industrial

action, I would like to say that strike is an ultimate weapon

for the workers and the unions.  Even if the workers call for

a  strike,  the  workers have a great probability  that  they

might  lose their jobs, they might lose their income and,  in

some  countries,  even  their lives.   Strikes  are  never  a

preferred  option for trade unions.  In Singapore, there  had

not  been a strike since 1977 except for one during the  last

recession.   Strikes, since they are not a preferred  option,

happen for various reasons.  One of it is that it is actually

an  open  manifestation of conflict and a total breakdown  of

consensus.   It  is an explosion of pent-up feelings.   These

feelings  and bad blood get bottled up because procedures  to

handle disputes are inefficient or inadequate.  I also accept

that  there  may  even be elements who might use  strikes  to

promote  their  narrow interests and cause  havoc.   But  are

these possible in today's Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show this question, I just want to review and talk

about  the  laws that exist here.  We have the  Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Act and the Trade Disputes  Act  which

prohibit strikes and lock-outs in water, electricity and  gas

services.   It is these three areas which render  service  to

the  community and we are all dependent on them.   But  while

the  law  prohibits a strike, it also prohibits lock-out.   I

ask  why  this  Agency,  which is so  important  to  national

interest,  prohibits strikes but not lock-out.  The  Criminal

Law  (Temporary  Provisions) Act and the Trade  Disputes  Act

also  provide for workers in essential services to  give  two

weeks'  notice  before  commencing  a  strike  or  industrial

action.  It has to be in pursuit of a trade dispute.  It  has

to  be employment related.  And the Trade Unions Act actually

says that the majority of union members who are involved have

to give support for this industrial action and they have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>

show  their support through a secret ballot.  And during this

period of two weeks' cooling-off period, efforts can be  made

to  resolve the dispute and if the dispute is referred to the

Industrial Arbitration Court, no strike or industrial  action

can  take place.  Strike, I say again, is an extreme  measure

taken   only  if  pushed  and  there  are  no  other  options

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Act in Singapore therefore has

comprehensive    provisions   for   collective    bargaining,

conciliation  and  arbitration  of  trade  disputes.    These

provisions  have given us industrial peace with justice.   It

has  served us well.  Why does the Agency not want to use the

existing   laws   instead  of  imposing  new  and   seemingly

unnecessary restrictions on trade unions and workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I said is whether we are giving the

right  signals.  The Singapore worker is widely broadcast  as

the number one workforce in the world and the Singapore trade

union movement as a responsible one that is not afraid to put

national  interests  before that of sectoral  interest.   Our

legal   system  governing  employment  is  ranked   high   by

investors.  We have a track record to show our responsibility

as  a  movement and its workforce.  Only last year, Singapore

workers  accepted  a wage cut without any social  unrest.   I

ask:   in  these  provisions of the Bill, is  the  Government

giving  a  different signal in its trust  and  faith  in  the

Singapore workers and the Singapore unions?  Is there  enough

confidence in our present legal system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say the solution to ensure that

we have got the right people, highly motivated people working

for the Agency for the good of the country, is not by placing

restrictions  on  people,  but rather  by  putting  in  place

procedures  in  which  grievances  can  be  handled  quickly,

effectively   and  smoothly,  and  you  have  processes   and

procedures  to handle people's needs and aspirations.   There

will  be differences.  Any organisation will have differences

but  we must address them and resolve them fairly and justly.

Singapore's proven way of treating people and workers  fairly

by giving them reasonable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>

and good remuneration, listening to concerns, addressing them

and involving them or using active citizenship, has worked in

most  places,  and there is a track record  to  it.   If  you

follow  these tested methods, then I am sure that the  Agency

will  have a highly motivated and committed workforce and  in

that  case,  there  is  no need to worry  so  much  of  trade

disputes  and  industrial actions. This is  a  challenge  for

management  and  I  urge the Minister to review  and  clarify

these points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the formation of the Agency as a consolidation of

our  resources  in  the defence industry.  As  maintaining  a

strong   defence   capability  is  crucial  for   Singapore's

continuing peace and security, I am happy with its  evolution

and the successes that occasionally appear in the news media.

Whilst   the  formation  of  such  an  Agency  is  a  natural

progression, I am filled with some unease.  Perhaps,  I  have

been  watching too many science fiction movies  that  portray

renegade    defence   agencies   carrying    out    unethical

experimentations and developments.  Quite naturally, the work

of  a  defence agency must generally be kept secret.   Clause

32(3)  provides  the Minister with the power to  certify  any

information  as  of  a secret nature and  as  stated  in  the

clause,  such information or matter shall not be required  to

be  disclosed to Parliament or any such person.  There is  no

provision for a Committee to monitor the works of the  Agency

to ensure that it does not breach any universal ethical rule.

Since defence development may involve ethical issues, such as

the  development  of land mines, biological weapons,  etc,  I

feel  that it would be too much to keep it purely within  the

Ministry of Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my belief that there is a need to have a

monitoring  body, comprising at least the Prime Minister  and

two  other Ministers from other Ministries, and in  fact,  it

would be my preference to include an independent person, such

as the President of the Republic of Singapore. The setting up

of such a Committee is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>

critical   since  defence  matters,  by  nature,  cannot   be

discussed  openly without compromising the national interest.

As  pointed  out earlier by Mr Ravindran, there is  really  a

need for secrecy to be independently verified.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I share the recognition of

the  importance of science and technology to  defence  and  I

also think that it is important to see that there can be spin-offs  from  such  research  which may  have  value-added  for

development of Singapore's technology and economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Bill. And if the Minister says

that  it  is  for flexibility, I also think that starting  an

Agency  to  deal  with the subject matter is also  worthy  of

support.   My concern then is, like the others, more  on  the

effects of creating such an agency quite independent  of  the

Ministry  and scrutiny of Parliament, and of the  effects  of

the Bill before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point, Mr Speaker, is about something that I

was  a  bit  puzzled by and which perhaps  the  Minister  can

explain.   Of  the  departments that are to  be  incorporated

within the Agency, looking at clause 2, I notice that one  of

the  Agencies  is Lands and Estates.  I am a little  puzzled.

Perhaps  I do not understand the functions of this department

why this should be part of our Defence Science and Technology

Agency, rather than part of the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I return my concern to clause 6(3) of the

Bill.   Clause  6(3) permits the Agency to undertake  certain

functions  as  the  Minister  may  assign.  The  Agency   may

undertake and, in so doing, the Agency shall be deemed to  be

fulfilling the purposes of this Act.  This power to me  is  a

little  too  wide  and yet, at the same time,  a  little  too

loose.   It  may be too wide in the sense that in  comparison

with this, clause 6(2) constrains the Agency much more to the

purposes  that  the  Minister  has  explained.   Even  clause

6(2)(l),  which  is the general one, allows the  Ministry  to

perform  such other functions as are conferred on the  Agency

by  any  other written law.  In clause 6(3), we go much  more

broader as "such other functions as the Minister himself  may

assign" and does not even say in writing.  But yet,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>

while  the  power  is  so wide, I do not understand  why  the

Agency  may  take  up such an instruction from  the  Minister

rather than "shall".  Perhaps, the Minister can clarify  that

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point I share with many of the speakers before

me  is with regard to clause 11(2) and (4).  I think I cannot

improve on what Mr Thomas, the NMP, has said on clause  11(4)

with  regard to the impact on trade unions and labour law  in

Singapore.   Let  me then focus on clause  11(2).   Here,  as

Members  have said before me, this provision is for  enforced

employment.  I would like to remind the Minister that Article

10  of the Constitution actually prohibits forced labour.  If

I may read Article 10:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) No person shall be held in slavery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All forms of forced labour are prohibited, but

Parliament  may  by  law provide for compulsory  service  for

national purposes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, of course, that the second part

"Parliament  may  by law provide" is probably  where  we  are

coming  to  now.   But I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

recognise  that this should be a power that is  exceptionally

used.  Why is it such an exception?  It could be that this is

an  essential  service such as police,  fire  protection  and

other matters.  May I ask the Minister's assurance that  this

clause  is  in  line  with  those other  essential  services.

Because we are in a bit of conundrum here.  If the service is

so  essential, why should it be under an Agency  rather  than

directly under the Ministry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to the powers of the Agency to

procure.  Sir, as we know, powers to procure for defence mean

large  sums of money and we have all heard nightmare  stories

of  procurement  for  research in other countries  where  the

system had led to overpriced procurement of what seems to  be

everyday goods.  I want to be reassured that the Agency  will

continue  to  follow  Singapore's  system  of  prudence   and

scrutiny. What then may I ask the Minister, would the changes

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>

to  Government  procedures for tendering and  accountability?

What  are the likely increased financial costs? The Bill says

that   we   would  likely  incur  some  additional  financial

expenditure.  We do not know how much.  Particularly,  may  I

ask  the  Minister  whether Government will,  even  with  the

creation  of the Agency, stay within the existing  guidelines

on  our  military expenditure as part of the  GDP?   In  this

regard, I too share a concern that the lack of accountability

to  Parliament  and the Minister's powers to declare  certain

things  to  be a secret must be broadly shared by a Committee

of Parliament such as the GPC or other Ministers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, let me first declare

that  I  am an employee of the National Trades Union Congress

and my views reflect that of the NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has had discussions with the Ministry of

Defence  and Ministry of Manpower on the Defence Science  and

Technology  Agency Bill because it touches on the fundamental

right of trade unions, ie, the right to strike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in the NTUC, do not like to see the abrogation of

such a right.  It is not that our unions are strike-happy  or

that  the industrial relations situation in Singapore  is  so

poor  that  unions do not threaten companies with  industrial

actions,  they  could not get management to settle  disputes.

In  fact, we have had no strike since 1977 except for a brief

one  in  1986.   But  no strike does not  mean  no  disputes.

Because  we have good relations with many employers,  we  had

been  able  to settle these disputes mainly through bilateral

negotiations. When we run into difficulties, we  refer  cases

to the Ministry of Manpower for conciliation.  Only rarely do

cases reach the Industrial Arbitration Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, the NTUC sanctioned a strike at Hydril, makers

of  parts of oil rigs for two reasons.   First, to punish the

management for their anti-union actions. The company had  set

unrealistically high productivity targets and  when  workers,

including those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>

elected  as union leaders, failed to reach the targets,  they

were  sacked.  Such anti-union actions, if  unchecked,  would

undermine the credibility of the labour movement. The  strike

was  over in two days. The management agreed to take back the

Branch  Treasurer  and  to compensate  five  other  dismissed

workers who later declined offers to return to their jobs. So

it  is  crucial that we have the means to take strike actions

if  management were to adopt a decidedly anti-union stance in

a  labour strike.  But strike action is not the objective  of

our unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, when Mr Ong Teng Cheong was Labour Minister, he

got  Parliament  to amend the legislation  to  re-define  the

objectives  of trade unions.  Instead of having  unions  with

such objectives as (1) imposing the restrictive conditions on

the  conduct  of  work, and (2) promoting  or  organising  or

financing  of strikes or lock-outs, the new definition  would

give  these  as  the objectives of our trade unions:  (1)  to

promote   good  industrial  relations  between  workmen   and

employers;  (2) to promote the working conditions of  workers

or  enhance the economic and social status; and (3) to  raise

productivity  for the benefit of workers, employers  and  the

nation's  economy.  One Opposition MP completely misread  the

situation.  He thought the amendment would spell the death of

trade unions.  How wrong he was!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have far more members in trade unions than in

1982  and  our  trade  unions are stronger  and  influential.

Labour MPs in 1982 fully supported the re-definition of trade

union objectives.  As they put it, a strike is a means to  an

end and not an end in itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Bill before the House, we must ask

these questions.  What is the job of the DSTA?  Who are to be

posted  there?  Why does MINDEF wish to stipulate a no-strike

clause?  MINDEF is transforming its Defence Technology  Group

into  a statutory board to be called the Defence Science  and

Technology  Agency.  This means staff working in  the  Agency

would be like employees of any statutory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>

board.  They can join the union whereas as MINDEF  personnel,

they  cannot.   Through the DSTA, staff  will  operate  in  a

statutory  board  environment.  The  work  they  do   remains

basically  the  same.   It is defence-related,  for  example,

logistics  support,  ensuring that our  defence  systems  are

fully  operational  at  all  times  and  providing  technical

support for the SAF in peacetime and in war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence of our country is paramount. As such, we

accept  the no-strike clause for DSTA employees.  A no-strike

clause  is  not new  in Singapore or even the more  developed

countries  around the world.  In 1967, the Government  sought

to  amend the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to  ban

strikes  by  workers engaged in the very essential  services,

namely, water, gas and electricity services.  While conceding

that  the  provision by itself would appear to be  a  drastic

step  in  curtailing  the rights of trade  unions  to  go  on

strike, the Government said that it was necessary for  it  to

ensure  that  the  public was not held to  ransom  by  a  few

irresponsible elements.  The Government was referring  to  an

illegal   strike  by  public  daily-rated  cleansing  workers

earlier in the year. Labour MPs protested over the erosion of

trade union rights. They argued that there was already a  law

to  prevent  workers from going on strike.  If the Government

felt  that  such action would be detrimental to the  good  of

society,  the Government could refer a dispute to arbitration

and  this  would  automatically  make  an  industrial  action

illegal.   After  a spirited debate, the no-strike  Bill  was

passed over strenuous objections by some labour MPs.  But, in

a  spirit  of  democracy, union leaders had to  persuade  the

ground to accept the will of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three years have passed. Since then, unions

representing water, electricity and gas workers have  secured

better  terms  and conditions of service for  their  workers,

despite not having the strike weapon to use as a last resort.

All  these years, water, electricity and gas supply has  been

flowing without interruption to our homes, our factories  and

workplaces.  Where necessary, our water, electricity and  gas

workers have turned to the NTUC

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>

for help to resolving conflicts with the management and, with

goodwill, problems have been resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need not be apologetic about giving up the right

to strike for it is not a new idea and even adopted by unions

in  developed  countries.  Now, let us take  a  look  at  the

situation  in  Britain.  Let me quote what Sir  Ken  Jackson,

General   Secretary  of  the  Amalgamated   Engineering   and

Electrical Union (AEEU), had to say about industrial  action.

He  said,  "I  want to see a strike-free future  for  British

industry."   As  he told the congress of the  United  Kingdom

Trades  Union Congress (TUC) in September 1999, workers  want

to work, not strike, and there could be "no return to the bad

old  days".   Well, Sir Ken, leader of 732,000-member  union,

could  see his vision come true when the measures of the  new

Employment Relations Bill come into effect in the  summer  of

this  year.  The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union

of  the  UK is a large and expanding union, and they are  not

alone  in  promising no-strike agreements to attract  foreign

investments  to  their  country  to  create  jobs  for  their

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing number of unions in Britain have signed

partnership agreements with companies since 1997 when the TUC

produced  a  document entitled "Partners  for  Progress"  and

endorsed  the Labour Party's initiative of creating  a  union

partnership with industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Iron Workers Local 17 signed a

no-strike    clause   with   the   Construction    Employers'

Association.    When the contract expired in  May  1991,  the

union  and the employers' group extended the pact.  When  the

union  went  on strike, the employers took it  to  court  for

violating the no-strike clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastern Airlines and the union representing its flight

attendants  told  an  American court in 1991  that  they  had

reached an agreement that would prevent a strike over a three-year period.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, General Motors told Wall Street investors that

the  United  Auto Workers (UAW) had given a no-strike  pledge

before a new national contract was signed.  On its part,  the

union said that it had agreed to ban strikes at three plants,

in  return for a company pledge not to shut down or sell  the

plants for 16 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the unions in the West have agreed to give up the

right  to  strike  -  for job security.  While we  may  think

that  Arthur Scargill of the coal miners union is  a  typical

British  trade unionist, the fact of the matter is that  many

union leaders in Britain had for many years gone to Japan and

other  countries to promise no-strike agreements in order  to

persuade investors to come to Britain and to create jobs  for

British workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I would like to amplify what my

colleagues  have  said earlier, and more  so  for  me  as  an

employee of the National Trades Union Congress, that we  must

emphatically call upon the management of DSTA to be  fair  to

our  workers now that they have to forgo the right to strike.

In the case of DSTA, we are giving up the right to strike for

an  even  more important reason, our national security.   One

may  say  that the workers at DSTA are non-combat  personnel,

but  their  jobs  are no less important  to  the  defence  of

Singapore for they provide logistical support for the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should always remind ourselves about our

vulnerability  and we must never compromise on  our  national

security.  I am sure Singaporeans have not forgotten that not

too long ago, we were referred to as a "little red dot".   We

must give our SAF and our NSmen full confidence that they can

call on every resource without disruption and interruption to

defend this "little red dot" on the map.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the people in DSTA who will be able to join the

union?  The majority are non-uniformed SAF personnel who  are

responsible  for logistics support for the  SAF.   There  are

1,112  of  them.   There  are 440  civilians   -    engineers

engaged in research and maintenance work and a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>

small  number  in the clerical grades.  Then  there  are  137

military staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much work ahead of us. The NTUC will have to

sell  trade unionism to those eligible for membership.  I  am

quite  glad  that  my  GPC  Chairman  has  called  upon   the

management to encourage workers to join the union.   We  will

have  to do the work to sell trade unionism to these workers.

We  cannot take for granted that since they can join a union,

those deployed to DSTA will want to become union members, but

we  hope  that the majority of those eligible for  membership

will  sign up.  We are confident that the DSTA will throw  up

some  good union leaders.  More importantly, we will need  to

help  the  DSTA union to work out a machinery  to  deal  with

labour-management relations.  In our discussions with MINDEF,

we  have  been assured that the DSTA management  will  accord

full recognition to the union and extend full cooperation  in

resolving work related problems.  Let us hope that we can get

DSTA unionised as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, unions representing statutory board

employees  have to be house unions.  I understand that  among

the civilian staff, there are about 40 who are members of the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) before they were

posted to MINDEF.  They have been allowed to keep their union

membership.  Now they have to trade their AUPE membership for

that  of  a  house  union.  I am sure AUPE will  accept  this

"loss" as it will be a "gain" to the new union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forming house unions, the NTUC has its own set of

criteria.   First, there should be a sufficiently large  base

of  a  house  union to be viable.  Second,  there  should  be

effective leaders.  And, thirdly, labour-management relations

must  be  good.   In  the case of DSTA, the  first  criterion

should  be  met if they are able to persuade the majority  of

employees to be union members.  We are confident that  DSTA's

staff would throw up effective trade union leaders, who  will

be  a credit not only to their members but also to the labour

movement as a whole.  As for labour-management relations,  we

take MINDEF's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>

word  that  DSTA's  management would  work  with  the  labour

movement for the benefit of the workers and the DSTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill before the House notwithstanding

the no-strike provision.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for

their comments and their perceptive suggestions regarding the

DSTA Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off with comments regarding clause 11(4),

the  no-strike clause, which has been commented on by Dr  Ong

Chit  Chung,  Mr Ravindran, Mr Thomas Thomas  and  Mr  Hawazi

Daipi,  and also the DSTA and the unions.  Let me  first  say

that  DSTA's staff will be allowed to join unions.   However,

our  national  defence  is  of paramount  importance  to  the

survival  and  prosperity of our nation and,  in  this  area,

there  cannot  be any compromise.  In times of  tension,  the

DSTA,  being  the  agency in charge of  logistics,  equipment

acquisition  and  technical improvisation  functions,  is  an

integral  part  of  MINDEF  and  the  SAF.   Currently,  such

functions  are undertaken by non-uniformed personnel  in  the

defence  technology group in MINDEF who are not permitted  to

join  unions.  The move to legislate such personnel  over  to

DSTA  is to allow for organisational flexibility to cope with

fast  paced  technological advances in the field  of  defence

science.  The jobs these staff perform and the criticality of

these   functions  have  not  changed.   The  DSTA  and   the

effectiveness of our national defence cannot be subjected  to

compromise  by industrial action, particularly  in  times  of

tension and war and, for these reasons, the no-strike  clause

11(4) is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF, in drawing up this clause, also looked to

see  whether  we  could achieve the same effect  under  other

legislation,   eg,  the  Emergency  Essential   Powers   Act.

However,  the  Emergency  Essential Powers  Act  only  covers

specific groups of persons, and the DSTA staff would have  to

be included in the subsidiary legislation of this Act through

a  presidential  proclamation.   We  have  some  concerns  in

regulating DSTA's staff

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

through   this   particular  Act.    First,   the   essential

regulations  are  intended  for  use  only  during   national

emergencies.   It  may  alarm  the  public  and  bring  about

undesirable   attention  to  the  fact  that   Singapore   is

technically  in  a  state of emergency  and  that  the  other

articles of subsidiary legislation could be brought  to  bear

at any time.  Second, the existing essential regulations were

passed  between  October 1964 and July 1996, and  would  seem

extremely odd after a lapse of some 23 years to pass  another

set  of  essential  regulations, arousing undesirable  public

attention  and scrutiny of the regulations.  Also, passing  a

set  of essential regulations now might send the wrong signal

to  external  parties  and create unnecessary  political  and

diplomatic difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions currently in the Enlistment Act

providing  for exigencies of service have served MINDEF  well

over   the  years  in  ensuring  that  our  national  defence

readiness is not compromised.  It will be prudent to continue

this   practice  through  the  inclusion  of  an   equivalent

provision in the DSTA Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to the other clause which has also been

commented by many Members including Dr Ong, Mr Ravindran,  Mr

Gerard Ee and Mr Simon Tay and this is why the DSTA will  not

have  to  submit  its  annual report to Parliament.   By  its

nature,  the business of defence has to be conducted under  a

cloak  of secrecy.  This includes the work that DTG is  doing

now.   The  change to a statutory board does not  remove  the

requirement for secrecy, and secrecy has to be maintained for

many  of the details of the activities and finances of  DSTA.

In  the  Bill, to provide an external check, the DSTA  annual

report  will  be  submitted to a committee appointed  by  the

Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the other points which have been

raised  by the other Members of Parliament.  One is on clause

11(2)  which is to require employees to work, a point  raised

by Mr Ravindran, Mr Thomas and Mr Simon Tay.  MINDEF and DSTA

know that the last thing we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>

want is to compel an unwilling employee to work because if an

employee does not want to work, then obviously  you  are  not

likely to get much useful service out of him.  But in certain

circumstances,  for  the  purposes  of  DSTA,  where  it   is

essential  and  necessary for DSTA to require the  person  to

work, we  must have that provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked about the Lands and Estates

Organisation and why it comes under the DSTA.  The  ambit  of

the  DSTA is a very large one.  It includes not only  science

and  technology but also providing logistics support  to  the

SAF, and the Lands and Estates Organisation is required to be

included in the DSTA for such purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the procurement powers of DSTA, a point

raised  by  Mr   Simon  Tay,  we will  make  sure  that  DSTA

exercises  its powers well and gets the best value for  money

spent  in  our  defence effort.  I would like to  assure  the

House that even with the setting up of DSTA, we will continue

to  abide  by the present guidelines we have for our  defence

expenditure, and that is not to exceed 6% of our GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some MPs also raised a point about secrecy and

whether  it  is necessary to have another body  in  order  to

restrain  the powers of the Minister for Defence with  regard

to  matters regarding DSTA.  Sir, many matters of defence, by

their  nature cannot be revealed publicly, and in such  areas

it is not possible to have another external body to supervise

such matters in the DSTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have dealt with all the matters brought

up  by  the  Members of Parliament.  I just want  to  end  by

reassuring  the  Members, particularly Mr Hawazi  Daipi,  who

speaks  on  behalf  of the trade unions,  that  we  are  very

conscious about the need to look after the interests  of  the

workers  in  DSTA.  I am confident that the  DSTA  management

will take this heavy responsibility with its full import  and

discharge it fully.  If they do not, Members can be sure that

the Ministry of Defence will compel them to do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point I missed is the suggestion by Mr Simon

Tay  with regard to the formation of a board of directors and

that we should look for a wider representation.  I think that

is a good suggestion and we will take that into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.33 pm

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br><i>Rationale for Third University</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early 1980s, the Government has been expanding

capacity  at the universities to meet the increased need  for

highly   trained  manpower  in  the  economy  and   to   meet

Singaporeans' aspirations for more opportunities  for  higher

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two state universities, the National University of

Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University,  together

admitted  8,600  local students in the  academic  year  1999,

including   some   900  local  polytechnic  graduates.   This

represented a 231% increase from the 2,600 students  admitted

in  1980.  University participation rate has risen from 5% of

the cohort in 1980 to 21% of the cohort in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore competes in the first league of world

economies,  we need a population that is skilled,  innovative

and entrepreneurial.  The Government has therefore decided to

further expand university educational opportunities. The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>

cohort participation rate will increase from the current  21%

to  25%  when the three universities have eventually  reached

their capacities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of expanding NUS and NTU, which are already the

size  of  large state universities in the United  States,  we

decided  to  start a new university specialising in  business

and  related disciplines.  The intention is for NUS, NTU  and

SMU  to  develop their own unique characteristics and niches.

NUS  will  continue to develop as a comprehensive university;

NTU  will  have  a distinctive engineering, professional  and

business bent; and SMU will focus on serving the business and

services  sectors  of the economy.  This model  provides  for

competition  and  yet  avoids  wasteful  duplication.    Each

university  has  enough  room to develop  its  own  areas  of

excellence, and enough competition to spur it on  to  greater

heights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a new university also gives us the opportunity

to make a fresh start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Management University has been conceived

to be innovative and pioneering.



<br><br><i>Approach of the SMU Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide SMU with the flexibility and autonomy to

innovate  and break new ground, SMU will be structured  in  a

different  way  from  NUS and NTU.  While  NUS  and  NTU  are

statutory  boards each governed by an Act of Parliament,  SMU

will be structured as a private company limited by guarantee.

There  will  be a two-tier approach.  SMU's daily  operations

are  governed  by the Memorandum and Articles of  Association

(M&A)  of the company which was incorporated on 12th  January

this  year.    The  company called The  Singapore  Management

University is also subject to the provisions of the Companies

Act.  This gives SMU as much operational autonomy as possible

to innovate and to pursue excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the higher level, SMU's activities will be governed

by  the  SMU  Bill. This is necessary because  of  the  wider

national

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>

role  played  by SMU as an institution of higher learning  in

Singapore,  and  the  fact that SMU will receive  significant

public  funding.   The  SMU Bill will therefore  provide  the

necessary  mechanisms  for  the  Government  to  guide  SMU's

strategic  development in the public interest, and  safeguard

the use of public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this two-tier approach and the desire to give

SMU  maximum  flexibility, the SMU Bill is a  minimalist  and

relatively short Bill.



<br><br><i>The SMU Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMU Bill aims to serve four key functions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it gives SMU the right to confer and award

degrees,   diplomas  and  certificates,  including   honorary

degrees and other distinctions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill allows for Government funding to be

provided  to the institution. This will help ensure that  SMU

develops successfully, especially in the start-up phase,  and

signals to the public governmental support for SMU;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it permits the Government, when necessary, to

influence the strategic development of SMU; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Bill permits the Government to monitor the

use of public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me to highlight the key clauses in the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 sets out the function of the university

company,  which  includes  the  conferring  and  awarding  of

degrees, diplomas and certificates;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes provision for Parliament to provide

funding for the university.  Clauses 3 and 6 therefore signal

the Government's support for SMU;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 5 and 7 provide safeguards in the public

interest. These clauses grant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister for Education the power to appoint  and  remove

Trustees and to give his consent for:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The admission of members of the company;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The disposal of the University's undertaking or

property;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The voluntary winding-up of the University; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any alterations of the University's constituent

documents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 clarifies that the Societies Act applies to any

student body in SMU unless otherwise exempted by the Minister

responsible for societies.



<br><br><i>Development of SMU</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to reflect the country's endorsement

and  support  of  this major undertaking,  I  am  pleased  to

announce that the President of the Republic of Singapore  has

agreed  to be SMU's Patron.  The Patron of SMU will encourage

and support SMU in the fulfilment of its mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to inform the House that Mr Lim Kim

San has agreed to accept the appointment of the Chancellor of

SMU.   Mr  Lim,  who has distinguished himself as  a  Cabinet

Minister and in the private sector, is eminently suited to be

the  Chancellor of SMU, especially since SMU seeks  to  be  a

premier institution of higher learning dedicated to the  high

ideals of scholarship, research and entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU has been making good progress in its development. It

has   established  strong  links  with  the   University   of

Pennsylvania's Wharton School - the top business  school  for

undergraduate   programmes  and the  MBA   programme  in  the

United  States.   Professor Janice Bellace,  formerly  Deputy

Dean  of the Wharton School, has been appointed the President

of  SMU.   In  addition, the Wharton-SMU Research Centre  has

been established to advance research relating to business and

management in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, SMU will be admitting its first intake

of  300  students  into its Bachelor of  Business  Management

course.  I am heartened to note that there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>

were  more than 1,000 applications for about 100 places  when

SMU opened the course for early admission this year.  Some of

the applicants, I am told, are of very high quality and could

have secured places in the best universities anywhere in  the

world.  This augurs well for SMU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelled after the Wharton School's innovative

undergraduate  curriculum, SMU's curriculum  is  broad-based.

In  addition to the core studies, students will  be  able  to

choose from a wide range of subjects such as IT and the  Law,

Political Science, Music and Interpersonal Dynamics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer run, SMU may expand its course offerings

to   related  disciplines.   There  will  also  be  a  strong

postgraduate  and research focus in management  and  business

issues related to Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU will be located temporarily at NIE's Bukit Timah

Campus until its city campus at Bras Basah vicinity is  ready

around  2005.  We can then expect SMU to become  an  integral

part of the business and financial community and life of  the

city.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that the Singapore

Management University, as Singapore's new university  founded

at  the  start  of  this new millennium,  will  become  known

throughout  the world for the innovativeness and  quality  of

its  academic programmes, management philosophy, research and

entrepreneurship. The SMU Bill, together with the  university

company's M&A, will provide the necessary framework that will

give  SMU a high degree of autonomy and the required  measure

of  public accountability that will allow it to excel as  the

first major university of the 21st Century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

compared  to the Acts establishing the NUS and the NTU,  this

SMU Bill is a very simple Bill indeed.  As the Minister says,

it is a minimalist Bill.  The two Acts are very comprehensive

covering  many  aspects of the operation of  the  University,

including  addendum schedules listing University Constitution

which specifies exactly how the University is to be governed,

including  the roles and responsibilities of the officers  of

the  University from the Chief Executive Officer all the  way

down to the Bursar.  In contrast, the Bill simply established

a company operating the University.  Although this company is

termed as the university company in the Bill, for all intents

and  purposes, it looks like a regular private  company.   It

feels  like  a  private company, and it is indeed  a  private

company.   Other than a few clauses empowering the Government

to  safeguard  the  assets, the Bill is  silent  on  how  the

University  is  to  be run.  So comparing the  two  tiers  of

statutes, it is indeed a very significant contrast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, the Government has chosen to

grant  SMU  as  much freedom as possible.  In  the  light  of

recent  announcement that the Government is  giving  the  two

established  universities,  the  NUS  and  the  NTU,  greater

latitude when it comes to self-governance, this is indeed the

right approach at this juncture in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have in mind is this. Since this is a

better way to run university, should the Government not  also

consider repealing the current statutes governing NUS and NTU

and  re-enact  similar Bills for these  two  universities  as

well,   if  not  now  but  maybe  sometime  in  the   future?

Otherwise,  are  there  any  other  reasons  that  those  two

universities need to be better safeguarded?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another impression that is left in the

public  mind  is that the establishment of the SMU  does  not

seem to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>

have  received  a  thorough deliberation   as  it  rightfully

deserves.   From  the  press report, it  seems  that  various

proposals  for  the  SMU were tabled in  the  past  and  were

seriously considered.  For instance, it was reported  earlier

that  the  NUS  Business School would henceforth  concentrate

only on the graduate programme as the undergraduate programme

would be transferred to SMU.  Obviously, that is not the case

now.   And I believe my colleague, the hon. Dr Tan Boon  Wan,

who  is  most familiar with the circumstances, will elaborate

on  this.  In view of this change at a relatively late stage,

one  gets a sense of see-sawing in decision making.   So  the

question  I  have  is: Is the current arrangement  among  the

three universities truly the best for Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having said that, let me assure the

House  that  I support the establishment of the SMU  at  this

juncture   when   we  are  rethinking  the  whole   education

philosophy and adapting the education scene to the demand  of

the knowledge-based economy.  For a new university, an Act of

Parliament gives it an aura of permanence and stability.   It

gives   the   SMU  a  stamp  of  approval,  ensuring   public

recognition and support.  More importantly, graduates of  the

University  will  be  assured  that  their  degrees  will  be

recognised by the Government and their employability  by  the

civil  service and the statutory boards will be assured.   In

this  aspect,  I  am  indeed very  glad  to  learn  that  our

President has agreed to be appointed to the position  of  the

Patron and Mr Lim Kim San has accepted the appointment of the

Chancellor.  This will indeed give SMU greater status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also disclosed earlier

that  it  will be exploring the use of SAT as a supplementary

measure  for  university admission.  This is  so  because  it

feels that its sole dependence on 'A' level examinations  has

encouraged  certain study habits of our youths and  neglected

creativity and innovativeness which are important in the KBE.

I am glad to note that SMU, with its stronger emphasis on the

American

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

curriculum,  is using SAT in its initial recruitment  of  100

students out of close to 1,000 applicants.  Selection will be

done through personal interviews, review of essays written by

the  applicants as well as the SAT scores.  Judging from  the

press  reports  of the students seeking admission,  they  are

very impressive indeed.  There is even one young lady with  a

SAT score of close to 700 which is very outstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SMU were able to attract the better students, it will

signal  to the other two universities that they too  need  to

enhance  their attractiveness.  It will be no longer business

as  usual as there will be competition for students.   As  we

all  know, a certain measure of competition is healthy in all

fields  of  human  endeavours.   We  can  see  that  in   the

development  of  our  polytechnics.  With  four  polytechnics

competing  to  attract the better students, our  polytechnics

have  become  more  innovative in the  course  offerings  and

indeed  more responsive to the changing time.  I believe  SMU

will have a similar impact on our local universities as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with all the flexibilities of a private

company,  SMU  will have the maximum freedom to  attract  the

best faculty through a better remuneration package.  Already,

it  has attracted several staff from NUS and in response, the

staff  in  NUS  Business  School  have  been  offered  better

compensation.   However, I would like  to  sound  a  note  of

caution here that the universities do not engage in a bidding

war  for staff, especially undergraduate teaching staff.   It

would  seem  to be a zero sum game if most of the  SMU  staff

were recruited from the other Singapore universities and  few

from  overseas.  We should also bear in mind that what  makes

universities excellent and famous has less to do  with  their

undergraduate  programmes and everything  to  do  with  their

research and graduate programmes.  It is a fact that  in  the

American universities, research talent is valued greater than

teaching ability when it comes to the granting of tenures.  I

studied  at  Stanford University in the late  70s.   I  still

recall  many  Stanford University faculty  members  who  were

great teachers, well beloved by students but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

were  denied tenure because their research ability was judged

to  be  below  par even though their teaching abilities  were

outstanding.  It seems to be the culture in NUS and NTU today

as  well.  In this respect, Sir, I am heartened to learn that

SMU has already acquired close to $22 million in its research

fund and is collaborating with the Wharton Business School to

establish the Wharton-SMU Research Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the current enrolment of 400

students per year, SMU will still have a total population  of

no more than 2,000 students when it is fully established.  By

all measures, it is indeed a small university and will remain

so  unless  it  has ambition to develop into a  comprehensive

university.   The Ministry of Education typically  funds  the

operation  of the universities on a fixed dollar  amount  per

student  per year.  So if you take the total number of  2,000

and multiply it out, it seems to be that the total budget for

SMU   would  be  rather  small  compared  to  the  other  two

universities,   probably  no  bigger  than  the   engineering

faculties of the two universities.  I am concerned that SMU's

small size will pose a hindrance to its attractiveness  as  a

centre of scholarship.  Furthermore, to restrict to the field

of  management would seem to be detrimental to the  emergence

of  a truly great institution as many fields of research  are

multi-discipline in nature.  In my opinion, SMU would have to

grow  beyond the field of business and management studies  to

evolve into a university of high esteem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

establishment  of  SMU.  I wish SMU great  success  and  look

forward to its contributions towards making Singapore a world-class centre of academic excellence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for permitting me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me declare that I teach at the National

University  of  Singapore.  Sir, I support  this  Bill.   Our

future  is  a  world  of information and  knowledge.   To  be

relevant in this new world, our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>

must be even better educated and trained.  The new university

will   provide  more  opportunities,  as  mentioned  by   the

Minister, for our young to be educated.  Many who now have to

go abroad at great expenses to study may no longer need to do

so.   The  new  university  will also  make  the  market  for

academics more vibrant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to raise some issues and

concerns.  In future Singapore, our people have not  only  to

be  just  trained  and  educated, but they  need  to  develop

qualities, values and skills that are now not yet emphasised,

things     like     creativity,     innovativeness,     being

entrepreneurial, being thinking and problem-solving oriented,

a  willingness  to take risks and adapting to lifelong  self-learning.   Our existing education system has strengths  much

admired  by  the  world, but it must change  to  develop  the

future   Singaporeans  we  need.   The  Prime  Minister   has

identified that this is one of the crucial and critical tasks

for  the  nation.  The Ministry of Education has embarked  on

this difficult and crucial task.  Many changes have been made

in  the  education  system  - in the curriculum,  governance,

testing  and  measurement,  teachers'  training,  etc.    The

changes  have  taken place throughout the  education  system,

from  the  pre-primary  level to ITE and  polytechnics.   Our

universities must also  change.  Since the future  represents

a  paradigm shift, significant changes would be needed in our

universities.  Can our universities meet the challenges?  Can

they change?  How should they change?  How can we ensure that

the  needed changes are made?  We know where we want  to  go,

but how to get there is less easy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerns have been expressed regarding the quality

of  degrees  to  be  conferred by the new  university.   This

concern  has arisen especially in the wake of the  discussion

in  the Forum page of the Straits Times on the acceptance  of

the  OUDP  degree by the Ministry of Education for a teaching

career.   Questions  have been asked if  the  Public  Service

Commission  would state openly the acceptance of SMU  degrees

for a civil service career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how you call SMU, that it is a private

institution as opposed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>

NUS  and NTU as State institutions, like the OUDP, the public

sees  the SMU as a Government institution.  If the SMU degree

runs into any problem, the Government will be blamed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new university will raise the competition for

students,  especially for the good ones.   As  GPC  Education

Chairman has stated, ideally the new institution should raise

national academic standards.  Good students would want to  go

to  better  institutions.  But studying is hard  work.   Even

good  students  can  be persuaded by promises  of  a  quality

degree  with less effort.  Eventually, institutions that  use

such  tactics  will be found out, but the damage  would  have

been done and would endure.  This would be compounded by  the

fact  that  talents,  especially for a small  nation,  are  a

scarce  yet  crucial resource.  Furthermore,  our  needs  are

varied   and  wide.   We  must  also  ensure  that   in   the

competition,  we also do not end up producing more  graduates

in  any areas with corresponding scarcity in other areas.  If

the  tertiary education market should develop into  a  highly

competitive one, we must pro-act to minimise this undesirable

fallout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of the university sector has

increased  in  pace.   Explosion  is  perhaps  a   more   apt

description.   Besides  NUS, NTU,  we  now  have  OUDP,  SMU,

INSEAD, Chicago Graduate Business School, John Hopkins,  etc,

and   other  long  distance  learning  outfits.   All   these

institutions would increase the demand for academic manpower.

Do  we  have enough of such manpower to go round?   Will  the

demand  for  such manpower raise the spectre of  job  hopping

whose  attending ills are well known from experience in other

sectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quality of an academic institution depends much

on  its  staff.  In fact, a large proportion of the recurrent

expenditure of a university goes to staff pays.  Human beings

work  best  when they are committed to what they  are  doing.

Since the capability of an academic lies in his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>

brain,  his commitment will reflect the efforts that he  will

put  in to make available the potential of its upstairs  grey

matter.   Therefore, how can we ensure that committed spirits

rather  than  mercenary  bodies roam  the  corridors  of  our

universities,   or   for   that  matter,    our   educational

institutions?    To get the best out from the academic  staff

and researchers, universities should put more efforts in this

area of human resource management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also ensure the proper use of staff. We should

avoid  the  use  of academic staff for administrative  duties

that  are not related to academic matters.  If academic staff

are  so  used,  this is surely a case of misuse  of  manpower

resources  and  funds,  especially  with  regard  to   senior

academic staff.  Academic staff are promoted and rewarded  on

the basis of their teaching and research, as professional and

administrative staff are trained, promoted and rewarded based

on  their  professional and administrative duties.   Each  is

better suited and appropriately equipped for his tasks.   The

use  of academic staff for non-academic related functions not

only misallocates resources but the practice also demoralises

professional   and  administrative  staff   who   see   their

promotional prospects curtailed.  The good ones may choose to

leave.  This will set in a destructive cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, research is all important to top universities in

the  developed  countries.  We would also like  to  emphasise

research  in  our universities, but we must not go  overboard

and  inadvertently run down the importance of teaching.   Our

universities  are  unlike  top  overseas  ones.   With   many

universities in the country, the top ones take  in  only  the

best  and can afford to focus on research.  This is a  luxury

that  our  universities do not have.  For  our  universities,

producing manpower across the board will remain a major role.

We neglect this role to our national and long-term detriment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also moving towards using the market to

price  the  value of academic staff.  This approach  has  its

merits,  but  the question is the extent to which  we  should

allow  the market to dictate prices.  The market is an  ideal

mechanism of a rational

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

and  perfectly competitive environment.  But the  real  world

seldom fits this description. A small market also has its own

constraints.   There  are  academic  disciplines  with   less

apparent  or immediate market value, but the nation may  have

need   of   such  expertise  at  some  later  time,   perhaps

unexpectedly.   How do we ensure that we have such  expertise

at  our  call?   Will we be able to do so by relying  on  the

market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the issues that I have just raised may appear to

contradict.  They  may be so over the long-term,  or  if  the

market is perfect.  But the short-term effects are real,  and

a  market  is seldom perfect. Some issues already exist.   In

any  case,  I  hope  the  concerns can  be  looked  into  and

addressed, or disposed of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an uncertain future which increasingly portends a

paradigm  shift,  we must take risk.  But we  must  also  not

abandon  caution to the wind.  We should calculate our  risk.

Moderation   and   balance  may  still  be  relevant   words,

especially in the midst of euphoria and earnesty.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the advent of the

Singapore  Management University augurs well  for  university

education  in Singapore.  It adds an additional dimension  to

the  landscape  of  management  training  and  education   in

Singapore.   As the Minister has said, it expands  university

opportunities  and no doubt the collaboration  with  renowned

institutions  from abroad will act as an additional  spur  to

domestic  competition in the area and  that  should  lead  to

higher  quality  all round.  Sir, for all these  reasons  and

many others, the Bill is worthy of this House's support and I

fully endorse it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Explanatory Statement that accompanies this

Bill  asserts that the main object of the SMU is  to  provide

undergraduate business education in Singapore and it is  with

regard to this objective that I have certain issues of public

policy to raise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental question that I have is whether we

indeed might be over-providing or over-allocating public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>

resources  in  the  provision of business  education  at  the

undergraduate  level.  It is a point that  my  colleague,  Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen,  has  also  alluded  to,  but  allow  me  to

elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SMU would be the third institution with public

funding  to provide such undergraduate business education  in

Singapore.  NUS has traditionally done so and NTU is  already

doing  so.   This,  in  addition to the plethora  of  private

outfits  that provide the same courses of a range in quality,

also  in  collaboration with overseas  universities,  and  in

addition, Singapore students are known to go abroad  to  take

up  post-graduate management courses.  So,  one  could  infer

that  both in absolute and, most probably, in relative terms,

the  number  of places available for university education  in

management has increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant concern that I have is that pertaining to

the  allocation of scarce talent, a perennial  question  that

this  House and, in general, Singapore policymakers  address.

If   we  have  three  credible  institutions  with  resources

competing  aggressively,  then  it  is  undeniable  that  the

quality  of  the faculty and the quality of the courses  must

rise  and with it, their ability to attract talented students

to  their courses. So, will we end up with a disproportionate

number  of young, talented Singapore students being drawn  to

undergraduate management degree programmes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in principle no problem with a management

degree but I have always felt, and I believe that many others

in  this  House  would  agree, that a  management  degree  is

perhaps  best  applied  when it is accompanied  with  another

degree   or   some  other  foundation  in  a  core   science,

engineering  or other content-based subject.   Especially  in

this era where we emphasise a knowledge-based economy and the

need  to  acquire core knowledge in areas that would generate

creativity and innovation in the future, would our  resources

be  better  applied  to  create additional  opportunities  in

engineering, in the sciences and in other basic core  content

subject areas and allowing more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>

private sector provision of management courses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these issues, I have a few questions to

raise.  The  first, as I have already alluded to, is  whether

there  is a plan for the Ministry to scale back the provision

of undergraduate business programmes, if not in SMU, since it

is  a  new  institution  with  this  stated  objective,  then

certainly the so-called state universities, NTU and NUS.   As

was  mentioned earlier in this debate, at one  point  in  the

deliberations leading to the establishment of the SMU, it was

suggested  that in fact undergraduate business education  may

be discontinued in some of the state institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if indeed that is not the case, then is there

going  to  be  a  policy  to help NUS and  NTU  differentiate

themselves  from  SMU?  One thought that  comes  to  mind  is

whether  NUS and NTU could provide business degree programmes

in conjunction with a content-based programme leading to twin

degrees, in other words, a business degree would not stand on

its  own  but  together with a content  degree,  such  as  in

engineering  or  in science, and bio-chemistry.   This  would

naturally    contribute    to   creating    the    kind    of

technopreneurship  that  we  are  talking  about  and   these

individuals  would  have  both  core  skills  that  we   deem

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, if that is not the case, could greater emphasis

instead  be  placed  on  post-graduate  management  training,

particularly   in  our  state  universities,   allowing   for

undergraduate training where it occurs to be largely taken up

at the SMU level?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, this is a point that my colleague, Dr Wang, has

raised and I would like to reinforce.  If we believe that the

private  company model might better serve the development  of

university institutions like SMU, then perhaps we  should  go

further  down  that  path with other  business  faculties  in

Singapore.  If we take the analogy of the United States,  the

business course is probably one of the few courses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>

where you can put almost at the start of the course the value

you  would  accrue  as  a student or as  a  graduate  of  the

programme.   It  is  one  of the most likely  courses  to  be

provided  on  a private basis because students can  do  their

numbers at the outset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on from these general public policy

questions, I have some specific questions pertaining  to  the

funding  for the SMU which is mentioned in clause 6  of  this

Bill.   I welcome the Minister's statement that SMU would  be

given  considerable  autonomy and  flexibility  in  order  to

provide management training and education creatively.  But it

still  begs the question of accountability, given that public

funds  would  be deployed.  And the questions I have  on  the

funding  principles are, first, I presume the funding formula

would  be  pegged to that used for the Business Faculties  of

NUS  or NTU in order to ensure some degree of a level playing

field.   Second, as I listened to my colleague, Dr  Tan  talk

about the competition for talent to teach management courses,

my immediate concern is one of an inflationary spiral. We are

privatising the wage rates for those faculty staff  for  whom

there is a reasonably comparable market equivalent and if  we

also  add  on  to that the notion that there is going  to  be

competition across institutions for limited talent, then some

degree  of  wage increases is inevitable.  The question  then

is:  would funding to SMU be somehow capped, or would it rise

in  tandem  with  any  projected wage increase  that  we  can

anticipate or not anticipate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question I have is whether, in the spirit of

keeping   SMU   a   private  institution  with   considerable

flexibility  and autonomy, there is a timeframe  after  which

such  funding from the public sector would be phased  out  so

that the institution can indeed function, as it should, as an

independent,  autonomous and flexible  institution  providing

quality management education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, like many of the colleagues who had spoken before me,

believe that the SMU can and will have a place in Singapore's

education  landscape.   Before  I  proceed  further,  let  me

declare  that I am an employee of the National University  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, much has been made of the idea that the SMU

is  to  be  a private university, different from the National

University   of   Singapore  and  the  Nanyang  Technological

University.  Much has also been talked about the fact that it

is  a  public company limited by guarantee.  Let  me  briefly

explain this concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike its name, public company, whenever you mention

that  idea,  it immediately invokes the idea  that  it  is  a

listed company for private gain. A public company limited  by

guarantee is quite different.  It is for public purpose,  but

in  some  ways, it is not part of the Government  and  it  is

ruled  by  the Companies Act.  And in this form of structure,

there  are  founder members who give a nominal guarantee  for

the  financial  credibility  of the  company.  This  form  of

incorporation has been used for several institutions such  as

the   Institute  of  Policy  Studies  (IPS),  the   Singapore

International Foundation (SIF) and a number of other entities

which  are  clear public in character, but for some  reasons,

wish to have much more flexibility and freedom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important in thinking about how the light

management of the SMU can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

done.  I take the Minister seriously when he talks about this

need  for a lighter touch.  There is a need therefore  for  a

balance  between  the autonomy of this  body,  which  by  its

constitution  is  governed  by a Committee  and  the  founder

members  and  the accountability that might come  to  anybody

that  receives public money. With those thoughts, may I  turn

to the particular clauses of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern is clause 4. Here, the Minister has

powers  to appoint the entire Board. To me, this is  quite  a

sweeping  power  if  we are trying to  keep  this  a  private

university, in the sense of understanding it to be driven not

only by the Government but by its founder members and by  the

community  as  a whole.  And here, I think the  role  of  the

Minister  would then obviate the role of the founder  members

of this institution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when I turn to clause 5(1)(d), I am also

concerned.  Here, the Ministry must approve of any change  to

a  constituent  document of the SMU.  For the earlier  parts,

(a),  (b),  (c),   I am quite agreeable.  If the  company  is

wound up, or if the company has disposed of its properties or

other  major assets, I think the Government, having given  it

its  land and money, needs to know this.  But I think  it  is

too  wide  indeed  to  require that any change  receives  the

Minister's approval.  It makes it just like a statutory body.

It  makes it just like amending the statute of the NUS or NTU

and  I think this moves away from the idea of a lighter touch

that we seem to be looking for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is clause 8 and this comes to the

activities  of  the  student  bodies.  And  here  again,  the

activities  of the student bodies in the SMU are  subject  to

the Societies Act and the Societies Act would allow the right

to   refuse  certain  applications  and  the  right  to  view

accounts,  etc. Why is this needed if we want  to  give  this

body a greater autonomy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned that a former Minister, Mr

Lim  Kim  San, has accepted the appointment of Chancellor  of

the new SMU.  I welcome this move.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Lim has enjoyed a tremendous reputation in Singapore, not

only in the public sector but also in the governance of large

public  companies.  However, I would like to remind us  again

that  this is going to be a private university, and if it  is

truly  to  be private, I hope the Minister will clarify  that

the  role  of  the Chancellor is clearly non-executive.   The

running of the SMU must be with its professional staff,  such

as  the President and those under the Provost.  I am reminded

of  this  particularly because when the NUS started  and,  of

course, the NUS is a state university, the then Minister  and

now  Deputy  Prime  Minister Tony  Tan  was  the  first  Vice

Chancellor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my last point, Mr Speaker, and this is

in  regard  to  the funding of the SMU.  I take it  seriously

that the SMU is to be a private institution. And as a private

institution focusing on business, it should be able, after  a

while, if it has enough reputation, to become privatised  and

more  or  less  self-sufficient in terms of its  funding.   I

would  like to ask the Minister whether there are plans  over

time  to reduce the amount of funding given to SMU and,  with

that,  to  reduce  the amount of Government supervision  over

this new entity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am glad that a third

university  in  Singapore has finally come to  fruition.   In

1984,  the Opposition called for the setting up of  a  second

university.   When the Nanyang Technological  University  was

formed,  it  called  on  the  Government  to  start  a  third

university.  Now the third university is established,  albeit

a  rather  specialist  one, confining itself  mainly  to  the

teaching  of  only  disciplines confined to  the  subject  of

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is supposed to embark on a knowledge

based economy.  Yet, the number of universities that we  have

compared  to Australia or New Zealand is very low.  In  those

countries,  they  have  one  university  for  about   500,000

population.    By  the  standard  of  those  two   countries,

Singapore  should  have about six universities  now  and  not

three, since our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>

population  is  about  three  million.   I  wonder   if   the

Government is thinking of setting up more universities in the

near  future.   I  think  it  should  as  Singapore  is  also

embarking  on  the policies of globalisation  and  attracting

foreign talents.  The globalisation policy will require  more

qualified  Singaporeans  to  travel  abroad  and  thus   more

university  graduates.  We should have  enough  graduates  to

buffer the impact of foreign talent or otherwise we shall  be

swamped by foreign talents coming to work here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of foreign students, I understand that

at  present,  the  Government's policy is rather  liberal  on

foreign  students.  I think this is a good policy.   We  must

not shut out foreign students who qualify to be admitted into

our  universities.   There are merits  to  encourage  foreign

students  to  study in Singapore.  Having said that,  at  the

same  time,  we  must  not deprive our  local  students  from

obtaining a tertiary education by making the entry point  too

difficult  for them, or run short of places due to taking  in

too many foreign students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, studying abroad is not cheap. It costs quite

a  lot  of  money  for a parent to send a child  overseas  to

study.   Not  all  Singaporeans are that wealthy.   A  middle

class family may be able to send one child overseas to  do  a

university  degree,  but to send two for the  average  middle

class  family is not possible.  Therefore, provision to  make

enough  university  places  for  locals  to  study  is   most

essential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I saw a TV programme about a 50-year old

Australian lady who is allowed to study in the NTU.  I should

say  that we should also not put an age limit on Singaporeans

who  wish to pursue a university degree in our local tertiary

institutions, even if they have passed the normal  university

entry  age.  We should not shut out mature students who  have

missed the boat in the first instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is we should ask ourselves what type of

universities  we like to establish in Singapore.   I  do  not

think we should establish another strictly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>

controlled  university, one where the  majority  of  students

dare not think independently.  They are mostly to become  yes

men,  and  also they dare not dissent or join the opposition,

although   the   opposition   operates   strictly   by    the

Constitution.  I do not think that we should set  up  another

strictly  controlled university, but a university  that  will

produce  students who dare to think differently and  who  are

dynamic   and   who   have  leadership  and   entrepreneurial

qualities.   I  am afraid the SMU shall not be one  of  those

types of universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that under this Bill, when it becomes law, it

shall  make  the SMU totally controlled by the Minister.   We

see that the Board of Governors shall be all appointed by the

Minister.   If  that is the case, the Minister  surely  shall

appoint  like-minded  people to the  Board,  and  like-minded

people  cannot promulgate new and daring ideas.  There  shall

only   be  inbreeding  of  ideas  and  there  is  no   cross-fertilisation  of fresh new ideas.  I urge  the  Minister  to

allow different sectors of the business community, the labour

movement   and  other  academic  professionals   to   appoint

independent trustees to the Board, so that daring  new  ideas

can  be  introduced into the SMU to make it produce  students

who  are not only technically competent but who are bold  and

daring  to  introduce new ideas and make  Singapore  a  truly

dynamic place to do business in.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be permitted

to  seek a clarification from Mr Chiam?  He mentioned in  his

speech  that in Australia, there is one university for  every

500,000 population.  That means if you look at the population

of  Australia which is close to 17-18 million, he is  talking

about a total number of 300 universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 34 universities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> 34 universities. Sir, I withdraw my

question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My mathematics is not that bad.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members have

observed, the Bill is, in fact, a minimalist one and it  does

not  contain  a lot in it.  Dr Wang has asked where  are  the

provisions   governing  the  operation  of  the   SMU.    The

provisions governing the operations of the SMU are, in  fact,

contained  in  the Memorandum and Articles of Association  of

the  company.   In  fact,  the  Memorandum  and  Articles  of

Association  contain  how  the company  should  be  run,  the

responsibilities  and  the roles of the  Chancellor  and  the

other  principal  officers of the university,  including  the

President,  the  Provost, Secretary,  the  functions  of  the

faculty and the departments and so on.  So the Memorandum and

Articles  of  Association,  in  effect,  functions   like   a

constitution of the NUS and the NTU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are starting up a new university, we decided to

adopt  this  new  model  so that we can  leave  many  of  the

detailed  issues in the governance of the university  to  the

company rather than to incorporate them into the Act and have

to  come to Parliament if the company does want to change any

of the ways in which it wants to govern itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is currently having a look at

university grants and funding and governance with a  view  to

granting   more   autonomy   but,   of   course,   with   the

accountability.   The  university's  governance  and  funding

committee  will  be ready to report its findings  later  this

year.   And  the experiences that we have from the management

of  SMU  and also the experiences that we will have from  the

management  of  NUS  and  NTU under  any  new  structures  or

governance  methods that we have will, of course, be  applied

to improve the governance of all three of our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has also asked why we have set up the SMU in

this  way  and  whether or not this is optimal  or  the  best

solution  for  the university sector in Singapore.   We  have

talked about this for quite some time and decided that if  we

set  up three universities which were basically identical and

comprehensive, then they would compete with each other to the

detriment of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>

university sector in Singapore.   Because all of them will be

trying too hard to be like each other, and some would win and

some would lose and that may not be the best positioning  for

the  small  number of universities that we have in Singapore.

Hence,  we  decided  that  it may  be  a  better  competitive

environment  for the universities if each one  could  develop

its  own  characteristics and niche areas of excellence,  but

with some overlap in the courses and programmes which each of

the universities offers, so that there will be a good balance

between  competition as well as allowing each  university  to

develop  an  area of specialisation and something which  they

become known for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had initially intended to start SMU out of the NTU

Business  School, as a seed for which to grow the university.

But  as we studied the matter further and as we were able  to

consider very close association with Wharton School, we  felt

that  we  would have the confidence to be able to  start  SMU

afresh, on its own, and this would allow us to introduce many

more  new innovations and ideas than if we were to start  SMU

out  of part of one of the existing universities.  And so  we

chose to go in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will SMU be too small? This is one of the questions

that  Dr  Wang asked.  We are starting SMU at a  modest  size

with about 300 students in its first year, because we want to

ensure that the intake quality is good so that SMU will start

on  a  good  solid footing.  That also means that we  can  be

quite selective about the staff that are recruited into  SMU.

That  again will assure high quality of SMU.  But  we  expect

that  SMU  will  grow over 5-7 years, perhaps to  3,000-4,000

students, and together with its executive programmes and  its

graduate  programmes, that would be quite a nice size  for  a

university  already.  In fact, NTU and NUS  with  16,000  and

over  20,000 students respectively are already quite  a  very

large  size and can be quite unwieldy to manage.  So  I  feel

confident  that SMU will be able to develop into a university

with enough critical mass to achieve excellence.  And in  the

course of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>

time,  it  will expand its course offerings into other  areas

related to business and management.  I do not expect that SMU

will  begin  to  offer  courses in heavy  engineering  or  in

esoteric areas in science and so forth, because that  is  not

an  area  in  which  we foresee SMU developing  its  area  of

expertise.  Hence, the name Singapore Management University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang and Dr Tan Boon Wan have also asked about

standards  of  the university and the degrees.   One  of  the

things  that is happening in Singapore today in which Members

of this House and members of the public have to understand is

that there is a variety of programmes in Singapore offering a

variety  of qualifications.  We have NUS, NTU, SMU, OUDP  and

many  other institutions offering twinning degrees of various

kinds.    As   the   variety  and  number  of  qualifications

increases,  we must understand that employers will eventually

be   the  final  arbiter  of  whom  they  consider  as   most

appropriate for the job that they are looking for a person to

fill.  This eventually will have to be the situation.  It  is

not  possible for the Ministry of Education to become a giant

accrediting   agency  that  accredits  all   the   university

qualifications in the world.  We already have enough  trouble

trying  to  maintain standards in our own  universities.   It

would not be possible for us to try to check on the standards

of  universities all across the world over which we  have  no

control.   Hence,  it is really a matter for  the  individual

employers  to  decide what students and what  graduates  they

would  find most appropriate for the kinds of jobs that  they

have.  That applies to the Government as an employer as  well

because  Government has a range of jobs  open  and  what  one

statutory  board may look for in an employee may be different

from  what  another Government department or  another  agency

does.   These are things which are best left to employers  to

decide  and  to  settle.  Students also have  to  decide  for

themselves whether to take up particular courses, whether  it

suits their needs or their career aspirations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr Iswaran have asked about

competition for students and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>

whether there is over provision of places for management  and

business students. The overall allocation of places which are

subsidised  and  funded by the Government is settled  at  the

National  Manpower  Committee chaired by my   colleague,  the

Minister for Manpower, and in which the Ministry of Trade and

Industry, the Ministry of Education, EDB and other interested

parties  are present. We try to estimate as best we  can  the

types  of  manpower that we need in the future, and  we  will

fund  places in the institutions of higher learning to  train

such  manpower.  So there should be no danger  of  us  willy-nilly increasing the training of business students way beyond

what  we expect the economy to be able to absorb or what  the

economy  needs.  As a matter of fact, both NTU and  NUS  have

reduced  their undergraduate intake and when SMU  begins  its

first  intake this year, we expect that we will  continue  to

adjust  the intakes of these three universities so  that  the

numbers  of  business students who will receive funding  from

the  Government in the form of subsidies to the  institutions

of  higher  learning  will be within reason  and  within  the

bounds of what we expect the economy will absorb.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan also asks about competition for

professors.   If  the  economy  has  a  demand  or  need  for

graduates of this type, we will have to try to train them  to

fulfil  this need.  If necessary, we will recruit  professors

worldwide, not just from Singapore, who can augment  whatever

teaching  and  professorial resources we have  in  Singapore.

This  has  always  been the approach in our  institutions  of

higher learning.  I do agree with Dr Tan Boon Wan that  there

needs  to be a good balance between teaching and research  in

our  universities so that one does not suffer because we have

over emphasised the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move to funding. Mr Iswaran asks about funding

for the SMU.  Yes, Government will fund capital and recurrent

expenditure  of the SMU, including its start-up  costs.   Our

intention  is  to  fund it basically on  the  same  basis  as

similar courses in NUS and NTU will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

funded.   Is there a time frame to phase out public  funding?

We  have not established such a time frame.  We want to  give

the  university a good start up so that it will  be  able  to

offer  courses of high quality.  Of course,  we will be  very

happy  if  the university proves that it can raise a  lot  of

funding  and I will be more than happy to reduce the  funding

to the university if it is able to fend for itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan raised a number of issues with regard to

personnel  deployment  and management, professorial  salaries

and  so  forth.   These are matters which I  will  leave  for

another  time to answer when we have finished our studies  on

university governance and funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asks why clauses 4 and 5(1)(d) are needed.

Basically, it is because we provide substantial public  funds

to  the  SMU  and  we  have provided land and  buildings  and

recurrent funding to the university for a public purpose.  If

I were not able to influence the direction of the university,

and  I am providing funds to them, one of these days Mr Simon

Tay  may  well call me to account and ask me why I  have  not

been   running  the  university  properly  and  why  is   the

university wasting money and so forth.   So the Minister  for

Education has a responsibility to make sure that while public

funds  are being provided to the university, persons of  good

reputation who are able to run the university well are put in

charge  of  the  university  and  that  the  funds  that  the

university is given are well expended for the purposes  which

we have set out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about clause 8. Why is it necessary

to  have this clause for the student bodies.  This clause  is

also contained in the NUS Act and the NTU Act and the purpose

of  this  clause  is  to ensure that all student  bodies  are

registered with the Registrar of Societies who is granted the

power  to  refuse to register societies if the rules  of  the

society are insufficient to provide for its proper management

and  control,  or if the society is likely  to  be  used  for

unlawful  purposes  or it will be contrary  to  the  national

interest  for the society to be registered.  So this  is  not

something

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

different  from NUS or NTU.  We basically want to  make  sure

that  the  universities do not have student bodies  that  are

formed  for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare  or

good  order  in Singapore.  But within those parameters,  the

universities, as you know, NUS and NTU, have been  organising

all  kinds of activities.  Mr Chiam, for example, has  spoken

there  a  number  of  times and I am  sure  that  if  he  has

something  new and interesting to say, the students  will  be

happy to invite him back again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also raised a number of issues. If only

starting  a university were as easy as calling for it  to  be

started, but it is not easy to start a university and we have

had  to think very, very carefully about starting up SMU  and

how  to start it, because a university lives and dies by  its

quality and its standard.  You can start a university but  if

it  does  not have the quality and standard, then it  is  not

worth starting one up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also makes a mistake in comparing the number of

universities  to  population, as  though  that  is  the  most

important thing.  The most important thing to compare is what

is  the  cohort participation rate for higher education,  and

not  the  number  of  universities.  What percentage  of  the

cohort  is able to attend higher education. That is  the  key

number.   In  Singapore,  we have 20% going  to  universities

today.  When SMU has reached full capacity, we expect that to

be 25%. We also have 40% going to our polytechnics, adding up

to  some  60% to 65% of a cohort going for higher  education.

This is one of the highest percentages in the world.  In  the

United  Kingdom,  they  converted all their  polytechnics  to

universities and they have attained 35% of a cohort going  to

university.   We  have  kept our university  and  polytechnic

sector  separate  and we are attaining  60%  to  65%  already

today.  In Hong Kong ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have a

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are you giving way, RAdm Teo?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We have kept our cohort going to

university at 20%.  Can the Minister say that, in fact, there

are  more  than  20% who would want to go  to  university  in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, everyone would want to go to

university if he could.  So I can quite safely say that there

are more than 20% who would want to go to university.  It  is

also  very easy for Mr Chiam to say that we should have  more

universities and it is easy for me, at the stroke of  a  pen,

to  allow 100% of a cohort to go to university and issue them

with degrees.  But the question that Mr Chiam needs to answer

is:  what  are  the  degrees worth?   That  is  the  ultimate

question  when  you look at the university  qualification  or

university  degree.  NUS and NTU are held in  high  standing.

Our polytechnics are held in very high standing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have another

clarification from the Minister?  The Minister asks how  much

is a university degree worth.  This question has been debated

many,  many  times.   In other words,  do  you  just  want  a

university  degree?   What  is the purpose  of  a  university

degree?  People say that the university is a training ground,

not just to get a degree.  But the point is the end result of

going  to university is not just getting a university degree.

The  fact that one goes through three years of training,  one

may  do  100,  200, 300 or 400 assignments, essays,  reports,

what  have you.  Just like in the United States, they  reason

that   a  student  going  through  such  training  will  gain

something for life regardless of what sort of degree he  gets

in the end.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I would not like to attend the

university which Mr Chiam starts, Mr Speaker.  But as I  have

explained,  we already have 60% to 65% of a cohort  going  to

higher  education.   Our  polytechnics  are  extremely   high

quality  institutions.  If you take a comparison  again,  for

example,   Hong  Kong  too  converted  its  polytechnics   to

universities and its participation rate in universities today

is 18%.  We have a very, very high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>

participation  rate in higher education, and by  keeping  our

universities   as  universities,  and  our  polytechnics   as

polytechnics, we have been able to provide education which is

suitable  for the aptitudes of a wide cohort of our  students

while maintaining an extremely high quality in both types  of

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asks about foreign students and he

supported  the  Government's  policy  of  admitting   foreign

students  in our institutions.  I am glad that Mr Chiam  does

support  this.   As I have explained, we have  increased  the

number  of students and the cohort participation rate of  our

local  students  in  higher education consistently  over  the

years.   In 1980, there were only 5% of the cohort  going  to

universities and 8% to polytechnics, ie, 13%.  In  1999,  20%

were   going   to   universities  and  40%  were   going   to

polytechnics.  So there is no shortage of places for students

who  can  qualify for these institutions and who can  benefit

from this education even with the intake of foreign students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asks whether we would allow mature

students  to go to university.  The answer is yes.  We  allow

students to go to university by a number of routes today.  In

fact, out of the 8,600 students who were admitted to NUS  and

NTU  last  year, 900 of them came from the polytechnics.   In

the  new university admission system, we have explicitly laid

down three different routes by which students can qualify  to

go  to  the  universities: (1) from JCs and "A"  levels;  (2)

through  the  polytechnics;  and (3)  from  mature  students,

taking  into account their SAT or reasoning test results  and

their  work experience or whatever other qualifications  they

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the questions

that have been raised by Members.  I would like to thank them

for their interest in the subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> If I may ask the Minister for a

clarification.  The Minister, in reply to me, has pointed out

why   clauses  4  and  5  are  necessary  to  retain   public

accountability.  But the other end of my question

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>

was: how does this allow SMU to indeed be autonomous, have  a

lighter  touch  and  be  a private  university?   How  is  it

different from NUS and NTU?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> It is different from NUS and NTU in

the  sense  that it is operating in a company  framework  and

company environment rather than in the environment of an  Act

of  Parliament.  So they have quite a lot more flexibility to

manage the company in the way that they deem fit, and also it

is  easier to change the M&A of the company.  Even  though  I

have  to  approve,  it is easier to change  the  M&A  of  the

company  than it would be to change the Act where we have  to

come  to  Parliament.   So there will  be  considerably  more

autonomy and freedom of action and flexibility on the part of

the  Board of Trustees of the SMU than there will be for  the

Board of Governors or the Council of NTU and NUS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PRISONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>4.18 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Act was last amended in 1997. Further

amendments  to the Prisons Act are now necessary  to  enhance

the  effectiveness of our Prisons Service and offer our penal

population with more rehabilitation opportunities.



<br><br><i>Community-Based Sentences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first cover the main set of amendments, which

are  related  to the introduction of Tail-End Home  Detention

for penal inmates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, I asked my Minister of State to chair an Inter-Ministry Committee to examine the feasibility of introducing

Community-Based  Sentences into our criminal justice  system.

Among  its  recommendations are the extension of the  use  of

Probation to adult offenders, and the introduction  of  Tail-End  Home Detention, Boot Camp, Community Service Orders  and

Re-integrative Shaming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is mindful that the use of Community-Based

Sentences must neither compromise the objectives of our penal

regime, nor give the victim or the public the impression that

our  system  is  becoming  lenient  towards  perpetrators  of

crimes.   Tough penalties would continue to be meted  out  to

deserving  offenders.  Community-Based Sentences  complement,

not   replace,   the  traditional  forms  of  punishment   of

imprisonment, caning and fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is scope, however, in Singapore's criminal justice

system   for  lighter  sentencing  options  with  a   greater

rehabilitative element for those who commit relatively  minor

offences, and first-time offenders.  This is especially so if

there  are  mitigating circumstances.  That  is  why  we  are

amending  the  Prisons Act to provide for the  Tail-End  Home

Detention Scheme.



<br><br><i>Tail-End Home Detention for Penal Inmates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail-End Home Detention is not new. Home Detention has

been implemented at the tail-end of the detention period  for

drug   inmates  and  Criminal  Law  Detainees  as   well   as

Reformative  trainees  released onto  statutory  supervision.

Countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia  have

successfully  implemented Home Detention.  It  serves  as  an

avenue  for  the earlier release of prisoners  who  are  most

amenable  to  rehabilitation.  Its  implementation  serves  a

number of purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, allowing the offender to be closer to his

family  and the community will help him to better reintegrate

into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>

society after incarceration.  The deterrent element is  still

retained  as offenders will be subjected to restrictions  and

surveillance  via  electronic  tagging.   Secondly,  as  this

scheme allows offenders to remain in the community, it  keeps

the  families  intact and allows offenders  to  be  gainfully

employed.   Reaction  to  our  announcement  of  the  Scheme,

especially  those  from  families  of  offenders,  has   been

positive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill introduces a new Part IVA in the

Prisons  Act  to  provide  for the  Tail-end  Home  Detention

Scheme.   The  Scheme will allow selected  offenders  serving

jail  terms of six months and above to be released  early  on

home  detention  up  to  a  maximum  of  six  months.   These

offenders   must  have  served  at  least   half   of   their

imprisonment term before they become eligible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of eligible inmates will be based on a

stringent  set of criteria.  Only offenders who are  assessed

to  be  least  likely  to  pose a risk  to  society  will  be

considered   for   the   Scheme.   Prisoners   serving   life

imprisonment,  offenders of serious or  violent  crimes,  and

drug and sexual offenders will not be eligible.  Clause 24 of

the Bill provides for a new Schedule which lists the type  of

ineligible  offenders.  In addition, eligible offenders  will

go   through   rigorous  assessments   to   determine   their

suitability   for   emplacement  onto  the   Scheme.    These

assessments   will  be  conducted  by  the  internal   Prison

committees as well as an independent Advisory Committee, made

up  of  distinguished members of the community.  The conduct,

attitude and response to rehabilitation and the risk  factors

of eligible offenders will be scrutinised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Home Detention, offenders will be released on

licence  to  reside at home under strict regulatory  control,

which  includes  mandatory reporting to the  authorities  for

counselling  and stipulated curfew hours of 10 pm  to  7  am,

which  will  be monitored via electronic tagging.   Offenders

are  also  required to be gainfully employed or  involved  in

academic  pursuits.  Those who violate these  conditions  are

liable to be recalled to prison while the breach is being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>

investigated.    Those  found  guilty  of  breach   will   be

adjudicated  and  punished,  and have  their  release  orders

revoked.



<br><br><i>Outsourcing of Prisons Escort Functions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to the proposed outsourcing of

Prisons  escort functions and the consequential extension  of

the necessary powers to commercial security agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, armed prison officers escort and guard

inmates  during trips outside prisons and drug  institutions.

Such outside escort duties include hospital and security ward

duty,  escort  for  court attendance and  inter-institutional

prisoner  transfer.   Outsourcing the escorting  of  low-risk

prisoners  to a commercial security agency will free  trained

prison  officers to take on more sensitive and  higher  value

frontline  operational  duties such  as  the  management  and

rehabilitation  of  inmates.  Prison  officers  will  however

continue  to  escort high-risk prisoners.  Clause  7  of  the

Amendment Bill introduces a new section in the Prisons Act to

empower  the  Director of Prisons to employ auxiliary  police

officers  to serve as escorts and guards while the  prisoners

are transported to, or from, any prison.  It also defines the

powers  given  to  such auxiliary police  officers.   Prisons

Department  will take measures to ensure that  the  auxiliary

police officers meet strict security standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the outsourcing, Prisons will continue to be

accountable for the safe custody of inmates both  within  and

outside prisons and drug institutions.



<br><br><i>Appointment of Committees of Inquiry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Act will also be amended to allow the

Minister for Home Affairs to appoint Committees of Inquiry to

investigate into the death of any prisoner or look  into  any

other  matters pertaining to the administration  of  prisons.

Clause  4  of  the  Bill introduces a  new  section  7  which

empowers  the  Minister  to appoint such  Committees.   Among

other things, these committees will be empowered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>

summon witnesses and to refer witnesses who lie or misconduct

themselves to the magistrates' court for prosecution.



<br><br><i>Use of Weapons Against Persons Facilitating an Escape</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the current Prisons Act empowers our Prison

authorities to use weapons against prisoners who are escaping

or  attempting to escape, it does not cover situations  where

other persons are involved in facilitating an escape.  Clause

6  of  the  Bill  amends the Prisons Act  to  empower  Prison

officers  to use weapons against any prisoner or  person  who

attempts  or facilitates an attempt to escape or attempts  to

damage  or break open the enclosure of a prison or  a  prison

vehicle.



<br><br><i>Removing  Prisons Visit Privileges of Members of  Cabinet  or Parliament</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the proposal to remove the Prisons

visit privileges of Members of Cabinet and Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, besides members of the Cabinet and Members of

Parliament,  the  Prisons Act already empowers  every  Judge,

Magistrate  or Justice of the Peace, to visit any  prison  to

examine  the  conditions  of  the  prison  and  the  inmates.

Visiting  Justices are Justices of the Peace  who  have  been

appointed  for  the  specific  purpose  of  checking  on  the

conditions of a prison and that of the prisoners on a regular

basis.   They  forward  their  observations  to  the  Prisons

Authorities  and  to the Minister.  As distinguished  private

citizens,  they  provide  a valuable  service  in  presenting

reliable  and balanced feedback on the state of our  prisons.

The  Visiting Justices conduct monthly visits to  all  Prison

institutions  to inspect the physical conditions  of  prisons

and  to  hear feedback from prisoners during such  inspection

rounds.  The roles of the Visiting Justices are clearly spelt

out in the Prisons Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there already exists an adequate check by neutral

parties on the Prison authorities, the current provision  for

Members of Parliament and members of the Cabinet is hence not

necessary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>

Malaysia removed its provisions relating to MP's visits  from

their  new  Prisons Act enacted in 1995.  The United  Kingdom

and  Hong  Kong  Prisons laws do not have such  a  provision.

Hence, my Ministry is proposing that the provision be deleted

from  the  Prisons Act.  Clause 22 of the Bill  seeks  to  do

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that prisoners are not left

without any avenues to express any grievances they may  have.

In  addition  to  voicing  their  concerns  to  the  Visiting

Justices, they can also forward any complaints or requests to

the Superintendent of their institution or write directly  to

the  Director  of Prisons.  They are also free to  let  their

family members know of their grievances during prison visits.

Their  family members may then take the matter  up  with  the

Prison authorities, who will investigate into every complaint

received.



<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill also proposes various amendments

that  are essential to facilitate the management of the penal

population  and  to allow the Prisons Department  to  operate

more  effectively.   For example, clause 18(c)  of  the  Bill

regularises  the existing practice that, before the  offender

is  punished  for any major breach of prison discipline,  the

Director  of  Prisons  is required to  confirm  or  vary  the

punishments imposed by the Superintendents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also taking this opportunity to update

the  provisions which have become obsolete and outdated since

its last major review in 1985.  For example, clause 14 of the

Bill  seeks to delete the provisions pertaining to the  terms

of  engagement and discipline of prison officers  which  have

become  irrelevant  as all terms and conditions  are  now  in

accordance  with  those  laid  down  by  the  Public  Service

Division.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Related Amendments to the Intoxicating Substances Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Drug Rehabilitation Centres and the Inhalant

Abuse  Centres are also under the jurisdiction of the  Prison

authority,  some  of the amendments made to the  Prisons  Act

will also be made to the Intoxicating Substances Act and  the

Misuse  of Drugs Act.  Clauses 25 and 26 of the Bill seek  to

make  amendments to the Intoxicating Substances Act  and  the

Misuse of Drugs Act to empower prison officers to use weapons

against inmates and other persons facilitating an escape;  to

appoint  auxiliary  police officers to serve  as  escorts  or

guards  for inmates; and to convene Committees of Inquiry  to

look   into  and  report  on  matters  connected   with   the

administration,  functions,  inmates  of  these  centres  and

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is an important one relating to the running of

prisons  and  the  treatment of  prisoners.   It  deals  with

several  matters, but I wish to focus on two.  One refers  to

the  new Committee of Inquiry to investigate or inquire  into

"any matter connected with the discipline, administration  or

functions  of  any prison or affecting any prisoner  ."   The

other  seeks  to  provide  a system and  procedure  for  home

detention.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the establishment of the "Committee of

Inquiry" and even though a committee is usually understood as

a  group of persons, it is not unheard of to have a committee

of one.  My only query here is: would it not be more sensible

to  have  more than one committee member?  I say this because

such a committee is likely to be appointed only when there is

some serious allegation made concerning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>

the  running of a prison, or the treatment of a prisoner.   A

group  of members, even of two, will add to the transparency,

the credibility and the general quality of the inquiry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point: who would be

appointed  to  such  committees?   Or  more  precisely,  what

qualifications must they have?  The Bill is silent  on  this.

And I hope the Minister can let the House know who are likely

to be appointed to such committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the proceedings of the inquiry are not open to

the  public  unless  the  chairman permits  or  the  Minister

directs.  I take this provision to mean that where a chairman

permits,  such a hearing can be open to the public, but  that

where  a  chairman does not give his permission, the Minister

may  direct him to do so.  Can the Minister confirm that this

is the position?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it is apparent that this committee of inquiry is

intended  to  be a quasi-judicial institution,  that  is,  it

takes evidence on oath, has power to summon witnesses and the

duty  to  keep  records  of  the inquiry.   Prison  officers,

prisoners  and  others may be affected by  such  proceedings.

May  they  employ  counsel?  If not, why  not?   I  refer  in

particular to the proposed section 7J where a prison  officer

who  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  findings  of  the

committee  has  to  be notified, and given a  hearing  during

which  he can give evidence as well as examine any witnesses.

In such a case, counsel may be desirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the record of the committee is confidential and

not to be released without the permission of the Minister.  I

am  uneasy with this, not that I think the Minister will  act

improperly.  There may be situations where he may be left  in

a  difficult position.  For example, a committee finds that a

prison  officer  has  used excessive  force  on  a  prisoner.

Disciplinary  action is taken and he is  dismissed  from  the

service.  He seeks redress for unfair dismissal and of course

the claim will be made against the Ministry.  In such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>

a  situation, where the status and livelihood of a person  is

at  stake,  and where he feels that there was, for  instance,

bias,  should he not be entitled to a copy of the proceedings

that  may assist him in his case?  Will the Minister let  him

have the report, even though the report came from a committee

appointed  by him?  I hope that there could be some procedure

to  ensure  that the committees of inquiry and their  records

are available to interested and affected parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the provisions for Home Detention. Sir, I

am not one to engage in semantics, but I do feel in this case

that  the  use of the phrase, "Home Detention" is  not  quite

appropriate,  given the spirit and intent of the  scheme.   I

understand that this scheme was a recommendation of the Inter-Ministry Committee on Community-Based Sentences, and that its

purpose  is  to  allow  prisoners to re-integrate  back  into

society,  and  to his home environment.  Unless  we  want  to

preserve  an  idea  that Home is Prison or detention  centre,

using  another  term, such as "supervision" might  have  been

more  appropriate.   From the point of  view  of  the  family

members,  it may also be more palatable than to regard  their

home as a place of detention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case "supervision" more correctly describes this

process.   The  supervisee is allowed  to  go  out  and  seek

gainful employment within the period that he is allowed to be

absent from home.  The electronic tagging is really more like

a  supervisory or surveillance process - triggered only if he

absents  himself  from home during the restricted  hours.   I

hope  that  the  Minister will take the first opportunity  to

assure   Members  that  the  intention  of  this  scheme   is

rehabilitative,  and  not  just a measure  to  reduce  prison

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the eligibility of prisoners for the Home

Detention Scheme, the Bill proposes that he has to have  more

than  six  months' imprisonment left, and not be disqualified

from  being considered.  The disqualifications are  contained

in  the  Second Schedule.  The disqualified category includes

offences against the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>

person, especially sexual offences.  Curiously, however,  the

offences  of  extortion, robbery and armed  robbery  are  not

within the disqualified category.  These are serious offences

-  robbery,  for  example, attracts a minimum  of  two  years

imprisonment  and  a maximum of ten and with  caning.   Gang-robbery,  an aggravated form of robbery, is included  in  the

disqualification list.  May I therefore ask the  Minister  to

let this House know why prisoners who are sentenced for armed

robbery,  robbery  or  extortion  are  not  disqualified  and

therefore  technically  eligible for consideration  for  home

detention?   It must be remembered that even in the  case  of

extortion,  the crime involves instilling fear of  injury  or

even death to the victims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill proposes the establishment of an

advisory  committee to advise the Director on the suitability

of  the  prisoner  for release under the scheme.   Could  the

Minister clarify how such a committee would work?  Who  would

be  appointed to this committee?  Will it interview potential

supervisees to assess their suitability for release, or  will

it simply rely on the recommendations of the Director?  Since

it is called an advisory committee, I assume that there is no

substantive power of review, but can it insist that it  would

like  to  interview prisoners applying for the Home Detention

Scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, the Prisons (Amendment) Bill contains

useful institutions and measures that, if implemented wisely,

would undoubtedly improve our system of criminal justice.  As

the  Bill stands, I would certainly support it, but hope that

the Minister would address the issues that I have raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I am happy that the Ministry of Home

Affairs is embarking on this Home Detention Scheme (HDS)  for

prisoners at the tail end of their prison sentence.  I assume

that  MHA  has had considerable success in its implementation

of  the scheme with drug supervisees who were placed on  drug

supervision via this electronic tagging.  If this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>

scheme  was  successful, then I am happy.  But if there  were

problems, perhaps the Minister could share with us what  were

the  problems  that they had faced in its implementation  and

how  these problems had been overcome.  For example,  I  have

learned  that  in the United Kingdom some of these  prisoners

were  placed  on  electronic tagging.  When  they  came  into

contact  with  some big equipment or objects in their  house,

the tagging system failed and many of them had to be returned

to  prison.   So  I  want to know whether we  have  any  such

problems in the past implementation of this scheme here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the present Bill, I have the following

points  to  raise,  Sir.  Is this scheme  being  extended  to

prisoners  as  a  means  to alleviate  over-crowding  in  the

prisons,  as  was  the case in the United  Kingdom?   If  so,

whether steps are being taken to expand the capacity  of  our

prisons.  I would also like to ask the Minister whether over-crowding in our prisons is because of our enhanced sentencing

for  many offences and whether the Minister intends to relook

at the sentencing regime in place at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the scheme's intention is that there are

prisoners  who are suitable and have shown good behaviour  to

deserve  to be placed on the HDS, could there be a  mechanism

whereby such prisoners are released earlier than having to go

through  this HDS process?  Are we too rigid in  sticking  to

the  present  process  whereby we  give  remission  for  good

behaviour  which  is usually about one third  of  the  prison

sentence?  Sir, if the prison authorities and the counsellors

who  are  counselling the prisoners are of the  opinion  that

this  prisoner is one who deserves to be given a  chance  and

that  he  has behaved well and should be released to society,

perhaps  we  need to even amend the Act to provide  that  the

Prisons Director, or even the Minister, should have the power

to  release this prisoner back into society so that he can be

rehabilitated into society even without this HDS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue is the question of who bears the

cost  of  this tagging and monitoring system because this  is

something

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>

which  remains unanswered in the Bill.  I would like  to  ask

the Minister whether the cost of the HDS Scheme is lesser  or

greater in relation to keeping the prisoner in prison at  the

moment.   Sir,  I  would also like to ask  the  Minister  the

criteria applied to disqualified offenders.  Paragraph (7) of

the  Schedule basically is too restrictive.  It tries to  lay

down  a  list  of  criteria which basically  covers  sex  and

violent  offenders.  But looking at the provisions  that  are

laid  there, I think the authorities who drafted the Schedule

have  in  a way tied down their hands.  Because for a  start,

there  are  some  offences  which  are  not  even  specified,

offences  under  the Vandalism Act, the Armed  Offences  Act,

Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act.

These are offences which are not specifically mentioned.   On

the  other  hand, there are offences like rioting  which  are

mentioned.  I would say that the list ties the hands  of  the

authorities  because  offenders commit  offences  in  various

circumstances.  For example, an offence of rioting.  If  five

persons  participate in an offence which  involves  violence,

three  of  them could merely be standing there but  they  may

have the intention, but they did not actually participate  in

the violent offence, beating up somebody or rioting.  But  by

putting specifically here that such a person is disqualified,

individuals  who  may actually qualify  for  the  scheme  may

inadvertently be left out and may be disqualified  under  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to see whether the Schedule

and the criteria for disqualification can be reconsidered and

worded in a wide manner whereby individuals who may be caught

under  crimes, whether it is an attempt, or abetment or  just

merely  being present, are also given a chance  to  go  under

this HDS scheme and are not automatically disqualified as the

way the present disqualification has been written.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister as to why

short-term prisoners cannot be placed under the scheme.   The

way   the  Bill  is  drafted  in  the  proposed  section  38B

specifically  says  that one cannot  be  qualified  for  home

detention for a period

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>

exceeding  six  months  and also that  those  who  are  given

sentence  must  have a minimum imprisonment sentence  of  six

months  of  which  he may not have served three  months.   So

basically,  those who are going to qualify for  this  offence

must have been given a prison sentence of six months or more.

My  question is: could this scheme be also extended to  those

who are given even shorter prison sentences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sweden, for example, Sir, short-term prisoners are

given  home  detention as an alternative to prison  sentence,

that  means, they do not even go to the prison in  the  first

place.   Such an alternative sentencing minimises  the  risks

for  social dislocation by allowing the offender to  maintain

his employment and family contacts.  It also reduces the rate

of  new  criminal behaviour being learned during  periods  of

imprisonment.   It is something which will be  very  suitable

for  young  offenders who are studying or offenders  who  may

need  regular  medical  treatment.  The  way  the  sentencing

scheme  exists  at the moment, for example,  for  a  youthful

offender  is he either gets probation or he goes  to  prison.

There  may  be  cases where some youthful offenders  fall  in

between, and I think HDS may be more appropriate for them  so

that  they  are not exposed to prison environment where  they

pick up bad habits and may become more difficult to turn over

a new leaf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fifthly, I would also like to ask the Minister

whether the Ministry would be taking responsibility and would

also be exposing itself to be liable for any crimes that  may

be  committed by such prisoners who are released  under  this

Home Detention Scheme.  For example, if a person who is under

the  HDS commits an offence where he causes economic loss  or

injures  somebody in commiting another crime, then naturally,

under the law, perhaps the Ministry may be exposed.  I do not

see  a  clause in the Bill itself which exempts the  Ministry

which is trying out this scheme from being liable under  this

scheme.  Perhaps, we have to look at this carefully because I

am  quite sure that there will be some offenders who may  end

up committing offence and the person

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

who  is  hurt  or  who suffers economic loss may  be  looking

towards the Ministry for compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy because I was concerned whether the person

who  is  placed on this HDS scheme will be forced to  go  for

counselling.  I was happy that the Minister in his speech had

mentioned that there will be mandatory counselling  for  such

people who are placed on this HDS Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know whether, among the

conditions  to  be  imposed, there will be a  condition  that

these  offenders  are  to  completely  refrain  from  alcohol

consumption during their period of home detention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the consent of all

adults living in the same residence as the detainee would  be

obtained prior to placing him under the HDS.  Similarly, I am

also  wondering  whether the Minister would insist  that  all

individuals  who  are placed on this HDS  must  be  gainfully

employed  or  must  be  undergoing  some  sort  of  a   study

programme. Otherwise, whether they would be released on  this

HDS scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would also ask the Minister whether he

would  consider  extending the scheme  to  various  types  of

categories  of prisoners and various types of schemes.   This

is very interesting because there are cases where during pre-trial certain individuals who are unable to put up bail,  are

now  at the moment placed in the remand prison.  This is  one

option  which  could be experimented by the Ministry  whereby

individuals  who are unable to raise money could  perhaps  be

placed under this electronic tagging so they are not sent  to

prison and be contaminated by other prisoners while they  are

detained there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, whether this HDS scheme could also be

considered  for  pregnant offenders,  handicapped  offenders,

primary family care providers and juvenile offenders.  Sir, I

hope the Minister would see how the scheme could be made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>

flexible   enough   to   ensure  that  we   provide   various

alternatives   in  rehabilitating  our  crime  offenders   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you, Mr Deputy Speaker for the opportunity to speak.  I would

like  to raise one main concern on the Bill under the section

on home detention order in Part IVA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard Prof. Chin just a while ago and I agree that

maybe  "home  detention" may not be  a  good  term.   If  the

Minister  ever seeks to change the term, let me  add  to  the

confusion  by  suggesting  two other  terms.   One  is  "home

supported  rehabilitation order".  The other  is  "community-based rehabilitation order".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full support of the Community-Based

Sentences  but  overcrowding, as MP, Ravindran suggested,  is

certainly not the issue and should not be the concern and the

cause  for  why we are doing home detention.  Literature  has

shown  that  offenders  recover well  and  best  in  familiar

surroundings  and among loved ones.  But I do agree  with  Mr

Ravindran  that  there  should  be  different  sentences  and

different  durations of home detention for various categories

of   offenders.   He  mentioned,  for  example,   handicapped

offenders,  pregnant offenders, etc, and some flexibility  to

be  given  for different forms of sentences.  I  am  all  for

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a Director may, by order, release a prisoner who

is eligible for home detention for a period not exceeding six

months,  I  would  like  the  Minister  to  clarify  if   the

authorities will do the following four things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to carry out an intensive in-depth interview and

assessment  by  experts before the release to  ascertain  the

level  of readiness of the prisoner in facing the real  world

again.  I heard from the Minister just now that this will  be

provided and an assessment will be carried out objectively by

external  consultants and internal experts  including  senior

officers.  But this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

is only meaningful if the baseline has first been established

on  the  cognitive and emotive orientations of  the  prisoner

when he first arrived so that the final assessment before the

release   could   measure   the   changes   in   him   during

incarceration.  I hope, therefore, findings upon  arrival  in

prison and before he leaves prison will be gathered and  that

these  findings  be  weighed against the order  made  by  the

Director.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second condition is to prepare family members on the

objectives and significance of the home detention  order  and

what they must all do responsibly if the prisoner shows signs

of  recidivist behaviour. A study on the after-conduct  of  a

cohort  of probationers conducted by MCD in 1999 showed  that

the recidivism rate for the probationers from intact families

is  lower than those from non-intact families. That means, in

families  where  the  parents are still  married  and  living

together,  the  chance of re-offence by the  probationers  is

reduced compared to those from non-intact families or  broken

families.  As the family is significant in the rehabilitation

of the offender, an assessment of the readiness of the family

in  receiving  the  prisoner home should be  carried  out  by

specialists  on  family therapy.  Their  findings  should  be

weighed against the order made by the Director.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is to mandate continuing counselling sessions for

the  prisoner under home detention.  Rehabilitation is a long

process and the chance of recidivism is less if the offenders

continue  to  receive  consistent and  scheduled  counselling

sessions.  I hope the Minister would consider mandating this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, if the objective of Community-Based Sentences is

to  allow  the community to collaborate in the rehabilitation

process  of offenders, I hope that the Minister, in the  next

Budget debate, will also commit to more resources being given

to the community for carrying out this work effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to raise one query on the

composition of the Committee of Inquiry in Part IIA.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister clarify the meaning in new section 7B

that  every member of a Committee of Inquiry appointed  shall

be  deemed to be a public servant within the meaning  of  the

Penal  Code?    Please  elaborate  and  help  us  understand.

Second,  in  the event that an institution is being  inquired

into  or  the family of an aggrieved prisoner should petition

for their own representation to the Committee of Inquiry,  is

there a provision to ensure a balanced hearing of views?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these points which I hope the Minister can

clarify, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in support

of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous and violent criminals deserve to be

incarcerated for long periods of time.  But for less  serious

offenders, I see the merit in applying correctional treatment

to  re-integrate them into the community.  I see  the  social

value  in  having  a home detention scheme  to  minimise  the

negative socialisation that occurs in prison.  It is assuring

to  know  offenders  placed  on  Electronic  Monitoring  (EM)

schemes  in other countries register lower recidivism  rates.

But the success rate varies, and the EM may be more effective

with  some groups of offenders and at certain stages  of  the

rehabilitation  process.   A group  of  American  researchers

found  that  EM works better with offenders who  have  had  a

taste  of  prison detention.  Apparently, juveniles  seem  to

respond  better to EM than adults.  EM also seems to be  more

effective  among  targeted groups of  non-violent  offenders,

such as drunk drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of such findings, there is merit in

insisting that home detainees should be non-violent offenders

and  have  spent at least six months in prison.   Justice  is

upheld  as  they  have  at least been minimally  punished  in

prison.  Thereafter, they should not be mixed too  often  and

too  long with hardcore criminals.  If it is bad company that

led  some  misguided  offenders into  prison,  why  test  the

penitent's  resolve by confining him further with proven  bad

company? Why suffer him to be corrupted even further while in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>

prison?   It  is  in  the public interest to  give  deserving

contrite  hearts a second chance.  We should grant  them  the

opportunity to redeem themselves so long as they do not  pose

a  risk to the public.  It is a fact I wholeheartedly applaud

the  spirit of the Bill.  Nonetheless, I would like to  raise

several points for the Minister's clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, can the Minister clarify the types of inmates

who  can qualify and benefit most from the scheme?  It is  in

the  public interest that the selection guidelines rule  that

violent and dangerous criminals, murderers, rapists and other

inmates  convicted of serious crimes should be  automatically

disqualified from the scheme.  They deserve the  full  prison

sentence.   There should be no exception to this.   But  what

are  the  other  criteria  -   family  support,  good  prison

behaviour,  age?  Will these criteria be transparent  to  the

inmates?  Are there studies to indicate that certain targeted

groups of offenders will benefit most from the scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the home detention scheme can help

to  steer  misguided offenders back to the right  path.   But

what numbers are we referring to here?  This leads me to  the

second  point of clarification.  Can the Minister provide  us

with   an  estimate  on  the  percentage  of  prisoners   who

potentially qualify for the home detention scheme?  How  many

detainees,  fitted  with  the EM device,  can  the  community

expect  at  any  one  time?   Does  this  number  affect  the

Government's plan on the number of prisons to be built in the

future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what will the detainees do at home? The scheme

provides the offenders with a measure of freedom.  My concern

is  that  when they are taken off the discipline  of  regular

physical exercise, prison chores and solitude, what are  they

going  to  do  with  their  free time  at  home?   We  cannot

legislate to deny a home detainee the pleasures of  his  home

for  what  is  there  to  prevent an affluent  detainee  from

enjoying  movie after movie on an ultra modern high-tech  big

screen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

home  entertainment system together with his family, or hours

and  hours  of Internet surfing, or a nice sun  tan  after  a

leisure swim in his private pool, or a home party on Saturday

night with his and his family friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not exaggerating. Some years back, a son of a

former  Amercian  Vice-President candidate was  sentenced  to

four  months of house arrest for selling cocaine.   The  home

detention  was  as  good as an extended resort  holiday.   He

lived in a luxury apartment, with maid service, cable TV  and

many  other expensive amenities.  This led his prosecutor  to

observe  that  the drug felon was living in  conditions  that

99.9%  of the people in the area could not afford.  Too  much

free time can be bad for the less affluent detainees too.   A

home  detainee cannot roam the streets.  But in the  confines

of  his  small HDB flat, he is exposed to the temptations  of

the streets through his friends, family media.  Some of these

influences  and friends may not be good for  him.   They  may

numb  him  to  forget that he is still serving his  sentence,

albeit  at home.  While there are devices to ensure  that  he

does  not  leave his home, we cannot legislate  against  such

influences from entering his home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new freedom can be a dangerous thing. When we

feed  idle minds with bad influences, they will breed crooked

schemes.   Restricted  freedom strengthens  the  resolve  for

some, but for others, it propagates jealously, resentment and

bitterness.  To put it simply, home detainees should  not  be

left to their own schemes.  Thus, detaining offenders at home

is  only part of the rehabilitated solution.  The other  part

involves  providing  structured programmes  to  occupy  their

daily  routine.   Meaningful activities should  be  included,

such  as  skill  upgrading  to help  the  detainees  to  find

suitable  jobs  later on.  Perhaps, the activities  also  can

benefit  the  community so that there  will  be  a  pay  back

redemptive effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point of clarification to the Minister then is

how  much  free time do home detainees have.   What  kind  of

rehabilitative programmes would there be?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

This  leads  to  my fourth point regarding community  service

programmes.  Community service programmes can supplement  the

home  detention scheme and acts as an additional intermediate

sanction.  Any  minor  offender, not  necessarily  just  home

detainees,  can be put on community service programmes.   For

example,  minor offenders can be made to help out  in  places

like  nursing homes or centres for the disabled. They can  be

assigned  simple  tasks that require some degree  of  contact

with the elderly or disabled.  Minor offenders may find it to

be  extremely therapeutic when they are exposed to the pride,

strength and character of the elderly and disabled.   It  may

even  help to change their value system for the better.   But

such a programme must be managed properly and discreetly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, as part of their sentence, certain

offenders have to conduct talks in schools or advise troubled

teens.   Some  convicted sports personalities conduct  sports

clinics  followed  by  counselling  sessions  for  juveniles.

Along  this  line, is it not better for a convicted  computer

hacker  to  help non-profit organisations to create websites,

design  software programmes, conduct basic IT training rather

than  for him to rot in prison for the entire period  of  his

sentence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is a corrective work order for litterbugs,

why cannot there be a corrective social work order for social

bugs?   Not  all  social  bugs are  social  menaces.   Social

menaces  should  be  put away from arm's  reach.  Some  minor

social  bugs can perhaps be disinfected of their  ills  by  a

dosage of corrective social work order.  In this light, may I

ask   the   Minister  whether  he  will  consider  broadening

correctional  sanctions further to allow minor  offenders  to

perform community services?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, should the home detention scheme always take

place  at home?  The home environment is not necessarily  the

best  rehabilitation centre.  Some offenders  are  in  prison

precisely because of the lack of guidance at home.  The  lack

of  parental  support has driven some   to  bad  company  and

subsequently to prison.  If the root of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

the  problem  is at home, why send them back to their  homes?

In  such cases, putting them back to their homes is likely to

be counter productive.  But does this mean that the offenders

must  have a supportive home environment in order to  qualify

for  the scheme?  I hope not.  If penitent offenders  do  not

have a favourable home environment to return to, perhaps they

can be detained in some established half-way houses instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that some of these half-way houses are

founded by ex-convicts.  They know what it takes to turn over

a new leaf and want to help others to do so.  The environment

in  these half-way houses can be more rehabilitative than the

home  environment.   The  sharing  of  positive  experiences,

bonding  and encouragement can do these detainees a world  of

good.   But there must be a review of the programmes, funding

level  and management practices of half-way houses.  This  is

because the performance standards, services and facilities of

half-way  houses may vary too significantly.  A  benchmarking

of  the  standards  of half-way houses is important  in  this

regard.   Some degree of recognition and support for half-way

houses   is   also  in  order.    For  my  fifth   point   of

clarification, may I ask the Minister whether an extension of

the  home  detention scheme to relevant half-way  houses  has

been considered?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the family home detainees who are

generally  supportive.  The family is  one  of  the  critical

success factors for the scheme.  It may not be so in the West

because,  given  their cultural practices, it is  conceivable

that  many  home  detainees there  do  not  live  with  their

families.   But  this is generally not the case  here.   Home

detention  here  can literally mean being detained  with  the

family.   A family may seem to be supportive, but we have  to

recognise that it is one thing to express support and another

to  be able to deal with the difficulties and shame of living

with  a  detainee.   The family has to learn  to  adjust  and

accept the concomitant stigma, but not all family members can

manage that successfully.  The mother may accept but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

the  father may resent.  The sister may bear with it but  the

brother  may find it embarrassing and disgraceful to stay  at

home  with  the detainee.  And when a family dispute  erupts,

the detainee cannot run off to cool himself down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all neighbours can accept living near a detainee

either.   It is possible for the family to conjure up excuses

to  explain  to their neighbours and relatives regarding  the

absence  of the prisoner from home.  But having the  detainee

locked  up  at  home  is altogether a very  different  thing.

Hopefully,  the  spot checks on home detainees  will  not  be

conducted  by uniformed law enforcers.  Otherwise, the  whole

neighbourhood will soon know about it.  When tongues are  set

wagging,  some home detainees and their family  members  will

fail  to deal with the stigma.  When this happens, the scheme

will  backfire  and become dysfunctional.  Instead  of  being

reintegrated, the scheme may end up disintegrating the  whole

family.   In this regard, may I ask the Minister whether  any

steps  will be taken to minimise the stigma of home detention

and  to  help home detainees and their family members  to  be

prepared  for the social and psychological stigma  associated

with the scheme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I support the Bill

and  would like to raise a matter of concern that has  arisen

over  the  years  in  my dialogues with residents,  and  this

relates to employment opportunities for ex-prisoners and  ex-inmates of rehabilitation centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is well-known to be tough on crimes and

other forms of deviant behaviour.  This is an admirable stand

and has served us well in making Singapore a country safe for

visitors and residents.  However, there is a segment  of  our

population,  albeit  a small one, who had  previously  served

some time in prison or in various rehabilitation centres  for

errors  made in their youth who require help.  And  there  is

also quite a high incidence of repeat offenders who have  not

been  granted the opportunities of reintegration into society

at large.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>

schemes in prison and rehabilitation centres and now homes to

equip  some  of these individuals with skills and  values  so

that  they  adjust  back to society.  However,  it  is  often

difficult  for  such  individuals to find gainful  employment

once  they are tarnished with a criminal record.  We run  the

risk  of developing by default an underclass who is not given

a second chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Singapore society is not a very forgiving one.

We are very tough on failure, whether it is financial failure

in  the  form of bankruptcy or social failure in the form  of

poor judgment and influence resulting in criminal activities.

Ex-prisoners  and  ex-inmates of rehabilitation  centres  are

often  labelled and are not given opportunities  that  normal

individuals  have despite having served out their punishment.

It is no wonder that often they fall back into bad company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we, as Singaporean employers and

Government, are not doing enough to give these individuals  a

chance to assimilate back into society and become responsible

citizens  who  have  the ability to fully contribute  to  our

nation's progress.  If we are indeed attempting to be a  more

compassionate  and  gracious society  which  is  tolerant  of

failure,  then  we  have to give such  individuals  a  second

chance  in  life.   And this is in keeping with some  of  the

objectives of Singapore 21, as we will provide a real  avenue

for all Singaporeans to be the best that they can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government may have to go beyond providing

education  and skill training to help rehabilitate  prisoners

or inmates.  I am not advocating something as radical as what

is  practised in some European countries where it is  illegal

for  employers to ask if prospective job applicants have  had

previous criminal records.  However, I would like to ask  the

Minister  whether  he  could  consider  using  some  of   our

Government agencies as vehicles to enable the integration  of

these  people  into  society,  by  providing  an  avenue  for

employment  for  a  period of, say, 1-2  years,  after  their

release  from prison or rehabilitation centres so that  these

ex-prisoners have a chance to start life

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

afresh.   Also, I would like to urge the Minister to ask  our

Government  agencies,  in particular,  the  airport  and  the

seaport  police authorities, to review their policy to  allow

ex-prisoners and ex-inmates of rehabilitation centres to work

in their premises, with the thrust of Singapore 21 in mind as

we  move towards becoming a more gracious, compassionate  and

forgiving society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a positive move to introduce home detention.

Whilst  it  is  new  to Singapore, it is  not  new  to  other

countries.  It is a tested system and it can work well in the

Singapore environment.  I hope that with the introduction  of

home  detention, more studies can be made to extend the scope

whereby  home detention could be considered as an alternative

sentencing.   Detention  in prisons  or  any  institution  of

detention  should be prescribed only where the offence  calls

for  it.   Where an offender can be sufficiently punished  by

restriction  of  freedom, perhaps home  detention  should  be

prescribed.  More studies should follow because I am not sure

that  there  can  be any easy answer as to whether  the  home

environment is better for rehabilitation, or that the  prison

environment  is  preferred  where  the  home  environment  is

considered hostile.  I  think the permutation would vary  and

it requires studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home detention is a new method. It is new to Singapore.

I  do  not  think  we  should rush into  making  conclusions.

Earlier  speakers  have suggested the possibility  that  home

detention  could  be used for people who are suffering  from,

say,  some disability or even a state of pregnancy.  I  would

have  thought  that the mode of punishment  should  suit  the

offence rather than the individual's condition itself.  I  am

not sure that it is so clear cut that one could just come out

with a guideline in a moment without more detailed studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Prisons Act and amendments to the

Intoxicating  Substances  Act and the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act

permit the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

use  of  any weapon including firearms.  I am concerned  that

there  should be adequate safeguards to ensure that  weapons,

especially firearms, are used only when absolutely necessary.

A  committee of inquiry should consider every occurrence of a

discharge of firearms or where a prisoner is injured  by  the

use  of  a  weapon.  I am not sure whether the  committee  of

inquiry  under  new  section 7A(2) of  the  Prisons  Bill  is

intended  to cover such occurrences, because it states,  "any

matter connected with discipline, administration or functions

of  any  prison  or affecting any prisoner .".   Perhaps  the

Minister could clarify on this.  And if it is not intended to

cover  such  occurrences, whether there will be  someone  who

will look into such occurrences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking

in  support of the Bill, and I shall try to answer as many of

the questions as possible and as detailed as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Prof. Chin Tet Yung's question about whether it

would  be  better  to  have  more  than  one  member  in  the

committee.   Certainly, it is, and it is not my intention  to

have only a one-member committee. Otherwise, it does not make

much  sense,  except that the law, as it is drafted,  is  not

inconsistent with the provisions in other laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would be appointed to such committees for the

committee of inquiry?  As I have said in my speech, prominent

citizens,  non-prison officers, senior officers in Ministries

and  the  Government, and people who can help us  to  inquire

into  a  particular matter.  All expertise  would  be  sought

where  necessary.  This is not the first time  that  we  have

committees of inquiry for matters that happen in the  prison.

We  have  appointed  a  few  of  them  and,  invariably,  the

committees  have members who are not from the civil  service,

like  Justice of the Peace, for example, or someone  who  has

been involved as a Visiting Justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the proceedings are not open to the public, and if

the chairman decides not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>

to  open  it  to  the  public,  would  the  Minister  decide?

Certainly, I will so decide if there is a public interest  to

do  so.  If there is not, then I think we should leave it  to

the  committee to do its work.  Otherwise, the committee will

feel  encumbered  and its job is to get to the  root  of  the

problem.  It is not a prosecutorial agency, neither is it  an

agency  to  decide what sort of charges to make  out  against

people  who  commit any particular offence.  That  should  be

left to the proper prosecutorial authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a person who may be implicated adversely arising

from  a committee of inquiry may employ counsel?  Yes, to  be

fair  to  him.  If the person is likely to be implicated,  he

may  engage  counsel  to represent him.  Eventually,  if  the

committee's report adversely affects him and his career,  eg,

it  involves a prison officer, as Prof. Chin says,  then,  of

course,  we  will look at the grounds for a request  for  the

committee's report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three suggestions on the term of "home

detention",  eg,  why  do  we not  try  something  else  like

community-based detention and home supervision and so on.  Of

course,  there are various alternatives that we can consider,

but the term "home detention" is not an original term that we

have coined.  Rather, it is a term used by other countries as

well  including the United Kingdom.  So I see  no  particular

reason  why we should favour one term over another when  that

particular  term is easily  understood by the  rehabilitative

or prison authorities in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ravindran and Prof. Chin asked whether this home

detention scheme is more rehabilitative or perhaps  merely  a

measure  to  reduce over-crowding in prisons.   We  know,  of

course,  that  there  is an over-crowding  situation  in  the

prisons,  but that is because many of our prisons' capacities

are  designed based on the old norms and we do not have  many

new  prisons  lately.   So  there is  some  aspect  of  over-crowding, but that is not the reason why we are providing for

home  detention.  The reason, as I have said earlier, is that

it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>

arose from a study that I have asked my Minister of State  to

make  together with other interested parties on what are  the

other  alternative  sentencing options  that  could  be  made

available in our criminal justice system.  We found that this

tail-end  home detention is one of them.  Mr Ee and Mr  Noris

Ong  also  asked whether we should not consider  that  as  an

alternative  instead  of having the person  served  a  prison

sentence  and then put him on home detention.  The  Committee

that my Minister of State chaired did indeed consider such an

option,  but I think we should take things one at a time  and

we  should  not  rush into implementing every  recommendation

that has been put up by the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked why some offences which we

consider to be serious such as armed robbery or extortion are

not  included in the disqualification list.  We can  have  an

exhaustive  list  which can run into many  pages  or  we  can

consider  some  of  those offences which we  think  are  very

serious  and  which we should exclude them.  For the  others,

they  could  be included provided they satisfy  the  criteria

that  I  have made out.  The criteria being that the  inmates

are  amenable  to re-integration and rehabilitation  and  the

family  members  are  prepared to support  them  in  the  re-integration effort, and the good behaviour of the person  and

so  on.   So it is not an exhaustive list and we will  review

the  list  from  time  to time and, if necessary,  update  or

include or exclude other offences which are currently not  in

the list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked about the Advisory Committee for

Home  Detention, how such a Committee will work and who  will

appoint  the  Committee  and whether the  Committee  will  be

appointed  by the Minister and whether it will have  its  own

internal procedures. Of course, the internal working will  be

such  that  the  internal Prisons Committee will  review  all

eligible  inmates  for  home  detention  and  those  who  are

considered  suitable or even not suitable, but  if  they  are

eligible,  they will be put up periodically to  the  Advisory

Committee  who  will then make its recommendations.   In  the

process of making its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>

recommendations, the Committee can call up  the  inmates  and

ask  questions and review their records.  That power is given

to  the Advisory Committee.  In the end, a decision has to be

made and that will be made by the Director of Prisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked specifically whether the overcrowding

in  our  prison  is  the  result  of  the  strict  sentencing

guidelines that have been imposed for offences.  There are  a

number  of reasons which I have explained earlier.  We always

look  at  the  sentencing  regime to  see  whether  they  are

adequate or not.  Of course, if they are not, we will  review

them.   On whether we could release prisoners in the  process

earlier instead of just having the standard remission period,

I think the remission of one-third of the prisoner's sentence

is  already quite generous.  Now we are providing the balance

of  up to six months for the person to serve his sentence  at

home  and I think for a start we should just go for that  and

not do anything more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners need not pay for the cost of the

electronic  tagging and the cost of monitoring  because  this

will be borne by the prison authorities.  Home detention with

electronic  tagging is not a new thing that  the  prison  has

implemented.   As  I have said, it has been  implemented  for

criminal law detainees, reformative trainees as well as those

detained   under  the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act.   So   Prisons

Department already has enough experience in dealing with such

people,  including  the process of examining,  assessing  and

investigating whether a person is suitable for home detention

or  not.   That  process will be quite exhaustive,  including

talking  to professionals and counsellors if necessary,  and,

in  particular,  for home detention, family support  is  very

important.   Without family support, there is no  purpose  in

releasing  that inmate back to society because  we  need  the

family  to  also play its role in rehabilitating the  inmate.

Getting  the half-way house to do the job is not good  enough

because  we  should not just pass the responsibility  to  the

half-way  house.  But we can get the half-way house to  help.

For example, in counselling, we can get SANA, VWOs, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  Aftercare Association to help in the  counselling.

Counselling  would indeed be one of the conditions  that  the

prison would impose on anybody who is on home detention.   Of

course, by not incarcerating the prisoner, it will be cheaper

in  the  process  to put a person under home  detention.   So

indeed the answer is yes, it is cheaper to put a person under

home detention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked whether the Ministry or the

prison  authorities or the Government will be liable for  any

offence committed by an inmate who is on home detention.  The

prison  authorities will be liable if it is shown that  there

is  criminal  negligence on its part.  If there  is  criminal

negligence in releasing the person, yes, certainly they could

be sued.  But in the end the whole process has to be examined

and  see  whether prison has indeed been criminally negligent

in  releasing the prisoner.  The final decision on that  will

be,  of  course,  the courts which will take that  case  into

consideration  and  decide  whether  there  is  any  criminal

negligence based on evidence and facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition which Mr Ravindran asked the prison

authorities to consider is whether we can prohibit such  home

detainees  from  consuming alcohol.  I think we  should  only

have  conditions which can be enforced or seemingly  possible

to  enforce.   It  is very difficult to enforce  a  condition

which requires a person to be a teetotaler at home unless, of

course, if a person is out on a drink driving charge, and  an

offence is committed, that person will be in deep trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other suggestions Mr Ravindran talked about in

extending   the   scheme  to  the  different  categories   of

offenders, indeed those he mentioned would be covered  except

those  who  are on pre-trial or pre-sentencing.  Because,  if

the case has not been heard yet, how could we put a person on

home  detention?  What power do the prison authorities  have?

If  he cannot post bail, then he goes on remand.  That is it.

I cannot imagine a person who cannot post

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>

bail but at the same time commits a serious offence and there

is  no  way  of  assessing the bahaviour of the  person,  the

prison authority is called upon to decide whether that person

should  be  on home detention.  I think that is an impossible

task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked about different home detention

periods for different types of prisoners like, for example, a

person who is handicapped.   The prison authorities will look

at all eligible inmates and release them for up to six months

on  home detention if they are suitable.  That is the kind of

flexibility that we should have.  We should not put too  many

conditions   and   criteria  into  the  assessment   process,

otherwise it will complicate the whole running of the scheme.

Even  for intensive interviews, that will be done.  As I have

said,  counsellors will be used.  We will talk to  the  right

people,  including the family members, to make sure that  the

person  is indeed amenable to home detention.  But  the  more

money  we  invest in this, the less we will  have  for  other

purposes, including rehabilitation in the prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong asked what is the potential number of

prisoners who will qualify for home detention.  I do not have

the  numbers  but I believe it will be a significant  number.

Of course, not the majority of them, because many of them are

in  the medium and high security prisons.  So we will have to

consider  all those eligible cases and then take  a  look  at

them.  Offhand, I would say that prisons will start off  with

30  to 40 a month.  It will try this out and see the pace  of

it.   If  it  can cope with it, and if our Advisory Committee

can deal with it, then more can be released.  We have to take

it one step at a time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is on home detention is not likely to be

wasting his time.  If he wants to do that, I do not know what

else  we  could  do.   We  could  recall  him.   One  of  the

conditions  for home detention would be that  the  inmate  be

gainfully employed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>

or  studying.  We will try our best to find him a  job.   But

that  may  not be easy.  There could be a time when a  person

may  not  be able to find a job.  That does not mean we  will

recall  the inmate back from home detention immediately.   We

ought to have some flexibility on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we can help them to reduce the stigma and

their  friends knowing them as prisoners or not, I think  the

moment  he goes to prison, the neighbours will already  know.

The  prison authorities have been quite discreet in designing

the tag.  The tag is a little item that is put on the leg and

if  he  wears long pants, it can be covered.  Unless he wants

to  go  for a swim, that is a different matter.  I think  the

person has to take a chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we should be more

compassionate to ex-prisoners. That is a view which  we  will

try  to encourage people to have, particularly employers,  to

employ  these people.  Of course, some employers are wary  of

employing ex-prisoners.  What SCORE and ISCOS, which are  MHA

statutory board and company, have done is that they have been

helping these people to find jobs.  If employers are prepared

to  employ  them, we will be happy to match the prisoners  or

those under home detention for jobs.  In certain places, like

airport  and seaport, security is very important.  Therefore,

the  standards  that the authorities expect  of  people  with

criminal  records are much higher. We should not be  too  lax

about that, otherwise we will bring ourselves more trouble by

being too lax over security standards in the airport and  the

seaport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Gerald Ee asked about the use of firearms,

and  whether  firearms  would only be  used  when  absolutely

necessary.  That must be the case.  I do not think our people

are  trigger-happy  to  shoot whenever somebody  attempts  to

escape. They will employ all measures to restrain the  person

and  to  stop  the  escape  from happening  and  if  that  is

impossible, then orders to shoot will be given by a  superior

officer.  If firearm is actually used, and it is necessary to

have a Committee of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>

Inquiry,  we  will inquire into it.  In any case,  the  right

authority to investigate into any discharge of firearm is the

police.   If there is a discharge of firearm, even innocently

or  accidentally, by an officer on duty, the matter will also

be  investigated by the police.  Members can be rest  assured

that we do not just shoot unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have dealt with all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I seek an answer from the

Minister on the status of the members in the Committee.  What

does he mean by "being deemed public servants"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I have not looked at the particular

provision  in  the  Penal Code, but from my  recollection,  I

believe  that it applies to people who are not civil servants

who help us and we consider them to be public servants in the

performance  of  their duties as members  of  the  committee.

Therefore, we assume that they do their job in good faith and

whatever decisions, recommendations or actions that they take

would not be subject to any suit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Two points of clarification for the

Minister.   The  first point is on the issue  of  imposing  a

condition on the offender for not consuming alcohol.  Sir,  I

am  quite  sure,  as part of the condition for  release,  the

prison  authorities  will  be  imposing  certain  conditions.

Similarly,  one  of it will be that he cannot consume  drugs.

Naturally,  the  officers will be making surprise  visits  to

meet this offender.  By imposing a condition that they do not

consume  alcohol imposes on them a condition that  they  stay

sober  and  also makes sure that this is not a  luxury  which

they  enjoy  at home but it would be monitored.  So  I  would

urge  the  Minister  to impose it as a  matter  of  condition

because  this is something that is even introduced in  Sweden

and they have found that it can be successfully monitored  if

your  officers are keen.  If the condition is there, I  think

the offender will know that there is such a condition.  If he

infringes it, he goes back

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>

to  prison.   So I hope that the Minister would include  this

condition into the terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is on the question of pre-trial

option to go on electronic tagging.  My concern is that there

are  cases  where individuals, who come from  poor  families,

before  they  are  determined  whether  they  are  guilty  or

innocent,  because they are unable to raise the  bail  money,

they  end  up  being  in the remand prison.   And  these  are

instances which I consider sad cases.  An option can be given

to  them  to  opt for electronic tagging, so that they  avoid

going  to  prison.   I  think it is an  option  that  can  be

considered,  and it is also being considered  in  the  United

Kingdom  in certain districts.  So perhaps this is  something

that the Minister could consider implementing, so that people

who  are determined subsequently to be innocent would not end

up  serving in the remand prison just because they are unable

to raise the bail money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the prison authorities will look

at whatever condition that is necessary to be included in the

enforcement of this home detention scheme.  It is  easier  to

detect  drug consumption than, say, alcohol.  When  you  take

alcohol,  whatever  drink it is, and  overnight,  it  can  be

washed  away.  But as for drugs, you can actually do a  urine

test,  and  you can determine whether the person  has  drugs.

But we will still look at the Member's suggestion and see  if

it is necessary to have the condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pre-trial cases, I think right now it is definitely

beyond  the  scope of this particular review,  and  it  is  a

totally different thing altogether.  I am not ruling  it  out

completely,  but right now we have other considerations  that

we  have to take into account in implementing this particular

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>LIBERALISATION OF THE SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE</b></div>

<br>5.34 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the long

title  of  my motion is "Issues related to the liberalisation

of  the Singapore Stock Exchange in the midst of the boom  of

Internet  Stocks".  I would like to declare  my  interest  as

Director of several listed companies, including I-one.net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the departure of Mr Koh Beng Seng from the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS), the  Singapore  Stock

Exchange used to be a bastion of conservatism.  After the Pan-Electric  episode,  the SES had adopted a regulatory  mindset

and  attempted to protect both the gullible investors and the

reckless  speculators  in essentially a buyer-beware  market.

From  time to time, rules for listed companies were made even

more  stringent with new requirements such as the requirement

of  an  independent  Audit Committee and full  disclosure  of

directors' fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing requirements of Initial Public Offering (IPO)

were very stringent, especially those seeking to list on  the

main  board.  These companies must have proven track  records

of profitability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the SES became a comparatively calm equity

market  where  speculations  were  minimal.   It  acquired  a

reputation  of being a safe market, in so far  as  an  equity

market  could  be made safe.  The collective  memory  of  the

public  is  that SES is a strict taskmaster.  When a  company

obtained  the  approval  from the SES  to  list,  the  public

assumed  that  someone  had done the due  diligence  and  the

company's fundamentals had been certified sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This public image has remained unchanged today, even

though in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

post-Koh  Beng Seng era, the SES, recently renamed  SGX,  has

modified its stance, moving away from its regulatory role and

becoming  more  a  stock exchange like  the  New  York  Stock

Exchange.   Companies  seeking IPO no  longer  need  a  track

record of proven profitability.  In fact, MediaRing, when  it

was being listed, had projected to continue its multi-million

dollar  losses  for  the  next few years!   In  essence,  any

company  with  a  market capitalisation  of  more  than  S$80

million post-IPO and could find a merchant banker prepared to

underwrite the IPO exercise, could tap the market for funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these

relaxations are appropriate if SGX were to remain viable  and

relevant   in   an   increasingly  dynamic   equity   market.

Otherwise, more and more market players will bypass  SGX  and

invest  in  other stock markets in the world, an  undertaking

made  easier because of Internet trading.  Unfortunately,  as

the  liberalisation has been quite recent, the fact that  SGX

is  now a less regulated market and hence a more risky  place

has not yet dawned in the collective memory of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, in the liberalisation process, a new kind

of companies has burst onto the scene worldwide: the Internet

companies.   High-tech companies and Internet companies  have

been  the darlings of the US capital market for several years

now.   Companies, which lose money consistently, continue  to

see their share prices appreciate.  Traditional indicators of

company's  performance no longer seem to  be  relevant.   For

instance,  the  P/E  ratio  has become  meaningless  or  non-applicable.   The famous example is Amazon.com.   This  fever

has  spread  to other major stock markets in the  world.   In

Japan,  Softbank and Hikari become investment companies  with

the  Midas' touch.  With the success of China.com and Pacific

Internet in the NASDAQ market, the Internet fever has  spread

to Hong Kong Stock Exchange, SGX, KL Stock Exchange, and even

the Bombay Stock Exchange.  In Hong Kong, Pacific Century

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>

Cyberworks almost single-handedly leads the charge  into  the

brave new world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, taking advantage of the relaxed

listing requirements, three dot.com companies were listed one

after  another  since  June  last  year,  namely,  I-One.net,

MediaRing  and  Horizon.com.   All  these  three  IPOs   were

spectacularly successful with prices peaked at multiple times

of  the issue prices.  The scramble is on.  Let me quote from

Hock  Lock Siew column of 19th February issue of the Business

Times:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is big money to be made from the Internet craze

in  Singapore.  The window of opportunity could be closing as

more and more Internet firms get listed.  Time is of essence.

The  faster  to  market,  the higher  an  Internet  startup's

valuation."



There are indeed many dot.com companies in the pipeline vying

to  go  IPO.  Gotcha, Nececity, iProperty, GeoAsia,  just  to

name a few.  Many companies, in fact, with very little to  do

with  Internet  are  now frantically transforming  themselves

into dot.com companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are not alone in this. The scene in Hong

Kong   is  even  scarier  as  traditional  brick  and  mortar

companies scramble to join the bandwagon.  Mr Li Ka-Shing has

just launched his Tom.com hoping to raise HK$762 million.   I

am quite sure many of those dealmakers do not really know the

difference between "bytes" and "bites".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the valuations of dot.com companies in the US

continue to escalate, the dot.com phenomenon is beginning  to

look like an asset bubble.  The Internet sector in the US has

a  valuation  of  around US$550 billion or 4%  of  the  total

market  capitalisation.  As an indication of the lofty height

NASDAQ  has  reached, it is pertinent to note that  Microsoft

alone has a market capitalisation of around US$600 billion, a

figure  larger  than the GDP of Canada!  The danger  of  this

asset  bubble is that all the stock markets in the world  are

now  pegged to the fortune of NASDAQ.  It also means that  if

NASDAQ  crashes, this would bring about a simultaneous  crash

worldwide.   The  scenario is indeed very scary.   In  recent

days, while Dow Jones has been declining, the NASDAQ has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>

continued  to  power ahead moving in the opposite  direction.

Despite all the talk of the new economy, nothing can defy the

law of gravity ultimately.  What goes up must come down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we shall embrace the new economy. Senior Minister

in  his  Chinese  New  Year's speech  at  the  Tanjong  Pagar

Community  Club urged that young men and women  in  Singapore

with  bright  ideas should be encouraged  to  take  risks  to

ensure  that  their ideas could be brought to fruition.   The

investing public must be encouraged to give their support  to

the risk-takers so that a new entrepreneurial group could  be

produced that would give Singapore's economy that extra zip.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is how Singaporeans can participate

in  the  Internet boom without being sucked  into  the  asset

bubble.    Had  our  market  been  known  for  its  high-risk

investment  environment where investors go  into  the  market

with their eyes open, I would be less inclined to be alarmed.

As  it  is,  most people still believe that so  long  as  SGX

approves an IPO, the company would have been vetted by one of

the  toughest regulators in the world.  As such, sometimes  I

feel  great unease standing by as the speculative fever sucks

in  the  wise  and  the worldly as well  as  the  greedy  but

ignorant.   I  am  sure  that in our environment,  if  things

ultimately  go  wrong, our Government will  be  blamed.   And

scenes   of   the   Taiwanese  speculators  petitioning   the

Government  for  assistance to recover  their  lost  fortunes

flash in my mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, should the current Internet boom burst, and

burst it seems to be sooner or later, would the investors  be

turned   off  by  all  dot.com  companies,  including   those

deserving ones, thereby depriving the young and the promising

entrepreneurs the lifeline for success?  My own preference is

for  the  Government  to express stronger  words  of  caution

regarding  new  IPOs of dot.com companies.   Perhaps  we  can

follow  the  practice of cigarette companies  printing  words

like  "Smoking  is hazardous to your health."   But  in  this

case,  maybe  words  like "Profit stream of  the  company  is

uncertain.  Invest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

at  your  own risk."  On the other hand, on a more  realistic

note,  I  would  prefer to see that companies  with  unproven

track  records,  such as dot.com companies,  be  confined  to

SESDAQ,  our secondary market, rather than be listed  on  the

main exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this is an unenviable and difficult task, I

would  like to urge the Minister to strike a balance  between

liberalisation  of our stock exchange and the  protection  of

our  retail investors, especially in view of the bull run  of

high-tech and Internet stocks.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I thank Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen  for  his

intervention.   It  is  a timely reminder  of  the  risks  of

investing in the stock market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years, we have liberalised and

modernised our capital markets.  We have changed the  listing

rules  on  SGX  to  allow a wider range of  companies  to  be

listed,  including start-up companies with short  but  strong

profit  records, and companies which have not  yet  made  any

profits at all because of heavy reinvestment needs.  The  new

rules  are comparable to the rules in other established stock

markets in the world for their main boards.  The changes have

been  necessary  to enable capital markets to  fund  the  new

economy, because the main purpose of the equity market is not

to enable investors to make a quick buck, but to be an avenue

for  channelling funds and resources as equity to  invest  in

companies and enable companies to draw equity in order to  be

able  to grow.  So the changes have been necessary to  enable

the  capital  market  to fund this new economy,  particularly

including   companies   in  high-tech   and   knowledge-based

industries.  If we do not allow high-tech companies  to  list

on  the  Stock Exchange, then either they will be choked  off

from equity capital and we will miss out on their growth,  or

they  will  list  overseas, for example, on NASDAQ,  and  our

stock market will wither.  So we are in this business.   This

is again for professionals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have changed the regulatory

philosophy - from a merit-based one, what Dr Wang called  Koh

Beng  Seng's approach, although it was not just Mr  Koh  Beng

Seng,  it was the Government's approach, or what the Business

Times  called "the Confucian approach", to a disclosure-based

one.   Previously, we would assess the merits of  a  proposal

and  decide whether it is a good or a bad company.   Now,  we

have  basic  criteria and as long as there is full disclosure

and  all  the  facts are put up, we allow the company  to  be

listed and allow investors to go in.  This has been necessary

because  finally, investors have to make their own  decisions

and   to   take  responsibility  for  them.   No  merit-based

regulator  can guarantee that only successful companies  will

be listed and that investors will definitely make a profit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We changed the listing rules last September. Since

then,  five  companies have been listed under the  new  rules

which would not have qualified under the old rules.  Only two

are  dot.com companies, as Dr Wang pointed out, MediaRing and

Horizon.com.  The other three are China Toll Bridges &  Roads

Ltd,   ST   Assembly   Test  Services   Ltd   and   Chartered

Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd, of which STATS and  CSM  are

also listed on NASDAQ and are by no means start-up companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our changes coincided with the great effervescence in

the  technology  sector and tech stocks in  the  US  markets.

There  is  a  new  frontier, there is a gold rush  mentality.

Some  people  have made it big, others hope to make  it  even

bigger.   They are going in, they are trying as if  the  last

train is about to leave the station.  Not all will succeed  - many will certainly fail.  The excitement is for real reasons

because the Internet is a dramatic breakthrough in technology

which  is  going to change the lives of billions  of  people.

But,  of course, in all this excitement, we start with a good

thing  and  get carried away by its momentum.  There  is  the

psychology of a speculative bubble, particularly in  the  US,

in  tech  stocks.  And this has buoyed other markets  in  the

world, including Hong Kong, Bombay, KL and to a lesser extent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  At some point, the American market will come back

to  earth, the law of gravity will reassert itself and  which

will affect markets everywhere else.  How or when, nobody can

tell.  If Dr Wang could be quite confident that this is going

to  happen  within  this year, contrary to  what  many  other

people  expect,  he could become very rich  by  shorting  the

market.  On the other hand, if he misjudges, he might not  be

rich at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I cannot comment whether the Singapore market is too

high or too low, much less on the merits of individual stocks

or  companies which are listed on the Stock Exchange.  But  I

can tell you that not every company that calls itself dot.com

is   naturally  and  automatically  an  Internet  company  or

destined  for  fabulous success.  Investors  have  to  decide

whether to buy the shares in these companies, or in any other

companies.  You have got to know the risks.  You have got  to

be prepared for the downside.  And you have got to judge what

your  risk  appetite  is.   If you are  an  investment  fund,

picking  winners  for  your portfolio,  with  many  potential

winners  in  a big portfolio, that is fine.  One  goes  sour,

another  one  will turn out right.  But if you  are  a  widow

investing  your last CPF dollar, and you put it on  a  single

company  in the hope that you will get rich, then  maybe  you

are  better  off keeping that money in a fixed deposit  in  a

bank instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think overall, our new rules and philosophy are

correct.   The  Government cannot stop companies  from  being

listed  on  SGX because we think that their business  is  too

risky, or because we think their shares are priced too  high.

Risk  taking  is the essence of business and particularly  in

the new economy.  But we will educate the public on the risks

so  that people know what they are doing and go in with their

eyes open.  Whether they are actually looking or not, that is

another  matter.  But we will not spare any effort to explain

and  to  point  out, and speeches by Dr Wang, MPs  and  other

leaders will also be helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even with tight rules, as in the past, you

must remember that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>

companies are not guaranteed to succeed.  Whatever our rules,

they can fail either for business reasons or because of fraud

or  crime, as Pan-El failed and Amcol ran into trouble.   And

even  if  a  company is sound, its share price can  still  be

inflated  and  not  justified by the company's  earnings  and

prospects.    And   indeed,  Microsoft   itself,   which   is

undoubtedly a very good company with its share price at about

$100,  that is about 70 or 80 times its price earnings ratio.

And  Steve Balmer himself, who is now the CEO, had said,  "My

price  is  inflated, over-valued."  As a result of which,  it

came down three or four dollars, but it is still over-valued.

So  I  do not think it is possible for the Government to make

sure that the Stock Exchange is a safe place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway it is difficult to prevent people from taking

risks,  by keeping what we think are risky companies off  the

Stock Exchange.  People who want risky investments find  many

ways  to  make them.  They can invest overseas.  In  the  old

days,  when  the Malaysian stocks were listed on  CLOB,  they

invested  on CLOB, which is a different environment from  the

Singapore stock market.  Or sometimes, if they cannot  invest

on  the stock market, they put money on horses or many  other

things,  or  football,  or even watch two  raindrops  on  the

windscreen  and  see  which  goes  faster.   That  is   their

instinct.   Our  job is to encourage a more professional  and

sophisticated share market, not controlled by people  looking

at the screen through the window and hoping to guess the next

move  that the share price will make, but people who  analyse

the  fundamentals, understand the business, know the way  the

industry is going and put bets in for the long term.   So  if

you  do  not know about stocks, do not buy and sell based  on

the  latest rumour or rely on hot tips from friends.   Better

entrust  your money to a reliable fund manager,  buy  a  unit

trust,  or  leave  your money in the  bank.   It  is  not  as

exciting,  but it is much safer.  Not totally risk-free,  but

much safer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can do is to enforce the rules of

the  market  -  have  proper disclosure,  have  tight  market

surveillance, have quick action against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>

any  price  manipulation, any monkey  business  means  severe

penalties  for offenders.  Recently, we changed  the  law  to

introduce a new civil penalty for insider trading, to make it

easier  to  punish or to obtain compensation from  those  who

make improper use of insider information to trade and benefit

themselves at the expense of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors cannot just invest in a company based on the

name  of  that company. They have to know what the  company's

business  is,  how the company is doing, what  its  prospects

are,  how much the company is realistically worth.  For  IPOs

and  share  issues, all this information  should  be  in  the

company  prospectus.   We will change  our  requirements  for

prospectuses  to ensure that they contain all that  investors

reasonably  expect  to  find  it.   And  this  will   include

information   which  is  known  to  the  directors   of   the

corporation,   or   known  to  the   persons   performing   a

professional or advisory function in relation to the issue or

proposed issue of securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a move away from a "one-size-fits-all"

prospectus.   We  will accommodate the greater  diversity  of

companies being listed on SGX, and create an environment  for

intermediaries,   like  stockbrokers,   investment   bankers,

accountants, even lawyers, are expected to play their part in

ensuring  that  proper disclosure is made.   But  of  course,

while we can print a good prospectus, this will only help  if

people  actually  read  the prospectuses,  and  do  not  just

blindly subscribe to IPO shares confident that they will make

a profit on the first day.  And in fact, it is known in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>

some markets, you go to the stockbroker's office, you get the

application form with the prospectus, you go out,  you  throw

away the prospectus in the dustbin and you just take the form

and  hope  that the shares are worth some money.   Sometimes,

even the form is worth some money.  But that is not the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained the Government's approach towards

liberalising  and regulating the stock market,  and  set  out

what  the Government can and cannot do.  It is in the  nature

of  stock markets and human psychology that the markets  will

go up and go down through cycles.  These cycles are linked to

the  real  economy,  but often overshoot.   They  last  seven

years,  10  years,  sometimes, like now  in  America,  a  bit

longer.  My suspicion is they are driven by young people  who

are  seeing  the cycle for the first time.  They  have  never

lost  before, they have never seen the blood on  the  ground.

It  is exciting and exhilarating.  It is their last chance to

get in.  They ramp it up.  And then something goes wrong,  it

comes  down again.  And they have learned their lesson.   But

in  10  years' time, a new generation of greenhorns is  born.

So  we  should know this.  We have been through this  before.

The  stock market will not always go up.  Sometimes, it  will

come  down.  So Singaporeans who want to invest on the  stock

market should know this and invest prudently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

of  SCV  has  increased to 23% (or 214,000 households).   The

subscription  rate is highest for private residential  homes,

service for different housing types are not available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 5,000 subscribers for its existing

years  ago.  SCV  has  estimated  that  an  additional  2,500

subscribers have signed up for its cable modem service  since

its launch in December 1999. Subscription rates for the cable

modem  service  are currently modest because cable  broadband

access is still in its infancy in Singapore.  SCV targets  to

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT AND RETRAINING PROGRAMMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  if  he  will  give (a) an  update  on  unemployment

figures  in  1999  based on age, education,  gender  and  job

sector;  (b) the nature and duration of retraining programmes

which  have  benefited women workers in  1999;  and  (c)  the

effectiveness of such training in matching the needs  in  the

job  market measured in terms of immediate job placement  and

work productivity levels.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's unemployment rate is traditionally low

averaging  around  2%.   However,  along  with  her  regional

neighbours,  Singapore  was  not  spared  from  the  downturn

triggered by the currency crisis in mid-1997.  The impact  of

the economic slowdown on the labour market was, however, only

largely  felt  in  the second half of 1998 with  unemployment

reaching  a high of 4.4% in the later half of the  year.   By

1999, the labour market began to show some signs of recovery,

with  the unemployment rate declining throughout most of  the

year.  The 1999 unemployment figure will be available on  the

24th  February  2000  when  the  Annual  Economic  Survey  is

released.  Full details on the unemployment profile  will  be

available  in  the  quarterly  Labour  Market  Report  to  be

released in mid-March 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All workers, regardless of gender, age and race are

given  opportunities to retrain and upgrade their skills  and

knowledge.   Female  workers can benefit and  have  benefited

from  retraining programmes such as the Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  (SRP).   Among the 21,700 workers  who  have  been

trained  or  are undergoing training under the SRP,  40%  are

females.  In fact, during the early stages of the SRP when it

focused primarily on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>

manufacturing sector, an even greater percentage  of  females

were  trained.   Most of the trainees were female  production

workers.  Today, the SRP has expanded into many other sectors

such  as  childcare, healthcare, banking, travel and tourism,

telecommunications, etc, so female workers of many  different

occupations are being trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courses being offered by national training

programmes are varied.  They include preparatory courses such

as  Basic  Education for Skills Training  (BEST)  and  Worker

Improvement through Secondary Education (WISE) which  aim  to

raise  the  workers'  proficiency in language  and  numeracy.

Other  courses  include Certificates of  Competencies  (CoC),

National Technical Certificates (NTC) levels 2 and 3, as well

as  other certificate courses offered by the polytechnics and

the  ITE.   These  courses are relevant to various  different

industries  in  both the manufacturing and services  sectors.

The  duration  of the courses also varies.  For example,  the

duration of a CoC course or 1 module of NTC course is usually

120 hours.  The duration of an NTC 3 course is 480 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, MOM started a scheme to improve the

employability of retrenched workers through skills upgrading.

This  was done under the SRP and spearheaded by the self-help

groups,  which  acted  as  surrogate  employers.   Under  the

scheme,  retrenched  workers who were unable  to  secure  re-employment  went  for skills upgrading under  the  SRP.   139

sponsored  retrenched  workers  graduated  under  the  scheme

between  August and November last year.  Of the 114  whom  we

managed  to  contact during a recent survey,  89  (78%)  have

found employment and 25 (22%) are still unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is not only relevant to retrenched workers. It

is  just  as  important  in  raising  the  skill  levels  and

productivity  of those who have a job.  In a study  conducted

by  the  Skills Development Fund in 1998, about  90%  of  the

companies  surveyed indicated that training  had  significant

impact   on  the  level  of  service  quality,  followed   by

productivity  growth  and level of  product  quality  of  the

organisations.   The  extent of  increase  in  the  level  of

service  quality ranged from 11% to 20%; and 1%  to  10%  for

productivity growth and level of product quality. As for  the

impact  of  training  on individuals, 80%  of  the  companies

surveyed   indicated  that  there  was  an   enhancement   in

employability after an employee had gone through  certifiable

training.  More than 60% of the organisations also said  that

employees who had undergone training received a wage increase

ranging from 1% to 10%.

<div align="center"><b>MINIMUM AGE FOR CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development (a) what is the rationale  for  fixing

the  minimum  age for criminal responsibility at seven  years

old; (b) whether in the past 10 years the Court has convicted

any  child  between 7 and 10 years old and for what offences;

and  (c)  if he will consider reviewing this issue, including

seeking  expert and community opinions on this, by organising

a public and private forum. .



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Penal Code has made it clear that nothing is an

offence  which is done by a child under 7 years  of  age,  or

committed by a child aged between 7 and 12 years who has  not

attained  sufficient maturity of understanding to  judge  the

nature and consequences of his/her conduct on that occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This minimum age of 7 years is inherited from the common

law  of England.  This minimum age provides a safety net  for

young  offenders  and  protects  them  from  exploitation  of

unscrupulous adults who may want to make use of  children  to

carry  out  illegal  activities.  It also  allows  for  early

intervention by social and other authorities before  a  child

progresses into a hardened offender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the minimum age of culpability is 7 years old,

children  are  not  subject to the  same  justice  system  as

adults.  The  juvenile  justice system adopts  a  restorative

model that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>

emphasizes  the  best interests of the child.   In  addition,

there  is an inherent safeguard as children between the  ages

of  7 and 12 years who do not have adequate understanding  of

the  crimes  they have committed will not be held  criminally

responsible.   Criminal sanctions can  therefore  be  applied

only  to young children who are aware of the nature of  their

conduct, while protecting those of a similar age who have not

yet reached a sufficient level of maturity, from prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all persons arrested for committing offences will be

charged in court.  In many cases, Police, at the direction of

the Attorney-General's Chambers, administer stern warnings to

juveniles  or  refer them for community-based  programmes  to

help the juveniles and their families, instead of prosecuting

them.

  "offences" filed against "unfilial children".)



  ++  This refers to the number of applications  filed by  an

  aged person for enforcement of the maintenance order issued

  by  the  Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents.  This  is

  done when a Respondent (the child) defaults payment of  the

  maintenance ordered against him and the aged person decides

  to  take up enforcement proceedings against him. Section 10

  of  the  MPA stipulates that the Order of Tribunal  may  be

  enforced in the same manner as maintenance orders for wives

  and  children  are  enforced under the  provisions  of  the

  Women's Charter.  Applications for enforcement of Order  of

  Tribunal are filed at Family Court.



  +++  This refers to cases in which the respondent in an

  enforcement proceeding heard at Family Court is sentenced

  to a  term of imprisonment for breach of the Order of

  Tribunal. The Family Court does not maintain such

  file search.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry makes available mediation or family

counselling  services,  either  from  the  Ministry  or   the

community  (such  as  in  family service  centres),  to  help

families  who  cannot  agree  on the  maintenance  for  their

elderly  parents resolve any family disputes  or  differences

even  before  they approach the Tribunal for assistance,  and

during and after the Tribunal's proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry takes a holistic approach in dealing with

families  who approach us for assistance.  We look  into  the

essential  needs  of  the family, (eg. help  with  waiver  of

medical  fees and school fees), provide counselling  services

to  deal with their emotional or social difficulties as  well

as  arrange  admission to a nursing home for elderly  parents

who  are  in  need  of  such care. If  necessary,  short-term

financial  assistance will be given to help the families  get

back on their feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry networks closely with other Government

agencies  and  Community Development Councils to  secure  the

necessary supportive assistance for families in need.   Cases

may  be  referred to family service centres  to  ensure  that

dysfunctional families receive the help they need to  resolve

their   social  or  emotional  difficulties  and  appropriate

counselling and casework follow-up.

<div align="center"><b>PRE-SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) what is the total number of children  under  6

years old who are in pre-school, including those in childcare

centres under the Ministry of Community Development; (b) what

are   the  basic  academic  qualifications  of  early   child

educationists; (c) what is the total number of such qualified

teachers in Singapore; and (d) what measures are being  taken

to   enhance  pre-school  teachers'  quality  and   classroom

teaching.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of children under 6 years old in

Ministry  of Education registered kindergartens and  Ministry

of  Community  Development registered  childcare  centres  is

104,000 and 43,992 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum academic qualifications of these

kindergarten teachers and childcare teachers are 3 `O'  level

credits,  including  English or the  Mother  Tongue  (for  MT

teachers).   For  a  childcare teacher,  he  or  she  has  to

successfully complete training in childcare recognised by MCD

at the intermediate level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2050 kindergarten teachers and 3767 childcare

teachers registered under MOE and MCD respectively, who  have

such minimum academic qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Steering Committee on pre-school education chaired by

Dr Aline Wong, Senior Minister of State for Education was set

up  in  November 1999 to oversee the necessary changes  which

will  help  to  raise the quality of pre-school education  in

Singapore.   This  Committee will look into teacher  training

and  also  review  the  guidelines for the  accreditation  of

training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For childcare centres, MCD has also developed guidelines

for diploma courses in early childhood care and education

(ECCE). The higher requirement was announced on 1st October

1999 to give the industry sufficient lead-time to prepare and

upgrade. The raising of childcare personnel's qualification

was widely welcomed by early childhood practitioners as it

recognised the importance of childcare personnel in the lives

of the young children in their care.

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION SCHEME OF SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  what is the rationale and special justification for  the

recent  upward  salary revision for the  teaching  profession

despite  the  current  need for wage restraint  in  both  the

public and private sectors; and (b) whether his Ministry  has

introduced  any new or innovative measures other than  salary

increases to enhance the status, working conditions  and  job

satisfaction of the more deserving school teachers so  as  to

attract the right individuals to join the teaching profession

as a long-term career.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions made to the Education Scheme of Service

since  1st  January 2000 was not a general  salary  revision.

Instead,  new  intermediate salary grades were added  to  the

scheme  of  service.   The  objective  was  to  improve   the

structure  of  the  service  to  allow  enhanced  promotional

opportunities  and more timely promotional  opportunities  to

improve retention.  These changes were part of civil service-wide  changes  to the structure of Division 1  services.  New

salary  grades were introduced for both the General Education

Officer  (GEO) and the Senior Education Officer (SEO)  salary

schemes.   Previously, classroom teachers were only  eligible

for  one promotion to the career grade of GEO 1A and GEO  2A.

With the new intermediate GEO salary grade, they now have  an

additional  promotion opportunity, ie, 2  promotions,  before

they  reach the career classroom teacher grade.  GEO officers

can also look forward to faster and earlier first promotions.

The  new  SEO  grade  was introduced to offer  better  salary

progression  in  the Upper Timescale levels  before  officers

reach the Superscale levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry agrees that we need to provide an overall

conducive  environment to help attract and  retain  teachers.

It  is  not  salaries  and promotions  alone  that  determine

retention  ability.  We have a strong focus on  training  and

development.   The  Ministry  encourages  and  supports   its

officers  to upgrade themselves professionally.  The National

Institute of Education has recently announced a comprehensive

framework  for continual training of teachers.  We have  also

implemented  various schemes such as the Study  Leave  Scheme

and  the  Professional  Development Leave  Scheme  to  enable

officers to upgrade themselves academically through full-time

graduate  and postgraduate programmes.  Financial  assistance

in the form of sponsorships, half-pay leave and interest-free

study  loans  are available.  Since 1998, an average  of  230

teachers  per year have been granted study leave to pursue  a

first degree or a Master's degree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, various awards have been instituted by

several organisations and the nation to recognise outstanding

teachers.   These  awards,  viz  the  Outstanding  Youth   in

Education  Award,  the  Caring Teacher Award,  the  Inspiring

Chinese  Language Teachers award and the pinnacle award,  the

President's  Award  for  Teachers -  are  reflective  of  the

community's recognition and nation's regard for the important

role that teachers play.  There is no greater affirmation for

our many dedicated teachers than when the community seeks  to

recognise their good work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also implemented several measures to alleviate

teachers'  workload.  These include the  creation  of  School

Administrator and Operations Manager posts at all schools  to

perform administrative support functions, the streamlining of

work procedures (e.g. payment of school fees by GIRO, central

issuing of student identification passes), and leveraging  on

IT to improve work efficiency.  Since 1998, MOE has allocated

more  than 1,500 additional teaching posts and more than  380

administrative and support posts to schools.
