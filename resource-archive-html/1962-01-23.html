<br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S. Ramasawamy (Bukit Merah), Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance - from 21st to 30th January, 1962.

<div align="center"><b>APPOINTMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS TO ADVISE ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether Government will consider the appointment  of

Constitutional experts of international  stature  to

advise  the  Government and the people of Singapore,

through  their representatives in the  Assembly,  on

Constitutional   aspects  of  the  proposed   closer

relationship with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, five eminent constitutional jurists

from  Britain, India, Pakistan, Australia and Canada

constituted the Commission which drafted the present

Constitution  of  the Federation of Malaya.  Several

other constitutional lawyers helped in the work.  It

is hoped that some of these lawyers, who are already

familiar  with  the Constitution,  may  be  able  to

advise  the  Government on how to enshrine  the  new

provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



in the Constitution of the Federation of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General is already in

correspondence   with  constitutional   lawyers   of

considerable experience and standing who  will  have

to  help  in  spelling out the amendments consequent

upon  the  heads  of agreement reached  between  the

Singapore and the Federation Governments. He is also

offering a contract to a parliamentary draftsman who

will  be able to assist him in the work of drafting.

If  any Member of the Assembly desires clarification

on  any constitutional matter consequent upon merger

between  Singapore and Malaya, the  Government  will

put  these  questions to the State  Advocate-General

who  can give his advice, if necessary, after taking

further    opinion   from   constitutional   experts

elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> May I ask the Prime

Minister  what  is  the  procedure  proposed - writing

directly  to  the  Prime Minister or  to  the  State

Advocate-General for that purpose with reference  to

queries from Assemblymen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I will be happy to

receive  any  letters  from  any  Members   of   the

Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>SUB-BRANCHES OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Number closed down and action taken to protect policy-holders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  how  many  sub-branches of  life  insurance

companies in Singapore whose head offices are in the

Federation of Malaya have closed down, or have  been

closed  down, from 1st December, 1961, to the latest

convenient  date; and what action he  has  taken  or

proposes   to  take  to  protect  the  policyholders

insured by these sub-branches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the following

Federation  life insurance companies have registered

branches in Singapore. I give both the names of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



the companies and the date of registration:



<pre>

Companies                           Date of

                                 Registration

Ban Chuan Pek Leng Co., Ltd          3-10-59

Billian Inusurance Co., Ltd         31-11-61

Fair Inusrance Co,. Ltd              11-9-61

Golden Wall Inusrance Co,. Ltd       18-9-61

Hup Cheong Inusrance Co., Ltd        16-8-61

Mah Peng Insurance Co., Ltd           6-5-61

Merdeka Inusrance Co., Ltd           23-6-61

Metro Enterprise Co., Ltd           10-10-61

Nothern Malaya Insurance Co,. Ltd   10-10-61

Peng Min Insurance Co., Ltd          18-9-59

Peh Sin Assurance Co., Ltd            4-8-61

Sinmah Insurance Co., Ltd            15-6-61

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this list, Members will note that nearly all

these  branches have commenced business in Singapore

in  the  latter half of last year, in addition,  the

following  insurance companies  have  recently  been

incorporated  in Singapore although they  have  also

been   doing  business  in  the  Federation.   These

companies with headquarters in Singapore are:

<pre>

Companies                           Date of

                                 Incorporation

Champion Assurance Co., Ltd.          9-10-61

Malayan National Life Insurance

   Co., Ltd.                         21-09-61

Tong Ah Assurance Co., Ltd.          20-09-61

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there may be other unregistered

branches  of  companies  doing  business  here.  The

Police are on the trail of some of these with a view

to prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general problem, the Singapore

Government  has  been for some time in  close  touch

with  the  Federation  Government  with  a  view  to

introducing   adequate   control   over    insurance

companies.  Legislation has already been  passed  in

the  Federation  which empowers  the  Government  to

close  down insurance companies which conduct  their

business in an improper way. Further legislation  is

in hand to empower the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



Government to wind up these companies and distribute

their  assets  to  policyholders. I understand  that

such  legislation will shortly be introduced in  the

Federation  Parliament on a Certificate of  Urgency.

The  Singapore  Government intends to  take  similar

action here, combining the two pieces of legislation

into   one.  I  have  been  assured  that   in   the

distribution  of the assests of these  companies  to

policy-holders,  there  will  be  no  discrimination

between policy-holders in Singapore and those in the

Federation  whether the company is  incorporated  in

one  territory or the other. I am informed, however,

that the mismanagement of several of these companies

has  been  so  bad that it is unlikely that  policy-holders  will get more than a portion of  the  money

they  have  put  in. Fortunately, however,  most  of

these   companies   have  only  recently   commenced

business  before  the  Federation  Government   took

action to deal with them. The probable loss of money

which  policy-holders may suffer has therefore  been

limited by the prompt action taken by the Federation

Government.  These  insurance  com  panics   receive

payments of small sums of money, usually between  $3

and  $12  per month per policy-holder. A $3  monthly

contribution  would entitle the policy-holder  to  a

sum of $400 on death or in ten years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most of the companies were incorporated in

the  Federation, the initiative in taking action  to

wind  up  these companies rests with the  Federation

Government. As I mentioned before, policy-holders in

Singapore  will  be  treated on the  same  basis  as

policy-holders in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, the two Governments intend to

introduce  full  and comprehensive legislation  over

the insurance business and there will be appointed a

Commissioner of Insurance which will take charge  of

a  pan-Malayan department with authority to  enforce

the  law  in  both territories. The present  set  of

insurance   laws  which  the  two  Governments   are

proposing  is only the first step in the control  of

the  insurance business. It is intended specifically

to combat the mushroom insurance companies which had

been springing up in recent months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I an very glad to know  that  the

Minister  for Finance has declared to this  I  louse

that  in  the  near  future the Government  will  be

introducing  legislation  to  protect  the   policy-holders.  But  as  far  as I know,  at  the  present

moment, there are many insurance company agents  who

have  wound  up their business. I want  to  ask  the

Minister  for Finance whether at the present  moment

legal  action can he taken against these  agents  to

recover the money paid by the policy-holders.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did say in

my answer to the question that the police are on the

trail of some of these companies  - those who have not

complied  with  the law as regards  registration  of

companies and the deposit of a sum of money with the

Attorney-General. Of course, when the  Ordinance  is

passed  here, we can un a sep further  and  wind  up

these   companies  and  distribute  whatever  assets

remain to policy-holders.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Under our insurance

laws,  before an insurance company can do  business,

certain  sums  of money have to be deposited.  Could

the Minister assure the House that these branches of

Federation companies which are carrying  on  or  had

been  carrying on business here have had those  sums

deposited under the law?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If these companies have

deposited  monies  with  the Federation  Government,

they  are not required to make a similar deposit  in

Singapore. But where they have not, then  they  must

do  so. But the trouble with these companies is  not

that  they  do  not  make these deposits  of  money.

Several  of them have deposited these sums of  money

and they are still in serious trouble. The reason is

that  they do not conduct insurance business in  the

proper  actuarial  way. Let me give  some  examples.

When  you  lake out a policy, you need not take  cut

one  on year own life. You can take out a policy  on

somebody else's life. Quite often, the policy-holder

will  say,  "This man may croak very  soon."  So  he

takes out a policy on this man, and if the man  dies

after nine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



months, he gets the capital sum. There is no  proper

medical   examination   which  reputable   insurance

companies carry out as a matter of course. The whole

system   under   which  these  so-called   insurance

companies  work  is rather similar  to  the  Chinese

benevolent  societies whereby you set aside  certain

small sums of money -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mutual aid.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, and then you get certain

benefits in the event of death either of yourself or

of  certain  persons  that  you  can  nominate.  But

whereas mutual aid societies are run on a non-profit

making  basis  by  people who get  together,  it  is

suspected  that many of these companies are  nothing

more  than downright swindles. In fact, the accounts

f  same of these companies have been examined by the

Federation   Government  end  they   show   a   most

intolerable  state of affairs. Fortunately  they  do

not  appear  to  have sold very expensive  policies;

also most of them have not been operating for a very

long  time.  So although damage has been  done,  the

damage is somewhat restricted.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Has the Minister considered some

means  of  advising the better intentioned of  these

companies who are seeking to meet the needs  of  the

poor  for  insurance, in order to assist them  to  a

stable financial policy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is very difficult for me to

meet  the  point  raised by the  Member  for  Anson,

because  the  full facts of this whole business  are

not  known. Only a number of cases have been brought

to  light,  either by complaints raised  by  policy-holders who want ta claim their capital assured  and

have  not  been  able  to do so,  or  complaints  by

agents,   and  preliminary  examinations  into   the

accounts  of  a few of these. If there  are  genuine

honest companies which attempt to meet a social need

and  are  run in a proper way, then I think when  we

come  across  such eases we shall see  what  can  be

done.  But  my view is that the manner in which  all

those businesses have been conducted shows, firstly,

that  there has been an inadequate understanding  of

the actual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



principles on which any insurance business should be

run,  and  secondly, the financiers behind  some  of

these  businesses  are persons of  doubtful  repute.

That, is  the  thing  that has been  troubling  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): if the policy-holders are not able to trace the insurance agents,

will  the Minister for Finance find it necessary  to

set up a commission to ensure that complaints can be

received  from such policy-holders as to the  amount

they  have  paid up, and as to how they can  recover

their paid-up money?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As far as the policy-holders of

the  companies are concerned, and as  far  as  these

policy-holders go, I think the only  remedy  is  for

the companies to be liquidated and for the assets to

be  distributed  in  fair  proportions  among  these

policy-holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards what the policy-holders should do in

future,  once  the  Insurance Bill  is  passed  then

everyone can rest assured that the premium rates  in

relation   to  benefits  which  insurance  companies

charge  are  both fair to those taking out  policies

and  sound  from the point of view of the  insurance

company  itself. I do not think it is  necessary  to

set up a Committee to advise policy-holders because,

in  this instance, I think many if not most of  them

have had their fingers burnt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, could the Minister assure the House

whether, in view of the fact that people of doubtful

character  are operating these insurance  companies,

he would take adequate steps under the existing laws

to  see  that no more of these companies  or  agents

from the Federation come to Singapore to operate  in

future as they have done previously?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have already said in my answer

that  we  shall  past  laws  similar  to  those  now

obtaining in the Federation and which the Federation

will  soon pass. This will provide effective control

on such companies.

<div align="center"><b>YAH LIN YAH KER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Permission to stage play)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs whether he is aware that permission to stage

the play Yah Lin Yah Ker was refused, and whether he

will give the reasons for the refusal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, permission to

stage  the play Yah Lin Yah Ker or Serenade  in  the

Coconut  Plantation was refused on the grounds  that

the  play encourages students to become involved  in

labour   strikes,  and  in  the  present  industrial

situation  its performance will be contrary  to  the

interests  of  the  State and of  the  students  who

should be concentrating on their studies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  far as I know, application for this play  to  be

staged  was made on 5th September last year  to  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs. It  was  only  on  13th

December  that the application was refused,  and  no

reason was given for such refusal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Minister has said just now, this

play,  as a matter of fact, is not the type that  is

described by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. What the Member can do is to

give  certain  facts leading up to  a  supplementary

question.  Let  us  have  a supplementary  question;

there can be no debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

ask the Minister for Home Affairs this: does he mean

that  when  students and workers are together,  they

are involved in industrial action?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The answer is no.

Secondary and Government-Aided Secondary Schools  as

at  30th  June, 1961, and 31St December,  1961;  how

many  of  them were employed as permanent  teachers;

how  many  of  them are still employed as  temporary

teachers; and how many of them had had their service

terminated and the reasons therefor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The number of second-batch

graduates of Nanyang University who were teaching in

schools:



<pre>



 As at 30th June, 1961:



   In Government schools         28

   In Aided schools              73

                                -----

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All appointments to posts of untrained Pass

graduate  teachers are temporary until the  graduate

obtains  his professional qualifications. Therefore,

to  the  question, "how many of the second-hatch  of

Nanyang   University  Graduates  were  employed   as

permanent teachers", the answer is "None" as all are

employed as temporary teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between June and December 1961, seven teachers had

resigned.  Only  one had had his service  terminated

for  two  reasons:  firstly, for failing  to  appear

before  the Public Service Commission for  interview

although  he  submitted  his  application,  and  the

second reason is for inefficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the

<div align="center"><b>ADMISSION TO UPPER SECONDARY I CLASSES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statistics)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how  many students were  in  the  Chinese

Secondary Four classes as at 31St December, 1961, in

all  schools; how many have been admitted  to  Upper

Secondary I classes in 1962; and how many have  been

refused admission and the reasons for non-admission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were

2,932 students in Chinese Secondary IV classes as at

31st  December, 1961, and as the admission to  Upper

Secondary I classes in the    Chinese medium  is  by

way  of  the School Secondary IV Examination  it  is

necessary  to state, first of all, that  the  number

who  have  passed  the  1961  School  Secondary   IV

Examination was 2,348. Of these, 2,080 students  (or

88  per  cent)  were admitted to Upper  Secondary  I

classes  as  at 13th January, 1962. No one  who  has

passed the School Secondary IV Examination has  been

refused  admission, although a small  number - 62 - were

unable  to get places in schools of their own choice

but  have been found places in other schools by  the

Ministry of Education. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, it

has been brought to my notice only this morning that

eight   students  who  passed  the  Adult  Education

Board's  internal  Secondary IV  examination,  after

having  been accepted for registration by the  Chung

Cheng  High  School for Upper Secondary  I  classes,

were  asked to leave on 20th instant, on the grounds

that  they  were not from regular schools,  although

they had already made their schools uniforms, bought

books,  and  paid  fees for the first  term.  It  is

regretted  that  the Principal of Chung  Cheng  High

School  should  have asked these students  to  leave

without first consulting with the Ministry. In these

circumstances,  I  wish  to  state  that  the  eight

students  concerned will be given  places  in  Upper

Secondary I classes

(18th January, 1962),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, taking cognizance of the heroic

struggle of the Indonesian people to liberate  Irian

Barat  from colonial rule, expresses admiration  for

the  determination  and courage  of  the  Indonesian

people and expresses full sympathy with their  hopes

and  aspirations,  and  calls  upon  the  people  of

Singapore to give their wholehearted support to  our

neighbours and friends, the people of Indonesia,  in

their  just and legitimate struggle against colonial

domination.". - (Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

before  the  adjournment last Friday, I spoke  about

the  positiveness  of the Government's  attitude  in

its  support of the Indonesian people's struggle  to

wrest  West Irian from the Dutch. Before  that,  Mr

Speaker,  I was greatly impressed by the  appeal  of

the  Member for Thomson which asked Members of  this

Assembly,  especially  the  Government,  to   debate

seriously  the motion before the House.  He  accused

the  Government of allegedly sneering or  ridiculing

this  motion.  The  Member also suggested  that  the

Government  is  belittling  the  struggle   of   the

Indonesian   people.   I   strongly   refute    this

allegation.  We,  the  Government,  have  constantly

given  our  wholehearted support to their  struggle.

We  view with grave concern the events taking  place

in  the  neighbouring country of Indonesia.  We  are

fully  conscious  of the fact that  developments  in

Indonesia  have  repercussions or reactions  in  our

country.  For that reason, we, the Government,  have

not   the  slightest  intention  to  disregard  this

motion  or not to give the respect that it deserves.

However,  our actual stand on this matter  has  been

twisted  by  Members  of the Barisan  Sosialis.  The

Member   for  Thomson  has  accused  us  of   having

insulted  and  affronted the  Indonesian  people  in

their  struggle to eradicate colonialism  from  West

Irian.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we view this accusation with concern because the object of the speeches made by the Barisan Sosialis

is to damage the good relationship between   the  Government  of

Indonesia   and   the Government  of  Singapore.  This  good

relationship already  existed, more particularly  so  during  the

time of the present Government. He also charged that

the Government had intimidated the people who put up

placards  or  posters in support of  the  Indonesian

struggle   against  Dutch  colonialism.   But,   Mr

Speaker,  in addition to what has already been  said

by  my  colleague, the Member for Ulu Pandan,  about

the work of putting up posters late at night, it  is

also  a  fact that they were put up in great numbers

bearing the symbol of the Barisan Sosialis. So  they

were putting up these posters in order to make known

the Barisan Sosialis to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our stand wholeheartedly in support of the struggle of the Indonesian people is not false. It is

positive. We support the struggle  in all  consciousness.

We  have  no  ulterior  motive. However, what we are surprised at,

Mr Speaker,  are the  tactics and the attitude of the mover  of  this

motion.  His  attitude, like  the  proverbial  Malay

saying, is just like a cock crowing. This means that

people  who  only  talk and find fault  merely  make

empty  noises,  and they fail to realise  their  own

mistakes. Mr Speaker, this attitude of the  Barisan

Sosialis astounds us. When we ridicule them,  we  do

not  direct it at Indonesia. We direct our  ridicule

or insult at the Members of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us recollect some of the past events and of the people who live in the Malay Archipelago,

or Temasek. Temasek is an old name  for Singapore. It has been

willed by God that people who are sincere and honest should have

been oppressed by the  Western colonialists who, because of

their lust and  greed,  succeeded in dividing the  people.  The

Western colonialists shared the spoils of the  Malay

Archipelago amongst the Dutch, the British  and  the

Americans.  Thus the Malay Archipelago  was  divided

into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



three spheres until the end of the Second World War.

Mr  Speaker,  God has also willed that  the  people

should  rise  in order to free themselves  from  the

yoke of colonialism. The Indonesian people woke  up.

They  declared their independence in  spite  of  the

sacrifices  which they had to make to achieve  their

independence.  Finally,  the  independence  of   the

Indonesian  people  was  recognised  by  the  world,

including  the Dutch. It was, however, decided  that

the problem of West Irian should be resolved through

negotiations.    American   colonialism    in    the

Philippines was uneasy. Finally, the Americans  also

gave  independence  to the Filipinos.  But  American

colonialism preferred to make an orderly retreat  to

being   forced   to   retreat.   Likewise,   British

colonialism   had  no  alternative   but   to   give

independence to the Malayan nationalists.  They  did

it  before  they  were ejected  forcibly.  For  that

reason,  Mr Speaker, it is our duty, as one  nation

in  the  Malay  Archipelago, to  be  united  in  our

efforts   to   wipe  out  colonialism.   Since   the

Philippines  has thrown away the yoke of colonialism

and  the  Indonesian people have  broken  away  from

colonialism,  we  will  not only  wipe  out  British

colonialism  here but will also wipe out colonialism

in the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the era of colonialism in Asia will definitely end. British colonialism is on its way out.

The  Dutch colonialists are adopting a  stone-headed attitude.

They forget Asian nationalism. They are  stubborn in wanting to

hold on to  West  Irian. For  that  reason, Mr Speaker, we  give them  this

warning. Although the cow is a weak animal,  we  get

milk  from  it.  It  is  also used  to  pull  carts.

Although it may not have horns, one day it will rise

and use all its energies to free itself. This is the

spirit  and the determination of the people  of  the

Malay Archipelago in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people of Malaya, especially in Malacca, were under the rule of the Dutch. I still remember, when

I  was in school,  a  history  book entitled "Hikayat Abdullah".

It was related in  this book how tyrannical the Dutch were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



towards  her  subject people. The Dutch colonialists

will pay heavily for this tyrannical attitude. Their

inhuman  action  took  the  form  of  torturing  and

burying  people alive. Some were tied and beaten  to

death.  Some  were hung to death.  There  were  many

other  inhuman  atrocities committed by  the  Dutch.

This  is  an  excerpt  from  history  to  show   the

atrocities  of  Dutch  colonialism,  especially   in

Malacca.  The  same  atrocities  were  committed  in

Indonesia. For instance, the name of Westerling will

remain  in  our memory, for he killed  thousands  of

innocent people in the Island of Celebes. Therefore,

when  we talk about colonialism in whatever form  it

is,  what  is  fresh in our mind are the  atrocities

which  the  colonialists committed on their  subject

peoples.  For  this reason, if there  are  among  us

those  who are satisfied or who are complacent  with

the  power given to us by the colonial powers,  they

are  only  the puppets of the colonial  power.  Only

stooges  are prepared to tolerate such  a  state  of

affairs.  This  clearly shows the attitude  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  when they moved  this  motion  of

merger  and  Malaysia. The Barisan Sosialis  opposed

merger  and  Malaysia. I think Mr  Speaker  himself

knows the position as well as I do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we recollect, since the West Irian issue could not be resolved through negotiations at the conference

table, how the Dutch then  tried  to offer self-government to West

Irian by changing  the name  of West Irian to Papua, and suggesting

a  flag for  Papua,  thereby  using  the  Papuans  as  their

stooges or puppets to support their action. It would

appear,  in  the words of the Minister for  Culture,

that if there were a Barisan Sosialis in West Irian,

they  would accept the Dutch plan, i.e., to  form  a

self-government under the auspices of  the  colonial

Dutch.  This  is clear from their stand  that  there

should  be  complete self-government for  Singapore,

rather  than  that Singapore should merge  with  the

Federation. Is this the type of people who  wish  to

support  the struggle of the Indonesian  people  for

the   return   of  West  Irian  to  the   Indonesian

Government? Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,   if  we  support  the  struggle   of   the

Indonesian people, it is not because our support  is

superfluous, or because we are anti-colonialists, or

to gain publicity and make political capital out of

this  in order to get political support. People  who

at  all times say, "I love you," are not genuine  in

their  love. It is false and has a sinister  motive.

Such  people make only empty promises. They  produce

only  noises,  but no results. In order  to  achieve

peace and happiness, we say frankly and openly  that

our  stand is that we love peace and justice. So  we

warn  the  Dutch to resolve this dispute peacefully,

surrender  West Irian to the Indonesian people,  and

leave Irian Barat in an orderly manner. All this  is

for the sake of world peace and harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wholeheartedly behind the people of

Indonesia.  The  spirit  and  determination  of  the

Indonesian  people are the same as ours. We  support

wholeheartedly  and  we give  our  sympathy  to  the

struggle  of the Indonesian people. Our  support  is

behind  the  Indonesian people  who  were  once  the

subject  people of the Dutch, because we are against

colonialism  in any kind or form. This anti-colonial

attitude  is embedded in our soul and in the  people

of Asia. For that reason, Mr Speaker, we are making

our  appeal in the interest of peace. If  we  hit  a

snake, we are going to make sure it is dead and that

the  stick  which we use to hit it is undamaged.  As

long as there is hope for negotiations, we must make

use  of  it. I also appeal to Members of the Barisan

Sosialis,  to go back to the main road if  they  are

lost  in  a cul-de-sac. I ask them not to  use  this

international  issue to make political  capital  and

gain  followers  in  the country  to  support  their

Party.  We  realise  that our people  are  comprised

mainly  of  anti-colonial people. But, as  has  been

mentioned by the Member for Geylang Serai,  although

they  can see the germs across the sea, they cannot

see  the elephant in front of their nose. So I  wish

to  appeal to the Barisan Sosialis not to dig  holes

because they will be buried in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



them. They should not always behave like a cock.  As

I  have said just now, the cock crows, but there  is

nothing in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that if we have been laughing at the motion which is being debated now, it is not because we wish to insult or show disrespect to the Indonesian people in their struggle. But what we are amused at are the tactics and behaviour of Members of the Barisan Sosialis when they speak on this motion. Once again, Mr Speaker, I wish to say that

we  wholeheartedly support the Indonesian people  in

their  struggle to wrest West Irian from  the  Dutch

colonialists.  We  have  not  lost  hope  that  this

dispute  may  be  settled peacefully.  This  is  our

stand.   Once   again   I  deny  categorically   the

accusation  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  that  we  are

treating this motion lightly.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, I

fully support the intention of the motion, but I  am

not  the same as the Barisan Sosialis who use filthy

mud to thrown before the people's eyes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today I would only like to make a point on this motion. We have heard the Member for Thomson say that

the P.A.P. has no sympathy with the Indonesian struggle to regain

West Irian, because  a number  of people have been detained for

questioning by the police for sticking up posters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> The same complain was made at

a rally organised by the Barisan Sosialis in support

of  West  Irian. I am surprised that the Member  for

Thomson  should have repeated this allegation  after

the  correction  made  in the  Government  statement

issued  on  13th January. I would like to  quote  to

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Straits Times  of  13th

January - this statement was issued by the Ministry of

Culture:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Ministry of Culture statement today said the

attempt  "to  mislead the listeners" could  only  be

deliberate,  as  the speakers well  knew  why  their

followers had been detained for questioning  by  the

police.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement said that in pasting posters all

over  the  place, including traffic  signs,  without

permission  from  the appropriate  authority,  these

people  were  deliberately breaching regulations  in

regard to the putting up of posters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the Barisan Sosialis leaders, as former

City  Councillors  and Assemblymen,  know  of  these

regulations.  The fact that these posters  were  put

up... late at night is further evidence that  these

people knew that they were breaching regulations,...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations existed to ensure that no mischievous

and  dangerous  posters were put up by irresponsible

people - such as racialists or Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were also necessary to ensure that there was

no  unauthorised  defacement  of  public  places  by

uncontrolled pasting of posters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting up posters without permission and under

cover  of  darkness, the Barisan  Sosialis  prowlers

quite  rightly invited the attention of  the  police

who  detained them for questioning and then released

them." the Government said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pointed out that there seemed to he a growing

impression  on  the  part of  some  members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis that they Were a privileged  group

to  whom the laws and regulations of the land should

not  apply and that any attempt to enforce obedience

of these regulations constituted injustice.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis could have

complied  with the simple regulations that a  permit

should  be obtained to put up posters. In any  case,

the  police  released those who put up  the  posters

once  the police were told that the posters were  in

support  of  the Indonesian struggle to regain  West

Irian. The police came suddenly upon people who were

putting up posters in the middle of the night.  Some

of  the  posters were in a language that the  police

did  not  understand. So they had  to  detain  these

people  for questioning. They had to make sure  that

the  posters  were not being put up  by  mischievous

people  for  mischievous ends. These  posters  could

have  incited people to violence or to racial hatred

pr  to  some other undesirable things. So was  there

anything  wrong  in  the  police  detaining  unknown

people   for  questioning?  Once  the  police   were

satisfied that the posters were in support  of  West

Irian,  they  let the bill-posters go,  even  though

they had breached the regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



But  let  me  ask the Barisan  Sosialis  and

others  not to break the law wilfully and, when  the

police  try  to  enforce the law, to  complain  that

there  is injustice and intimidation. Let them  also

not  use this as evidence that the Government is not

sympathetic to Indonesia over the West Irian  issue.

The  P.A.P. Government supported Indonesia over  the

West  Irian issue in a statement over two years ago.

It  has again declared its stand on the issue a  few

weeks ago in a statement in support of Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the P.A.P. support this motion

wholeheartedly, but we do so for different  reasons.

The  leader of the Barisan Sosialis at a mass  rally

on West Irian tried to draw suitable lessons for the

people  of  Singapore. For example,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  said  that  the

struggle    in   West   Irian   showed   that    the

constitutional struggle was useless. We say that, as

far  as  Singapore is concerned,  that  is  not  the

lesson.  We  have always said that  any  attempt  to

carry on the anti-colonial struggle by violence in a

multi-racial and multi-cultural society is to invite

disaster  for  the people. It is all  too  easy  for

political  leaders to talk bravely of  revolutionary

violence and incite people to violence. But, Sir, it

is  not the leaders who get hurt, injured or killed,

but  ordinary  people. The leader gives  orders  and

makes fierce speeches knowing full well that he will

not  get hurt or killed. I am not saying that  there

may  not be circumstances when force may have to  be

used in defence of one's rights, but we say there is

nothing  to  suggest that in the case  of  Singapore

there  is justification for using violence in  order

to  get  independence for Singapore. The leaders  of

the  Barisan Sosialis have given no good reasons why

we should use violence in Singapore to get freedom.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to anyone who has any

conscience  or realisation to want independence  and

to  hate oppression, he would surely give support to

the Indonesian Government in order to get rid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



of Dutch colonialism in West Irian. In the same way,

anywhere and at any place where people are oppressed

and colonialised, we for our part positively support

them wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, more than a year ago the P.A.P. had already shown sympathy for the Indonesian struggle to get rid of Dutch

colonialism in West Irian. This is   known  by  the  people  and

also  by  the   13 representatives of the Barisan Sosialis, and also

by the  leaders of the Barisan Sosialis who  have  gone

out  of  the P.A.P. In a fiery speech when he  moved

this motion, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the

Member for Queenstown, said that this House supports

the  struggle of the Indonesian people to take  back

West  Irian from the Dutch. He said that the Barisan

Sosialis had organised a mass rally in Geylang Serai

and  that  more than 10,000 people were  present.  I

would  like  to ask them why they held  a  rally  at

Geylang Serai. We know the reason why they have  not

got  the  support  of  the  Malays.  Therefore,  the

intention  of holding a mass rally at Geylang  Serai

was   to   draw  the  Malays  there  and  take   the

opportunity  of  influencing  them  to  support  the

Barisan Sosialis. There is a Malay saying: while  we

dive,  we drink. It is customary for the leaders  of

the Barisan Sosialis to find opportunities and adopt

tactics to confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we still remember when we

discussed  the  education policy the representatives

of  the  Barisan Sosialis only talked about  Chinese

education  and they did not talk about the education

of  others - not to mention Malay education.  In  this

motion  moved by the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,

the  Member  for Queenstown, we have the opportunity

of studying the irresponsible tactics of the Barisan

Sosialis to confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members of the Barisan Sosialis very often, talk very loudly in this Assembly that they have the support

of the people, that the P.A.P. has no more the confidence of the

people, that it is no more supported by them, that it is better

for the P.A.P. to resign and hold general elections. I would

like   to  state  to  the  Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  who  are sitting on the Opposition,  that

they have not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



elected  on the Barisan Sosialis ticket but  on  the

Petir   ticket.  Let  the  Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis resign and determine their own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the conflict between the Indonesians and the

Dutch  on  West  Irian, the Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  talked  loudly in  the  rally  at  Geylang

Serai, and in this Assembly they said they wanted to

liquidate  Dutch  colonialism  in  West  Irian.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  opposed  merger  but  suddenly  a

number  of  their  leaders  communicated  with   the

British Government's representative in Singapore. Is

this  their  way to indicate their wish to  liberate

the  people  from British colonialism in  Singapore?

They  would  rather  the  British  rule  this  place

longer,  and  it  is possible that they  would  have

guarantees for the future of their leaders  and  not

of  the people. These are the tactics of the Barisan

Sosialis in order to get the support of the  people.

We  can study their irresponsible tactics to confuse

the  people as a result of the motion moved  in  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queens-town put up his hands at the rally at Geylang Serai and said, "Let us get rid of

colonialism." I would like to ask him, since when had he

struggled against colonialism  and opposed  capitalists and

imperialists, and how  many times has he gone to jail? He was

only known to  the

people when he joined the P.A.P. The people now know

better  that  the  Member  for  Queenstown   is   an

instrument  of  the Barisan Sosialis which  embraces

Communism.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

question of West Irian seems to me too serious to be

made  the subject of local party politics. It  seems

to  me  also  that this is not the  time  for  fiery

language  but  for a cool head, a calm  mind  and  a

steady heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances surrounding West Irian are not

yet  unfavourable for a peaceful solution. Even  the

President   of   the  Republic  of  Indonesia,   Dr

Soekarno, has said that the door is still open for a

peaceful  settlement,  and the Secretary-General  of

the  United Nations is making an all-out  effort  to

find a solution. Under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



the  circumstances, it does not seem proper that  we

in  this  House should try to incite any  particular

Party in the dispute to precipitate action. For what

is at stake, Sir, is not merely a piece of territory

but the question of world peace or world war. We  in

Singapore  have been through a world  war  and  have

suffered the horrors of an enemy occupation. We know

that  when there is a world conflagration the people

who  suffer most are very often the innocent people.

Therefore, before we incite the parties concerned to

serious  military  action,  we  should  support  the

efforts  of  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United

Nations   and  the  good  intentions  of   President

Soekarno  to  keep  the door of peaceful  settlement

open  and  contribute our bit to finding a  solution

towards world peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of colonialism, we have said

again  and  again here in this House  that  all  the

Parties represented here are against colonialism. We

know that colonialism is an anachronism in this part

of  the  world. It is no longer and should no longer

be   an  issue.  The  question  is,  how  soon   can

colonialism  be  removed from  South-East  Asia?  We

believe that it can be made to retire gracefully, as

the  British are about to do. We are seeing it, Sir;

we  have  seen  it  in Malaya; we have  seen  it  in

Malaysia; and there is no doubt that we shall see it

in  the  case of West Irian, provided the people  do

not incite the participants concerned to unnecessary

conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, we should not make anti-colonialism

a  platform  to discriminate between one  Party  and

another  Party.  It  seems  to  be  the  fashion  to

indicate  that  one Party is more anti-colonialistic

than  another  Party, and the people  are  asked  to

judge  the  degree of incitement or  firey  language

being  used. I believe that it all depends on  their

convictions.  Today  we all agree  that  colonialism

should  be  removed. The question is  how  soon  and

whether  by violence or by peaceful means. It  seems

we  have come to the stage where the colonial powers

know  that if they can retreat gracefully, they  can

salvage something from the wreck.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we therefore appeal to the Barisan Sosialis

Members  not to keep on drawing the line that  there

are  Parties which are more against colonialism  and

others  which are less against colonialism,  because

we  are  all agreed on that issue. Today  we  should

really try our best to help Asians in the world find

a peaceful solution to all their difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as

the  motion moved by the Member for Queenstown seeks

to give expression to the solidarity of all the once

subject  peoples of Asia and Africa against  Western

imperialist domination, no Afro-Asian nationalist in

his  right  mind  will give this motion  other  than

unqualified  support.  For 400  years  the  European

powers carved out the territories of Asia and Africa

and  exploited  the natural and human  resources  of

their  colonial  empires. No historian  of  economic

history  has  attempted to deny that the  industrial

revolution of the countries of Europe was, in  large

measure,  due  to  the  capital  accumulation   made

possible  by  the large surpluses drawn  from  their

colonial  possessions. Even America,  a  country  at

present with the world's highest standard of living,

owes  its  wealth to the tremendous human sacrifices

which  the  negro  slaves, taken  out  from  Africa,

laboured  to  produce for the Americans of  European

descent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep and abiding hatred for the injustices and

iniquities  of  the colonial system aroused  by  the

domination  of the European peoples over the  Asians

and  Africans became an irresistible force after the

end  of  the  Second  World War.  Those  imperialist

powers who have yielded and bent to the will of  the

nationalists have fared better than those  who  have

sought  to suppress and continue to subjugate  their

peoples. Although the Portuguese looked like winning

the  first  prize  for obstinacy and  obtuseness  in

refusing  to  recognize that the  days  of  European

empires in Africa and Asia are over, that is not  to

say that any Asian or African will easily forget the

brutalities of the French in Algeria or the Dutch in

Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to Indonesia in January 1960, I could

well  understand the ferocity and intensity  of  the

hatred  of the Indonesians for the Dutch. The  Dutch

had  sucked  the wealthy Indonesia Archipelago  dry.

They  had  squeezed everything they could have  from

the  then Netherlands East Indies for the enrichment

of the Dutch and their country in Europe. They had a

head tax or a capitation tax on all natives for  the

privilege  of  being alive, not for the  purpose  of

educating  the  natives  but  for  the  purpose   of

enriching the Dutch. The local population  was  kept

down to the position of serfs and slaves. A Javanese

servant was so crushed and dispirited an animal that

he  crawled every time he passed the master  of  the

household. And no Javanese was good enough to be  an

administrator  in his own country.  The  postmaster,

and  sometimes even the assistant postmaster, was  a

Dutchman.  And  so the end of Dutch rule  came  with

much bitterness, hatred and vengeance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one day some Afro-Asian historian will

write and  analyse history from the  purely  Afro-Asian  point of view and equate the skilful  running

of  an  empire with the smooth and rapid dismantling

of  it. Those countries which ran their empires  and

squeezed the riches of the colonies not to the point

of  utter sterility were usually wise enough to know

when it was time to make a graceful withdrawal. When

the  British left India and Pakistan in  1947,  they

had  moved  billions of crores of  rupees  worth  of

wealth  from the soil of India created by the  sweat

of  the  Indian people for over 300 years. But  they

did  leave  behind a coterie of well-trained  Indian

administrators in the Indian Civil Service,  trained

and    able   Indian   judges,   teachers   in   the

Universities, and an incorrupt and disciplined army.

True,  the army was made use of as cannon fodder  in

two  world  wars, but at least there was a  coherent

fighting force of nearly half a million men  with  a

core of able Indian officers from the subahdar-major

to the major-general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Dutch were pitch-forked out of

Indonesia in 1949, they had ruined the country  even

more  than the Japanese had done during the 3½ years

of  Japanese  occupation. There were  no  Indonesian

administrators, no technicians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



and no apparatus to run the wherewithal  of  a

modern  State.  The bitterness and hatred  have  not

worn off. I was not surprised to find, when I was in

Indonesia in January 1960, that the deep and abiding

hatred had eaten into the soul of the nation, partly

by the selfish and greedy Dutch industrial combines,

partly  by  the  arrogance and  superciliousness  of

Dutch  officials and the Dutch people towards  their

former  subjects; and last but not least,  by  their

stupidity in clinging on to West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as this motion seeks to give expression

to  the  hatred that all subject peoples  must  feel

strongly  against  Western  imperialist  domination,

particularly   in  the  case  of  the   intransigent

Dutchmen, we give our solid wholehearted support. At

the end of my visit to Indonesia in January 1960,  I

signed a declaration jointly with the First Minister

of  the  Republic  of Indonesia, Dr  Djuanda.  This

declaration  included a statement  of  our  attitude

towards the West Irian issue. May I quote, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Singapore fully supports the

Indonesian struggle for the return of West Irian  to

the  territorial  jurisdiction of  the  Republic  of

Indonesia.  The Singapore Government  expresses  the

hope  that  the West Irian question will be  settled

peacefully soon.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my quarrel with the Barisan Sosialis is that

their intention in moving this motion is not to give

expression  to the solidarity of the former  subject

peoples of Asia and Africa. Their whole object is to

play  party politics over a great national issue  of

our  neighbour, to play Communist politics over  the

struggle of subject peoples seeking freedom.  Theirs

is the cynical philosophy of utilising every current

political movement, every strong political force, by

associating themselves with the high ideals  of  the

strong  nationalist movements and forces and  hoping

thereby  insidiously to pervert these  movements  to

the Communist cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years since 1945 saw the expulsion of European

empires from Asia. The years after 1957, when  Ghana

got  her  independence,  saw  the  European  nations

kicked  out  of Africa. All this had nothing  to  do

with  Communism. It was the desire of men to be free

and to be rid of domination by another race,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



a  desire  which  is as old as history  itself.  But

listening to the diatribes of the Communists through

the  Barisan Sosialis, one might be led  to  believe

that   it   was  they  who  started  the  liberation

movements,  the movements for freedom of the  former

colonial   peoples   of  Asia   and   Africa.   They

conveniently forgot the fact that it is  nationalism

and  not  Communism which gave the driving force  to

freedom  movements throughout Asia  and  Africa.  To

them,  in  their cynicism, this desire  for  freedom

offers  a magnificent opportunity to use and pervert

it  for  their  own  objective  of  world  Communist

domination.  But  because they know  that  Communism

will not invoke enthusiasm in the subject countries

of  Asia and Africa in the way that the desire to be

free  from  domination of colonialism has  done,  so

they   have  hidden  behind  the  slogan  of   anti-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nationalist hates colonialism because he loves

independence. He wants his countrymen to be free and

to  run  their  own  country. He is anti-colonialist

because  he  loves  nationalism  and  freedom.   The

Communist  does not love nationalism or  freedom  in

the  sense  that the mass of nationalists throughout

Afro-Asia   understand  it.  He  hates   colonialism

because   he   wants  to  establish  the   Communist

millennium   which   he   believes   can   only   be

accomplished by the dictatorship of the  proletariat

led  by  the  cadres in the steel framework  of  the

Communist combat party. And because the mass of  the

people  are nationalists, not Communists,  he  hides

the  fact  that  he is a Communist by talking  about

anti-colonialism.  But unlike the  nationalist,  the

Communist does not end his anti-colonialism with the

achievement  of independence. He cannot  afford  to,

because  with  the  achievement of independence  the

majority of the people who are nationalists want  to

start  building up their independent nation  into  a

modem  State  with all the sinews of  an  industrial

society. The Communist anti-colonialist fears  this,

and  rather  than  come out and say  that  he  is  a

Communist  and  therefore does not  believe  in  the

nationalist  solution  in  trying  to  build  up   a

national State, he says the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



anti-colonial  struggle is not  over.  He  keeps  on

asking everybody to go on fighting authority in  the

name  of  anti-colonialism, hoping that out  of  the

anarchy and economic chaos that will result, he will

be  able  to assume power and establish a  Communist

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Member for Thomson, if not now in

this   House,  then  at  a  subsequent  time,  after

consultation  with  his  colleagues,  not  in   this

Assembly,  but possibly in the Opposition  Committee

Room, the following questions. After West Irian  has

been  returned to Indonesia, will they say that  the

Indonesian   people  have  completed   their   anti-colonialist  struggle? Are they  prepared  to  admit

that   the   Federation  of  Malaya  is   free   and

independent? Are they going to admit that the  anti-colonial  phase is over after independence and  that

the time has come to settle what kind of independent

country  Malaya  should be? The Communists  are  now

still fighting in Malaya. In the same way after West

Irian, the anti-colonial struggle for the Communists

will  have to go on and on and on, because  in  that

way  they  hope to conceal their desire to carry  on

their   struggle  for  Communism  by   using   anti-colonialism  as  the  camouflage  and  avoid   being

isolated as Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is clear in the speech of the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis when he spoke at a

specially  sponsored  mass  rally  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis at Geylang Serai. He was reported  to  have

made,   without  any  subsequent  denials,   several

significant  statements.  First,  may  I  quote  the

Straits Times of 8th January, page 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We realise that the moment is coming when we too

will  receive  the support and help of  other  peace

loving people to free us from colonial domination.'



<br><br>Sir, who are these peace loving people? Does he mean

the  U.S.A. and the Western imperialist  countries?

Surely  not.  They,  are  war-mongering  imperialist

colonialists.  Does  he mean the decadent  bourgeois

nationalists or neutralist States? Surely  not.  Can

he  mean  the  Russians and the Communist  blocs  of

peace loving people whose intense and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



passionate desire for peace led them to explode  the

90  megaton  bomb?  And he went on  to  say  in  the

Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism cannot be ended by any form of

constitutional imposition, and all should have their

eyes open who imagine that they can end all forms of

colonial exploitation of the Borneo people simply by

having merger.'



<br><br>Sir,  the Chinese report of this speech is even more

interesting. The Secretary-General spoke in  Chinese

and  the  Sin  Chew Jit Poh on the  8th  of  January

reports  him as differentiating between the  warlike

Western  countries, the neutral  countries  and  the

peace  loving  countries. As there  are  only  three

power blocs in the world, there can be little doubt,

reading  the  Chinese Press, who are the  people  he

refers to when he talks of peace loving people. Sir,

I  do  not want to have an unnecessary argument with

Members   of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   over   my   -interpretation of what is quoted here. I will  leave

it  to  the interpreter to put it in his own  words.

What  he  said, Sir, was as follows. These are  just

the words and phrases used for interpretation by the

interpreter as such. I will give -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister will also give his

interpretation.  Then  he  is  within  the  Standing

Orders; otherwise lie is not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly, Sir. If I were to

give  only my own interpretation, it might  be  said

that I have not correctly transposed the meaning  of

the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is a little technical

difficulty about the interpreter interpreting. So if

the  Prime Minister will read in Chinese,  and  then

pause,  I  will switch on to the interpreters,  then

the   interpreters   will   have   some   time    in

interpreting. There must be another pause before the

Prime Minister gives his own interpretation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly, Mr Speaker, Sir.

This  is  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 8th  January,

Singapore, at Page 1. This is about Indonesia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter's interpretation):</b> `The anti-colonial

struggle is not completed.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister's interpretation):</b> `The Indonesian

people's   struggle  against  colonialism   is   not

completed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `And Indonesia was formerly the

Dutch Netherlands East Indies!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `Indonesia is the former

Archipelago of the Netherlands East Indies.'



<br><br>This  is  the  basis on which the  Barisan  Sosialis

supports the claim of Indonesia over West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `In South-East Asia peace is ever

increasing from day to day.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `In South-East Asia from day to

day, peace is increasing.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `The Western world in Vietnam, Laos

and  South Korea, the puppets are finding  more  and

more difficulty now.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `The Western powers in South

Vietnam, Laos and South Korea - the stooges of Western

powers  -in these territories are meeting  more  and

more difficulties.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `The Western world and the pro-colonialist countries are afraid and they are

dissatisfied   with  the  neutral  and   independent

countries  and  peace  loving  countries  for  their

influence in this area.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `The Western powers and the pro-colonialist countries are afraid and are not

satisfied with the independent neutral countries and

the  peaceful countries whose influence is  in  this

region.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important. There is a clear

distinction - three blocs. The Western  countries  and

the pro-colonialist countries. I do not know who  is

meant. He has named them: South Vietnam, South Korea

and  Laos. I think certain inhibitions prevent  them

from  adding a few more in their desire to  avoid  a

counter  attack.  Then  he goes  on  and  says  that

independent countries - neutralist stand (chun li). No

mention  of the Federation of Malaya, Sir,  although

it has declared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



its clear independent, neutral stand with regard  to

West Irian. No praise is due to the Federation.  And

the peace loving countries? Who else would the peace

loving  countries mean? Then they went on  to  great

praises of President Soekarno. Mr Lim Ching Siong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `The people of Indonesia are not

cowards.  They are the strongest - like the people  of

Indonesia.  So  far no President has already  stated

this point.'



<br><br>Here  is  a friendly gesture by the Barisan Sosialis

to friendly neighbours!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `The Indonesian leaders are not

cowards.  They  are  strong people,  just  like  the

Indonesian   people.  And  President  Soekarno   has

already made clear this point.'



<br><br>Sir,  if we must give credit - and certainly I am  all

in   favour   from  time  to  time   of   exchanging

compliments    with    friendly    and     important

neighbours - it   seems  to  me  by   an   intentional

ommission of a certain even closer neighbour  and  a

more  important  leader, certain adverse  inferences

have  been implied. However, perhaps they think  the

Federation Government does not read Chinese, and all

this  might be forgotten. This is the philosophy  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis, through the  Communist  open

front leader - Mr Lim Chin Siong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `Colonialism cannot depend on any

control  or  cannot  be ended by any  constitutional

means.'



<br><br>This  is  a very important point. I did not want  to

have  this  misinterpreted by me.  As  I  heard  the

interpreter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism cannot be ended by any constitutional

means.'



<br><br>This is the basic philosophy. And I did not know why

the  Member  for  Thomson was equivocating  when  we

asked  him  what  he  meant by the  policy  of  open

confrontation  of force. But then  the  Member  for

Thomson does not read the Chinese papers. So he  can

perhaps  be excused of the fiercer line being  taken

by  the  Secretary-General. Then he talks about  the

strength of progressive forces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `The progressive forces, some

people are of the opinion that b) going through  the

Malaysia plan they will be able to help the  Bornean

people to end all sorts of exploitation in any form.

This  incident should be able to serve  as  an  eye-opener. The people in these territories must  decide

for  themselves  and make their own  claims.  It  is

useless  to  go by constitutional means. The  people

have  been  given up to the pro-Western  people  and

controlled  by them. This will not be  able  to  get

freedom for the people themselves.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the sort of statement that explains the

whole  philosophy  of the Barisan Sosialis  and  the

Communists.  Let me give my version of  this.  There

are  people who think that through Malaysia they can

end all the various forms of colonial exploitation in  the  Borneo  territories,  and  this  happening,

namely,  in West Irian, should awaken them and  open

their  eyes.  These things must be  settled  by  the

people  and their demands themselves. The  plan - this

is  to  be  fair  to  the Secretary-General  of  the

Barisan Sosialis - I would like to read again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `It is useless attempting to play

with constitutional means.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `For anybody with the intention

to  play around with the constitution is a waste  of

time.  The people who are handed over to the control

of pro-Western leaders cannot get freedom.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important statement of political

belief.  If  the leader of a country is pro-Western,

in other words, he does not take the Moscow line or

the line of the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandoeng or

in Cairo or in Belgrade, then he is pro-Western, and

handing over power to any group of men who are  pro-Western cannot bring freedom. That is a very strange

proposition. Sir, I am not defending the  policy  or

the  approach of countries in Asia and Africa  which

maintain good relations with the West. Every country

and  its  people have the right to choose their  own

leaders who decide on their own policy. But  I  say,

to  tell the people who have popularly voted  for  a

government whose policy is based on friendship  with

the West, that by that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



relationship such countries cannot have  freedom  is

to spout a straightforward Communist line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 22nd Congress in Moscow has clearly demarcated

the  world  into three blocs - the Communist  bloc  of

progressive   nations,  the  Imperialist   bloc   of

capitalist nations which must be destroyed, and  the

in-between   bloc   of  national  bourgeois   States - Nehru's India, Soekarno's Indonesia, Nasser's Egypt

and so on. But, of course, not U.M.N.O.'s Federation

of  Malaya.  According to that thesis, espoused  and

explained  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  it  is   the

colonialist  stooge line. Therefore, freedom  is  an

utter mockery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `We have nothing to be afraid of.

All   the  progressive  forces  in  the  world   are

expanding  and  this fact makes our  job  very  much

easier.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `We have nothing to be afraid

of.  The  development of progressive forces  in  the

world makes our duty so much easier.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time they are in difficulty they talk about

progressive forces advancing in the world while they

go downhill. I do not know how long they can keep on

consoling their followers who have to suffer for the

blunders    and   stupidities   of   immature    and

inexperienced  leaders.  But  they  always   console

themselves. I have heard it so often, Sir - I have had

7  years.  Since 1954, we have been  with  them  and

every time they make a major error, we tell them not

to  do  certain stupid things; they get into trouble

for  doing it; they keep on saying having the  world

progressive forces on their side. And then  he  ends

up his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Interpreter):</b> `We are all peace loving, but let

us  see  clearly for ourselves that we love  freedom

all the more.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Prime Minister):</b> `Everybody loves peace, but let

everybody  see  clearly  we  [namely,  the   Barisan

Sosialis,  I  take it, because the  words  used  for

"everybody" are Ta Chia; but then they say  Wo  Men,

that  means "We Barisan Sosialis" and the  crowd  is

excluded;  Ta  Chia means "We" where  the  crowd  is

included] love freedom even more.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean, Sir? Why does the Member for

Thomson  bother  to  try and apologetically  pretend

that  they  love  parliamentary  democracy  and  the

constitutional  forms of struggle and constitutional

advance,  when everyday this philosophy of  violence

and   the  inevitability  of  world  revolution   is

preached?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson declared that I had lost my

anti-colonial fervour, and he asked  me  to  go  and

find  it  back.  With  your  kind  permission,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I was able to ask him where he thought

I had lost it, and he said in the Colonial Office in

London.  I have been wondering whether it  is  worth

while  writing to the Colonial Office in  London  to

find  out  if  I had dropped anything there.  But  I

refrain  from doing such an irrational thing because

I  came back from the Colonial Office in June  1958,

and  at  that time the Member for Thomson was  quite

happy;  he was convinced that I had the right degree

of  anti-colonial  fervour and he was  working  very

hard  with  me  together  in  the  unions  competing

against  the  Communist cadres  throughout  all  the

years  since  June 1958 to September  1960  when  he

decided to go over to the other side. Sir, can it be

that  after he has gone over, when he talks of anti-colonialism, he really means pro-Communism and  that

my honest brand of anti-colonialism, which means pro-nationalism, is no longer admired by him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought he made a singularly unhappy

speech,  but then he had a singularly unhappy  task.

He  tried  to  show why the desire to liberate  West

Irian  and to integrate it with Indonesia  is  anti-colonialism.  But  the desire to liberate  Singapore

and  the  three Borneo territories and to  integrate

them with Malaya in a Federation of Malaysia is  not

anti-colonialism.  Then he gave a  whole  series  of

excuses. Perhaps I should be fair to him. His Brains

Trust closeted in the Opposition Committee Room have

brought  out a whole series of excuses  to  try  and

show why West Irian is different from Malaysia.  The

curious  thing about this Brain Trust is that  since

they  moved over from this side of the House in  the

Committee   Room  to  a  far-away  corner   in   the

Opposition Committee Room -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must explain that

the removal was at the direction of the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

have  no  doubt that the proprieties of the transfer

of  tenancy  were  duly observed  by  you.  But  the

curious  thing is that, ever since they  began  this

meeting  in  January, the Brains Trust  have  become

very shy, and they do not come to the C.P.A. Room to

talk  and converse with us. I do not know if  it  is

because  they realise that they have got the plague,

and,  in  decency and humanity, they  want  to  keep

their  malady  to themselves. But the fact  is  that

people  like  Messrs. Sandra Woodhull, Dr  Poh  Soo

Kai,  Dr Lim Hock Siew have avoided us and  abjured

the  alcoholic conviviality which gave them so  much

temporary euphoria and solace during our meeting  in

November  and  December. Only Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong

occasionally turned up to exchange pleasantries with

us.  I do not know what has overtaken them, but  the

jollity is gone; and, alas, they are so morose  that

they  have hidden themselves in the secrecy of their

special  Committee  Room. But let  me  read  to  the

Member  for  Thomson what his Secretary-General  has

said in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. I will read this first

in  English,  Sir, and then I will read the  Chinese

text:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The struggle of the Indonesian people against

colonialism  is not finished. The Dutch must  return

to  Indonesia all the islands which once constituted

the former Dutch East Indies.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basis of the Barisan Sosialis support

for West Irian. The Secretary-General of the Barisan

Sosialis explained that West Irian belonged  to  the

Dutch  East  Indies, that Indonesia is the  rightful

successor  of  the Dutch East Indies, and  that  the

whole  empire  must be given up to  the  nationalist

heir   and   successor,  namely,  the  Republic   of

Indonesia;  and  he, Mr Lim Ching Siong,  the  most

important open front Communist leader, has logically

denounced  that  all this talk of self-determination

in  West Irian and the giving of self-government  to

Papuans in West Irian is so much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



prevarication  and  duplicity on  the  part  of  the

wicked Dutch colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have summarised it in one short

paragraph - about  three paragraphs in  Chinese - and  I

lay  it upon the Table for the interpreter to  spell

it out in Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the same way, we expect them to dismiss as

utter rubbish any British talk of self-determination

for  a  few  hundred thousand people in  the  Borneo

territories.  As  far  as  I  can  see,   the   only

difference  is  that, unlike the  stubborn  and  the

stupid   Dutch  who  insist  on  talking  of   self-determination  for  a few hundred thousand  Papuans,

the   British  are  sensible  enough  to  know   the

absurdity of making such excuses and are yielding to

the   logic  and  the  relentless  pressure  of  the

nationalist solidarity for Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I cannot understand is how a troupe of

dialectical jugglers can get themselves into such an

absurd position where they support the anti-colonial

struggle for the liberation of West Irian, and hence

denounce  the hypocrisy of the Dutch in  talking  of

self-determination for the Papuans, and, at the same

time,  support the same anti-colonial nonsense about

self-determination for a few hundred thousand people

in  the Borneo territories when the whole desire  of

the people of Malaysia is to be free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson tried to explain this

in  several  ways. He said that the British  support

Malaysia  and  that  the Dutch  oppose  West  Irian.

Therefore,   one  is  pro-colonialist  because   the

colonialists  support it, and  the  other  is  anti-colonialist  because the colonialists oppose  it.  I

asked  him, therefore, whether if the British oppose

Malaysia he would support it, because then it  would

become, by his reasoning, an anti-colonial issue. He

was  not able to give me a reply but he promised  me

one  when  the Malaysia debate comes on. Sir,  I  am

sorry  that  from  time to time I have  to  ask  the

Member   for  Thomson  embarrassing  questions,   so

embarrassing that he has absented himself from  this

Chamber. But it seems to me that whether an issue is

anti-colonial  or not depends not upon  whether  the

colonialists stupidly oppose it, or wisely, in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



own  self  interest, support it. A  stupid  colonial

power   opposes  any  form  of  withdrawal  of   his

imperialist position. Was the Member for Thomson  in

his right mind when he suggested that this should be

the  yardstick,  whether a nationalist  movement  is

anti-colonial   or   not?  Did   he   suggest   that

nationalism should be measured not by the desire  of

a   people  to  liberate  every  portion  of   their

territory  but  by  whether or not  the  imperialist

power yields? And if it does, then it cannot be anti-colonialist, because the colonialists have  yielded.

Therefore,  as a corollary, the Member  for  Thomson

suggested  that  any plan supported by  the  British

must be pro-colonialists. So I asked him whether the

plan  to integrate the three Borneo territories into

a  Federation  of Borneo is a colonialist  plan.  It

must  be because, according to him, a plan supported

by  the  colonialists is colonial. He had difficulty

in  answering  that question about the  West  Borneo

Federation because it was the British who  sponsored

the  scheme and it has been reported to be supported

by   one  of  the  few  non-Communist  anti-colonial

Parties   in  the  Borneo  territories   which   has

relations  with the Barisan Sosialis, namely,  Party

Ra'akyat   of  Brunei.  The  President  has   warmly

supported  this plan of the Borneo Federation  which

is  a colonialist plan because the British sponsored

and  supported  it. But was the Member  for  Thomson

suggesting   that  Inche  Azahari   is   thereby   a

colonialist stooge for supporting a colonialist plan

long  after the colonialists have abandoned it? Sir,

he  then  said that West Irian is the  wish  of  the

people  of  Indonesia including the people  of  West

Irian.  Sir, how did he know this? Did he  not  know

that Malaysia is strongly supported by the people of

our  five  territories?  After  he  went  at  public

expense to Borneo. We allowed him to go, but he  has

not  been to West Irian, although I have assured the

House  the other day that if he volunteers  for  its

liberation, although as a Government we will not  be

able to pay for his passage, as a Party we will  pay

for it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> One-way ticket!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And if he believed that the

claim  is  supported  by the  West  Irianians,  then

surely  he was in fact advocating that there  should

be  acceptance  of the colonialist proposition  that

the  Papuans or West Irianians or West Irians should

decide   whether  or  not  they  should  come   into

Indonesia. But then no nationalist in his right mind

concedes to such colonialist nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to say that whether or not the

desire  to  complete  the  liberation  of  a  former

empire,  a part of which is still under subjugation,

is  anti-colonialism depends upon whether the people

resisted it at the time of separation. He said  that

the Dutch were resisted by the Indonesians when they

separated West Irian. This is a strange thing  about

the  Barisan Sosialis - whenever they deal with people

whom  they think they can eat up, they denounce  and

abuse  them  in vicious terms, name them by  vicious

and  vile  epithets. But when they deal with  people

whom  they feel they are an unequal match for,  they

begin  to  talk in innuendoes; they have  an  unholy

fear of talking direct. As the people in high places

supported  the  separation  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation and of the Borneo territories when Malaya

was  allowed  to become independent.  Sir,  does  he

seriously  suggest that whether an  issue  is  anti-colonial  or otherwise depends upon whether  when  a

portion   of  the  territory  is  allowed  to   gain

independence, people in high places protest  at  the

continued   subjugation  of  other  parts   of   the

territory?  In  other  words, it  depends  upon  the

accident of the actions of people in high places  at

the  time  of separation, and not upon the intrinsic

qualities  of  an anti-colonialist situation.  I  am

surprised that the Member for Thomson, who  is  such

an  avid  student  of  dialectical  materialism  and

socialist realism, should be led to propound such  a

subjective and not an objective theory, of sizing up

whether  or  not the movement is anti-colonial.  The

Member for Thomson said that it does not depend upon

whether  West  Irian is really a part of  Indonesia,

which  is  quite  contrary to  what  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  as  I  read  in

Chinese, said in Geylang Serai, but that it  depends

upon whether President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Soekarno  opposes it or whether the Tunku  does  not

oppose it. Since President Soekarno opposes it, that

is    anti-colonialism,   but   since   the    Tunku

acquiesces - people in high places, Sir,I do not know

whether the Member for Thomson is likely to pass his

Tenderfoot Badge when he applies to be promoted from

just  a  sympathiser to a proper arid regular member

of the organisation. But if he keeps on talking like

that,  I can assure him that he will fail the  first

elementary  examination in dialectical  materialism.

Then  he  said that West Irian is different  because

the  Dutch retained it by force. These were all  his

words.  They were reported in the Straits Times.  We

heard  it  in  this  House. I  listened  with  great

astonishment to the ingenuity of the Brains Trust in

trying  to  say,  "Well, that is red,  this  one  is

brown. The other one is Soekarno and this one is the

Tunku.  And anyway the Dutch retained West Irian  by

force," implying that if the Dutch did not retain it

by  force  but by popular consent, then  it  is  all

right,  it  is not anti-colonialism. I do  not  know

whether  he  realised the full implications  of  his

proposition.  But  this  is  really  the  height  of

dialectical  absurdity because, by implication,  the

Member for Thomson, the great anti-colonialist,  was

giving,  in  a  back-handed way, a  bouquet  to  the

British  Raj, suggesting of course that the  British

are   not   retaining  Singapore  and   the   Borneo

territories by force but by the popular consent  and

will  of  the  people. Now are the Barisan  Sosialis

anti-colonialist? When it suits them, they say, "No,

we must have the colonial struggle to carry on. Then

we can use this slogan, hide ourselves together with

the nationalists, because the nationalists are anti-Communist  and  non-Communists  but  all  are  anti-colonialists.  Therefore, let us  all  get  together

under  a common denominator - anti-colonialism."  Then

he   reached   the  culmination  of  his  tremendous

argument  against Malaysia. He said  that  what  the

Barisan Sosialis wanted is the original Malaysia. He

said,  "Melayu Raya, for merger of Singapore. Malaya

and the Borneo territories into the Republic of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia." He left out the Philippines.  I  do  not

know  whether it is because in his definition it  is

not included, but anyway he was quite happy to merge

with  the  Republic of Indonesia. Well, there  speak

Bintang  Timor and Harian Rakyat  - the voice  of  the

P.K.I. (Parti Komunis Indonesia). And he quoted  all

this  without so much as saying with the  leave  and

consent of Bintang Timor and Harian Rakyat.  He  was

propounding  this as a new and original  proposition

of  the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, I can understand this

line  of  the  Bintang Timor and the  Communists  in

Indonesia.  They want Malaysia as part of Indonesia.

Why?  They say that Malaysia as a separate State  is

anti-Indonesia. That is what the Member for  Thomson

said,  "Malaysia is anti-Indonesia."  And  why?  The

Member for Thomson may or may not know; he has  made

so  many  elementary mistakes in explaining away  in

dialectical terms the political situation in  South-East   Asia.  Perhaps  he  may  not  know  that   an

independent and nationalist State of Malaysia  would

be  difficult  of  absorption by Indonesia  because,

unlike   West  Irian,  they  would  have   to   meet

nationalists and not colonialist forces. He  may  or

may  not  be  sincere when he says that he  wants  a

merger  of  Singapore  and the  territories  of  the

Federation   and   Borneo  into  the   Republic   of

Indonesia.  We  can  only assume  that  he  and  his

Secretary-General are sincere. I read the Secretary-General just now praising in very glowing terms  the

President of the Republic of Indonesia, that he is a

great man; and according to this picture of the mass

rally, in the honoured place on the right-hand  side

of  the  symbol  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis - the  Red

Star - is a great portrait of President Soekarno.  And

he  said, "Oh, this is the struggle of righteousness

against  wickedness." The Barisan Sosialis  keep  on

telling us that they represent the people. I say  to

them  that if they keep on repeating that Singapore,

the  Borneo  territories and Malaya should  go  into

Indonesia  and merge with it and they  say  that  it

represents the view of the people, they will wind up

in  Woodbridge Hospital and not just as  members  of

the Advisory Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson made what he thought

was  a  scathing statement which would reduce me  to

utter  ridicule.  He said that I spent  my  time  in

Kuching  playing golf all the time. Sir,  he  forgot

that  only  three weeks previously he  had  bitterly

denounced me when he returned from Borneo for having

spent my time advising the Federation delegation  on

how  to  answer  the  difficult  questions  put   by

delegates from Sarawak and North Borneo and how,  in

spite  of  my assistance, he referred to  me  as  an

astute  personality  - I am deeply honoured;  a  back-handed  compliment from an ideological mortal enemy.

Of  course, personally we are still good friends. He

buys me a drink -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And you buy him two!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have not bought him two yet,

Sir,I  always put it on the account of the  Member

for  Nee  Soon who is the wealthiest of  us  all  in

private practice and whose wealth is clearly visible

now.  However,  he  said that in  spite  of  all  my

assistance,  there were so many difficult  questions

that  could  not be answered; he had to go  back  to

Kuala  Lumpur, adjourn the meeting there for further

time  to  consider  and  give satisfactory  answers.

Where   is   the   truth - two  utterly  contradictory

statements made at two different times? I  can  only

assume that the Member for Thomson had forgotten the

absurdity of his first allegation when he  made  his

second  allegation.  Perhaps he  has  forgotten  the

truth that, as a member of the Singapore delegation,

I  worked  hard to put the Singapore point  of  view

across. And the day's work having been done, I  took

the opportunity of a bit of recreation to play golf,

while  he bemused himself at the bar of the  Aurora.

Mind  you, Sir, the Aurora is the poshest  hotel  in

Kuching - all paid for by C.P.A. Kuching.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As Speaker, I was just

debating  in my mind whether or not conduct  at  the

bar  of  the Aurora is personal conduct. If  it  is,

then perhaps the Prime Minister should not refer to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



that,  just as I told the Member for Thomson not  to

refer to golf playing in the first instance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would like to lay

myself  open to criticism of any conduct - whatever  I

do in public is public conduct, be it on my personal

behalf  or  on behalf of the public weal that  I  do

these things. However we will leave it at that.  All

I  need say about golf, Sir, is that it is a pity he

did  not pursue the game because three years ago the

Member  for Thomson and Dominic Puthucheary and  his

good friends went up to Fraser's Hill and tried  out

my clubs on the golf course there. Had he persisted,

he  might  have  understood the potential  political

value of golf which has led to his undoing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am glad the Prime Minister

has made that statement, because it seems to me that

probably modren golf is public conduct!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly, Sir, and quite rightly, from time to time I anxiously watch the

comings  and goings on the golf course,  because  in

the free and lax atmosphere when one looks at vistas

on  the  wider  horizon, one is not worried  by  the

hothouse atmosphere of synthetic revolution bred out

of  anxiety and neurosis in a smoke-filled Committee

Room. In calm and detachment, forces are analysed to

their  last and absolute fundamentals, and prognoses

are  more  likely often made in quiet  and  peaceful

surroundings  than  in  synthetically  excited   and

anxious ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all I need say before I close the subject of

golf  is that I have a clear encouragement from  the

Secretary-General  of the Barisan  Sosialis  that  I

should  play more golf. I met him on Friday  in  the

C.P.A.  Room,  and  he inquired anxiously  after  my

health.  He said he heard that I went and  addressed

the  University of Malaya students and  that  I  had

blacked out. I said, "Yes, I had." And he said, "Ah,

you  worked too hard and the strain was too much for

you." I said, "No, it was just one minute. It was an

old complaint". He said he know about it because - and

this  happened when he was in this Assembly - you will

remember I once recounted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



the  problem  of  people who suffer  from  low-blood

pressure,  of which I am an unfortunate sufferer.  I

went  on  to assure him that even if I were to  pass

out permanently, it would be unlikely that merger or

Malaysia would be forgotten. And he ruefully agreed.

He   is   a   man   better  trained  in  dialectical

materialism  and socialist realism than  the  Member

for Thomson. He understands that history is not made

by  the  P.A.P. or  the Prime Minister.  There  are

important movements and forces and peoples, and  one

of  those  forces  and  peoples  is  nationalism  in

Malaysia.  And  those  who  stand  in  the  way   of

nationalism  and  want to throw  themselves  against

this  overwhelming  might may well  have  reason  to

despair  when  the relentless process and  logic  of

forces  and events unfold in Malaysia. In any  case,

everything is all right and I hastened to assure him

what  he  had  already known many  years  ago,  that

people who suffer from low-blood pressure live  long

lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson should remember that

most people do not change their basic beliefs as  he

has  done. He melted away at the thought of  a  long

and  protracted struggle for supremacy  against  the

Communist cadres in the unions. He became tired  and

in  his  exhaustion - he was in a  state  of  physical

exhaustion  in September 1960 when he  asked  us  to

send him away to England on a T.U.C. course, to  run

away  from it all for a while - he believed  that  the

world  would belong to the zealous Communists. Well,

that is his mistake and that is his business. But he

mentioned  Ferhat Abbas and Lumumba and how  utterly

disgusted  he  was  that we were not  sincerely  and

avidly  in  favour of the great causes of peace  and

anti-colonialism represented in these two men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first remind him - he knows all this - these

are  things  which were uttered between us.  Let  me

remind him first of Lumumba and what I said in  this

debate - the  thing  that made the  late  Mr  Lumumba

politically  important was that his  opponents  were

stupid  enough to assassinate him. But for the  fact

that he died such a cruel death at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



the  hands of political opponents, he may well  have

gone down as a comic figure in Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those days - I think it was January last

year - we  were all still comrades in the P.A.P.,  and

the  Member for Thomson and Mr Sandra Woodhull were

discussing with me in the C.P.A. Room as to  why  we

should  not only move a resolution about Mr Lumumba

but  that  I  should name a road after Lumumba,  for

instance, Lumumba Highway. I told them then,  and  I

tell them now that I am quite happy to call a circus

after  Lumumba,  if  the  next  roundabout  lacks  a

suitable  name, but I see no reason  why  we  should

commemorate the name of an anti-colonialist whom the

Russians thought they could use as their stooge  but

who  lacked  basic  stability,  both  emotional  and

political.  He  let  his people  down,  among  other

things, by using the resources of the Congo to  take

a  Belgian popsy with him to the United Nations,  so

described  in Time magazine, Sir, and in  unpleasant

detail -  "the redhead daughter of a curio dealer".  I

told  both  Mr Woodhull and the Member for  Thomson

that  that  was  not my idea of a great  nationalist

leader.  Mr Woodhull said I should make allowances

for  the African ethos. And I had a sneaking feeling

that  perhaps Mr Woodhull was already  finding  his

excuses  for  the  day  when he  would  be  measured

against  the  austere and puritannical standards  of

the  Chinese revolution. However, we will  let  that

pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ferhat Abbas, nobody in his right senses

would  doubt  the sincerity with which  we  welcomed

him.   Here  was  a  French  scholar,  the  Algerian

nationalist,  the  moderate in an  extreme  Algerian

situation.  Now, unfortunately, by the  dictates  of

the  situation he has been replaced by  fiercer  and

sterner  men.  We welcomed him and  his  people  for

their  heroic  struggle against the stupidities  and

the  atrocities of the French. But just in case  the

Member for Thomson does not know it, let me tell him

that   the  F.L.N.,  which  formed  the  Provisional

Government of Algeria, expels anybody who  is  found

to be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



Communist  or  have Communist connections.  And  the

F.L.N. have   not  forgotten  that  the   Algerian

Communist  Party  opposed  the  revolt  against  the

French when they started it in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Sir, even though a nationalist

movement does not lend itself as a stooge instrument

of  the  Communists, objective circumstances  compel

the   Communists   to   support  it.   International

Communists,  in utter and complete cynicism  of  the

fate of Communists both in Algeria and in Egypt, who

are  smacked  down with considerable regularity  and

ruthlessness,  support both the Aswan  Dam  and  the

F.L.N. So one does not have to be a pro-Communist in

order  to be an anti-colonialist. That is the  first

lesson    to    learn   in   objective   dialectical

materialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the Communists is simply this:

unlike  the nationalists, they cannot afford to  say

what  they  believe in. And so they start  on  false

premises.  They say they believe in democracy  when,

in  fact,  they believe in Communism. They say  they

believe  in the freedom of the individual  when,  in

fact,  they  believe  in  the  dictatorship  of  the

proletariat.  We  have  the  advantage   of   saying

honestly and frankly what we believe in, and  to  do

what  we  have  stated  we  believed  in,  like  an

independent,  democratic,  non-Communist,  socialist

Malaya,   not   an  independent,  democratic,   non-Communist, socialist Malaya in the Barisan Sosialis,

because that is not what they believe in. We believe

that  West Irian belongs to Indonesia, so we support

this   motion.  In  the  same  way,  logically   and

consistently,  we  believe that  Malaya,  Singapore,

North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei belong to Malaysia,

and  we are not afraid of supporting history.  Since

there  are  people who always cite history  whenever

they find a dearth of ideological arguments, let  me

assure  them  that very shortly history  will  prove

that they are on our side, the side of Malaysia.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker. Sir, this is the third time this House

is  discussing foreign affairs. I remember the first

time  when we discussed foreign affairs, it  was  on

the  motion  on  Algeria moved by the  Minister  for

Culture.  At  that  time, this  House  censured  the

French colonialists for their atrocities in Algeria.

The  second topic discussed was the motion moved  by

the Prime Minister in regard to the assassination of

the  Prime  Minister of the Congo, Mr  Lumumba.  At

that time we condemned the Belgian colonialists  for

their actions against the Congo people. Today we are

discussing  the Dutch colonialists and their  bloody

administration  in West Irian. These  three  motions

show  us  very clearly that the motive is to condemn

the   imperialists  and  their  suppression  of  the

colonial  people.  The  two  previous  motions  were

unanimously supported by this House. But today,  the

motion that we are discussing and the speeches  made

supporting the Indonesian people in their liberation

of  West  Irian  are  different  from  the  previous

speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have listened just now to the speech of the

Prime  Minister. It took him about  two  hours.  His

speech and the speeches by the Ministers in the past

few days clearly show the Government's stand on West

Irian.  From  the Prime Minister's  speech,  we  can

clearly see that the Government is not honest in its

support of the Indonesian people in their liberation

of  West  Irian. The Government says the  motive  of

this  motion  is  inspired by  the  Communists.  The

speech  by the Prime Minister clearly shows that  he

is anti-Communist. He says that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. Government support the Indonesian people

in their efforts to retake West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1960, after his tour of Indonesia, the

Prime  Minister signed a joint communique  with  the

Indonesian   First  Minister,  Dr  Djuanda,   which

clearly states the P.A.P. stand. I do not deny  that

this  communique  was  about the  support  which  we

expressed  for the Indonesian people.  At  the  same

time,  we  hope  the  West Irian question  could  be

solved  by  peaceful  means. However,  the  one  who

drafted  this  joint communique was  not  the  Prime

Minister.  I  was one of the delegates  who  visited

Indonesia. The joint communique was drafted  by  the

Member  for  Upper  Serangoon and  Mr  S.  Woodhull

jointly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our support of the struggle

against   colonialism,  it  is  not   necessary   to

distinguish  between those who belong to  this  camp

and  those  who  belong to that camp and  those  who

belong to which political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said just

now  that  we  said at our mass rally that  we  love

peace  but  that we love freedom more. According  to

the  analysis made by the Prime Minister,  this  was

Communistic. But the Prime Minister did  not  notice

that  this phrase was uttered by President  Soekarno

at  a  mass  meeting  at  Djokjakarta  on  the  29th

December, 1961. Does it mean that President Soekarno

is a Communist?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister has

also mentioned my colleague. He said that the Member

for  Thomson was pro-Communist and that he went over

to  the  Communists in June 1960. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the  Prime  Minister said that  if  the  Member  for

Thomson wanted to join the first class for the cause

of  dialectical materialism, he would fail.  We  can

see very clearly that the speeches made by the Prime

Minister  are  contradictory. If he  failed  in  his

dialectical  materialism,  how  could  he  become  a

Communist? [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Opposition should be given the

courtesy of a silent hearing. Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, we can

see from the speeches of the Prime Minister that his

theory  is bankrupt. It cannot stand up to argument.

It cannot stand up to facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has also

referred  to  the Secretary-General of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who,  at the Geylang Serai  mass  meeting,

mentioned   about   the  peace   loving   countries.

According   to  the  analysis  made  by  the   Prime

Minister, the peace loving countries he referred  to

are  the Communist countries. I am astonished at the

logic propounded by the Prime Minister. Does it mean

that  only the Communist countries are peace  loving

people?  Does it mean that if we are a non-Communist

country,  then we should say that we are  not  peace

loving,  and that we are against peace? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  peace  is  not only the desire  of  the  Asian

people.  Peace  is also the desire of  the  European

people. It is the desire of the people of the  whole

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech made by the

Prime Minister, which lasted about two hours, we can

say that he represents -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For the correct record, the

speech took about one and a quarter hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from  the speech by the Prime Minister which  lasted

about two hours, we can say that he represents -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Probably the Member did not

hear  me. The record of the Prime Minister's  speech

indicates that he spoke for one and a quarter hours,

not two hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from  the speech by the Prime Minister which  lasted

for  more than one hour, we can see that he detailed

the  Director of the Special Branch to make such  an

analysis in this House. We are not surprised to hear

such speeches by him. At the same time, we will  not

be intimidated by what he says.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



The  people of Singapore will not be intimidated  by

what  he  says. Mr Speaker, Sir, when we  open  our

map, it clearly shows that West Irian belongs to the

Indonesian   Republic.  It  is  part  of  Indonesian

territory.  Except  for  the  colonialists  and  the

imperialists,   the  people  of  the   whole   world

recognise   West   Irian   as   belonging   to   the

Indonesians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from news agency reports, we

know  that  Dutch  warships  have  opened  fire   on

Indonesian  warships.  This has  clearly  shown  the

people in Asia and Africa that the Dutch do not want

to  give back West Irian to the Indonesians. As part

of  the  Asian people, we should solemnly  warn  the

Dutch  colonialists and the imperialists that  their

parasitical   way   of  occupying   other   people's

territory  in  this twentieth century  will  not  be

tolerated any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 700,000 people in West Irian

have  been  exploited and suppressed  by  the  Dutch

colonialists for more than 300 years.  In  the  past

two  years, they have still not been able  to  enjoy

the same political life as that of their compatriots

in  Indonesia. They have also suffered at the  hands

of  the  Dutch  colonialists. The Dutch colonialists

have  not  given  back West Irian to the  Indonesian

people.  From the time of the round-table conference

up   to  1962,  the  Dutch  colonialists  have   not

expressed  their desire to surrender West  Irian  to

the  Republic of Indonesia. In the General  Assembly

of the United Nations, the reasonable demands of the

Indonesian  representatives  were  objected  to  and

frustrated  by  the imperialists. The so-called  big

family  of nations have not been able to help  solve

the problems of the member States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recollect that in April

1955,  a  conference was organised by the Afro-Asian

countries  at  Bandoeng. 29 nations  from  Asia  and

Africa  attended  and  they discussed  economic  and

cultural co-operation. More important than that  was

the   fact  that  the  conference  passed  the  five

principles  and  their  stand  against   the   Dutch

colonialists and their continued domination of  West

Irian. This conference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



reflects   the  struggle  waged  by  the  Indonesian

people. Their anti-imperialist struggle is also part

of  the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples. In  this

solemn  struggle, there are two methods  of  solving

the  problem;  first,  the  problem  can  be  solved

peacefully at the conference table; this is the best

way   of  solving  the  problem:  secondly,  on  the

battlefield, i.e., by force: this is the last resort

and  is  the  only alternative which  could  not  be

solved  by peaceful means. We, the Barisan Sosialis,

are   glad  to  see  that  this  problem  is  solved

peacefully. We are not against the Indonesian people

for trying to liberate West Irian by force, just  as

the Indian Government have used force to retake Goa.

The  Indonesian people wish to liberate West  Irian.

This  is  the  first round of the Afro-Asian  people

against  colonialism.  In  this  struggle,  we,  the

people  of  Singapore, should not remain indifferent

and  neutral.  We  should not  also  sabotage  their

struggle.  Therefore, my Chairman, representing  the

Barisan  Sosialis, has clearly explained his  motive

when he tabled this motion. In this struggle against

colonialism, there should not be any barrier  placed

on  language,  race or custom. There  should  be  no

distinction. As regards the people in Singapore, who

are  still under colonialism, they should try  their

best  to help the Indonesian people. Therefore, this

motion  which has been tabled in this House reflects

their  support of the Indonesian people against  the

Dutch colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the P.A.P. theoretician, namely, the

Minister  for  Culture, spoke on  this  motion.  His

speech showed the reactionary and childish stand the

P.A.P. has taken on the question of West Irian.  The

Front Benches of the Government treated this serious

problem  with levity and frivolity. I doubt  whether

the  theories  propounded by the Front  Benches  are

supported by the Back Benches of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that on the 22nd of

February,  1961,  the Minister for Culture  moved  a

motion  in  support of the Algerian  people.  It  is

barely  one  year since the motion was  tabled,  but

they have changed entirely. They have already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



turned  Right. In the motion tabled by the  Minister

for  Culture  last year, he asked the Government  to

allot $10,000 to help the Provisional Government  of

Algeria. He also appealed to the people of Singapore

to support generously the Algerian Fund. At the same

time, the P.A.P. also donated $2,000 to this fund as

a  kind  of  show. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  people  of

Singapore  donated the money to the Algerian  people

in  their  struggle against the French colonialists.

They gave what they could materially and spiritually

to  support the Algerian people in order to let them

fight    more   effectively   against   the   French

colonialists. But, on the question of the Indonesian

struggle  against  the Dutch over West  Irian,  what

kind  of  argument did the Minister for Culture  put

forward? Let me now quote what he said last week  in

this Assembly concerning the question of West Irian.

The  Minister for Culture said the Barisan  Sosialis

not  only supported these conditions, but they  were

also  prepared to support the Indonesians to  invade

and  to  continue to invade West Irian. Mr Speaker,

here  are  certain Barisan supporters who  willingly

volunteered   to  take  part  in  the   West   Irian

liberation struggle. Is the P.A.P. really supporting

the  Indonesian claim over West Irian? Its  attitude

has  been  entirely  exposed by the  speech  of  the

Minister  for  Culture. What is  invasion?  Military

invasion?   What  is  the  definition  of  "military

invasion" as used by the Minister for Culture?  Does

it mean that the Indonesians have to use force as  a

last  resort to claim back West Irian? Does it  mean

that this is the so-called military invasion by  the

Indonesian people? When a country could not but  use

force to reclaim its territories, does it mean  that

this can be termed as a military invasion? Now,  who

has occupied West Irian? Who has invaded West Irian?

According to the logic of the Minister for  Culture,

India's reclamation of Goa by force is also  a  kind

of  military  invasion. Does he mean  that?  If  the

house  of the Minister for Culture has been occupied

by  other people and he uses the police to  take  it

back, can it be termed as a military invasion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> What

about P.A.P. branches?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  the motion on Algeria tabled by the Minister for

Culture  had been hypocritical, then his  speech  on

the  motion on West Irian must be a reactionary  one

and  a kind of sell-out speech. The people will then

see clearly who are really selling out the interests

of  the people, who are really pro-colonialists, and

who  are  really anti-colonialists in the course  of

the  struggle against the colonialists. The Minister

for  Home  Affairs and his colleagues  have  already

alleged  on  many occasions that the action  of  our

workers  who pasted up posters was against  the  law

and  a  breach  of the regulations.  It  is  a  very

regrettable matter. This goes to show that they  are

already  deviating  from the  original  course  they

adopted  once  upon a time  - they are deviating  from

the people. The people who went out to paste posters

in  support  of West Irian were workers and  farmers

who   had   suffered  under  colonial   rule.   They

understand that the Indonesian struggle against  the

Dutch  over  the question of West Irian  is  closely

connected with them, and that was why they took part

in  putting up posters. On the other hand, as I have

just  said, they belong to the working class-farmers

and workers. They made use of their spare time - after

their  normal working time; that is to say,  in  the

night  time - to go out and paste posters.  In  actual

fact,  they did not go out to paste posters  in  the

early  hours of the morning. For instance, in  Jalan

Kayu,  a few workers were detained by the police  at

about  9  p.m. and not at 1 a.m. or 2  a.m. in  the

morning. They were brought to the Paya Lebar  Police

Station   awaiting  investigation  by  the   Special

Branch. They were kept there up to midnight.  So  it

is  the  pro-colonialist stand of  the  P.A.P. that

should be blamed; also the bureaucratic attitude  of

the police. I would like to express my gratitude and

admiration   to  the  workers  who  were   arrested.

According  to  reports, some were  detained  on  two

occasions  for  two nights by the police.  All  this

goes to show that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



this  anti-colonial struggle the reactionary  group,

in spite of resorting to all methods of suppression,

could  not  suppress the fervour of the  people  who

take part in the anti-colonial struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, we heard a speech made by One who

appeared to be worse than a Fascist - the Minister for

Finance.  After hearing his speech, I  came  to  the

conclusion  that  he was worse than  a  Fascist.  He

disclosed  his true colours in his speech.  He  said

that the Dutch had not derived any benefit from West

Irian and that they did not acquire much money;  but

that, on the other hand, they had to invest a lot of

money in building schools, hospitals, roads, and  so

on.  Obviously he was speaking in the same  vein  as

the colonialists. There is no difference between the

opinions   he   holds   and  those   held   by   the

colonialists.  [Interruption] If you will  refer  to

the official records, you will then know what he has

said.  His  speech was very puerile and foolish.  He

has  forgotten that the main purpose of the invasion

of  colonies by the imperialists - such as the French,

Portuguese, Belgians and the British  - was  to  carry

out  economic exploitation with a view  to  personal

benefit. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give a very simple

and practical example to show that the speech of the

Minister for Finance was nonsensical and puerile. On

23rd  June, 1959, the Financial Times published that

the  British obtained over œ600 million  every  year

from the colonies. As an economist, the Minister for

Finance  was not aware of this. How can  he  explain

away  this  kind  of  economic exploitation  by  the

colonialists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, he made a speech in which he

mentioned the merger forum organised by the  Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce. He described it as  the  fifth

round with the Barisan Sosialis. In my opinion,  the

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce organised  this  forum

because  after  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara last year - it was a policy speech on behalf of

the Government - the Government did not give any reply

to  questions raised by civic organisations. Instead

the Government continued with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



its  attitude of smearing and giving excuses,  as  a

result  of  which the representatives at  the  forum

were very dissatisfied with the answers given by the

Government.  The  forum  was  closely   watched   by

personnel  from  the Special Branch. The  Government

sent  out  personnel  from the  Special  Branch  and

photographs  were  taken of all representatives  who

were  allotted special seats. This clearly  goes  to

show that the P.A.P. do not only want to control the

Press and the radio but also all civic organisations

in   order   to   carry   out  their   retrogressive

constitutional arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the reference to the

fifth  round  by the Minister for Finance,  we  have

already seen his true colours. We have been used  to

his  smears in the past. We understand that clearly.

Perhaps he would say that the question of West Irian

is  the sixth round and the question of Malaysia  is

the  seventh  round. We are not  interested  in  all

this.  What We are interested in is that the welfare

of  the  people should not be adversely affected  by

the  so-called fifth or sixth round struggle by  the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Barisan Sosialis will try our best to

unite  our people and to step up our efforts in  the

anti-colonial struggle.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  I  first  moved this motion, I never  for  one

moment thought that the debate would develop in  the

way t has. It is a simple and straightforward issue.

Are  we  for or against colonialism? Are we  for  or

against  the  Dutch colonialists on the  West  Irian

issue?  It  is  not as the Member for Tanglin  said,

more  anti  or less anti. It is simply anti  or  not

anti.  There  is no more or less. He  has  seen  the

thing  wrongly. Of course, the Front Benches of  the

Opposition  do  not like to hear things  that  hurt.

They  have  to run out of the Chamber. It  would  be

better for them not to listen to what I have to  say

because  it is obvious they cannot stand it. Perhaps

they  know  they  will  not he  able  to  stand  it,

Speakers after speakers agree that West Irian itself

belongs to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



the  Indonesians and that it is a part of Indonesia.

Even  the  Minister for Finance admitted  that  West

Iran should be returned to Indonesia forthwith.  Yet

all  the  P.A.P. speakers have advanced reasons  and

arguments  as to why this should not be so.  I  will

come  to  that  later, Sir,In putting  forth  their

views,  they have made sure that this simper  debate

on  a  clear-cut issue was debated on  party  lines.

They  accused us of doing that, but, in actual fact,

they themselves are the very people who have debated

this  issue on party lines. The Members of U.M  N.O.

say  that we are not sincere. Some say we are proud.

The  Ministers  used  insulting  words,  calling  us

puerile,   half-baked  anti-colonialists,  Communist

stooges, hypocrites and a whole host of words  which

you normally do not allow, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must

know that certain words used in certain contexts may

not be offensive or insulting to Members. But I must

rely on Members getting up on a point of order,  if,

in fact, a word is offensive or insulting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I say has

no  reflection  on the Chair. It happened  when  you



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow that. That is

also a reflection on the Chair. Even if I am not  in

and the reflection is on the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I have said, Sir, the issue

before  the House is a simple one. The motion  says,

"That  this  House  , expresses admiration  for  the

determination  and courage of the Indonesian  people

and  expresses  full sympathy with their  hopes  and

aspirations"  - just expressing our sympathy  and  our

admiration  for  the determination and  courage  and

hopes  and  aspirations  of the  Indonesian  people.

There is nothing very much wrong with that. And  the

motion  also "calls upon the people of Singapore  to

give  their  wholehearted support to our  neighbours

and friends,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



the   people  of  Indonesia,  in  their   just   and

legitimate  struggle  against colonial  domination".

Again,  Sir,  there is nothing wrong  with  that.  A

simple,  straightforward issue.  When  I  moved  the

motion  I  addressed the House in all solemnity  and

seriousness.  I  made it a point to explain  to  the

House  that  the West Irian issue s an anti-colonial

issue.  All  political Parties that are truly  anti-colonial   should  not  have  any  difficulty,   any

reservation,   any  hesitation  in  supporting   the

motion.  And  if they are truly anti-colonial,  they

should  not worry about the question of which  Party

has  moved this motion. If only they are truly anti-colonial  and if they are sincere, they  should  not

read  into the anti-colonial sentiments more meaning

than  there  is, and meanings which are  not  there.

They  should  not fear that their support  may  give

credit  to  the Party that has moved the motion.  In

fact,  we in the Barisan Sosialis make no secret  of

the fact that we are uncompromisingly anti-colonial,

either now or in the future. And if the P.A.P.,  for

example, had moved this motion, we would have  given

our support unreservedly and without qualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened? All their talk of support

for  the  motion  has  been  introduced  with  party

politics. They bring in a lot of irrelevant matters,

and  they  point to our insincerity. All  this  only

goes  to  prove the hypocrisy of the P.A.P. Possibly

they  support  the motion as a matter  of  political

expediency, for unfortunately they are forced into a

position  where they have to support this motion.  I

will  come  to that later, Sir,In actual  fact,  in

their  heart  of  hearts, they  are  not  really  in

support  of  the  motion at all. We  are  forced  to

assume   this,   as  there  is  no  other   possible

explanation for their attitude and behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, as I say, is whether we are pro-colonial or anti-colonial. Are we pro-Dutch or are

we  pro-Indonesia? It is as simple as that, and they

equivocate,  they  twist  and  turn,  and  say,  "We

support and we do not support." What do they  really

mean?  The  U.M.N.O., for example, say that  we  are

insincere and they advance the reason for  their  so

thinking on the fact that we had put up posters late

at night. That has already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



been  answered by the Member for Choa Chu Kang.  But

let  me  just remind them once more: that as in  the

P.A.P. in the days of old, our workers are voluntary

workers. They can come out to help voluntarily  only

after they have finished their day's work, and  have

taken  their bath and have had their dinner. But  me

P.A.P. say that just because these people come  out

at night, therefore, we are insincere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Till 1 a.m.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Surely that is not a good

reason for calling us insincere. If it is because of

party  politics, we can understand why they  advance

such  a reason. They also say that we held the rally

in  Geylang Serai in order that we might gain  Malay

support.  I  must ask: Why not, Sir? What  is  wrong

with  that? Why cannot we try to gain and why cannot

we fight for Malay support? [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Prime Minister wishes

to  intervene, he knows how to do so. I think he  is

off-tune. I think I reminded the Government  Benches

that the Opposition should be heard in silence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In this anti-colonial issue, we

want  the support of everybody. This is not a racial

issue.  It  is  an issue clear and simple,  repeated

again  and  again,  of whether  you  want  to  fight

against colonialism or not. They may think it is  an

abstract idea. And to the P.A.P. it is, because they

have completely forgotten what anti-colonialism  is.

The  P.A.P. come out with the question of  peace  or

war.  As  I have said, Sir, the P.A.P. unfortunately

have  been  pushed  into  a  very  unfortunate   and

embarrassing  position. First, because  the  Barisan

Sosialis first came out with a statement in  support

of the Indonesian people on the 28th December, 1961.

Second, because the Barisan Sosialis held a rally in

Geylang Serai in support of Indonesia's struggle and

because   the   P.A.P. were   forced   again    by

circumstances  to allow us to hold  a  rally  there.

This  has to be explained to you, Sir. We have asked

for permission -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of order. Is

it  in  order to suggest that the speaker is moronic

and unable to understand?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It did not occur to the Speaker that

the  Speaker  is moronic. But these, I suppose,  are

permissible  flowery references to the  Speaker,  so

long, of course, as the Speaker is not dragged  into

a controversy! Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We ourselves would never dare

to  disparage or to belitle the Chair  in  any  way,

quite   unlike   some  of  the   people   who   show

supercilious arrogance towards the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that we want to explain. We have asked

for  permission  to hold rallies  in  various  other

areas,  and  the  P.A.P., in search  of  reasons  to

prevent our holding such rallies, have said that  we

can  hold  rallies only in constituencies  where  we

have  Assemblymen.  Now  we  have  pointed  out  how

untenable such reasoning is. We have pointed out  in

our  Barisan  paper  and in  our  rallies  that  the

U.M.N.O. had held a rally in Kampong Bahru, that the

Party Rakyat had held a rally -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

explanation. It is very important; and to be fair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let him sit down.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must

not  arrogate  unto  himself the  authority  of  the

Chair.  If  he does not wish to give way he  remains

standing  and the Prime Minister will  have  to  sit

down. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that the

Party  Rakyat had recently held a rally  in  Geylang

Serai.  And even the Singapore Congress had  held  a

rally  sometime back in Mountbatten. They  have  not

got  any  Assemblymen in those areas. If I could  go

further  back,  the P.A.P. itself  held  rallies  in

Bukit  Panjang, Farrer Park, Shenton Way. All  these

rallies   were   permitted,  and   there   were   no

Assemblymen in those areas. Yet -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Home Affairs

will have an opportunity or can take the opportunity

to make a ministerial statement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All this tells us how

ridiculous  and dictatorial the P.A.P. has  been.  I

have already given two reasons why the P.A.P. is  in

that embarrassing position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that the P.A.P. is embarrassed

by the fact that the motion is being tabled by their

deadly  opponents,  the Barisan  Sosialis.  We  have

shown them up to be completely pro-colonial in their

outlook and approach. They have deviated so much  to

the Right that they do not know what anti-colonialism

is all about. In this particular motion, in spite of

themselves,   they  have  to  support  the   motion.

Otherwise, their secret will be shown up for all  to

see,  and I am sure the Prime Minister does not like

that.  He would like to keep up the posture that  he

is  still anti-colonial, and he would like  to  show

the people that he is still fighting colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, compelled to support this motion, the P.A.P.

is now also forced to play politics. They say we are

not  sincere.  They  accuse us of  playing  politics

instead, and they adopt the contemptible attitude of

making fun, joking, laughing, and smearing - an air of

light-heartedness, frivolity and ridicule.  Looking

at  their feces, Sir, you can see hypocrisy  written

all over them. We are deciding a very serious issue,

Sir,  and  see what they do - they laugh! Is that  the

respect  that  we  want to show  to  the  Indonesian

people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, but to the volunteers of

the Barisan. Are you a volunteer?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We will come to that. Of

course,  in  order  to  show  that  they  are  anti-colonial,  they also bring up their pet  subject  of

Communism.  They  do  so  first  by  belittling  our

Geylang Serai rally. They harped on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



fact  that  there were only about 5,000  people  and

that we had to shepherd-in unions in order to form a

crowd. Sir, we have had pictures taken of the rally.

For  the  edification of the House and you,  we  can

easily  see  that  from  only  one  section  of  the

crowd - that   is   here    - [indicating]   the    most

conservative estimate on this picture alone would be

8,000. We ourselves have estimated the crowd  to  be

10,000 but there are other people who have estimated

the  crowd to be anywhere between 12,000 and 15,000.

The  Prime  Minister should have  seen  the  traffic

congestion there. If he had gone there, he would not

have  been  able to pass through. That alone  should

show what happened. The P.A.P. would not dare hold a

rally like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, they made some frivolous jokes

about   volunteers.  I  remember  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister saying something about suckling babes. Sir,

the  Member  for Thomson has already mentioned  that

the  three lady volunteers whom they poked  fun  of,

were  not, as far as we know, members of the Barisan

Sosialis. I personally do not know the three  ladies

concerned.  But  we  take strong  exception  to  the

ridicule which Members of the Government Party  have

showered  on  these volunteers. By  this  very  fact

alone, the P.A.P. have proved to the House that they

are  not  sincere  at all in the way  they  talk  of

supporting this motion. By the manner in which  they

ridicule  these volunteers, they have already  shown

that  they  are not friendly towards the  Indonesian

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Can the

Member  be allowed to make fantastic allegations  of

our  hostility to our neighbour when the declaration

stands  in the joint names of the First Minister  of

Indonesia and myself pledging our friendship and our

support of West Irian?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. I think

the  Prime  Minister has made his point. A different

opinion apparently has been expressed by the  Member

for  Queenstown. He is entitled to his opinion.  Dr

Lee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will also make an observation

about  that  joint  statement  of  his  later.   The

question to ask the P.A.P., under the circumstances,

is,  will they also adopt the same attitude  if  the

people  start  a  campaign to help and  support  the

struggle  in  South Vietnam? Will they do  the  same

thing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What same thing?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do the P.A.P. think it all so

funny?  Will  they also adopt the same  attitude  if

they should start a campaign to help Ngo Dinh Diem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who is starting?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is perfectly natural

for  people who feel deeply about certain things  to

volunteer for service in West Irian, especially when

the  issue  has turned into a burning issue.  It  is

unnatural, to say the least, to stop this inevitable

political  process in spite of what the P.A.P. have

said  and  will  say. It does not take  the  Barisan

Sosialis  to incite them to volunteer, in  fact,  so

far  as  we know, popular sentiment as regards  West

Irian  has existed long before now. And if the Prime

Minister  does not take my statement as the  genuine

truth,  I am sure he can inquire from the Indonesian

Consulate  whether there have indeed been volunteers

showing  readiness to help the Indonesian people  as

regards  the  West Irian issue. It is as  simple  as

that.  Why must they link it up with this and  that,

and  twist  and turn it into something sinister?  In

fact,  I  might mention that there are other  people

who  feel  agitated over the West Irian  issue.  For

instance,  the Member for Geylang Serai himself  has

told us that he felt so deeply about the matter that

he  helped  to  run  guns for the freedom  fighters.

Things  like  this have happened long, long  before.

They  keep  on  asking  why  we  ourselves  do   not

volunteer  when  we  talk of  supporting  the  anti-colonial struggle in West Irian. Sir, this is a very

vicious  question.  After all,  let  me  remind  the

P.A.P. that  they themselves had  held  rallies  in

support  of the Algerian struggle and in support  of

the condemnation of the murder of Lumumba. Did they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



at  any  time suggest to themselves that they should

go  and  fight in the Congo or in Algeria?  Did  the

Prime  Minister  do  that? The P.A.P. want  the  13

Assemblymen to volunteer. They are even  willing  to

draw  out  funds from the P.A.P. for the  first  one

hundred  volunteers  from the Barisan  Sosialis  and

they  would  join  the merry chorus  and  say,  "Bon

voyage."  Let  me tell them this, Sir.  This  is  no

joking  matter to the 96 million Indonesian  people.

The  time  may  come  when everybody  will  have  to

undergo  heavy  sacrifices.  Families  may  be  torn

apart. Fathers may have to mourn for sons. Wives may

have  to  mourn for husbands, sisters for  brothers,

and friends may never meet again. Do they think that

it  is  such  a frivolous matter that they  have  to

laugh about it? Do they dare to laugh in the face of

the Indonesian people? Let them laugh that out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat what the Member for Thomson has said,

Sir.  Even if they do not want to respect the  mover

of  the  motion, even if they do not want to respect

the  Barisan  Sosialis, at least let them  pay  some

respect  to  the Indonesian people. The  West  Irian

issue  is  not  a  simple, joking  matter  to  them.

Recently,    President    Soekarno    was     almost

assassinated. That is no joking matter. I was hoping

that  Members opposite would join with me  and  say,

"What  a  barbaric thing it was." But  instead  they

poked fun. They ridiculed. Volunteers from Singapore

or  from  anywhere for that matter,  will  not  make

much,  material difference to what is  happening  in

Indonesia.  The Indonesians have nearly 100  million

people against Holland's meagre 10 million, or  less

than  that. They could just swarm over them.  A  few

hundred  or a few thousand from Singapore  will  not

make  any  difference to the numerical  strength  of

Indonesia. But we admire these volunteers for  their

noble  gesture. It is this noble gesture, Sir,  that

goes to give moral support to the Indonesian people.

That  is all we ask for. Not material strength  from

Members of the Government Benches. As far as  I  can

see  with regard to some Members, a strong wind  can

blow  them  off the ground. They cannot  even  stand

upright.  No  wonder, the Member for  Geylang  Serai

said that the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



was  an  embarrassment  to  the  Indonesian  people.

Because,  after the Prime Minister had  signed  that

solemn  document  of  support  two  years  ago,  the

Government now has turned round and made fun of  our

friends who are hoping for a gesture of support.  We

get  derogatory remarks from the Government  Benches

about people getting senile, needing gimmicks. We in

the Barisan Sosialis definitely do not need gimmicks

and  we are not senile. Everybody in Singapore knows

that.  I would not like to compare, Sir. Comparisons

are  odious, they say, and it may be mistaken as  an

arrogant attitude on our part when we say how strong

we  are  as  against the P.A.P.  But  the  whole  of

Singapore knows exactly what is happening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of order. Has that

got anything to do with the motion itself?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

replying seriatim to the allegations which have been

made. He is perfectly in order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Sir. Just now the

Prime  Minister was referring to the document  which

he  signed with the First Minister of Indonesia, Dr

Djuanda.  Reference has already been made to  it  by

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang. But the point I  want

to  make is this. The joint statement was drafted by

Mr  S.  Woodhull in conjunction with the Indonesian

officials, and - now this is important - it included the

West  Irian issue. And when the Prime Minister heard

that  the  West  Irian  issue was  included  in  the

statement,  he  was  very,  very  unhappy.   It   is

unfortunate that I have to mention this, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. The

Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All this shows that the P.A.P.,

in  their  support  of  the motion,  have  not  been

sincere.  If they had been, they would have  held  a

rally in support of Indonesia too. You will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



remember  that  we held a rally in  support  of  the

Algerian  struggle  and we  also  held  a  rally  in

condemnation of the murder of Lumumba. Of course, at

that  time, there was the Hong Lim by-election which

was  about to come on. In answer to the charge  that

the  P.A.P. had lost all anti-colonial fervour,  the

P.A.P. were compelled to dig up something  to  show

that  they  were not pro-colonial and had  not  lost

their anti-colonial fervour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I might say I felt very

unhappy and sorry that the Prime Minister had  again

thought it good politics to make fun of the name  of

Lumumba.  We  do  not hold brief for any  particular

person,  but the name Lumumba today is held in  high

esteem by all the people who are taking part in  the

anti-colonial  struggle.  But  what  did  our  Prime

Minister  say? If he gave consent to naming anything

after  the  name Lumumba, he said,  it  would  be  a

circus.   Such  derogatory  remarks  from  a   Prime

Minister  of a so-called elected people's government

is  very,  very  hard to believe. All these  remarks

show  up  the actual nature of the P.A.P., and  also

incidentally why we left the P.A.P. So you  see  the

P.A.P. actually support this motion  Just  to  suit

themselves,  as I have demonstrated all  along.  But

here  is where the fun starts. Having supported  the

anti-colonial struggle of the Indonesian  people  in

spite of themselves, the P.A.P. leaders have now  to

explain  their inconsistent stand, in  other  words,

they  have to rationalise their inconsistencies  and

contradictions.  The Minister for Culture  says  the

P.A.P. support  the Indonesian struggle  over  West

Irian  because  they support the same  principle  as

they  support  the principle of Malaysia.  He  makes

great  play  of the words "Malaysia is  historically

inevitable;  and  similarly,  because  reunification

between  West  Irian and Indonesia  is  historically

inevitable,   therefore,  the  P.A.P. support   the

Indonesian people in their struggle to recover  West

Irian."  I  say  this  to the  Government  Ministers

sitting  opposite: "Go and tell that to the Marines,

the Dutch Marines!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Not the Dutchmen of Malaysia?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> First, let me debunk this

"inevitable" theory of the Minister for Culture.  If

inevitability  were  to be carried  to  its  logical

conclusion, then one would have expected  that  they

would  include Indonesia in this matter.  I  am  not

getting  into  the controversy of Malaysia,  how  it

should  be  or  should not be. But if they  want  to

argue,  if  they want to use the word  "inevitable",

then  let us say the inevitable conclusion  is  that

there  will  be  a merger - a union of a  much  larger

unit,  and it includes Indonesia. Is that  what  the

Minister  for Culture says? Is that the  logic?  Are

those  the dialectics of the P.A.P.? Of course,  the

Minister  for Finance knows that it is all nonsense.

So  he  quickly tries to turn the attention  of  the

people to the stand of the Barisan Sosialis instead,

and  attempts  to show the so-called inconsistencies

and  contradictions in our stand as regards Malaysia

and West Irian. He says in the case of Malaysia,  we

ask for consultations, control of internal security,

self-determination  and general  elections.  And  he

asks, why do we not ask the same in the case of West

Irian?  Sir, the trouble with the P.A.P. is that  in

their dictatorship and supercilious arrogance, their

leaders  have mistaken the wood for the trees.  They

have  deviated so far from the original  stand  that

they now cannot distinguish friend from foe, and foe

from   friend.  They  have  lost  the  anti-colonial

fervour,  as I have said, and they try to masquerade

their  true  nature.  They  use  catch  phrases   of

inevitability  of  this and inevitability  of  that,

because  they  know  such words  are  used  by  real

Leftists. They do not see the West Irian issue as an

anti-colonial issue. They do not see it as an  issue

of  the  struggle of oppressed peoples  against  the

colonialists and the imperialists. They do  not  see

that  it is part of a global struggle. To us, it  is

just  as simple as that. And either they do not  see

it or, if they see it, purposely twist it, purposely

pretend not to see it, refuse to see it. It is  just

an  issue of the people fighting against colonialism

and  in  our  support, we want to  add,  as  I  have

indicated in my speech when I moved the motion,  our

small voice to that of the world forum of more  than

half the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



people  of  the  world. Is there anything  wrong  in

that?  There  is no similarity between Malaysia  and

the West Irian issue. In the case of West Irian -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. Sir, I was outside the

Chamber and did not wish to interrupt the Member for

Queenstown. He stated that the joint declaration  on

West  Irian signed by Dr Djuanda and myself was  an

insertion  of a draft by Mr Sandra Woodhull.  As  a

point  of order, I would like now to ask you when   I

could  make  a statement in this Chamber to  clarify

this, because I think this is a matter of some grave

importance and one should not in matters  of  inter-State relations make so mischievous a statement.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. But I

take  it the Prime Minister could allege that he  is

being  misunderstood in some material  part  of  his

speech, and the Standing Order is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Member who has spoken to a question may again

be  heard  to offer an explanation of some  material

part of his speech which has been misunderstood; but

he shall not introduce any new matter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that when the Member for Queenstown has

completed  his speech, the Prime Minister  may  make

his clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was trying to explain that

there is no similarity between Malaysia and the West

Irian  issue.  In  the case of West Irian,  complete

sovereignty  of the whole of the Dutch  East  Indies

was transferred to the Indonesian people at a round-table  conference in the Hague in August  1949.  The

ceremonial  transfer was effected in December  1949,

the  same year, and the transfer of sovereignty  was

unconditional and irrevocable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the International

Court  of  Justice in his argument. But  we  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis are not lawyers  and  we  are  not

arguing  in  any  court of law. We  only  deal  with

general  principles and, to us, the issue is  simply

one of driving out colonialism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



and  of  restoring national sovereignty and national

integrity. In the case of the proposed Malaysia, the

Borneo  territories  are  all  separate.  If  Sabah,

Brunei  and Sarawak are to form some sort  of  union

from  separate  entities, then the people  in  these

areas  must  decide.  If the P.A.P.'s  argument  for

unification  is that all these separate  territories

are under the same British flag, if that is the only

logical contention they have, then I must ask  them,

what  about other areas  - what about Hongkong, Malta,

Aden?  They  are  all under the same  British  flag.

Similarly.  Sir,  I  take it that  Indonesia  Cannot

claim  Dutch  Guiana in South America, because  they

are all separate. They do not claim territories just

because they happen to be under the same flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference which I would like to stress

between  Malaysia and the West Irian issue is  this.

Indonesia  recovers West Irian as part of  Indonesia

and  the West Irians are going to be treated  as  as

equal brothers and sisters of other Indonesians  and

not  as outcasts, and the West Irians will be given,

as  we  can  see  from  the  pronouncements  by  the

Indonesian   authorities,   full   citizenship   and

political  freedom. This is not what will happen  in

Malaysia. As far as Singapore is concerned, we  will

not  be  given full citizenship and we will  not  be

given political freedom. Where is the similarity? In

fact, I would say there is a contrast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch briefly on this self-determination which the Minister for Culture and the

Prime  Minister talk so much about.  Just  like  the

word  "merger",  Sir,  the word "determination"  has

been  twisted  out  of  shape  by  the  P.A.P.   The

principle   of  self-determination  is  raised   and

supported  by  the  Dutch for two reasons.  One,  to

encourage the formation of a puppet State and,  two,

to  prevent  the  reunification of West  Irian  with

Indonesia.   That   is,   to   sabotage   Indonesian

territorial    integrity   and   sovereignty,    and

therefore,  it is a pro-colonial move.  The  Barisan

Sosialis   wants  self-determination  for   entirely

different  reasons. Self-determination is  to  allow

us, even you included, Mr Prime Minister -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not as yet aspired to

the  position of Prime Minister. I think the  Member

must remember that he is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I should have said you. Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That embroils the Speaker in

the  debate  and  I think that is not  fair  to  the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, the Barisan wants

self-determination  for entirely  different  reasons - self-determination to allow us, a colonial  people,

an  opportunity to have freedom from colonialism and

to achieve unification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So the Papuans are not a

colonial people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is, it is a completely

anti-colonial  move.  One is pro-colonial,  and  the

other  is  anti-colonial! Do you see the difference,

Sir?  Surely  the brains of the P.A.P. can  see  the

difference. [Interruption] Sir, we have been  called

many  names  before   - opportunists,  pro-Communists,

Communist  front  men,  the Barisan  Sosialis  is  a

Communist front organisation -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and even Dutchmen. Smear

tactics  are  not new, Sir. They are  the  time-worn

familiar tactics of the colonialists, and such smear

tactics  are treated with the contempt they deserve.

But  whatever it is, one thing is certain. We cannot

be Communists and pro-Communists and Dutchmen at the

same time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not? There are Dutch

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would ask the PAP, to make up

their minds first  - Dutchmen or Communists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dutchmen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> At least they should be

consistent in their name-calling and smears, if  not

in their policies and programmes. They should try to

he consistent one way or the other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member may not be -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister must not be

disorderly.  He  knows the Standing  Order.  If  the

Member does not give way, he cannot speak. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No one in Singapore will ever

believe  that  we  can  be  Dutchmen  who  are  pro-colonialists  and imperialists. It  is  a  laughable

matter. Nobody will believe it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the tragedy of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the one hand, the Dutch are

colonialists  occupying other people's territory  by

force -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The British are not, eh?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and hoping to persist in

their  imperialist  policy of  divide  and  rule  by

force. We in the Barisan Sosialis -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - are uncompromisingly anti-colonial and though a mere Opposition Party with no

power  whatsoever  are nevertheless  struggling  for

genuine  unity and reunification of the territories.

Yes,  that reminds me, what of the P.A.P.? What  are

they? I think they are worse than Dutchmen. At least

the   Dutch   are   open   colonialists   and   open

imperialists. But the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are Russians.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - are a sham. They are helping

the  colonial  forces  to  impose  Malaysia  on  the

people.  They  are helping to impose on  the  people

some  constitutional arrangement that will not  give

equality, justice, democracy, unity and independence

to  the people. [Interruption] They are only helping

to impose colonialism in a new guise. As we are part

of  Afro-Asia -  he cannot stand it; he  has  to  run

away.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Queenstown

makes provocative remarks like that, I do not wonder

that he is interrupted time and again in his speech.

A  Member  is  entitled to walk out of this  Chamber

with decorum, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



I  think  any Member who passes provocative  remarks

about a Member who is walking out of this Chamber is

disorderly himself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I apologise, Sir. Anyway, as

part  of Afro-Asia, we in Singapore should adopt  an

entirely different attitude, but the P.A.P. are  not

doing  that,  and  therefore  they  are  worse  than

Dutchmen. They can be said to be -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Russians.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - Tshombes, Syngman Rhees, Ngo

Dinh  Diems and Chiang Kai-sheks. That is what  they

are.  That  is  why the P.A.P. are  supporting  this

Malaysia scheme together with -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Chiang Kai-shek.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the British colonialists and

other Right-wing forces. But before I close on  this

theme,  one  last word on this "inevitability",  and

that  is  this. One thing is inevitable in the  next

general  elections - the P.A.P. will be  out  and  the

Ministers will be jobless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is sometimes a little entertaining to

listen  to  the Minister for Finance to see  how  he

ties himself into knots and contradictions. You will

remember he agreed that West Irian should go back to

the Indonesians. He ridiculed the volunteers, saying

that  it  is nonsense to fight, and yet he came  out

with a thesis that force would have to be used if no

other  way  was  possible.  Then  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  came  out  with his plea  for  a  peaceful

settlement. I was most touched by what he said,  and

we  all  share with him those sentiments. I said  as

much  in my opening speech. Probably when the Deputy

Prime Minister said that, he did not hear me when  I

first addressed the House on this issue. I said that

we  all hope for a peaceful settlement, and we  hope

that  those "first" shots will be the "last"  shots.

As   we  have  seen  in  the  newspapers,  even  the

Indonesian  people themselves, through Major-General

Jani,  Chief  of  West  Irian  Liberation  Operation

Staff, have also expressed their hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



that  some  peaceful solution will come out  of  the

West  Irian dispute. But I think we should  be  very

clear  on one point. However the dispute may develop

in  Indonesia  and West Irian, it  is  entirely  the

affair of the Indonesians themselves. We on our part

can  only  hope for peace. We cannot  say  that  the

settlement  must be by peace or that it must  be  by

war.  Whatever  the  method  the  Indonesian  people

themselves choose, we, as outsiders, have no say  on

the  matter.  If  the Indonesian people  think  that

force  has to be used, well, that is what it  should

be.  If they think that force is necessary, who  are

we  to say. "No, you just put down your guns and  be

shot at by the Dutch." Surely, that is not what  the

P.A.P. are  advocating.  Therefore,  we  are   not

inciting any one at all when we ask for support  for

the   Indonesians.  We  should  not  be   blind   to

realities.  The Dutch - as the Member for Thomson  has

said - have been holding on to West Irian by force. If

in   the  final  resort,  when  patience  has   been

completely  exhausted, as in the case  of  Goa,  the

Indonesian  people  take  up  arms  to   force   the

imperialists out of West Irian, then I say  that  we

support  the  Indonesian people. The issue  is  very

clear:  whether  we  support the  Indonesian  people

under  those circumstances, or we support the Dutch.

Let the House declare itself straightaway there.  It

is  a  simple decision and there is no need to argue

on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has accused us of making fierce speeches, shouting empty slogans and inciting the people to volunteer for something which they do not understand. He says he knows what war is. I do not know, Sir,I know that the Member for Anson knows what war is. He was a prisoner of war. I do

not  think  anyone on the Government  Front  Benches

knows anything about war. They do not know what  war

is. But I can tell them that I know what war is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear! Tell them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do know about war not only in

Singapore, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear! Where else do you

know about war?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was up in Kanchanaburi - the

death  railway,  Sir,I was there  for  about  nine

months, and then I finally came back. We had to push

trains for more than two weeks before we could  come

back.   We   had  to  push  trains - not  sitting   in

trains - over wrecked bridges. The first thing when we

arrived in Kanchanaburi - I can get witnesses to prove

it - we  were  nearly bombed to smithereens.  We  were

very lucky. We escaped the bombing by about 10 or 15

minutes.  I just want to tell the P.A.P. - it  is  not

that  I want to talk about it, Sir - that we know what

war  is - not the Deputy Prime Minister whose only war

experience consisted of carrying bed-pans.  That  is

not  war  experience. For a person  who  was  merely

mewling  and puking in a nurse's arms - as it  were - to

try  to  tell  people who have war experience  about

war, is laughable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are a stooge of the

British then, are you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister made

a plea that there should be no war. The Minister for

Finance  contradicted him by  saying  that  when  it

became  necessary he did not mind war.  He  did  not

mind war if it was a quick one - if it was going to be

a   blitzkrieg.  He  would  mind  if  the  war   was

protracted.  Under those circumstances,  he  thought

the  Indonesian  people would suffer  and  that  the

Indonesian economy would not be able to stand up  to

the  strain. That is the thesis of the Minister  for

Finance.  Of  course, when they come to  that,  they

must  link  it  up  with the Barisan  Sosialis.  The

Minister for Finance quoted the other day,  and  the

Prime   Minister   himself  quoted  again   tonight,

passages  from  the  speech made by  the  Secretary-General  of  the Barisan Sosialis at the mass  rally

held in Geylang Serai two Sundays ago. They want  to

give   the  impression  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis

advocates violence, because then it will all link up

with  their smear campaign that the Barisan Sosialis

is   a   Communist  front  organisation.  The  Prime

Minister quoted almost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



the  same  passages which the Minister  for  Finance

quoted  the other night. But let me tell them  this.

In  their  quotations,  they  made  sure  that  they

twisted  and  distorted the whole thing.  Paragraphs

were  quoted  out of context; in one paragraph  they

quoted  only  the second half. I will  only  mention

three  paragraphs in this paper from which the Prime

Minister  has quoted today, and I will show  how  he

has  tried  to give a false and distorted impression

to  the  people.  One - may  I  read  the  passage  in

Mandarin,  Sir, and it is also from the  same  paper

which he quoted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English):

`Indonesia  is  a  peace loving and  neutral  strong

force  in South-East Asia. India is the same and  so

is Burma. Cambodia and Ceylon are also the same.'



<br><br>This passage was not quoted, but the following words

were  quoted - the words which I will now read - by  the

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No mention was made of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And these are the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English):

`South-East Asia is becoming from day to day a peace-loving territory. The Western bloc in Laos and South

Korea have their puppet governments whose powers are

going  from bad to worse, and they are meeting  with

more  and  more difficulties. The West and the  pro-colonialist countries are afraid of and dissatisfied

with  the neutral and free people countries who  are

peace-loving for their influence in this region.'



<br><br>I  will give my own translation. I am not very  good

at   it,  but  this  will  do,  I  think.  It  says,

`Indonesia is a great force for peace and neutrality

in  South-East Asia. India is the same; Burma  also,

Ceylon  and  Cambodia.' And the rest  [Interruption]

And  therefore, there was a definite  distortion  in

what  the  Prime Minister has said. And  I  wish  to

correct that distortion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quotation which I would like to bring

to your notice, Sir, is this, and I wilt read. These

are me same words but his interpretation is entirely

different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English):

`Colonialism  cannot  depend on  any  constitutional

arrangements from top to bottom to be ended in  this

way.'



<br><br>He  made it to mean, and he made great play  of  the

translation   given   by   the   Interpreter,   that

"Colonialism cannot be" -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Settled or ended.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All right. "- settled or ended

by  constitutional  means". Now,  that  is  a  wrong

translation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir,Is the

Member  allowed  to quarrel with an  Interpreter  of

this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not the judge as to what is the

correct interpretation. That will come later  on,  I

take  it, when points are raised on the matter. Now,

if  the  Member  for Queenstown indicates  what  his

translation  is, then perhaps we can compare.  I  do

not know what his translation is yet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will endeavour to give you

the  translation, Sir. And you can confirm this with

the  Interpreter  again. The  translation  is  this:

`That   colonialism   will  not   be   finished   by

constitutional imposition, by people who are sitting

on  the top.' In other words, colonialism cannot  be

ended by manipulation of constitutional arrangements

by  people  who  happen to control  power.  That  is

exactly what it means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.

Where are those words -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Those few words are -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is getting to be a

"brawling" house. Let us have some order. The Member

for  Queenstown now has the Floor. Let us hear  what

he has to say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The few words, Sir, I will read

it in Mandarin. It is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version In English): `From

top to bottom.'



<br><br>The  literal  translation is: "From top to  bottom."

And  it  means  "imposition  from  above,  something

imposed  on the people." That is the actual  meaning

and  not just constitutional arrangements. I do  not

know  the standard of Chinese of the Prime Minister,

but  I  can  easily  say that mine  is  better,  and

definitely much better than that of the Minister for

Finance!   There  is  no  running  away   from   it.

[Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So that again proves how the

Prime Minister has distorted and twisted the meaning

of simple words to suit his meaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a very serious point

of order. Is it proper for the Member to say that  I

distorted  the interpretation of that  word  when  I

carefully  repeated what the Interpreter said  those

words meant? I read it out. The Interpreter read it.

I  heard it over the interpretation. I just repeated

what  the Interpreter said. I am not vying with  the

Member  for  Queenstown as a linguist of  the  Sino-English   language.   I  just  repeated   what   the

Interpreter said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to me to be a very important

point  and,  therefore,  I  think  the  Member   for

Queenstown   is   entitled   to   say    what    his

interpretation is. It has been made quite  an  issue

of  in this debate. I think we must leave it at that

and  let those who read the record make up their own

minds.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On another point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. I have read this

particular  passage  in question, and  I  too  have

sought  the  opinion  of people  whose  standard  of

education  in Chinese is not only higher  than  mine

but   also  higher  than  that  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The point of order being this:

that  where  there is a difference of interpretation

of  what the words mean, how could the Assembly,  as

an Assembly, get authoritative opinion on what those

words  mean,  so that we will not be misled  by  the

individual's  interpretation, to my  mind  even  the

eccentric  interpretation put forward by the  Member

for Queenstown?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As far as I can assist in this

matter,  the  official  record  will  not  have  the

Mandarin   words,  but  will  have  the  interpreted

version,  the  Prime Minister's version  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. When the Prime Minister read

those  passages,  he  said he  would  give  his  own

interpretation of them. Members can see whether  his

interpretation  corresponds with the  interpretation

of  the  Interpreter. The Interpreters have  a  very

difficult job, and I have allowed the interpretation

of  those passages because it seems to me  to  be  a

very  important  matter. All we  have  then  is  the

Official  Record which will place before the  reader

the  interpretation as propounded not  only  by  the

Prime  Minister  but also by the  Interpreters,  and

also  the interpretation as propounded by the Member

for Queenstown, and again by the Interpreters as the

Member for Queenstown read that passage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is very simple explanation,

Sir. I think anybody who knows Chinese will come  to

the  same conclusion as I have in my explanation  to

you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Queenstown is entitled to say that at this juncture.

All  he  can say is that that is his interpretation.

He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



cannot  say whether his interpretation is  right  or

the Prime Minister's interpretation is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is best.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very well, Sir. I will then

come  to the third point which I want to raise about

the  quotation  and it is this. The  Prime  Minister

quoted   the   last  part  of  it -   two   or   three

sentences - and omitted to quote the preceding two  or

three  sentences. I will first quote what the  Prime

Minister quoted. He quoted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly Interpreter's version in English): `All

of us are peace loving.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, I have read that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - `But let all see clearly that

we love freedom all the more.'



<br><br>He  interpreted these words to mean that we advocate

violence.  Let  me  now  quote  the  preceding   two

sentences. That will help to clarify any doubts that

we may have on this issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have no doubts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And the words are as follows,

Sir,I will read first in Mandarin, and then I will

give you my translation of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Assembly interpreter's version in English): `We

do  not  want  to make use of force to  achieve  our

ends.  We hope that we can avoid using arms. We  are

all  peace-loving. Let all see clearly that we  love

freedom all the more.'



<br><br>The  translation will read as follows:  `We  do  not

want  to use force to achieve our objective. We hope

we can avoid using force. We all love peace -'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But we love freedom more.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot understand Members on the

Government Bench at all. I am trying to follow  this

argument and I find it very difficult if there is  a

running commentary from the Government Benches. As I

have  indicated, the Government speakers  have  been

heard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



in  silence.  Then let the Member for Queenstown  be

heard  in  silence.  Could the Member  commence  his

translation again?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> `But let us make it very clear.

We love freedom even more.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is the use of it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

Finance  is  now  becoming very  disorderly.  He  is

disregarding  the  authority of the  Chair.  I  have

certain  powers  and  I do not  want  to  use  those

powers. He must not disregard the authority  of  the

Chair. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As mentioned by the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang,  these words, Sir,  are  words  not

spoken by an ordinary mortal. They are the words  of

President  Soekarno himself. He made it  very  clear

that   "We   love  freedom  even  more   under   any

circumstances." These are sentiments also  expressed

by  us  in the Barisan Sosialis. And I am sure every

right-thinking  man  will  also  express  the   same

sentiments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No. I do not want to add much

more,  Sir. I will wind up. The issue is very  clear

and the lesson also is very clear. The -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Queenstown is

misleading the House when he says that those are the

sentiments of President Soekarno. My pint  of  order

is  this:  the words that are being quoted here  are

the  words  of the Secretary-General of the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  not a quotation from  the  speech  of

President Soekarno.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Finance perhaps

never heard the Member for Queenstown correctly. Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was telling the House, Sir,

that  the issue is clear and the lesson is also very

cleat.  The  West Irian issue is part  of  a  global

struggle  of  oppressed peoples against colonialism.

Some  people  seem  to believe that  colonialism  is

already  dead. According to the Prime Minister,  the

back-seat driver is no more there. But we  know  the

back-seat driver is still there. Colonialism is  not

dead.  This has been proved by what is happening  in

Algeria,  the Cameroons, the Congo, Angola, Northern

Rhodesia,  Kenya, recently Goa and now  West  Irian.

The  lesson is that colonialism will not retreat  of

its  own  accord.  In  order to  gain  our  freedom,

equality,    justice,   democracy,   progress    and

prosperity,  we  must keep up a relentless  struggle

against  colonialism. We want a peaceful  settlement

whenever possible. In the present West Irian  issue,

the  peaceful overtures of the Indonesians have been

met   with   force   from  the  intransigent   Dutch

colonialists. Under the circumstances, we, like more

than  half of the people in the world, and like  the

United Arab Republic and others, wish to express our

admiration for the courage and determination of  the

Indonesian  people. We call on all in  Singapore  to

support  the  Indonesian people in  their  just  and

legitimate struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, when I

was not in this Assembly for the express purpose  of

not  interrupting the Member for Queenstown,  I  was

informed  that the Member for Choa Chu Kang  alleged

that  the draft of the joint statement made  by  Dr

Djuanda and myself was the work of Mr Woodhull  and

the  Member  for  Upper Serangoon.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  subsequently  alleged  that  the   draft

statement was done by Mr Woodhull and an Indonesian

official and that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



was  very  unhappy when I discovered that the  draft

includes  West Irian. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  draw  the

attention  of the House to the fact that the  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon, who is alleged to have  known

what  took place, did not have the temerity  himself

to say this in this Chamber, but had done so via the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang who cannot claim  he  knew

anything about it. All I need say is that I have not

known, either the Member for Upper Serangoon or  Mr

Sandra Woodhull to have ever expressed any desire as

was stated in the memorandum that there should be  a

peaceful settlement in the West Irian dispute.  This

is an utter misrepresentation of what took place.  I

am  sorry that both the Member for Choa Chu Kang and

the Member for Queenstown, who knew nothing of these

matters,   have  lent  credence  to   a   completely

irresponsible falsehood.
