<div align="center"><b>COMPLAINT ON MATTER OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVILEGE AFFECTING MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members will recollect

that  on  the 4th day of December, 1961, I read  to

this  House a reply dated the 30th November,  1961,

received  by  the, Clerk from the  Commissioner  of

Police, Singapore, in relation to the resolution of

the  Assembly agreed to on the 29th November, 1961,

regarding the matter of privilege reported  to  the

Assembly  by the Leader of the House affecting  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education.  The Commissioner of Police stated  then

that he had ordered an immediate investigation  and

would  be  submitting  the  results  to  the  State

Advocate-General as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further letter dated the 19th December, 1961,

has   been   received  by  the   Clerk   from   the

Commissioner of Police. It

reads as follows : -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly Resolution of 29th November, 1961.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to my letter of 30th November. 1961, I

regret   to  inform  you  that  although  detailed

investigations have been carried out, it  has  not

proved   possible  to  deal  with   the   culprits

according  to the law because of lack of  evidence

of identification.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COURT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL REPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yesterday the Member for Farrer

Park,  during the course of the debate on the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's  Speech,  alleged   that   the

President  of the Industrial Arbitration Court  had

failed  to furnish an Annual Report as required  by

the   Industrial  Relations  Ordinance,  1960,  and

invited  me to consider whether such failure  could

be considered to be an affront to this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2660</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 83 of the Industrial Relations

Ordinance. 1960, reads as follows:-

<pre>

  'Annual   83.      The President shall, once in each year, furnish to

reports              the Minister for presentation to the Legislative

                     Assembly a report on the working of the provisions of

                     this Ordinance relating to the Court, to arbitration

                     and to the registration of collective agreements and

                     of any other provisions of the Ordinance in relation to

                     which he considers it appropriate to report, and in

                     particular the extent to which the objects of the

                     Ordinance have been achieved and any considerations or

                     circumstances which have prevented or hindered the

                     achievement of those objects.'.

</pre>



<br><br>The  Ordinance does not make it an offence if the

President  of  the  Industrial Arbitration  Court

fails to furnish to the Minister the Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, however, that the President is

under  a  direct statutory obligation  to  comply

with    the    provisions   of   the   Ordinance.

Nevertheless  any failure by hint to  do  so,  of

itself, cannot, in my view, he considered  to  be

an  affront to this Assembly. It seems to me that

the  obligation is an obligation on the  part  of

the  President  to  furnish  the  Report  to  the

Minister, and it is the Minister in turn  who  is

under a responsibility to this Assembly to ensure

that the Report is received and presented to this

Assembly. In other words, it is the Minister  who

in  the  first instance is answerable to  the  As

sembly for the default, if any, of the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the Minister or any other Member

has  satisfied  himself that  there  has  been  a

default  on the part of the President  which,  in

the   Minister's  or  the  Member's  view,  would

warrant the intervention of this Assembly, it  is

open to the Minister or the Member to move for an

Order in the matter and for this Assembly to make

the Order if it so thinks fit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bound to say, however, that it is doubtful

whether  any such Order could be effective  under

our present Privileges Ordinance. It is certainly

intended  that such an Order would  be  effective

under  the provisions of the Legislative Assembly

(Privileges,  Immunities and Powers)  Bill  which

has   recently  been  committed   to   a   Select

Committee.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>

<br><br>2.36 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

understand from the Leader of the House  that  with

the  agreement of Opposition Members, the House  at

the  end  of  the  debate on  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  Speech will adjourn to a further  sitting

next  month,  may  I take this opportunity  to  say

that  the  Government  is  prepared  to  appoint  a

Commission  of  Inquiry  in  accordance  with   the

spirit  of  the  motion tabled by  the  Member  for

Anson  and the Member for Joo Chiat which reads  as

follows



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

recommend  the  appointment  of  a  Commission  to

enquire  into  the Government's Education  Policy,

its content and administration in all fields other

than  vocational and technical education,  and  to

make recommendations.'.



<br><br>However,  on the 19th of December, the  Member  of

Anson  wrote further to me suggesting an  amendment

to the motion by adding the following words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'including the six-day week and political

activities   and  machinations  in   primary   and

secondary schools, the extent thereof and the

persons and organisations responsible therefor.'.



<br><br>I  wish  to state, Sir, that Government is prepared

to  extend  the scope of the terms of reference  of

the  proposed Commission of Inquiry to include  the

six-day  week  and  to investigate  into  political

activities  and  machinations in  schools.  But  as

Government   has  already  agreed  to   appoint   a

Commission  of Inquiry into the recent  examination

boycott  as  proposed by the Member for Anson,  the

political  machinations behind the  boycott  would

be  dealt  with under this Commission. In  view  of

Government's  intention to appoint a Commission  of

Inquiry  along  the general lines proposed  by  the

Member  for Anson, the exact terms of reference  of

the   Commission  of  Inquiry  will,  however,   be

announced later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2662</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former statement to the Member for Farrer

Park   during  the  recent  debate  on  the  1962

Estimates, indicating the early announcement of a

revised  version of the six-day week for  primary

schools in 1962, will therefore have to be put in

to  cold  storage and not implemented  until  the

Commission of Inquiry to be set up has  completed

its findings.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you,

Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that I am indebted to

the  Minister for taking this question out of the

political  field? I would like to  enquire,  Sir,

whether it would not be appropriate to have  just

one Commission instead of two, as I gather he has

in  mind, and the one Commission can then make an

interim  report  on the political activities  and

machinations  including  the  troubles   in   the

Chinese middle schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is most

desirable  that the two issues be  kept  separate

and I think it is essential to go deeper into the

examination boycott.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  accept that and I would enquire at  this

stage whether it would be appropriate to withdraw

item 4 from the Order Paper.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is provision in the Standing

Order,  which I think the Clerk will indicate  to

the hon. Member, as to how that should be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourn

1961],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to

the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

which  he  delivered on behalf of the Government

at  the  opening of the present session of  this

Assembly.".'.-(Deputy Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2663</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>2.41 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now continue

from where I left off yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I talked about certain allegations

made  by Members of the Opposition and I will deal

with some of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of debate on the Yang di- Pertuan Negara's speech, the Opposition Members,

especially those in the Barisan Sosialis  and  the

Member for Hong Lim, made certain allegations  and

accusations  which were not quite  artistic.  They

tried to draw a picture of a dragon which was  not

realistic and certain parts of the picture had  to

be  painted  over by other artistic painters.  The

picture drawn by them was incorrect and very  poor

indeed.  Before we talk about poverty, we have  to

take  the  economic  situation in  Singapore  into

consideration.  If we are faced with  an  economic

situation which cannot meet our requirements, then

we  will have to look for other avenues to help us

tide over it. In recent months, the Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis have not tried to help  us  with

improving  our  economic position.  On  the  other

hand, they accuse us of having put our economy  in

a  predicament. Because the people are poor,  they

are  unable to buy goods. This contributes to  the

poor market and products are not easily sold.  The

blame  for some of these things should, to a great

extent,  be  put on the shoulders of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  When  merger  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  achieved,  our products  will  have  a

larger  market, and this will help to improve  our

economic  situation.  This is  one  of  the  steps

towards  this aim. But the Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis have been trying hard to hinder this move

towards merger.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated already

that  there  can be no reference to  merger  which

will  excite  a  debate. The hon. Member  is  just

doing  that when he says the Barisan Sosialis  are

trying  to  hinder merger. He must  not  touch  on

merger in that strain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2664</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I was only mentioning it in passing. I  will

now continue with another part.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I indicated to the Member for Toa

Payoh  yesterday that merger must not be  referred

to in that strain even in passing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  now  let  me  reply to the Barisan  Sosialis

accusations  regarding certain situations  in  the

rural  areas. They mentioned street lights, water,

electricity   supplies.  On  these  questions   my

colleagues already replied yesterday. The Minister

for National Development also replied. But I would

give a further reply to certain points raised.  In

the  speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it is

clearly   stated   that   we   will   build   more

agricultural  stations next year,  and  will  send

more agricultural officers and veterinary officers

to  carry out services in the rural areas in  this

respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. We will increase medical

services  and  veterinary services.  The  services

rendered  to chickens in the past have been  super

seded.  We are using scientific methods  to  treat

chickens  and  other domestic animals  and  reduce

their   fatality.  On  the  other  hand,  we   are

increasing  the production of chickens  and  other

domestic animals. This will help the farmers to  a

certain extent. We will also introduce many  kinds

of scientific methods to enable the farmers to use

these  methods to improve their agricultural  work

and to compete with old methods. There is proof to

show   that   agricultural  products   have   been

increased this year. In the past our market was  a

consumers'  market, but nowadays we  are  able  to

export  our agricultural produce. This is concrete

proof of the achievements by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now I have been talking about

the  rearing  of chickens. Now I will mention  the

feeding of pigs in Singapore. These past few years

we  have  been importing pigs of good strain  from

Europe and America and these have been sold at one-tenth the original cost. This also is to help  the

farmers   in  their  production.  In  agricultural

experiment situations the chickens hatched every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2665</b></font><br><br>

month  are sold to the farmers at very low prices. In  all  these fields we have been trying to  help

the  farmers increase their produce by the aid  of

scientific  methods.  We will  show  them  how  to

achieve  artificial breeding of domestic  animals.

This will also help them to a great extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about fisheries. On this

question,  in  order to increase  their  production

and  reduce their costs, we have been teaching them

how   to   use   new  fishing  boats  and   fishing

implements  and  we  have  been  supplying  certain

fishing  implements to them. We have conducted  for

them  courses  in fishery. In the  coming  year  we

will  establish more of such schools teaching these

courses  along the east coast. This is to  increase

the  technique of the fishermen in order to  enable

them  to make a living and be able to compete  with

others  in the business of catching fish.  We  have

also  established  a mobile motor  service  station

which  is  to help repair fishing boats on request.

Certain  officers will proceed to the  place  where

such  services are required to repair  their  motor

boats.  As to the question of fishermen on  certain

islands,  we have this year already carried  out  a

scheme  of distributing goats to them. My colleague

will give details of this scheme later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, besides agriculture and

fishery,  we  have been providing tractors  to  the

farmers  to help increase their production  and  to

reduce  labour hands and thus reduce their cost  of

production. This service has been well received  by

the  farmers.  We  have also established  a  mobile

teaching  institution to teach the farmers  how  to

take  care  of  their lands and how  to  carry  out

agricultural and other activities. The  aim  is  to

help  the  farmers  increase their  production  and

reduce  their cost of production and  in  this  way

help them generally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all these measures are not

directed  at  helping  the  farmers  in  the  rural

areas,  then  I  cannot  understand  what  can   be

construed   as  helping  the  farmers.  I   believe

everybody will agree with me, that the lot  of  the

farmers cannot be improved just by shouting  a  few

slogans.  The Members of the Barisan Sosialis  have

claimed themselves to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2666</b></font><br><br>

revolutionaries.  If  they are  really  concerned

with the livelihood of the farmers, then let them

do  something to help the economic development of

Singapore and not hamper it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will talk about the shortage

of arable land, which the Opposition Members have

been talking about during these few days. The Gov

ernment  has  already taken steps  this  year  to

reclaim  lands  in the Sungei Poyang  area.  This

project  will  be completed at the  beginning  of

next  year. After completion the land can be  put

to  three uses. First, the land reclaimed can  be

used  to  grow  vegetables.  Secondly,  the  land

reclaimed can be used for fish ponds to  increase

production.  Thirdly, certain lands  can  provide

prawn ponds. All these will help to increase  the

agricultural products for the needs of Singapore.

In  this  way we will be helping the  farmers  in

their livelihood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the debate, I can come to

this conclusion. For the record, I will point out

to this House that in the modern political arena,

there  are  two ways in which you  take  part  in

political activities. One is where the activities

are carried out in accordance with constitutional

means to improve the lot of the people, and  with

the  consent  of the people. This  has  been  our

policy all

along.  The  second  way is to  create  political

trouble  and  damage  the  economic  position  of

Singapore  behind  the scenes, thereby  hampering

the  livelihood  of the people, to  arouse  their

dissatisfaction, and to urge or  excite  them  to

seize political power. This way is adopted by the

Barisan Sosialis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to avoid this tragedy

occurring   in  Singapore,  I  hope  the   policy

statement  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  can  be

realised  and that Singapore will merge with  the

Federation of Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the important question

in  Singapore  today,  the question  that  is  in

everybody's    mind,   is   the    question    of

unemployment. The Government have indicated  that

they  hoped  to  ease  the  unemployment  problem

through industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2667</b></font><br><br>

expansion, But we are told, Sir, in the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

this is Hansard, Vol. 15, col. 13:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before, however, any significant improvement in

the  economic  and  industrial expansion  can  take

place, there must be brought

about a situation of political certainty and

stability, within which it will be possible for

long-term investment of capital to be planned with

confidence.'

<br><br>Sir,  His Excellency says, "must be brought about".

That  indicates that it does not exist today.  Sir,

may  I  refer you to an earlier Hansard,  Vol.  11,

No. 1 of 1st July, 1959, in col. 7. It says here

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The political stability which is a pre-requisite

for  expansion  and which has been lacking  for  so

long, has been achieved by the election

with  an  overwhelming  majority  of  a  Government

whose   declared   policies   are   clear-cut   and

unambiguous.'

<br><br>It says that in 1959, Sir, this stability has

been  achieved. Again in 1960, Sir, - I refer you  to

Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 1, col. 5  -  it says here  in

line 9:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... Singapore has enjoyed greater political

and economic stability than it has known during

the last 15 years.'



<br><br>Sir,  we were told in 1959 that stability had  been

achieved.   In   1960  we  were  enjoying   greater

stability than was ever known in 15 years. In  1961

we   are  told  that  we  must  go  and  find  that

stability;  "bring it about". May I  ask  what  has

happened  to  the stability that has  already  been

achieved?  Sir, I doubt whether what has been  lost

can be regained, because when the Government had  a

powerful  majority of 43 against 8, they  lost  the

stability that was already there. Now with  a  weak

26,  it is not likely and not easy that they  could

regain  the stability they have, lost. The  trouble

is  this. There can be no political stability where

there is political corruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, non-P.A.P. citizens have chosen non-P.A.P.

members    to    represent    them    in    certain

constituencies. They have indicated in no uncertain

terms  that  they have rejected a P.A.P. candidate.

They  do  not want a P.A.P. candidate to  represent

them.  They  want somebody else. And what  happens?

They  have  a  right,  Sir - political  franchise - to

choose  whom  they  like. The Government,  if  they

recognise political franchise, if  they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2668</b></font><br><br>

claim  that  Singapore  has  political  franchise,

must  recognise the representative that  has  been

chosen   by   the  people.  But  not  the   P.A.P.

Government,  Sir. They force their representatives

on  the  people. In divisions where the electorate

have chosen other than the P.A.P. representatives,

they  have  been  forced to accept the  leadership

from P.A.P. Assemblymen or defeated candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope you will allow me to quote one more

example,  Sir, to substantiate my accusation  that

there is political corruption. When the school  at

Guillemard was built with public funds, [Laughter]

- the  Minister laughs; he knows what this  is  all

about because he is guilty of it - that school  was

built. What happened? When the people went  there

they  did not see the leader that they had chosen.

They  did  not see the person they chose as  their

representative, but a P.A.P. Assemblyman

from  a neighbouring constituency was brought into

that   constituency   to   act   as   leader   and

representative of the people to open that  school.

Sir,  the electorate have indicated whom they want

as their leader. Why must they be forced to accept

a  neighbouring leader to come and lead them?  Why

must  the leader that they have chosen be  brushed

aside?  Sir,  I  take it this is  an  attempt  to

confuse  the public into thinking that the  P.A.P.

Assemblyman is their leader and to make  them  get

used to the idea that the P.A.P. Assemblyman,  the

P.A.P.,  is  their  leader.  [Laughter]  Sir,  the

Minister  laughs.  I tell him  this.  I  have  won

Mountbatten in a

clean  fight  in  the last election,  and  if  the

P.A.P. wants Mountbatten, let them fight it  in  a

clean fight in the next election and not rob me of

the constituency.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Mountbatten is perhaps getting too excited. It is

not too good for this Chamber. It is not too good

for  the  Speaker.  But I would  suggest  to  the

Members  of the Government Front Benches  not  to

deal with these matters with such frivolity and

not  to sneer at remarks passed by the Opposition

Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2669</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sorry, Sir, I take it that

not only am I robbed of my

constituency, but the constituents are  robbed  of

their  leader too. The same attempt has been  made.

It  was  not an oversight because this has happened

more  than  once.  When  the Mountbatten  community

centre was opened, as has been mentioned before,  I

was  not  even invited. In Joo Chiat you knew  what

happened,  Sir, It  has  been  mentioned  that   a

defeated candidate was asked to open that centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be political stability when there

is  such  political corruption? Sir,  public  funds

have  been  spent not on improving the lot  of  the

people  or  the  State, but to pay  P.A.P. cadres,

such  as  Political Secretaries  and  the  People's

Association's  staff. As I have said  before,  Sir,

the  P.A.P. cannot  deny this, because  the  staff

have been called upon and told that they either  be

loyal  or  be  asked  to quit. The  wishes  of  the

masses have been thoroughly ignored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are 60,000 unemployed, plus

the  thousands  that  will be leaving  school  each

year  who will be seeking jobs. It looks as if  the

P.A.P. is   unlikely  to  regain  the   political

stability  sought  to be brought about.  Then  what

happens?  If the solution of unemployment  lies  in

the   expansion  of  industry,  if  there   is   no

political stability, and it can

not  be obtained or regained by the P.A.P.,  I  ask

them,  Sir,  for  the  60,000  unemployed  and  the

children  who leave school, where do they  go  from

there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told in the speech of His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in  Hansard,

Vol.  15,  No.  1,  col. 23 (31st October,  1961),

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The problem that is always uppermost in the

deliberations of the Government is that

of unemployment. This problem has been partially

alleviated . . .'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says it has been "partially alleviated". I

cannot understand how it has been alleviated  when

in 1958 we find in statistics that there were

about 16,000 unemployed; in 1959, it went up  more

than  double, 36,000; and recently, at the end  of

1960, I think, in answer to one of my questions, I

think  the  figure  59,000 was  given.  Sir,  from

16,000  it has gone up to 59,000, and we are  told

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2670</b></font><br><br>

the  problem  has been alleviated. I  remember  the

P.A.P. did argue that the big number does not  mean

very  much because it was their confidence  in  the

new Government that made them rush to register. The

unemployed  had  always  been  there,  but  it  was

because  of  their confidence in the new Government

that they have come on to the register now. Sir, if

you  read  the  Annual  Report  of  the  State   of

Singapore,  1959, page 133, statistics  there  show

that  this argument is not very logical unless  the

unemployed has a funny logic. In 1955, out of 1,381

registrants   of  unemployment,  368   were   given

employment, that is about 25 per cent roughly. Then

in  1959,  out of 3,059 registered, only  313  were

given employment, which was less than in 1955. This

is only about 10 per cent. Sir, when 25 per cent of

those  who  registered were given  employment,  the

unemployed had no confidence to register, but  when

only  10  per  cent registered, they  had  all  the

confidence in the world and 59,000 people rushed to

register. Sir, I am sure that is not very  logical.

But that is the way the Ministers have argued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there has been a lot of talk about

industrial  expansion. We have been  told  in  the

same  Hansard as I have read just now, i.e.,  Vol.

15,  No.  1,  col. 23, which says the unemployment

problem has been partially alleviated; it goes  on

to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...by the present boom in the building industry

and  the  gradual  materialisation  of  plans  for

industrialisation.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that plans for industrialisation are

materialising and there is a boom in, the building

industry.  Yet,  Sir, if we look  in  the  Malayan

statistics, it shows that in the industrial field,

manufacturing shows 50,878 employed  in  1958  and

42,945  in 1960, both in September, the difference

is  7,933,  nearly  8,000.  8,000  labourers  less

employed  in  manufacturing, but we say  that  our

industry is expanding and the expansion is  taking

in more unemployed people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that there is a building boom when in

the   same  statistics  it  shows  that   in   the

construction   section,  there   is   3,159   less

labourers employed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2671</b></font><br><br>

Sir,   we  do  not  know  which  to  believe   the

statistics   or   the  statement.  Anyway,   about

unemployment,  up  to  June  1959,  there  was  an

unemployment  relief scheme which gives  temporary

relief  to the unemployed. There was, I think,  in  1959   before   June  1,165  who  were   receiving

anything  between $3 and $5 with  two  katties  of

rice  and one katty of sugar to take home to their

families.  This  was  abolished  immediately   the

P.A.P. came in, and was substituted by  the  Work

Brigade.  Sir,  what is the Work Brigade?  We  all

know  the  meaning  of  "work",  but  what  is   a

"brigade"?  The  Oxford  Dictionary  gives   three

meanings:  Subdivision of army  (and  its  description),  uniformed  workers  and  disciplining  and

occupying boys. Sir, is our Work Brigade an  army?

Are  they  workers  or are they  delinquents  that

need  to be disciplined? The Government have said,

in  answer to some attempts to form a union,  that

they  are  not workers. They cannot form  a  union

because  they  are not workers. Then  are  they  a

subdivision  of  any army or are they  delinquents

meant  to  be disciplined? We all know what  they

are,  Sir.  We have seen what they have been  used

for,   because   the   P.A.P. has   turned    an

unemployment  relief scheme into  a  Work  Brigade

spending  $7  million  not,  as  stated  in   this

report, to expand opportunities for work. It  says

here:  it has been used to build an army to  fight

the   P.A.P. political  battle.  It   has   been

organised  to form a section of workers  who  will

be   depending   on  the  P.A.P.  Government   for

survival and must therefore of necessity be  loyal

to  them.  So they thought. We knew what happened.

To  stand  on  the  roads  and  cheer  the  P.A.P.

whenever  they come to this Chamber the first  day

of Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959, the P.A.P. came to power with an

overwhelming  majority - 43 against  8.  That  shows

the  people accepted their policies and have given

them  a  full mandate to implement these policies.

It  shows the people had confidence and trust both

in  their  policies  and in  the  Party.  All  the

people  wanted were employment, houses,  food  and

water, peace



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2672</b></font><br><br>

and  stability,  personal freedom, good  education

for  their  children, a just, honest  and  sincere

government. They were promised these, Sir. But the

question  is: Have these promises been  fulfilled?

What  is the position today? Today there are  very

many  more unemployed than ever before.  Sir,  the

promise  of  solution  of  unemployment  has  been

given, but we find there are more unemployed  than

ever  before.  Sir,  I  say  that  the  misery  of

unemployment and other miseries that have befallen

Singapore have been brought by the P.A.P. due  to

their neglect of duty to the people and the State,

due  to  their arrogance, their mismanagement  and

their political corruption. In 2½ years they  have

spent  millions of dollars of public  funds;  they

have  used  almost every Government department  to

build  up  a  little P.A.P. empire.  The  people's

welfare has been postponed from year to year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Hansard of Vol. 13, No. 1 (20th July

1960),  col. 5, we have been told, Sir, that  "The

first  year  of  office was one of reorganisation,

consolidation  and preparation. It  was  taken  up

largely  with clearing the ground and setting  the

course  for  the year of construction ....".  But,

recently,  Sir,  the Deputy Prime  Minister,  when

moving the motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara,  said that between 1959 and 1961, that  is

the  first  year,  "We  first  took  over  the  Government,  we had to feel our way."  he  says  the

first year was "feeling our way". here it says the

first   year   was  planning,  the   second   year

construction, which means, first year plan, second

year  action. Here it says the first year was only

"feeling  our way", second year was for plans  for

economic development, and only the second half  of

1961  marks the beginning of implementation. Well,

I  hope,  Sir, the calendar will not be moved  one

year  back again; it has already been  moved  one

year   back;  first  year  planning,  second  year

implementation,  and  now  we  hear   first   year

"feeling  our  way", second year, planning,  third

year,  implementation. I hope something  new  will

not be invented next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2673</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Third year - acceleration.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, as I have said, they

have failed to give employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one is housing. Have they succeeded? As

you know, Sir, they built practically nothing the

first year. When they were exposed here in answer

to  some  of  my  questions as to the  number  of

houses built, and when it was found that they had

built  practically nothing, they conveniently  at

that time blamed the Member for Hong Lim. But now

that  they have built some, Sir, what do we find?

Rents are terribly high; the people cannot afford

the  rents; and there are lots of houses  vacant.

Now,  Sir,  at a time when thousands are  on  the

waiting list, Government keeps the houses vacant.

As  high as 18 per cent of the one-room,  16  per

cent of the two-room and 6 per cent of the three-room  premises are vacant, Sir, In all, it  comes

to  a  total  of  879  units  vacant.  There  are

thousands on the waiting list. Not only  are  the

rents  high,  but  they are  so  ridiculous  that

certain  portions of those houses  are  naturally

vacant  and are not likely to be occupied because

where  they  charge  $35  per  one-room  unit - the

kitchen,  water  closet, washing  facilities  are

communal  they charge $20 for a room  which  only

has the W.C. as a communal facility, the rest are

self-contained. Naturally, nobody wants  to  take

the  $35 type of unit. When I ask why, I was told

because  it was Mr Ong Eng Guan's plan. Sir,  we

do   not  care  whose  plan  it  was,  but   the

Government must do something. They must not leave

those houses vacant forever and ever and lose not

only  the rent, but the Housing Board has to  pay

assessment  to  the  Assessment  Department.  All

that, Sir, is unfair, because it adds to the cost

of  the house. This paying of assessment is  from

one Government Department to another. They do not

lose.  All that is added to the cost of the house

and the poor tenant eventually has to pay for the

shifting  of money from one Government Department

to another, which is really unfair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2674</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor which adds on to the rent which

makes  their  policy cock-eyed is  the  paying  of

property tax on vacant premises. It affects  other

people badly enough, Sir, but it also affects this

Housing   Board.  It  ,pays  property   tax   and,

therefore, as I have said, whatever they  lose  is

added on to the cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot can be done about housing. Far too

many  houses  are vacant for reasons  which  could

easily be rectified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sore point about housing are the

unauthorised huts. Instead of nipping  it  in  the

bud, as I have suggested right from the beginning,

as  in the case of those houses that have come  up

in  years  past, and to take a very  firm  control

over the future position to see that nobody builds

unauthorised huts, this sore has been  allowed  to

fester  and  fester and fester  until  now  it  is

almost  in  unmanageable proportions.  The  longer

they  delay, Sir, the more unauthorised huts there

will be and the bigger the problem will be and the

more difficult the solution. They should handle it

sooner,  authorise  the huts that  deserve  to  be

authorised - because having lived there for so  many

years  people  have nowhere to go - and  then  start

controlling either by legislation or otherwise  to

see  that no more unauthorised huts go up.  Unless

they  do  that, Sir, this sore is going to  fester

and  eventually be fatal, I am afraid. Just now  I

read  to you that the Government has claimed  that

there  is a building boom. But on page 28  of  the

"Malayan Statistics" of October 1961, we  see  the

lowest  number  of units built in  1960.  Sir,  in

1958, it was 437; in 1959, it was 774; in 1960, it

was  422;  and  in 1961 it was 266. In  all  these

cases,  the  period covered was  from  January  to

August. It was the lowest in 1961. Yet we are told

that  there  is a building boom. [Interruption]  I

agree that the building position has improved, but

I  would  not  call it a boom. It would  not  have

improved  if  the Government had  not  decided  to

rectify   their   detrimental  decision   on   the

development   charges   in   respect   of   water,

electricity and other services. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2675</b></font><br><br>

when they rectified that, the building trade began

to show a revival. But I say, Sir, that it has not

come to a satisfactory

position yet because developers now - leaving aside

those charges - are hesitating to build because of

the stupid decision to charge assessment on vacant

houses. I have shown just now how it has affected

the tenants; but now it affects the developers too

because if a house can be rented at $200 and a

developer decides to build 1,000 houses in an

estate, he pays assessment at the rate of 36 per

cent, which is $72. That means he pays $72,000

every month until his houses are sold. Sir, which

developer will not think twice before he

starts developing? In fact, the landlords too are

hesitating to expand their business here. They

would rather go to the Federation or any other

place where they

do not run the risk of facing bankruptcy

from having to pay assessment on vacant houses, if

their houses happen to be

vacant.  While superficially it seems to be capable

of  bringing  in  money for the Government,  it  is

destroying  the  building  trade.  It  is  no   use

blaming the Member for Hong Lim or Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis for not having done

their duty when they were on the other side of the

House. Because they were

the P.A.P.'s choice and if the P.A.P.

leaders  do  not have the quality of  choosing  the

right  men  to run their business, whose  fault  is

it, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another two essentials of life are food and

water.  Sir, I am sure you will agree with me  that

any stupid government can

supply  water during the rainy season.  But  it  is

the  sign of a good and efficient government  which

plans ahead or makes

adequate  arrangements to meet unexpected droughts.

On  page  14  of Hansard, Volume 15, No.  1,  dated

31st October, 1961, it is stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Concerning water supplies, the Tebrau

Waterworks in Johore has been recently extended  to

give an increased supply of 15 million gallons  per

day.  Furthermore, an agreement  to  extract  water

from  the  Scudai  River  in  Johore  was  recently

signed   and   the  construction  of   the   Scudai

Waterworks  will commence at the end of this  year.

The project is expected to take approximately two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2676</b></font><br><br>

years  to complete. The first phase of the Scudai

Scheme will produce a further 15 million gallons

per  day.  The Tebrau extension should  meet  our

ordinary needs until the

Scudai Scheme is completed.'.

<br><br>"our  ordinary needs", Sir. Does it mean that  if

there  are  further droughts next  year,  we  are

going  to have further water rationing until  the

Scudai  scheme  is completed,  in  the  next  two

years? If the Member for Farrer Park is right - and

he  should be, having had such experience in  the

City  Council before - that means even after  the

completion  of the Scudai scheme, we might  still

have  water  rationing. If they  cannot  give  us

employment and houses, at least give us water  to

drink.  What type of a government is  this  which

cannot give us water to drink?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is beer for?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is not what beer is

for. That is the P.A.P. mentality. The poor

cannot afford beer, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next to water is food. The poor and the

rich  need  food. This Government is a Government

that  claims to work for the poor. They plan  and

they  work  for  the poor. They are  chiefly  concerned with the poor. I was surprised to find  in

the  "Malayan Statistics" that the prices of food

which finds its way to the table of the poor have

gone up very much and the food that finds its way

to  the  table  of the rich and the middle  class

have gone down.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, it is impossible.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, definitely, Sir, In

the case of fish, it is the rich man who goes for

ikan bawal, pomfret, kurau, large prawns, and  so

on.  But  the poor people take ikan bilis,  selah

and  tamban.  If you look at the statistics,  the

food  that usually goes to the table of the  poor

has  gone  up quite a lot in price, by  about  18

cents  per katty, whereas the food for  the  rich

has gone down by about 20 cents per katty. I will

not  go  into details, but just to show you  that

the  food of the poor is going up. The Government

might  think that this is a frivolous  matter  to

bring up in this House, but I would like to point

out that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2677</b></font><br><br>

a  small rise in the price of food for the rich  is

nothing - it  would probably mean less  hoarding  of

money;  for the middle class, it might  mean  just

cutting  out  a bit of luxury; but for  the  poor,

Sir, it would mean malnutrition, weaker youth  for

our  next generation. It is no exaggeration,  Sir.

It would mean less resistance to disease. It would

also  mean that school children would be  affected

in their work if they are undernourished. I am not

speaking   as   a   woman  who   understands   the

difficulties of a housewife with a limited  purse,

but  I  am speaking as one who has been the principal  of  a  school right in the heart of Chinatown

and   has  seen  little  children  suffering  from

malnutrition. As a social worker, I  have  made  a

study  of it and I have found - without exaggeration -

that   it  does  affect  the  children.  If   the

Government  does  not want to bother  itself  with

visiting  these places and making  a  study,  they

just  have  to  read reports from the  F.A.O. and

E.C.A.F.E. which   stress  the   importance   of

nutrition. They have also stressed the dangers  of

malnutrition in the countries of South-East  Asia.

I  do  not know why they seem to be very frivolous

about  this, Sir, whenever we talk about children.

When  we  talked about the Chinese school children

the  last  time, the Prime Minister seemed  to  be

very  happy and he laughed over it. The Government

Members  always  laugh  when  the  dangers  facing

children  are pointed out to them. I do  not  know

why, Sir. Probably they are children themselves.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, in the health section

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, we  have

health. No extensions of hospitals or clinics  are

going to be sufficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2678</b></font><br><br>

if we do not take preventive measures to see that

diseases do not spread. I have complained and I am

complaining again, but the Minister says,  "It  is

typical  of  the Member for Mountbatten.  She  has

seen  me  in  my  office and she  brings  up  this

subject  here." Yes, Sir, because I  did  not  get

satisfaction. I took the trouble to go and see why

the  drains were blocked and I travelled up to the

sea  to  see where the boulders were. I then  told

him.  But  until  today the  drains  ate  just  as

blocked as on the first day I went to see him.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

details. Let us go into the general policies now.

Health  does  not  take steps to prevent  diseases

from  spreading,  in  spite  of  the  building  of

hospitals  and  clinics,  he  might  find  himself

running  a risk with disease germs. You just  have

to  look at Raffles Place and see the filth strewn

by  the hawkers. I am not blaming the hawkers.  In

fact,  I admire them for wanting to earn an honest

living   and   I   think  the  Government   should

appreciate  that  and help them by  allocating  to

them  a  proper  place so that there  will  be  no

danger to the health of the public in spite of the

hawkers earning a living. But, Sir, it is the  bad

administration - it is not the fault of the hawkers - that is making Raffles Place into what it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that the whole

trouble with the P.A.P. policy is that it has  not

been  an honest policy. The overall policy clearly

aims  at  eventually controlling  all  social  and

recreational    groups   through   the    People's

Association and the community centres, all workers

through  the T.U.C. which has now failed, all  the

unemployed  through  the  Work  Brigade,  all  the

effective politicians by giving them good posts of

$1,100  a month to do no harm, and all the farmers

and  rural  people through their associations.  In

this  way,  Sir,  the P.A.P. hope to  control  the

different  sections of the whole of the population

of Singapore. If this had been achieved, Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2679</b></font><br><br>

would  have got a one-Party dictatorial government

in  the next election. Thank God, their scheme  has

been foiled. Thank God,  the  public have seen through their strategy

and  have  realised that their standard of  living

has  been going down. On two occasions, thank God,

they  had  the  courage to reject the  P.A.P. and

showed  them  that they were no longer  wanted - at

Anson  and Hong Lim. The people have now  realised

that  the  unprecedented increase in  unemployment

and trouble in Singapore is the result of lack  of

stability and lack of confidence in the Government

brought about by P.A.P. political corruption.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  are debating the major annual Government

policy  speech a little late. It is now more  than

1½  months  since this policy speech was delivered

by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the Government

can  hardly  be  said to be paying His  Excellency

much  respect  by having pushed in  all  sorts  of

interjectory motions. It is a pity that the Budget

debate  had to come before the debate on the  main

policy  speech. The result was that  many  matters

had been touched on rather inadequately because of

the time guillotine on the Budget debate. However,

Sir,  never  have  we seen any  government  policy

statement so utterly dry and so completely  devoid

of  colour  and imagination. One cannot  but  feel

that  the  Government  this  year  is  simply  not

interested in forwarding any policy at  all.  Gone

are  the  days when the P.A.P. could  put  forward

policy  statements full of imagination  and  drive

that  reflected  the vigour and  dynamism  of  the

earlier  days of the P.A.P. In the first  year  of

office, the P.A.P. had called it a year that would

lead  to  a  more equal and just society.  In  the

second  year the P.A.P. had painted it, as Members

have  already  said, as the year of  construction.

This year the P.A.P. has not bothered to give it a

name, let alone a policy. So what has happened  to

the  P.A.P.?  Where have all the imagination,  the

vigour and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>

dynamism of the P.A.P. gone to? It looks as though

all  these qualities have left the P.A.P. with the

entire  rank  and  file  who  walked  out  of  the

leadership to form the Barisan Sosialis. What is

left  of  the  original P.A.P. is  a  colourless,

uninspiring  group of desperate politicians  whose

sole aim in life is to keep themselves in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said, Sir, that the first year of the

P.A.P. might  be  described  as  the   year   of

excitement,  and the second year as  the  year  of

confusion. If the P.A.P. is honest, it  will  call

this year the year of desperation.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> You

are a desperate chap!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, a year of

desperation  and a year of sell-out  as  well  for

politicians who have refused to remain faithful to

the  people who elected them to office. The P.A.P.

leaders  have  now  thrown  overboard  all   their

carefully   planned  and  thought   out   election

programme. They are only interested in  trying  to

keep  afloat their fast sinking ship.  Next  year,

from what the Member for Mountbatten has asked,  I

doubt  if  the P.A.P. will still be here then.  So

there is no need to talk about next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, minus the parts of the speech touching on

merger,  there  is  really nothing  in  the  policy

statement  that merits serious consideration.  They

are  more  like the departmental reports  from  the

various  Government Ministries; dry  and  insipid,

and  it  looks as though the P.A.P. this  time  has

merely  taken  out pages here and  there  from  the

various   departmental  reports  and   bound   them

together  as their policy statement. For  instance,

in  col. 15 of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech,

at the end of the first paragraph, it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Water rationing will be lifted when the rainy

season breaks and the reservoirs are filled.'





<br><br>What  is  there  so informative about  that  little

statement? Surely the Government has something more

important  to  say  in  this  annual  major  policy

statement  than mere routine matters of  Government

departments. Many have been led to believe that  in

Singapore today the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2681</b></font><br><br>

water  pressure varies not proportionately  to  the

rainfall  but  inversely to the political  pressure

on   the  Government,  that  is,  the  greater  the

political pressure on the Government by the people-

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The less the water pressure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the less the water pressure.

That  is  right. For all of us. Sir, reviewing  the

activities  of the Government during the  last  few

months, it is perhaps not strictly correct  to  say

that  the  Government  is completely  devoid  of  a

policy.  For  the  Ministers have  clearly  a  very

determined policy to keep themselves in office.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You can have it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In fact, this is about the

only  policy  the Government has this year.  It  is

clear  that the entire efforts of all the Ministers

are  concentrated  towards this aim.  They  are  so

busy  playing  politics that they  have  completely

forgotten  that  the  purpose of  their  coming  to

office  was  to improve the lot of the  people.  In

fact,  Sir,  our Prime Minister is hardly  ever  in

Singapore  these  days. He is  hopping  everywhere from  Singapore  to K.L., from K.L. to  Singapore,

and  now  to Borneo, and tomorrow I understands  he

is  going to Thailand and play golf. That  is  what

the  report  says, Sir. And in these  moments  when

our  Prime Minister is here in Singapore he is  too

busy  over Radio P.A.P. Sir, it is a pity  that  on

the  debate on such an important policy  speech  of

the  Government today, the Prime Minister  and  the

Minister  for Finance have to get out of  Singapore

again.  I do not know what they are up to. Is  that

the  only  thing they think of - playing politics  or

playing golf? Sir-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is too much of this

reference to-

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Golf.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might ask the Leader of the

House  to assist the Chair in keeping order. He  is

there  as  Leader  of  the  House  for  that   very

purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2682</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall   not  be  referred  to  except   upon   a

substantive motion. There has been too  much  of

this  reference to the personal conduct of  hon.

Members.  I  ask  the Member for  Queenstown  to

refrain  from  making any comments  on  personal

conduct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Point of

order, Sir, Is it in order for a Member to sleep

in the Chamber?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had to rule on that point of

order sometime ago. It is perfectly in order for

a Member to sleep in the Chamber. He is only out

of order when he starts snoring! Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Government now

appears  to  have  lost  their  smug  arrogance,

though   basically  they  still   retain   their

contempt  and  disregard for the people.  It  is

easier  now  to  get  immigration  permits   for

relatives  from abroad - thanks to representatives

from  Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen  and  branch

executives. Various other small favours are  now

granted with a view to buying votes. Hence,  the

restoration  of paycuts and increase  of  social

welfare  benefits  for the  various  unfortunate

members  of  our society. Sir, these concessions

are correct and should have been given long ago.

Everybody  knows that the change  in  Government

policy is motivated not by any sincere intention

to  relieve  the  suffering of  the  people  but

simply  to buy votes. Sir, the people  have  not

forgotten  that  only  a  few  months  ago   the

Minister  for Finance firmly refused  the  civil

service  a  full restoration of their  allowance

because  of  the supposed need for  a  stringent

economic plan. Now when the Government is  about

to  topple, it suddenly has plenty of  money  to

throw  around.  Sir, either the  Government  was

telling a falsehood a few months ago or  it  has

now  decided  to abandon all long-term  economic

policies  in  order  to meet the  immediate  and

urgent need to keep themselves in office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking of the Government's attitude

towards  our  civil service  brings  me  to  the

Government's policy towards the English-educated

section of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2683</b></font><br><br>

community. We all know that it has been said -  and

it  has been said several times before, Sir - that

the  P.A.P. leadership came to power mainly on the

vote  of  the  workers  and  the  Chinese-educated

section of our community. The greater part of  the

English-educated, because of the vicious falsehood

and  smear campaign by the S.P.A. and the  Straits

Times,  was  led to believe that when  the  P.A.P.

came  to  power  they  would have  their  properly

confiscated, their rice bowl broken and all  would

be   forced  to  live  in  communes.  Instead   of

explaining   away   these   genuine   fears    and

misunderstandings towards the socialist  movement,

the  P.A.P.  Government, however, thought  fit  to

insult  and  intimidate the  English-educated  the

moment  it came to power. Now that the P.A.P. has

lost  the support of the workers who brought  them

to power, its leaders are following the same dirty

tactics of the past. They hope to woo the English-educated by smearing and vilifying-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Barisan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- this time not the

P.A.P., but the Barisan Sosialis. But let me  tell

the P.A.P. this: that just

as  the same smears and falsehoods invented by the

S.P.A. and the Straits Times against the P.A.P. In

1959  did  not  stop the people from electing  the

then P.A.P. to power, so the smears and falsehoods

which  the P.A.P. is now levelling at the  Barisan

Sosialis will not shake the determination  of  the

people  from  supporting Barisan Sosialis  in  the

next general elections.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the Member for

Queenstown  is  not now embarking on  an  election

speech. We

are now dealing with Government policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no such intention,

Sir, It is regrettable, anyway, that the  P.A.P.

has not learnt the lesson

of  history  in Singapore, history in which  they

themselves have played a prominent part.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2684</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of elucidation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As you have just said, Mr

Speaker,  the  Member for Queenstown is  departing

from  the  debate on the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech. Yesterday you gave the Member for Moulmein

ten  minutes  to rectify his speech.  Perhaps  you

could do the same for the Member for Queenstown.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of

elucidation. The Leader of the House must not take

advantage  of  procedural devices. He  is  out  of

order  himself. The Member for Queenstown has  now

assured me that he is not embarking on an election

speech. If he does, I will stop him. Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need answer

that  jibe  from  him. It is not  necessary.  Sir,

never  in  my reading of socialism have  I  learnt

that  socialism can be achieved by  insulting  and

intimidating sections of the people into accepting

socialist  thinking. Indeed, we must  be  able  to

understand why certain sections of our people  are

apprehensive about socialism. It is  our  duty  as

socialists to try and explain away these fears and

misunderstandings. Only thus will all  the  people

participate willingly and actively in  our  sacred

task  of  improving  the  livelihood  of  all  our

people.  Insults and intimidation will only  drive

those who do not understand socialism further away

from our movement. We are happy to note, Sir, that

today the English-educated worker is becoming more

and  more politically conscious. The recent strike

at  Robinson's shows that our English-educated are

no  longer  spineless and soft.  Sir,  unlike  the

P.A.P.,  we the Barisan Sosialis believe that  the

English-educated will have an extremely  important

role  to  play in this socialist movement  of  our

country. Sir, I am English-educated myself.  Being

a  Barisan Sosialis Member I am confident that the

English-educated  will join us in  supporting  the

cause of the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2685</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the rise of the English-educated

workers   leads   me  now  to   comment   on   the

Government's  labour policy.  It  is  clear,  Sir,

that  the  Government has abandoned  its  election

promises to unify the trade union movement.  There

is  no  mention  at  all of  this  in  the  policy

statement.   Today  the  Government  has   clearly

divided  the workers into two camps, those  unions

which  are sponsored or controlled by the  P.A.P.,

and  those which are not prepared to be tied  down

to  the P.A.P. The Government has styled all those

workers  under P.A.P. control as nationalists  and

smeared  all  those who refuse to be under  P.A.P.

control  as  pro-Communist.  By  this  the  P.A.P.

hopes  that  the workers will be frightened  into

accepting  P.A.P. control. Sir, this is really  an

insult   to  the  intelligence  of  the   workers,

because  every  worker knows, for  example,  about

A.U.P.E.,  a  Government-sponsored splinter  union

which  featured prominently in the  recent  Public

Daily-Rated  Workers strike.  Every  worker  knows

that   it  was  the  Government's  insistence   on

foisting   upon   the  workers  this   Government-sponsored  union that had sparked off the  strike,

in  spite  of  all  that the Government  has  said

about  the  evil men behind the scenes.  Sir,  all

this  talk of the P.A.P. wanting to spend millions

of  dollars to build a trade union centre  is  not

going  to deceive the people about the anti-worker

attitude of the Government today. In the light  of

the  Government's  labour  policy  of  divide  and

rule,  this extensive building may well  turn  out

to be a mere white elephant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards unemployment, the situation today is

just  as  bad as ever. What have they  done  about

this?  The  Member  for  Mountbatten  has  already

asked.  The  only answer we can hear is,  nothing;

nothing.  Instead, Sir, today the P.A.P. uses  the

police  and  armed troops against the workers.  We

have  seen  how  the  City  Council  workers  were

bullied  by  the use of brute military  force.  We

have  seen  how simple street cleaning was  turned

into  major political operations. There were  more

troops

than black-legs in each operation. Encouraged by

this successful use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2686</b></font><br><br>

troops  against  the  City  Council  workers,  the

Government  is  now  employing  the  same  tactics

against  workers in the Work Brigade, workers  who

were  struggling to form a union to  seek  redress

for their grievances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few days ago, troops in battle dress and

armed  with  bayonets  fixed  to  rifles  launched

surprise dawn attacks not on an invading army  but

on  sleeping  workers in the Work  Brigade  camps.

This  unscrupulous use of brute force in  commando

dawn  attacks  and  assaults against  unarmed  and

sleeping  workers is a provocation of the  gravest

nature,  such  that  it might  well  have  led  to

violence  and bloodshed. We cannot but admire  the

workers for their calm and self-restraint  in  the

face of such grave provocation. We admire them for

having  accepted  humiliation with  such  dignity.

Such  tactics of the P.A.P. Government are  merely

attempts  to terrorise and intimidate the  workers

of  Singapore,  but  workers  are  not  so  easily

terrorised  and intimidated these  days.  Let  the

P.A.P.  Government  realise  that.  It  is  indeed

ironical, Sir, that it should be a Government that

was  elected to power by the workers of  Singapore

that  is  now using troops and the police  against

the workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ask the people's democracy!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I doubt - there are very

few  Back-benches left anyway - if the P.A.P. Back-benches realise what their Government is doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not say much about Radio Singapore, Sir.

It  is now completely monopolised by the P.A.P. It

is  obvious to everybody. What is not so  obvious,

Sir,  is the subtle pressure exerted on the  Press

in   Singapore.   We   have  seen   how   mounting

dissatisfaction   amongst   the   Chinese   school

students  was  completely blackout  in  the  Press

until the matter blew up and caught the people  of

Singapore completely by surprise. We are told, for

example,  again, that many reporters are  becoming

increasingly frustrated. They find that what  they

faithfully  reported were often not  published  in

the papers. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2687</b></font><br><br>

particularly  so,  Sir,  I understand,  among  the

reporters  of  the  English  Press,  who  in  many

instances  found  their  reports  completely   re-written  by  the  sub-editors to suit  the  P.A.P.

Government policy. We also understand,  Sir,  that

certain newspaper headlines have had to be altered

after frantic telephone calls from the Ministry of

Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wonder if the people of

Singapore know all this. Sir, that little  bit  on

the  Ministry of Culture should be enough. But  it

is pathetic that immediately following the portion

on  labour,  the policy statement should  harp  on

television and the national theatre. We would like

to  ask  the Government: what is the use  of  tele

vision  and  the national theatre to workers  when

their basic wants are not satisfied? Let us  hope

that television will not turn out to be merely  an

instrument of Government propaganda.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us hope there will not be

another series of twelve television talks.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thirteen!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let Radio P.A.P. give fair

news   reports  and  not  distorted  and  doctored

versions from the P.A.P. propaganda machine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rest of the policy statement is really

not worth commenting on except a small section  on

education. We have seen how the recent  inept  and

arrogant  handling  of  the delicate  problems  of

Chinese education nearly plunged Singapore into  a

blood-bath.  The  Government's  attempt  to  blame

everything on Communist manipulation-

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And the Barisan Sosialis.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -does not deceive the people.

The  Government must be responsible for their  mishandling of the recent dispute in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2688</b></font><br><br>

Chinese schools. I do not wish to comment  on  the

merits  and  demerits of the education policy.  We

welcome  the  establishment  of  a  Commission  of

Inquiry  to  investigate into all aspects  of  the

Government education policy, including the English

stream  of education, as has been promised by  the

Minister  for  Education. But  I  would  urge  the

Government  to use this opportunity to  allow  all

teachers  in Singapore to air their genuine  grievances.  The  question of a unified service  scheme

for   teachers   long  promised  by   the   P.A.P.

Government has still to be met. Let the Government

remember  that  for  the attainment  of  the  best

possible  education results for  our  children,  a

satisfied  and  contented body of teachers  is  an

essential prerequisite. Let the Government  handle

this  matter  with  tolerance,  understanding  and

patience  and  not  with the usual  arrogance  and

haughtiness,  the  outstanding  qualifies   widely

associated with the Ministry of Education today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable, Sir, that this year the P.A.P.

policy statement completely omitted any mention of

its professed policy to help the Malays. We in the

Barisan Sosialis believe that the Government  must

exert  greater  efforts  to  help  the  Malays  in

Singapore. We congratulate the Government on their

having  built the first Malay Secondary School  in

Singapore  and  a  Fisheries Training  School  for

fishermen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But these, Sir, are not

enough.  We  are sure that the Government  can  do

more  if it will but put its mind on the job.  Let

them not play politics too much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also pursuing a very dangerous

communal  policy  as  regards  many  things,   but

especially  as  regards,  as  has  been  evidenced

recently, the Work Brigade. Soon after the

workers  of the Work Brigade had tried to  form  a

trade  union,  the Government had  segregated  the

Malay  workers from the non-Malay workers  in  the

Work  Brigade camps. We cannot see why the  P.A.P.

Government,  which  is  supposed  to  believe   in

communal unity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2689</b></font><br><br>

harmony,   should   want  to   practise   communal

segregation. We hope it will not persist  in  this

communal  approach because this is merely  playing

with fire.

<br><br>4.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's  speech  on  the

question of education, the Government promises  to

build  19 schools every year. But let us see  what

has  happened  in  these  two  years.  The  P.A.P.

Government  could only build one  Malay  secondary

school,  namely, Sangnila Utama Malay School,  and

another  Chinese  School, namely, Whampoa  Chinese

Secondary  School.  They  could  only  build  four

Chinese   middle  schools  namely,  River   Valley

School, Teck Min School and two others. From  this

we  can  see that the Government is biased towards

English  education.  The integrated  schools  have

been said to be very successful, according to  the

policy  statement.  I  doubt  this  because  these

integrated  schools  are mainly  English  schools.

Before  these  schools  were  opened,  they   were

chiefly  English  schools. Later  on,  because  of

other  reasons,  they  became integrated  schools.

Because there were vacant classes and most of  the

classes were meant for the teaching of English -

two-thirds  of  them  for  the  English  stream - the

balance   was   allotted   to   other   vernacular

languages.  The  facilities  in  all  schools  are

mainly  meant  for English schools. Other  classes

for   vernacular  education  are  only  meant   as

supplementary classes and the use of these classes

will  have  to  depend  on from  which  stream  of

education the principal comes. Among the  students

some of them have to express their opinions in the

vernacular languages in these integrated  schools.

Can  this  be  claimed to be successful?  Is  this

policy really conducive to the so-called promoting

the   mutual   understanding  among  the   various

language streams? The Government has built about 9

schools -  The $3 million spent last time  has  now

been  increased to $9 million and it is  spent  on

building  a  few  schools. They have  promised  to

build 19 schools. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2690</b></font><br><br>

sum  spent  on capital expenditure, i.e.,  building

schools, last time was $3 million; but now  it  has

been  reduced  to  $1  million,  one-third  of  the

amount. Most of the schools are English schools and

most  of  the Chinese schools are Government  aided

schools.  From  this we can see  that  the  Chinese

schools  cannot develop smoothly and  that  is  the

main   reason.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  very

difficult  to  apply  for  school  building  funds.

Therefore,  it  has  hampered  the  development  of

Chinese  schools. When a school wants to apply  for

expansion  of the school building, it  has  to  go

through the Ministry of Education, the Ministry  of

Health,  and  the Ministry of National Development.

Very  often  certain officers in  these  Ministries

shift  the burden to other Ministries, evading  the

responsibility  in dealing with applications.  Thus

applications   are  delayed  for  several   months,

sometimes  for  several years.  For  instance,  the

application for the building of Nanyang  University

and the application relating to school expansion in

Chung  Cheng High School. These are good  examples.

The   procedure  has  not  been  explained  by  the

Government to the schools. So the schools  applying

for capital grant, because they have not applied in

accordance with the regulations, have not been able

to  get  the grant. For instance, Kwong  Yong  High

School could not get any grant. It put the Board of

Directors  in  a  difficult  position  because  the

Ministry of Health demanded too much of the  school

without   considering  its  special  and   economic

conditions.  The Ministry concerned  insisted  that

the  site  should  be large, the  space  should  be

ample,  and  there  should  be  certain  kinds   of

conditions applicable to sanitary facilities and so on and so

forth. How could the applicant school afford to pay so much? When a school

building plan is given to the Ministry

of Health, the Ministry not only entirely changes

it, but very often certain structures already put up have to be

added in, such as window, ceilings and

so on, thereby putting unnecessary restrictions on the applicant school and

causing much trouble to the Board of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2691</b></font><br><br>

Directors.  The Ministry also insist on  the  land

lease to be 30 years minimum, instead of 30 years.

But  then the Government, on the other hand, would

not grant a lease for 30 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way how can the Government help the

development  of vernacular schools? I suggest  that

the   Government   should   establish   a   special

department  to  deal with these matters  so  as  to

enable  the  applicant schools to facilitate  their

applications  and  so that they  can  approach  the

relevant  quarters  and realise their  aims  early.

The  Government should provide these facilities and

assistance   so   that  the  Chinese   schools   in

Singapore  can  shoulder  their  responsibility  in

respect  of education in their educational  stream.

In  this  way the Government can achieve what  they

profess  to do, namely, to give equal treatment  to

the   four  streams  of  education,  including  the

Chinese stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the Ministry of Education there

is  already established an Examination Syndicate to

manage  and  control  matters  relating  to  common

examinations  in  all standards. It  is  not  known

when  the  present  examination system,  which  has

been  conducting colonial examinations,  is  to  be

abolished,  and  when the Government  is  going  to

conduct  examinations  for  secondary  schools  and

higher  secondary  schools.  Everybody  knows   the

Government  has  been saying that the  contents  of

the   textbooks  should  be  based  on  a   Malayan

background.    But   if   the   Senior    Cambridge

Examination   and  the  Higher  School  Certificate

Examination  are not abolished, then  this  is  not

quite   correct,  because  the  contents   of   the

textbooks used for these examinations are  colonial

in  nature. The Government says they want to  unify

the  contents  of all textbooks in all  educational

streams,  but  there  are  still  contents   of   a

colonial nature in the textbooks. How then can  the

Government   achieve  the  purpose   of   promoting

Malayan  culture  and achieve  a  Malayan  type  of

education!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About technical education, I am not satisfied

with  what the Government has done because it  has

only established



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2692</b></font><br><br>

technical  classes in the secondary schools.  They

do   not  have  workshops  and  laboratories.  For

example,  the  students in the  technical  schools

have to go to the Tanjong Katong Girls' School  to

do  their  experimental work, and the students  in

Hua  Yee  School  have  to go  to  the  Queenstown

Secondary  School  to do their experimental  work.

This  is  a waste of time on the part of  students

and causes great inconvenience to the students.

<br><br>4.29 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a full technical school, how are we going

to  train technical personnel? Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  there  are  about 8,000 graduates  from  the

Chinese   secondary  schools  this   year;   5,000

Secondary  III  graduates and 3,000  Secondary  IV

graduates. Next year a few will be able to  go  to

the    Upper   Secondary   classes   or   to   the

Universities.   There  is  no   other   employment

opportunity  for them except to be  teachers.  How

many graduates can be absorbed into the Government

service!  The  Government should open  a  two-year

teacher  training course to absorb  the  graduates

from  the  Chinese secondary schools so that  they

will  not be unemployed. It should also set  up  a

department in the Polytechnic in which the  medium

of  instruction should be Chinese  to  enable  the

Chinese  school students to receive some technical

training.  This  is  the  demand  of  the  Chinese

parents and the school committee members.  I  hope

the  Government will put into practice the  demand

of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Adult Education

Board  was formed in April 1960. There were  about

21,000  students.  But in July  1960,  there  were

about  17,400 students. We do not know the  number

of students in 1961 because the Government has not

announced the number. Perhaps the number has been

reduced  still further. It is said that there  are

now a few students in certain classes. In order to

have  enough  classes, the teachers in  the  adult

education classes have asked the pupils in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2693</b></font><br><br>

the  day  schools  to augment  the  number  in  the

classes  so  as to falsify the number of  students.

As  the number of pupils are so few in the classes,

the  teachers  are naturally very  slack  in  their

work.  How then are we going to wipe out illiteracy

if  we  organise such classes? On the  other  hand,

the  Government  does not dare to  co-operate  with

the  civic  organisations and, as a  result,  these

organisations run better classes than those run  by

the  Adult Education Board. This should be reviewed

by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us review the work

done  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture.  It  can   be

summarised   in  eight  words - "It  is   meant   for

decoration  and  show only." Let  us  see  how  the

Ministry  of  Culture whitewashes  its  work.  Last

year  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech  to

this  House pointed out that in order to  stimulate

Malayan  art  and  culture  the  Government   would

establish  a national cultural brigade.  When  this

scheme  is  implemented, it will  provide  a  fixed

venue for cultural activities. This is a very  good

scheme.  The  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Culture gave details about  the  work

of  this cultural brigade at a meeting last year in

the  belief that this project would be carried out.

He  said  that if we were to carry out  this  heavy

work,  we  must  absorb talented  and  hard-working

artistes  into the cultural brigade and organise  a

systematic  research in art and creative  work.  He

also  spoke on the problem of organisation. He said

that,  on the whole, the cultural brigade would  be

divided  into  two groups. One group would  consist

of  those  with a higher intellectual  ability  and

they  would  be  entrusted with the compilation  of

artistic  works  such as songs,  dances  and  other

cultural  activities and then, after some research,

with  the  production of Malayan music,  drama  and

dances.  The  other group would  consist  of  those

talented  as  performers, for  example,  musicians,

dancers,  singers and dramatists. These  performers

would  take  part  in open-air concerts  and  would

assist  in the cultural and recreational activities

of the community centres. It seemed that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister for Culture wanted to gather all the

talented  people and artistes and give them  scope

to express their artistic talents. But, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, after a lapse of 14 months now,  has

the  cultural brigade been formed? What songs have

been  written and what dances have been  arranged?

How  many  artistes  have been  recruited?  I  can

answer  these  questions  for  the  Minister.  The

answer  is  that all these plans have been  thrown

into  the wastepaper basket. Could it be that  the

Minister   for  Finance  does  not   approve   the

expenditure for this project? If it is not so, how

can they explain it away? Does it mean that we  do

not  have enough talented artistes in this  State?

If  it  is  so, then how can one explain the  fact

that  many  concerts  and many cultural  festivals

have  been  successful? Can  it  be  explained  on

political grounds? If that is so, how is that  the

Government invited them to give performances?  The

people of Singapore

are perplexed on this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But I can

answer  this question: the Ministry of Culture  is

only meant for

show!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us go back to the

policy  speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

last year in which he said at column 22 of Hansard

dated 20th July, 1960:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This year will also see the establishment of the

Institute  for National Language and Culture.  The

aims and objects of the Institute

have  already  been explained to  Members  of  the

Assembly. The Institute, in addition to publishing

translations  of outstanding works  of  literature

and promoting the growth and

spread   of  the  national  language,  will   also

encourage original works, literary and scientific,

by local writers.'.



<br><br>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very significant.

When  tabling  the  Bill  on  the  Institute   for

National   Language   and   Culture,    the    ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture  said  that  the P.A.P. would  pay  great

attention   to   the   establishment    of    this

institution.  I  would like to  summarise  briefly

what  he said. He said that the institution  would

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2695</b></font><br><br>

responsible  for the publication of textbooks  on

the  national language for non-Malays and for  the

publication  of simple magazines in  the  national

language  and  also  for radio broadcasts  in  the

national language with Chinese, English and  Tamil

translations on politics, economics,  science  and

international cultures. This grandiose scheme  was

described  by  him in this House on  11th  August, 1960.  He  said that he would bring good  news  to

the  people  of Singapore on the establishment  of

the  Institute for National Language and  Culture.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, through the  assistance

of  the  Indonesian Government,  Professor  Sulamo

was  recruited by the Singapore Government and  he

is  the  Director  of the Institute  for  National

Language   and  Culture.  I  believe  the   famous

Professor  Sulamo  will run  the  Institute  well.

However,  Mr Deputy Speaker, we have so  far  not

been  able  to  see any publications published  by

that  institute or any textbooks in  the  national

language. Translations of these works are  not  to

be  found  in  the bookshops. Is  it  because  the

Minister for Finance did not give money or  is  it

because of the shortage of personnel? It was  said

that  when Prof. Sulamo was appointed, he did  not

even have typists and cupboards in his office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the policy speech

delivered  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  last

year,    the   Government   boasted   about    the

achievements   of  the  Government's  construction

work.  Not a word was mentioned about the work  in

the   Ministry  of  Culture.  Is  it  because  the

revolution has not been successful? If it  is  so,

the  Government should tell the people. Mr Deputy

Speaker,  in  the  past one  year  this  so-called

cultural  revolution  by the Ministry  of  Culture

was  nonsense. There was no system  at  all.  Last

year the cultural brigade and

the  Institute  for Language and Culture  did  not

achieve  anything. This year they  say  they  will

put  up  television.  The Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This medium will prove to be a valuable ally

not  only  for  popular  education  but  also  for

hastening the development of a Malayan

culture and consciousness.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2696</b></font><br><br>

In  this  respect it is true that in the  twentieth

century  when  all sciences are very advanced,  the

establishment  of television and the  dissemination

of   knowledge  through  T.V. will  be  much  more

effective  than  the  radio  broadcasts   and   the

audience  will  be  able to comprehend  better  the

programmes. The programmes will be more  vivid  and

can  be  seen  on  the  screen  and  will  be  more

penetrating and moving to the audience.  If  it  is

used  to  educate  the  masses  and  to  wipe   out

illiteracy, television can-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Point of order,

Sir.  The  Member  seems to be  reading  from  his

speech.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I do not think he is reading,

but  he  is  making  occasional reference  to  his

notes. If he is reading, then I will rule him  out

of order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, the Government's purpose is not really to

make  use  of  T.V. to foster Malayan culture  and

help  bring about a Malayan consciousness, and  to

build a Malayan nation. But according to the  work

done  last  year  we can see that  the  Government

intends  to suppress the formation of Malayan  culture  and consciousness. From this we can see that

the T.V. plan will not be successful. But when one

talks  about  T.V., it is not so  very  simple  a

matter.  I think T.V. programmes will be  prepared

in  time unless the P.A.P. Government collapses in

the near future; otherwise the Government will not

give up the plan to build a T.V. station. If it is

so,  then  the question is not so simple.  Let  us

study it. What is the motive of the Government  in

promoting mass education? Everybody knows, and the

P.A.P. leadership also knows, that the P.A.P. is

at  present faced with a very difficult situation.

It  has  its  back  to the wall,  because  it  has

betrayed the people

and has no courage to face them. It has no courage

to express the strength of the people and has lost

the  support of the people. Therefore,  in  future

there  will be no masses appearing at mass rallies

or street comer meetings or large-scale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>

meetings.  The only people who want to attend  will

only  be a few pickets and it is likely that  there

will  be  no  pickets  at all when  they  hold  any

meeting.  It  will be just like one of those  minor

political  Parties in 1955. It will  have  to  show

some kind of films and play some music in order  to

attract people to attend its meetings. In the  past

the  P.A.P. has been attacking others and  accusing

them  of many faults. Now it is doing the same.  It

is  very  difficult for them to explain away  this.

Therefore,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the leadership  of

the  people have now thought out a very cunning way

to  go round it. They have thought out a T.V. plan.

Then   in   all   the   community   centres,    the

playgrounds, shops, houses, everywhere,  T.V. sets

can  be set up, and the Government will be able  to

contact  the  people through television  programmes

and  to  conduct their mass rallies. By  that  time

the  Prime  Minister can come on to  the  stage  to

continue  his mystic stories. The people  will  not

only  be  able  to  hear the  voice  of  the  Prime

Minister  but  will  also be able  to  see  him  in

person.  All  his  acts and gestures  can  be  seen

clearly  on the screen. This will be of quite  good

use to the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which they could help the

P.A.P.  First, it will get them out of a situation

if  they should convene any meeting and nobody  at

tends. Secondly, perhaps they may still say  there

are  650,000  citizens attending the  P.A.P. mass

rally  and there is applause all round.  They  can

claim  that  the people have been supporting  them

and  they can cherish this spirit of Ah Q. The ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture,  on  the 11th of August  this  year  said

something  which is quite true. He  said,  in  the

past one year-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of order, Sir,Is it in

is  in  the  right  to  say the  ex-Parliamentary

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  thank you for your  guidance.  He

said  in the past year the cultural artistes  and

cultural  organisations had greatly assisted  the

Ministry of Culture in promoting healthy cultural

recreation  and cultural work. It  is  undeniable

that the past one year can be said to be the most

active  year  in  the history  of  Singapore, in

respect of cultural activities. I agree with what

he  said,  that 1959 was a year in which cultural

activities  were  the most  active.  Was  it  the

result of active encouragement by the Ministry of

Culture? How many cultural organisations did  the

Ministry  of  Culture help  to  carry  out  their

activities? How many cultural workers or artistes

did  the  Ministry of Culture help? What was  the

attitude  of the Ministry of Culture to  cultural

workers? What was the attitude of the Ministry of

Culture towards cultural organisations?

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member

is   going  into  too  much  details  about  this

Ministry  of  Culture. Perhaps he could  bear  in

to  the  policy  of  the Government  and  not  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I can say

that  the  Ministry of Education left the cultural

organisations  alone, leaving  them  to  die.  The

Ministry of Culture did not help cultural  workers

at  all. On the other hand, it misused them.  When

they were needed, they were asked to take part  in

programmes  and concerts and so on. But  when  all

these things were over, they were forgotten by the

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, what is the attitude of the

Minister   for  Culture  to  local   authors   and

playwrights? I remember the Political Secretary to

the  Ministry  of  Culture  has  encouraged  local

artistes  and playwrights to write more plays  and

books  with  a  Malayan  background  and  give  up

feudalistic thought. Rich creative work will  have

to  be  written by local playwrights and artistes;

such  as  on the lives of rubber tappers  and  tin

miners.  This  is  a very good  subject  to  write

about. If you write a book on the happiness of the

rubber  tappers and so on, this may have a certain

significance.  If  you  write  a   book   on   the

difficulties and the difficult lives of the rubber

tappers and the miners, then a certain meaning may

be construed. If you write-

has amounted only to this. The Ministry of Culture

has   only  published  certain  pamphlets  on  the

speeches made by the Ministers and so on.  At  the

quiz  forum  of Radio Singapore, the  Ministry  of

Culture even pays money in this kind of programme.

this  is  the  second time this  Chamber  has  been

treated with such scant respect. It is the  job  of

the  Government Whip to see that there is a  quorum

so  that Government business could continue without

unnecessary  interruption. If  there  had  been  an

Opposition Whip, it would have been his duty to see

the Opposition benches were filled. Mr Yong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

heard at least 6 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen speak

on the question of education in respect of the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's speech for the  year  1962.  I

should like to take this opportunity to answer  the

main  points  raised by them as far as possible  on

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the point raised by the Member for

Stamford on Tuesday when discussing the question of

women's  rights. She referred to cases  of  certain

Chinese   married  women  teachers  who  paid   for

substitutes  out  of their own pocket  before  they

went  on  maternity leave. It would seem from  what

she  said that the teachers concerned entered  into

this arrangement voluntarily. I mean it is a matter

between  the  individual  teacher  and  the  school

authorities.  I  would like  to  explain,  for  the

information  of all concerned, that  married  women

teachers,  whether in Government service  or  aided

schools, are eligible for maternity leave up  to  a

maximum  of 60 days upon certification by a doctor.

While  the  married woman teacher's  on  maternity

leave,  the  school is expected  to  make  internal

arrangements  to cover her work, but such  internal

arrangements neither require the teacher to find  a

substitute nor to pay for the substitute. But  when

too  many women teachers are away on medical  leave

in  the  same  school or when the  absence  of  any

teacher  during  maternity leave  is  unnecessarily

prolonged,  the Director of Education has  his  discretion to consider and approve the appointment and

payment of substitute teachers provided always such

appointment is essential for the proper running  of

the school. It is therefore clear, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2702</b></font><br><br>

from  what  I have said, that the cases mentioned

by  the Member for Stamford are not authorised by

my   Ministry.  We  cannot  interfere  with  the

teachers'  desire  to enter  into  any  voluntary

arrangement with their own school. But I  hope  I

have  made  it  plain that it is unnecessary  for

married  women teachers to make such arrangements

as  they  are entitled to maternity leave without

having to find substitutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the Member for Pasir Panjang, it

is quite a change to find him changing from being

the vanguard of Chinese education to stand up  in

defence of Tamil education. The Member for  Pasir

Panjang  referred to the case of  the  Government

having built Labrador School on the playing field

of  Pasir  Panjang Tamil School,  thus  depriving

them of the use of a playing field. I assure  him

that  he  has been misinformed - they  are  always

misinformed unfortunately. Although Pasir Panjang

Tamil  Aided  School  is  occupying  State  land,

Labrador  School was built outside the  perimeter

fence  of the Tamil School. Only a small  portion

of   the  Tamil  school  compound  was  used  for

constructing an approach road Ro Labrador School.

The   Tamil  school  building  itself  is  in   a

dilapidated condition and provision has been made

to  offer  them accommodation in the new Labrador

School  building. In addition, the  Tamil  school

pupils  are  being  offered  use  of  the  common

playing  field for Labrador/Batu Berlayer Primary

Schools and the Pasir Panjang Secondary Schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the Member for Changi is not here,

but   he  did  raise  the  matter  about  Nanyang

University.  I think it is necessary  for  me  to

refer  to it somewhat in detail. Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis follow the regular  pattern  of

lifting  sentences  out of  context  from  P.A.P.

literature  or statements and give them  a  twist

and  distortion  where  such  interpretation   or

intention  is not intended. The false  allegation

has  been  made  by the Barisan Sosialis  Members

that  we  have failed to uphold our election  promise to give financial aid to Nanyang University.

The relevant paragraph on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>

Nanyang   University  in  the   education   policy

statement made by us in April 1959, more  than  2½

years ago, reads as follows [The Tasks Ahead, Part 2, page 11]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The University [i.e. Nanyang University],

however, does not officially exist, in the eyes of

the Federation government, although 60 per cent of

its  students are from the Federation. Until there

is  a  change  of  heart in  the  Federation,  any

government  grants to the Nanyang University  must

therefore   come   solely   from   the   Singapore

government.  To have two governments  support  two

Universities  is  obviously easier  than  for  one

government  to support two Universities.  The  out

look  actually  would appear to  be  that  if  the

political  separation between  Singapore  and  the

Federation    continues,   then   the    Singapore

government  will be faced with the  responsibility

of   supporting  the  University  of   Malaya   in

Singapore   and  the  Nanyang  University.   Faced

already with an education bill amounting to 25 per

cent of its budget and an increasing population of

young  children, the prospects of  supporting  two

universities may well strain the resources of  the

Singapore government to the limit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position today remains unchanged. Nanyang

University  is not wholly for Singapore  students.

As  stated, the Federation students form about  60

per cent of enrolment in Nanyang. Now, whereas the

Federation Government is prepared to reimburse the

Singapore Government to the sum of $4 million  for

Federation students who will attend the University

of  Singapore  next year, it is  not  prepared  to

consider the existence of Nanyang University. That

is the problem to be resolved. Who is to carry the

financial  responsibility for 60 per cent  of  the

students in Nanyang who come from the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> According to the Government's

policy  statement on the 10th of February,  1960,

on  publication of the Nanyang University  Review

Committee's Report - I refer to Hansard,  Vol.  12,

No. 3, col. 143, the bottom paragraph, Sir - it was

stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government has no hesitation in

accepting  its  share of these deficits,  for  the

Singapore students in Nanyang University  who  are

estimated  at  40  per cent of the  total  student

population.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2704</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi talks of Government

asking   for   what  he  considers   unreasonable

conditions from Nanyang University. But  he  does

not  state  what are the unreasonable conditions.

What exactly are the conditions, Sir? I refer  to

col.  143  again,  it is at  the  middle  of  the

column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...in what manner and under what conditions

will  the  Singapore Government  be  prepared  to

support Nanyang University?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answers are given. I turn, first of all, to

col. 146, bottom paragraph, where it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government accepts, in

principle, the main recommendations contained  in

the  Gwee  Ah Leng Review Committee's  Report  on

Nanyang University.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the basis on which the Singapore

Government  is  prepared to give  financial  aid,

thus accepting the main recommendations contained

in this Review Committee's Report which calls for

reorganisation.. We will come back to paragraph 4

at col. 143:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... the new Government will be prepared to

support Nanyang University on the same basis  as

it  does the University of Malaya, provided that

there   are   similar  safeguards  as   to   the

maintenance of proper academic

standards...'

<br><br>There  have  been accusations that the Government

was   criticising   the  standards   of   Nanyang

University.   We  have  accepted   the   critical

findings of the Gwee Ah Leng Review Committee. We

have  not  criticised Nanyang University  but  we

have  accepted the recommendations of  an  expert

Committee:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the maintenance of proper academic

standards   and  proper  accounting  of   public

monies.'



<br><br>And just one final paragraph at the bottom of

column 145 where we said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nanyang University must therefore be reorganised, academic standards must be raised,

and  the  general  policy of Nanyang  University

must be entrusted to a group of people with high

academic  reputation and experience to discharge

such onerous duties, and adequate

checks made on expenditure and accounts.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on, Sir, to other aspects of

criticisms  lodged by Members of the Opposition,

especially the Barisan Sosialis. The Member  for

Changi made passing reference as to why, whereas

the non-English medium schools have English as a

compulsory subject in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2705</b></font><br><br>

schools, in English schools the students  are  not

compelled  to  study  Asian languages  like  Malay,

Chinese  and  Tamil. That is exactly what  the  Government  intends to do. We realise that the English

medium   schools  in  the  past  was  unfortunately

concentrating  far too much on the use  of  English

alone.  That is why the English schools  have  been

on  a  six-day week to give the students more  time

to  learn the Asian languages. But we cannot do  it

overnight.  Even though we have accepted  Malay  as

the  national  language,  there  is  a  paucity  of

teachers  to teach the language. We are  not  in  a

position  to  insist that Malay  should  be  taught

compulsorily, otherwise  we  would have 370,000 children  wanting  to

learn  Malay  and we have only 600 teachers.  There

are  not enough Malay teachers even to teach in the

Malay  stream. We have started secondary  education

in  the  Malay  stream and we find it difficult  to

get  the  right  teachers. So it is useless  asking

why  we  do  not make it a compulsory  subject.  We

intend to. But the time must be given to train  the

teachers  to  be  adequate in such  languages.  For

example,  in  conducting the Common Primary  School

Leaving Examination in the four streams, we have  a

situation  where it is possible for  students  from

the   Chinese  medium  schools  to  take  a  second

language  paper other than the language  medium  of

instruction,  that  is  English,  but  it  is   not

possible  to  insist on the other language  streams

to  take  a  second language because  in  the  past

there  was  a  rather indifferent attitude  towards

the  study  of such second languages. Yet  we  have

indicated  that  next year a second language  paper

for  the  four streams will have what is  called  a

half-unit.  We  will  take  it  into  account   for

examination purposes, and by 1963, we will  have  a

full  unit. First we must give some time  for  this

to  come into operation. We are hoping to introduce

a  regulation  whereby we will  insist  that  if  a

Primary   VI  student  has  had  three   years   of

continuous learning of a second language,  then  it

will  be  compulsory  for him to  take  the  second

language  paper. But I think we have made  attempts

towards remedying a previous defect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2706</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Toa Payoh picked out a little

sentence - he  seems to be a protagonist for  farmers

in  the  rural areas - that somewhere in  our  policy

statement  we  have indicated that the  farmers  in

large rural areas should be given some education to

help  them  in their rural life. He also said  that

the  Government had done nothing about it and  that

the  teachers  in  the rural schools  should  know.

Well,  Sir,  we  have  appointed  a  Commission  of

Inquiry  into  Vocational and Technical  Education.

The  Government just does not go "bang"  and  introduce  things  off the cuff. We believe  in  getting

people  who are experts in education to  sit  down,

make   a  close  study  of  the  subject  and  make

recommendations,  and  then  Government  will  give

thought  to  whether  the  recommendations  can  or

cannot  be accepted. Well, this Report has  already

been  tabled  and,  as I said,  a  White  Paper  is

forthcoming. There is a recommendation here by  the

Commission  of Inquiry at the top of the  paragraph

on page 23 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the primary schools, syllabuses could be

modified  to take account of the particular  needs

of rural children, and of those urban children who

will eventually enter careers

involving also the use of their hands.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have done something and in the right way - not

by  just  picking out sentences here and there  and

not being able to follow them through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former Parliamentary Secretary, the Member for

Serangoon Gardens, lamented the fact that  students

from the two Chinese secondary schools, Dunman  and

Hwa Yi, had to waste a lot of time moving over  to

the Tanjong Katong and Queenstown secondary schools

to  pick up some technical secondary education.  It

is  quite  a  change, Sir, to see the  Member,  for

Serangoon  Gardens  saying  so  many  things  about

education.  When he was my Parliamentary Secretary,

he  was well known for his silence. If only he  had

all  these ideas when he was assisting me  for  the

last  two  years,  we  could have  done  something.

However,  here  again, I would  refer  him  to  the

Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Vocational

and  Technical  Education. The recommendations  are

being  considered  and  when  the  White  Paper  is

published, perhaps I would like to know what he has

to say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2707</b></font><br><br>

then  on the subject. Because of the existence  of

this  Report, we have not pushed forward our plans.

After  all, there is an expert Report in hand,  and

we  may as well make use of the brains of those who

produced  the Report before involving the State  in

expenditure of millions of dollars. It  would  cost

at  least  $1  million to build  a  good  secondary

technical  school  and  to equip  it  properly.  In

fact,  the Report recommends the Government not  to

go too fast about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next to the criticism lodged by the Member

for  Toa  Payoh  and  by  my  former  Parliamentary

Secretary,  the Member for Serangoon Gardens,  over

the  lack  of  liaison between the Adult  Education

Board  and  other organisations like  trade  unions

and  so  on, and that therefore the Adult Education

Board  is failing to give that drive to get  pupils

to  burn  the midnight oil. In the Constitution  of

the  Adult Education Board, there is provision  for

two  representatives  from  the  trade  unions.  In

fact,   the   Secretary-General   of   the   Barisan

Sosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong,  and  one  of  my

colleagues,  the  Member for Ulu Pandan,  serve  on

the Board but unfortunately Mr Lim Ching Siong  is

noted  for his absence from meetings. So, far  from

getting  co-operation, we got little, if  any,  co-operation  by  his lack of attendance.  Of  course,

with  the  politics  that  went  on  and  with  the

dissolution  of the T.U.C., they are no  longer  on

the   Board.   But   we   do   hope   that   proper

representatives  of  real  trade  unions  and   not

politicians   will   come   in   to   support   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticism again was lodged by the Member for

Changi  and the Member for Serangoon Gardens  about

the  continuance  of the Cambridge  Examination  in

English  as something that is colonial. I  like  to

hear  the strong anti-colonial fervour of our great

anti-colonialists as expressed by  Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis! We have it as  an  objective  in

our  education policy statement that we should have

an  Examination  Syndicate. It is something  to  be

achieved.   But  let  us  not  fool  ourselves   by

throwing  things to the winds. After  all,  we  are

very  much  tied up with the Federation  of  Malaya

with whom we are to merge, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2708</b></font><br><br>

Federation   Government   conducts   its    public

examinations closely with the Cambridge Syndicate.

We  are also using the Cambridge Syndicate for the

conduct  of  our  English medium examinations  and

many  Singapore  students,  after  obtaining   the

Cambridge  School  Certificate  or  the  Cambridge

Higher  School  Certificate,  will  have  to  find

employment  in the Federation or seek  entry  into

the  new  University of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur  to

take up engineering and agriculture, or to proceed

overseas  anywhere in the world because  they  are

certificates  known to anyone as  certificates  of

recognition to Universities abroad. Now we do  not

just tear it all up in order to comply with the so-called   anti-colonial  fervour  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis. We will do it if we can be sure that the

certificates in the English medium, when we do con

duct  such examinations locally, will be  accepted

by  the Federation Government as equivalent to the

Cambridge  School Certificate. This  is  something

which we do not just do overnight. We should  have

discussions, close liaison; perhaps people in  the

Federation  setting  the papers  and  vice  versa,

where  probably we do the marking on their behalf,

and  so on. It takes time and, in fact, the leader

of the Barisan Sosialis mentioned quite earlier on

during  the previous debate on merger that  hordes

of  Chinese  from  the  Federation  come  down  to

Singapore  in order to take the examinations  that

are  conducted in the Chinese medium but regretted

the fact that such certificates are not recognised

outside the State of Singapore. So let us be clear

about this. Let us not say, "Yes, we shall conduct

our  School Certificate Examination in English  in

Singapore,"  and find the sad position  that  such

certificates  are not accepted outside  Singapore.

It   is   an   entirely  different   picture   for

examinations conducted in other than  the  English

stream.  Nobody is providing for such examinations

and  it  is the duty of the State to conduct  such

examinations for the Malay medium by 1962 and give

it  equal  recognition with certificates conducted

by  the  Cambridge Syndicate. I think it  is  time

that  Members of the Barisan Sosialis should  also

think   a  little  bit  more  before  they   start

criticising,  that all these are colonial  actions

and so on;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2709</b></font><br><br>

that  anything English is colonial. Paper questions

on History and Geography are sometimes set by local

people on textbooks which have been malayanised. It

is a question of keeping certain standards that are

world recognised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the complaints raised by the Member

for  Changi  and  the Member for Serangoon  Gardens

about  the so-called stringent regulations for  the

granting of capital aid to schools. The Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens  was my Parliamentary  Secretary

until a few months ago. He knew that I had in  mind

the  relaxation of the regulations to assist  rural

schools.  Let him and his colleagues not  get  away

with  it. They have raised all these points so that

they  can say the Government was under pressure  to

concede  to them. No, they do not get that  credit.

Try  not  to  still the thunder from the Government

which has been working on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> There is no more

thunder, only a squib.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We now come to the question of

integrated  schools  where my former  Parliamentary

Secretary,   the  present  Member   for   Serangoon

Gardens, again lamented the fact that we are trying

to  have  integrated  schools  which  are  only  an

adjunct  to the English schools. Now, according  to

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, it is the  intention of the Government to have more and more  of

such integrated schools. By that we mean one school

building  taking in two different language streams.

We  believe  that  by  bringing together  different

streams,  it  is  one  way to break  down  communal

barriers and communal schools. Since it is our plan

to  bring multilingualism into our schools, I think

it  will  be  possible  before  long  for  a  happy

exchange of teachers to be effected between the two

language streams. Let us assume that we are talking

of  an integrated school in English and Chinese, of

which  we  have  about  ten  by  now.  The  Chinese

language teachers could come from a Chinese  school

and  the  English language teachers for the Chinese

stream  could come from the teachers in an  English

school,   That  raises  the  standard  of  language

teaching  in  both streams, so that they  would  be

fairly good in both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2710</b></font><br><br>

Chinese and English. Next month, at the new school

to   be  opened  in  Jalan  Kaki  Bukit,  we   are

introducing  an integrated school in  the  English

and Malay media. We hope the children who come out

of  this integrated Malay/English school would  be

very  good both in Malay and English. In the  past

it  has  been such that products of Malay  schools

are  generally unfortunately weak in English,  but

we  hope  to  remedy that situation in  course  of

time.  We might even say, Sir, that the integrated

school could well become a national school of  the

future,  as  the  language medium  of  instruction

begins  to  be  more  and  more  in  the  national

language and where all the races would be together

in  one  school building and the correct type  for

the teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of the school building

programme  where the Member for Serangoon  Gardens

stated  that  the  Government  was  only  able  to

establish two secondary schools so far,  one,  the

Whampoa  Chinese Secondary School, and the  other,

the first Malay Secondary School known as the Sang

Nila  Utama School. He has forgotten, I am afraid,

the new secondary school which was opened sometime

ago  by  my colleague, the Member for Tiong Bahru,

which  is  the Queensway Secondary School  in  the

English  medium. Sir, it is one thing to say  that

we want to build 19 schools a year, or maybe 16 or

17  depending  upon whether the schools  concerned

are  six storeys instead of three storeys, so that

there will be fewer schools but they will take  in

the same number of pupils; but it is another thing

to see the schools really built. So far I think we

have been able now to build up to ten new schools,

of  which three are secondary schools. But I think

next month we will have at least three new schools

and  we  will  have to open one new school  almost

every  month.  So the rate of new  buildings  will

catch up, and we hope that by 1964 there would  be

no  less  than  17 new schools. But  the  way  the

Member  for Serangoon Gardens has put it  is  that

the   Government  has  done  nothing  for  Chinese

education. Everything that is being built  is  for

English schools. It is that chauvinistic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2711</b></font><br><br>

twang - if it is an English school, therefore, it  is

colonial   and,   therefore,  this  Government   is

colonial;  and  so on and so forth. Sir,  the  only

way to prove it is by deeds, by facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came into office in June 1959, the

enrolment  in  Government Chinese  schools  was  as

follows:  Primary, 2,233 pupils;  Secondary,  1,361

pupils,  making  a total of 3,594 pupils.  By  June

1960, these are media figures; the

Primary  enrolment  had  increased  from  2,233  to

5,775.  The Secondary enrolment was increased  from

1,361  to  5,230. The total enrolment  jumped  from

3,954,  which  is just under 4,000,  to  more  than

11,000,  i.e. close  to a 279 per  cent  increase.

June  this  year  (1961), Primary school  enrolment

was  raised  to  7,911; Secondary school  enrolment

was  raised  to  6,571; total school  enrolment  in

Government Chinese schools was 14,482, or  365  per

cent  over the figures before we came into  office.

Sir,   there  are  more  than  a  hundred  thousand

students  in Chinese aided schools and  it  is  not

possible  to  absorb  all of them  into  Government

schools. But if the Government is able to  keep  up

with the school building programme of 19 schools  a

year,  I think perhaps within a decade the majority

of   all  pupils  in  all  streams  would   be   in

Government   schools  and  a  minority   in   aided

schools, of whatever language stream they may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I cannot do better in concluding my

short  address  than  by referring  to  my  Party's

publication, Petir, Issue Vol. 4, No. 1,  Saturday,

17th  June, 1961, to an article written by  Mr  S.

Woodhull,  now  the VicePresident  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis on "The Two Years of Concrete Progress  of

the  P.A.P.".  He had this to say on  education.  I

will just quote the relevant paragraphs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Education

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In The Tasks Ahead we drew attention to the fact

that  our population was increasing by about 60,000

each  year. There was a need, therefore, to provide

schools  for  about the same number of pupils  each

year.  The  Ministry of Education has handled  this

problem of providing education with the

greatest zeal.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2712</b></font><br><br>

Another  paragraph  on the Adult  Education  Board

which   Members  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis   now

criticise. He has this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In September 1959 itself, night classes were

launched for 13,000 workers who registered

with the Board. Schools and community centres in

various parts of the Island are be

ing used for the purpose of adult education.

Further, 6,000 adults who desire a secondary

education have been provided with this oppor

tunity. It is only a matter of time before

illiteracy will completely be wiped out in our

society.'

<br><br>Sir,  either Mr S. Woodhull is the most insincere

man  when  he  wrote this "Two Years  of  Concrete

Progress of the P.A.P. Government" or the  Barisan

Sosialis are not people who stick to their word or

honour it.

<br><br>6.13 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

of 51 seats in the 1959 general elections have now

dwindled in number. They are only about-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might as well warn the

hon.  Member that I will not allow any repetition.

This  sentence that he has just delivered has been

repeated by every Barisan Sosialis Member who  has

spoken.  Let us get down to the Government  policy

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, this is the phenomenon of the present Session

of  the  Legislative Assembly. Everybody  has  the

same  feeling. If they do not give vent  to  these

feelings, they will feel rather unhappy.  But  let

us  see. Today, there are a few more left of them.

See  how many can survive until 1963. They are now

hoping.   At  every  street  corner  in  Singapore

everybody is doubtful and guessing, and  even  the

P.A.P.  Ministers and Assemblymen  themselves  are

guessing and speculating whether they can preserve

their present seats until 1963.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a  man  who in a very short space  -of  five

years   and  without  passing  through  any  major

political   storms,  such  a  youth,  namely   the

Secretary-General of the P.A.P.,  has  now  become

the  Prime  Minister  of Singapore,  without  much

merit  on  his  own part. Thus this has  made  him

very  arrogant  and  haughty. He  thinks  all  the

people  of Singapore are not as good as he is.  He

has,  now  forgotten the people who once supported

him.  He  has  relegated  them  to  oblivion.  The

attitude of the leaders of the P.A.P. towards  the

people is one of enmity. They are now collapsing-



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of order. What

has all this got to do with the policy speech?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already indicated that even

if   it   has  got  anything  to  do   with   the

Government's policy, all this has been said  time

and  time  again. It is becoming very tedious.  I

would now like the hon. Member to relate what  he

has to say to the policy speech and nothing more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the policy statement of the Government  for

the  third session deals chiefly with the  P.A.P.

sell-out type of merger. It also says that it  is

going  to  do  something for the benefit  of  the

people  and  to provide them with certain  social

amenities.  But then what achievements  have  the

P.A.P. Government made? The Government's promises

made  in  the  policy statements in the  previous

sessions - have   they   materialised?   Have   the

Government kept their promises? Nothing has  been

achieved. The policy statement for this  year  is

very poor indeed in content. There is nothing  in

it.  Everybody is disappointed when reading  this

policy statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1959 general elections, Dr Goh Keng

Swee,  namely, the present Minister for  Finance,

read  out certain policies of the P.A.P. to  the

people.  I quote from the Chinese pamphlet.  This

is on the economic policy of the P.A.P. It says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The objective of the economic policy of the

People's Action Party Government will be to obtain

for the general masses of the

people a happy, full and secure livelihood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything which can be done within the

limitations of our economy to achieve this will be

carried out by the P.A.P. Government.'

<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, today, the P.A.P. is holding the

reins  of  government  for  the  third  year.  The

welfare  and the wellbeing of the people have  not

been safeguarded. More people are unemployed. Many

graduates  of  local secondary schools  are  still

unemployed. I shall give a simple example. We read

from the newspaper last month that the Ministry of

Education  wanted to recruit 1,000  teachers  from

all  the language streams as teachers. There  were

11,683 applicants. From this it is clear that when

the  Ministry  of Education asked for applications

to fill 1,000 posts, there were so many applicants 11,000  applicants from middle school  graduates.

There are graduates from the Universities who  are

also unemployed. Cases of robbery and all kinds of

crimes are happening everywhere and everyday.  The

Government  does not try to solve these  problems.

Instead,  it  resorts  to  certain  tactics   and

actions against those people who do not see eye to

eye  with  it; for instance, members of  the  Work

Brigade and the staff of the People's Association.

From  all  this, we can see what the  Government's

attitude to them is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask the hawkers and the workers what their

livelihood  has been. They can all  tell  you  that

they   are   very  disappointed  with  the   P.A.P.

Government.  It is true that the P.A.P.  Government

has been a great disappointment to us. What then is

the  cause? In the 1959 general elections,  did  it

not  clearly  promise the people  of  Singapore  to

improve the economic situation of

Singapore and to resolve unemployment? The  P.A.P.

also  printed  in booklet form their  promises.  I

will  quote them in order to show that what  I  am

saying is correct. Otherwise they will say I  have

no proof. From this booklet we can get our answers

to  rebut  them. We can see that all the  promises

made by the P.A.P. at that time have not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2715</b></font><br><br>

realised.  I  will mention some  of  them  and  to

refute everyone of them to show whether the P.A.P.

Government  has lived up to its promises.  In  the

first book of the P.A.P. pamphlet on the hive-Year

Development  Plan, there is a short passage  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us briefly consider what factors work to

our  advantage  in  industrialisation,  where  the

difficulties  are  likely to arise,  and  how  our

favourable factors can be put to the

best  advantage to overcome the difficulties.  The

correct economic policy would then emerge.'



<br><br>In this small pamphlet it is also pointed out that

in  regard  to the industrialisation of Singapore,

there  are  four  economic  advantages.  It  says,

first,   we  have  in  Singapore  a  hard-working,

resourceful and enterprising people. Our  workers,

if given the proper training facilities to develop

their   skill,  are  able  to  reach  the  highest

standard  achieved in a modern industrial  nation.

Let  us  examine  the first point.  How  does  the

P.A.P.    Government   treat   our    hardworking,

resourceful and enterprising people? Let  us  see.

Not  only  does  the Government not  organise  and

mobilise  all  workers to create a more  beautiful

and  more reasonable society, but instead  it  has

resorted  to  all means to defeat them,  and  give

them  much trouble. It has also de-registered four

trade  union federations. The Government  is  also

making  use of certain yellow trade unions,  which

have  been  banned  before, to  defeat  the  other

legitimate trade unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the promise of giving the workers certain

kinds of training to equip them with higher skills

and scientific training in order to serve society,

it depends on the people themselves to acquire the

knowledge,   to  study  and  to  practise.   Given

encouragement by the Government all  this  can  be

realised.  But  the basic attitude of  the  P.A.P.

towards the workers is not a friendly one.  It  is

at  enmity  with the workers. How  can  they  talk

about  improving the technique and  skill  of  the

workers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2716</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the Singapore Polytechnic,

which  is  meant  to  train  workers,  to  provide

personnel skilled in scientific knowledge. But how

many  workers  have the Polytechnic  trained?  How

many  workers are studying there? The  Polytechnic

does  not  provide  any  technical  education   to

Chinese stream students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pamphlet says that the second advantage of

Singapore is that its central position,  with  its

excellent  sea communications with all  places  in

the  world, gives her an advantageous position  to

obtain  cheap raw materials from nearby countries.

The  absence  of the raw materials in  the  island

itself   will   not   be  such   a   drawback   to

industrialisation  since  we  can   obtain   cheap

supplies from nearby countries. Now, that  is  the

second     advantage     Singapore     has      in

industrialisation. Since we have these  favourable

conditions  and  these  advantages,  why  has  the

Government not tried to make use of them to  carry

out  its  promises? Why then does  the  Government

make such pathetic accusations as that it does not

have raw materials and skilled labourers and other

things and contradict what it has said before?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the third advantage, the pamphlet says

there  is  a fairly substantial amount of  capital

accumulated   by   local   concerns   and   public

authorities;  that much of this capital  is  lying

idle  or  is  invested in foreign countries.  This

advantage  would give confidence to the people  in

respect  of  the  future  economic  prospects   of

Singapore.  But  all  these  good  prospects   can

materialise only if Singapore can shake away  from

colonial economic control and shake away the  yoke

of  colonial rulers, and promote the local economy

and  encourage  local  people  to  take  part   in

economic  activities. But what the  P.A.P.  Government  has  done  during their term of  office  has

greatly  disappointed us. The P.A.P. rulers  have

kowtowed  to colonial rulers. They are now  trying

to  grovel.  They  are  now trying  to  resort  to

appeasing foreign capitalists, to come

to terms with them. They have neglected our

economic development and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2717</b></font><br><br>

industrialisation  policy. In this  respect,  there

is  one very important factor, which is to make use

of  our present local capital and not try to depend

entirely  on  the  investment of  foreign  capital.

This   point  is  also  mentioned  in  the  Chinese

pamphlet of The Tasks Ahead. It says:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the

survival  of  Singapore depends on foreign  capital

and  foreign capitalists. That is to say, there  is

ample local capital for this task.'

<br><br>It continues to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But it would be foolish to imagine that whatever

we  do,  foreign capital will come in on the  scale

needed to solve our problems.

Our salvation lies in our own hands. There are no

benevolent foreigners knocking around

the world anxious to discharge these duties and

responsibilities which are rightly our

own.'

<br><br>There are also a few lines which say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us never forget that self-government is not

possible  without self-reliance. This is true  both

in politics as well as in economics.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is what the P.A.P. promised

in  1959.  How grand it sounds! But it  is  a  pity

that  our Minister for Finance is not here. He  has

said  that we should not face our economic problems

with  the  mental attitudes appropriate to colonial

servitude.  Can he still remember what he  said?  I

believe he has relegated this statement of  his  to

oblivion.  During  these 30  months,  how  has  the

P.A.P.   Government   dealt   with   the   economic

situation?  Has it carried out its promises?  I  am

not  a  Doctor  of  Economics. I have  not  studied

economics much. Of course, I am not used to  giving

grand  talks  on economic theories,  but  from  the

realities  of  life and facts,  I  feel  they  have

already  forgotten their resolute  belief  made  at

that  time. I say this not because I am now in  the

Opposition.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Finance, I also  mentioned  this

to  him on many occasions. I suggested to him  how

to  deal with the local economic situation and  how

to  deal with foreign capitalists. But he seemed to

feel  that he is a very famous economist well known

in   Singapore,  so  he  took  my  suggestions   as

something acquired from others. When somebody  else

says so, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2718</b></font><br><br>

also  say  so.  That  is what  he  thought  of  my

suggestions. But during its 30 months  of  office,

has the P.A.P. Government taken steps to encourage

local capitalists and industrialists? Has it tried

to  gather  scattered local capital  in  order  to

invest locally and to develop local industries? We

have  to  ask  our local national capitalists  and

industrialists this question. Their answer will be

the  same, that they are greatly disappointed. The

Government  has not done so. The P.A.P. Government

has  not only not reclaimed the money invested  in

England  to  invest  it in local  industries,  but

instead  it has reinvested large sums of money  in

England. How disappointing it is to us. The P.A.P.

Government is giving special treatment to  foreign

capitalists  and their local compradores.  It  has

given foreign monopolistic capitalists a five-year

tax  holiday  from income tax. It has  also  given

them  pioneer status and certain favourable  terms

for     certain    Government    industries    and

manufactures.   Although  local  capitalists   and

manufacturers can apply to have such terms,  there

is  a  provision in the Income Tax Ordinance which

gives the Government power to claim arrears of tax

retrospectively  for  12  years.  Of  course,  the

Government,  if it is in the hands of the  people,

can  have  such  a law to prevent the  evasion  of

paying tax. But during the previous Government the

people  tried  to  evade  paying  tax.  This   was

inevitable  because, during those  colonial  days,

this was one way to hit at the colonial rulers  by

evading  paying taxes to the colonial  government.

When  the  relevant laws were formulated in  those

days, they were specially meant to deal with

the  general  public. But now, if anybody  or  any

national capitalist tries to evade paying tax,  he

will be running a risk.

It  is mostly in the past that they tried to evade

tax. If they were to, put in capital, they run the

risk of investigation by the Government under  the

present  law  and  they  fear  that  they  may  be

required to pay the tax which they evaded  in  the

past. Therefore, they would rather carry out  some

other   kind  of  business  in  order   to   avoid

investigation by the Government. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2719</b></font><br><br>

this  policy of the Government is not very correct.

It  is  trying  to get golden eggs by  killing  the

goose which lays the golden eggs. But in the end it

will  lose  both the golden eggs and the goose.  If

only   it   does  not  take  stringent  restrictive

measures     against    the    local    nationalist

industrialists and capitalists who help to  promote

local  industries, commerce and trade, and economic

development,  they  will be more  than  willing  to

help.  But  the Government is in favour of  foreign

capitalists,  and is neglecting our local  national

capitalists   and  industrialists.  How   can   the

Government  now  explain  away  what  it  has  said

before, of encouraging our local industrialists and

nationalists? How can the Government now be able to

stimulate   economy   and  achieve   its   economic

purposes?  I  will  again  quote  from  the   small

pamphlet on the economic policy of the P.A.P.:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us never forget that self-government is not

possible without self-reliance. This is true  both

in politics as well as in economics.'.

<br><br>The  Minister  for Finance must  be  very  absent-minded,  because  how  can he  now  explain  this?

Perhaps he has now forgotten what he said in 1959.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When touching on the fourth advantage of

industrialisation in Singapore, he said that large

natural  markets  exist in neighbouring  countries

with  whom  the merchants of Singapore  have  good

relations  and  that  manufacturers  in  Singapore

could  have access to these markets provided  they

could  produce  goods at competitive  prices.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is obvious. There  are  large

natural   markets  existing  in  our  neighbouring

countries,  not only in the Federation of  Malaya.

The  P.A.P. is adopting a grovelling attitude  to

the  Federation of Malaya as though the people  of

Singapore  cannot exist without the Federation  of

Malaya.  The P.A.P. Government despises our  local

capitalists  and  industrialists.  It   does   not

encourage and guide them. What is the use then  of

these  large  natural markets? The Government  has

ignored  the local capitalists and industrialists.

For  instance, most of the people engaged  in  the

biscuit,  soap  and leather-shoe  industries  have

closed down. Some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2720</b></font><br><br>

them  have  gone bankrupt while others  are  in  a

very  bad  economic situation. Are these not  good

examples?  If the Government had taken  good  care

of  them  so  that  they  could  have  sold  their

products  at  a lower cost to world-wide  markets since  they had close links with these markets - the

local  economy would have improved. We should  try

to  lay  a sound foundation for our local  economy

to  help the local industries prosper. But has the

Government  done  anything towards  reaching  this

objective? Has it any plans? No, none at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see again whether the P.A.P. Government,

during  the  last  30 months of its  office,  has

tried to remedy any defects in industrialisation.

In  their small pamphlet there is a passage which

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the other side of the picture, there are

certain  weaknesses. The first is that  the  free

entry of foreign goods places local manufacturers

at a disadvantageous position especially in lines

where  it would take some years for a factory  to

reach full efficiency. Also foreign price-cutting

is  not  unknown  as a method of killing  locally

established industries.

This increases the risk of investing in manufacturing industries.'.

<br><br>In  order  to cure this weakness, we  must  first

break  away  from  the  colonial  economic  yoke,

eliminate  the colonial forces and help establish

local  industries. That is the basic method.  The

preservation of Singapore's status as a free port

and the development of Singapore as an industrial

island    are   two   contradictory   objectives.

Therefore, the Government should try to find some

means  whereby we can preserve our entrepot trade

and,  at the same time, promote industrialisation

so  that  we  can  offer more  opportunities  for

employment  to our rapidly increasing population.

Therefore,  we  have  to  expand  our  industries

rapidly. In order to protect our local industrial

products  against foreign goods and at  the  same

time  compete  in other markets,  the  Government

should  impose certain tariffs on foreign  goods.

But it is regrettable that the Government has-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Member  for  Havelock has had an  opportunity  of

seeing the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2721</b></font><br><br>

presented  yesterday.  It is  called  the  Customs

Dumping  and  Subsidies Bill  which  seeks  to  do

exactly  what  the hon. Member is  urging  now.  I

would suggest that if he has any comments on  that

particular  aspect of his speech,  he  reserve  it

until the Second Reading of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the reason is that we have not received  the

Bill in question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about how to protect the locally

manufactured goods and local industries, that  the

locally  manufactured goods have  been  badly  hit

because of competition with foreign goods.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

now  going into too much details. I have indicated

that there is a Bill which has been introduced and

when  we  come to debate it, he can go into  these

details. Let us touch on general policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  that  is  the case, I will go on to the  second

weakness in the P.A.P.'s economic policy.  This  is

very  important.  In the P.A.P.'s pamphlet,  it  is

stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The second disadvantage is that the large market

in  the Federation is not open to Singapore on the

same  terms  as  it  is  open  to  the  Federation

manufacturers. A factory in Johore Bahru does  not

pay import duty on its products but one sited five

miles away along Bukit Timah Road will have to pay

a  duty  on  goods exported to the Federation.  So

long  as this is the case, there will be a  strong

incentive to manufacturers to establish plants  in

the Federation rather than in

Singapore.'.



<br><br>This is what the Minister for Finance said at that

time.  Everybody  can clearly understand  how  the

Federation Government is treating us. It  is  just

like  an  elder brother bullying a younger brother

who  has  all  the  time  been  tolerant  of  such

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall what the P.A.P. said in 1959. This

is  to  be  found  in the Chinese version  of  the

pamphlet:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hitherto, Federation manufacturers have enjoyed

not  only  free  access to Singapore  markets  but

could also depend on Singapore's entrepot services

to help them to penetrate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>

overseas  markets. On the other hand,  Singapore's

products  are  treated  as foreign  goods  in  the

Federation.  The Federation need not  assume  that

such   a   one-sided  arrangement  could  continue

indefinitely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a common tariff-free market

within  the  framework of a larger economic  union

based  on a co-ordinated development programme  is

the  only  way whereby both territories  can  find

answers to their pressing economic problems.



<br><br>It goes on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will be foolish in the extreme for one

territory  to  take  temporary  advantage  of  the

other,  for this will set off a chain reaction  of

reprisals and counter reprisals which will lead to

the ruin of both territories. In Malaya, as indeed

elsewhere, prosperity is indivisible.''

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been correct. Discussions on a common

commodity   market  between  Singapore   and   the

Federation have been going on for two years. Up to

now,   this  question  is  still  being  discussed

between the two Governments. This proves that  the

Federation Government does not have any regard for

the  wishes  and hopes of the people of Singapore.

Where then are the ambitious aims which the P.A.P.

manifested some time ago? The P.A.P. are  adopting

an  ignominous, shameful and begging  attitude  by

asking  the  Federation to  help  them.  This  description by me is not exaggerated. Let us  examine

what the P.A.P. said in 1959 in their pamphlet:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A P.A.P. Government in negotiating with the

Federation Government for the abolition of  import

duty  on  Singapore manufactures need not approach

the   Federation  Government  in   the   role   of

supplicants for favours.'



<br><br>Is  it  not very clear from this? The P.A.P. said

that   we   would  not  approach  the   Federation

Government in the role of supplicants for favours.

Let  us  now  hear  again what the,  Minister  for

Finance  said on the 25th November, 1959, when  he

made his Budget Statement. He pointed out that the

interests  of the two territories are indivisible.

It  is to be found in Volume 11, No. 13, col.  780

of Hansard. Then he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is clear from the foregoing account that an

arrangement  of this kind accepts the fact  of  the

economic  unity  of  the two territories.  Whatever

the  political divisions, it is obvious  that  they

must co-operate in economic fields and it would  be

injurious  to both countries to take an independent

and   competitive  line  of  action  in   promoting

industrial growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the prospective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2723</b></font><br><br>

manufacturer,  the  attraction  of  investing   in

Malaya  would  immensely  increase.  A  Federation

investor,  for  instance, would be  assured  of  a

protected market not only in his own country,  but

also   in   Singapore.  Similarly,   a   Singapore

manufacturer would not have to surmount the tariff

wall  which  the  Federation  now  places  against

Singapore products. It is therefore hoped that  an

early  decision  would be reached.  Any  delay  in

reaching   a  decision  would  merely  mean   that

prospective investors may be induced  to  adopt  a

waiting policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attraction as a partner to the common

market is much greater than the comparison of  the

population  figures of the two  territories  would

suggest.  While the Federation has more than  four

persons  to one Singaporean, the purchasing  power

of  the  two territories by no means follows  this

ratio. This is because ---'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I really do not know what

the hon. Member for Havelock is driving at. He  is

either in favour

of or against the Common Market, I do not know. If

he is in favour of the Common Market, all he need

say is to tell the Government to carry on with

it. But going into these details is irrelevant. We

are on general policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

There  is  something about the  Common  Market,  I

think, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech. Well, let us confine ourselves to the

Common Market as a general policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we do not oppose  this  Common

Market with the Federation of Malaya, but we think

that negotiations

by the present P.A.P. Government on

the  question of a Common Market have not come  to

any results yet. Instead the P.A.P. Government  is

taking  a kind of grovelling attitude towards  the

Federation of Malaya. Mr Speaker, if you

think it is not necessary to quote what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2724</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister for Finance has said for comparison,

then I will not mention it again. But there is one

point, Mr Speaker. I think, in criticising the Go

vernment,  the most effective weapon is to  attack

it  with its own words. The economic interests  of

the  two territories are indivisible. Neither side

should  take advantage of the other side, but  the

Federation  of  Malaya  achieved  independence  in

1957.   After  its  independence,  the  Federation

Government not only has not helped us but has been

pressing hard on us, somewhat like persecuting us.

Yet  the  present P.A.P. Government is adopting  a

kind of trying to please attitude.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member is justified in debating the policy of  the

Federation    Government   now.   The   Federation

Government is a friendly government and I  do  not

think  he  ought to say anything derogatory  about

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

are  we supposed to stare at the P.A.P. while they

sell out the interests of the people of Singapore?

Of  course, we should not allow them to do such  a

thing.  But, Mr Speaker, we think that  Singapore

can  stand by itself. We do not have to kowtow  to

anybody.  We  do  not have to supplicate  anybody.

Everything  in the world is created by labour.  As

long  as  we have faith in ourselves, we can  live

and  exist.  There  is nothing  difficult  in  the

world.  The  only hindrance is that  there  is  no

faith in oneself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now examine the fourth

weakness.  It says the merchants of Singapore  pay

too   much   attention  to  commerce  and   little

attention  to industries. Singapore has  been  the

centre  of commerce for over a hundred years.  The

British  colonialists, for the sake of  exploiting

the  primary  materials, products  and  wealth  of

South-East Asia, did not in the past try to expand

the  local trading facilities. Whatever  they  did

was  only  for their own interests. They  did  not

have  the interests of the local people at  heart.

They did not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2725</b></font><br><br>

any intention to promote our local industries.  So

without  any  safeguard, local national capitalists

and  industrialists would not dare to invest  money

in   industries.  We  should  blame   the   British

colonialists  for what they did.  But  the  present

P.A.P.  Government  has  not  accused  the  British

colonialists.  Instead the Government  is  accusing

the local industrialists and capitalists of not  in

vesting  locally. It has also accused  the  workers

in  Singapore  of  not following the  line  of  the

Government. As I have said just now, Singapore  has

been  a  commercial port for over a hundred  years.

So  to  revert it to an industrial centre is not  a

very  easy  matter. Therefore, the Government  will

have  to  encourage  local industrialists  and  mer

chants  and national capitalists, to persuade  them

and  give  them more confidence, and  try  to  help

them  in all ways to give them confidence to invest

locally,  to promote industries and to create  more

employment  opportunities. The  livelihood  of  the

people  will  then  be solved  partially.  But  the

Government   has  not  encouraged  local   national

capitalists  and  industrialists to  develop  local

industries.  On the other hand, it  has  only  been

ridiculing   the   simple  family  industries   and

businesses   carried  on  by   them.   Of   course,

industries  managed  by a family  are  not  run  on

scientific lines. But the Government has  the  duty

to  teach them, to encourage them, to help them run

their  businesses on modern lines. So this attitude

of  the Government is only impeding the development

of  industries in Singapore. When the country is at

the  beginning  of industrialisation programme,  we

cannot  expect it to be up to modern standards,  up

to  100  per  cent. Our local national  capitalists

have  been  going  through a long period  in  which

they  have  been exploited by foreign  monopolistic

capitalists.  They  have been  suffering.  But  the

Government  has  not  tried  to  help   them.   The

Government  has said that it wants  to  help  build

local  industries. But, on the other  hand,  it  is

actually  helping foreign monopolistic  capitalists

in industry locally. There are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2726</b></font><br><br>

foreign monopolistic concerns established. That is

the  Shell  Oil Refinery. When it was established,

the  concern  employed only one  extra  worker.  I

remember that-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is getting rather fantastic how

the   Barisan   Sosialis  Members  are   repeating

arguments  which have been advanced by  their  own

Members in this Chamber. Let us try not to repeat.

Let us touch generally on the Government's policy.

Mr Low.

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  no  intention to repeat what others  have

said. What I want to do is to mention the most  important  point.  Having done  so  much,  the  said

company  only engaged one extra worker. From  what

we   have  revealed  about  the  various  economic

advantages and disadvantages of Singapore, we  can

easily come to this conclusion, which is that  the

P.A.P. Government, which has been in office for 30

months,  has not carried out its promises made  in

1959.  The whole economic policy is near the stage

of  bankruptcy. The livelihood of the  people  has

become  more  difficult. The  whole  situation  in

Singapore  is very confused. It is in a  state  of

turmoil. All this can be attributed to the  P.A.P.

In  the  P.A.P.'s pamphlet, it is  also  mentioned

that the unemployment problem in Singapore is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2727</b></font><br><br>

very  acute.  If  we  do not try  to  resolve  this

problem  now,  then by 1962 the situation  will  be

out  of  hand. It will be very difficult to  tackle

it.  The  P.A.P. is  now  trying  to  salvage  its

political  fortunes and to save itself from  dying.

To  do so, it is now trying to carry out a kind  of

phoney  merger in order to achieve its own  purpose

of   maintaining   its   political   position   and

political power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to say that if we want to make the

economy of Singapore a prosperous one, we have,  on

the  one hand, to eliminate colonial influences and

forces  and, on the other hand, to try to build  an

independent  and autonomous economic system.  Therefore,  our major economic tasks now are, first,  to

eradicate  colonial economic control  and  economic

forces  and  to eradicate all kinds of unreasonable

phenomena  from  our  society.  When  there  is  no

exploitation of man by man can we then achieve  our

purpose  of  having a more just and equal  society,

which is our long-term aim.

<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

wish  to  waste  the time of this  Assembly  to  do

roundabout  talking, because we have  been  sitting

in  this  Assembly for quite sometime  and  we  are

almost  tired  of  words being repeated  again  and

again.  I  do not think this is necessary  for  the

people  of  Singapore. I feel that we, as  represen

tatives  of the people, are big enough and  we  are

quite  aware. We can understand what  we  say.  But

unfortunately  there  are  people  who  could   not

understand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention in debating the Address of Thanks to

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in connection with  the

Government's  policy is to draw  the  attention  of

the  Government, who has governed Singapore for two

and  a  half  years,  to  certain  things.  It   is

necessary for us to look back during the two and  a

half  years  and  see  what  are  the  achievements

confronting us now. This Government was elected  to

power because it promised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2728</b></font><br><br>

to  bring  prosperity to the people of  Singapore.

The  people of Singapore are still waiting for the

promises to be fulfilled. But what we get is  just

the  reverse. There are things which are not satisfactory to us. There are political conflicts among

the  people. We find more unemployment, and it  is

getting worse each day. This is one instance which

shows  that  the Government, who claims  to  be  a

socialist   Government,  has  not  fulfilled   the

promises it made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance is this. There are rules and

regulations  as to where hawkers  are  to  set  up

stalls and what will happen to them if they do not

comply  with  those rules. It is  not  that  these

hawkers  wish  to be like this, but they  have  to

rely  on  their livelihood as hawkers. But  it  is

wise  on  the part of Government to plan long-term

development programmes, although the results  will

not  be achieved within a short space of one year,

two   years   or   three  years.  Such   long-term

objectives will not immediately effect a change in

the   livelihood  of  the  people.   Everyone   in

Singapore  needs  all  the basic  necessities  and

amenities  of  life, as are required  by  ordinary

human  beings.  A  short-term  objective  can   be

achieved  within  a  specified  time.  It  is  not

because we are half independent but because of the

restrictive constitutional conditions that we  are

barred from finding ways and means. I feel this is

merely  an excuse put forward which is not in  the

interest  of  the  public. I  think  there  is  no

difficulty which cannot be resolved. If there is a

will, there is a way, Mr Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, today we are providing houses.

There  are unemployed persons and the money  spent

an  housing will be wasted because the houses will

not  be occupied by people because they are unable

to  afford  the  rentals. This is  the  reason  as

explained  by  a  Member of  this  Assembly.  This

cannot wholly resolve the unemployment problem. On

the  contrary, it will lead to communal  distrust.

They will have no faith in the Work Brigade which,

it  is said, was in fact established for the  good

of  the  people, although the object of  the  Work

Brigade was to help in the implementation of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2729</b></font><br><br>

Government's  development  programmes.  I  do  not

wish  to  go  deeply into the details,  but  it  is

obvious  that  the Work Brigade is merely  for  the

good of the party in power and not for the good  of

the  people  of Singapore. Similarly, Mr  Speaker,

although  we admit that the present Government  was

elected on the basis of parliamentary democracy and

that it is the responsibility of the Government  to

govern, we cannot get the support of the people  if

the  methods  of administration are not implemented

in the true spirit of democracy. Democracy does not

mean  that the Party that has been elected to power

can force plans down the throats of the people. The

people  are not like hens which we feed with maize.

We  as humans beings can distinguish the good  from

the bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself has admitted that he

has  no  confidence in nominating  persons  to  the

Public Service Commission who are not closely  asso

ciated  with  the P.A.P. So when such a  method  is

adopted   naturally   there   is   a   feeling   of

dissatisfaction among those persons who cannot  get

through the P.S.C. I think this question of  having

no  faith  in the non-P.A.P. members is a  mistake,

because  the  Government are not merely responsible

for P.A.P. members. They are not going to provide a

livelihood  for  P.A.P. member's  alone.  They  are

responsible  for  all  the  people  of   Singapore,

numbering 1½ million. Therefore, if this  practice

is   continued  by  the  Government - we  experienced

Japanese  administration for over 3½  years - I  fear

more  chaotic  conditions will be suffered  by  the

people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of land planning, Mr Speaker, I

know  the  Government is basing it on  the  Master

Plan  which, according to this policy speech,  says

that the Master Plan will be revised to fit in with

the  prevailing conditions as to the  provision  of

houses  for  the  public  and  the  development  of

factories and so on. I would like here to draw  the

Government's attention to the fact that it is right

and proper that some revision be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2730</b></font><br><br>

made  to the Master Plan. I think suggestions  for

the  amendments have already been submitted to the

Government for consideration. I raise this matter,

Mr  Speaker, in view of the unsettled conditions,

that  is  to say, wherever vacant land  is  found,

there will be erected unauthorised huts. But I  do

not  wish  to  go  into  details.  Admittedly   in

accordance with the law the people who build these

unauthorised  huts  are  at  fault.  These  people

deserve  to be punished. The Government has  taken

action to demolish these huts. But one thing which

I  would like to awaken the Government to is  that

these   people  are  the  people  who  have   been

neglected.  To  the  best of my  knowledge,  these

people  are unemployed or are not fully  employed.

They  are  hawkers selling satay and  things  like

that.  They are renting cubicles at $20 per month,

sometimes $25 per month. They do not like to  rent

such   cubicles  because  of  the  unhealthy   and

insanitary conditions. Naturally they wish to seek

better  accommodation. These cubicles are  not  in

accordance with the building regulations.  Because

circumstances force them to do so,  they  have  no

alternative   but  to  erect  unauthorised   huts.

Although   these  unauthorised   huts   had   been

demolished  by the Government, they were  prepared

to  live in them. So this is a matter to which the

Government   should  give  serious  consideration.

These people are prepared for the worst. They  are

not prepared to quit. This is a serious matter and

I  have  brought it to the knowledge of the  Prime

Minister.  I  have  suggested  to  him  how   this

delicate  problem  could be overcome.  But  up  to

today,  my  Party has not yet received a  positive

reply   whether  our  recommendations  have   been

accepted  in order to overcome this very  delicate

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this policy debate I have heard Members of

the Barisan Sosialis who, in addition to attacking

the  present P.A.P. Government, have also seen fit

to  criticise the Federation Government  which  is

not in this Chamber. But as a member of a Party-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member did hear me

over-rule the Member for Havelock when he attacked

the  Federation  Government. I  do  not  think  he

should expand on that now.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I bow to your

ruling,  Mr  Speaker. I will  not  reply  to  the

criticisms  levelled by the Member  for  Havelock.

Once again I emphasise that the elected representa

tives  of  the  people must speak with  sincerity,

that all that they express in this Assembly is, in

fact, for the benefit of the people. If they  have

to  depend on the backroom boys, I think it is  no

use.



<br><br>7.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  have heard  the  third  policy

statement  read out by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

in  regard to the Government's policy, and we feel

very   disappointed.   We   realise   the   P.A.P.

Government  is now at a loss to know what  to  do,

and  so it has to pin its hopes on merger to  save

its fate



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have repeatedly directed

hon.  Members  to  keep away from  the  subject  of

merger.  We have dealt with it. It should not  even

be touched upon in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  just  mentioned the word "merger" in passing.  I

will not mention other details. Mr Speaker, Sir



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps what I have said has

not   been  understood  by  the  Member.   I   have

indicated  that the word "merger" or any  reference

to   merger  even  in  passing  might  provoke   rejoinders. So the best thing any hen. Member can  do

is  to refrain from touching on merger, which  took

us, I think, about 12 days to dispose of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank you for

your  direction, Mr Speaker, Sir. Let us  look  at

the  P.A.P. in  its handling of the political  and

economic  fields. What has the P.A.P. achieved  in

21 years in the political and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2732</b></font><br><br>

economic  fields?  The  answer  is  nothing.   The

negotiation for a common market between  Singapore

and  the Federation has not come to fruition. This

House has not been informed of any result so  far.

The  Four-Year Development Plan, as far as we  can

see,  is  nothing  but a mere plan  in  which  the

P.A.P. tries to

make itself happy. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the whole

of the policy statement for the

present   session,  we  can  discover   that   the

Government  is  now indulging in another  kind  of

argument.  It is contradictory to what  they  said

last  year.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  like  your

permission to make some quotations from the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech appearing in column  12

of Hansard dated 31st October, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on

which the original economic policies of the

Government were based must be reviewed. As part of

a greater entity, Singapore can stand up better to

its...'-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Here again the Member for

Punggol  is developing an argument which  involves

merger.  I  have indicated that that  has  already

been  dealt  with and I do not want  a  debate  to

develop on any aspect of merger.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  you  will  remember that  the  Minister  for

Finance declared

last year that the Government wanted to increase

the registration fees of businesses

and  the  property tax. At that time, my colleague

the  Member for Hong Lim, with a mandate from  the

people,  criticised the Minister  for  Finance  by

saying  that the Estimates were going  to  extract

money  from  the people. The Minister for  Finance

tried  to  defend himself and this resulted  in  a

very  heated debate. At that time, the  Government

insisted  on its own views and refused  to  revise

its  economic policy which was based on a  certain

assumption.  The  P.A.P., in  wanting  to  prevent

itself from coming to a political end, changes its

policy  from  time to time. We can see  this  very

often and there is no need for us to speak a

lot on this. In order to survive, the P.A.P. has

resorted to all sorts of tactics. It has

restored the pay cuts and it has cancelled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2733</b></font><br><br>

the    registration   fees   for   business    and

professions. The Government is now in  a  pathetic

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have already approved about

$6  million  as expenditure for the  Work  Brigade

next  year.  This  is  a  considerable  amount  of

money.   But   we  have  not  as  yet   seen   any

comprehensive  plan which the Government  proposes

for  the Work Brigade. I am not personally against

the  Work  Brigade  or its members  who  are  very

young  and  useful people. If the  Government  can

take  good care of them, they would then  be  able

to help in nation building.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>7.50 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to a lack of leadership and

ability  and  the  lack of a  comprehensive  plan,

these  young people are just like heroes who  have

no  way to express their abilities. As a result of

this,  public funds are being wasted on  the  Work

Brigade.  This is, however, not so  bad.  But  now

the  Government  is even making  use  of  military

forces  and the police to suppress members of  the

Work  Brigade. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can  see

that  this  Government is becoming more  and  more

fierce.  The  Prime Minister is now as  fierce  as

Hitler  was. I think if this amount of $6  million

is  spent  on the construction of roads and  amenities  in the rural areas, the people in the  rural

areas will derive a great deal of benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we can see that the

Government  have done hardly anything in  respect

of   health.  We  know  that  the  population   of

Singapore  is  increasing  from  day  to  day.  At

present the Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital  has

to attend to too many people. I wonder whether the

Government are considering any plan to expand this

hospital.  As a result of the present  congestion,

many  pregnant women can only stay in the hospital

for  one  day.  As a result of this,  mothers  and

babies are not receiving proper care. On the other

hand, instead of doing something to extend the hos

pital, the, Government are building more and  more

community centres from public funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2734</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have not helped the poor people

very  much.  I can quote an example to  illustrate

this.  Clinics,  which are  a  help  to  the  poor

people,  are not being built in great  numbers.  I

want  to  quote some facts to, show  how  the  Government  are  ill-treating  our  poor  people   in

Singapore.  At the 6th milestone, Upper  Serangoon

Road,  there is an old post office which has  been

turned into a children's welfare clinic. This  old

post  office building is very small and every  day

you  have many mothers bringing their children  to

this  converted clinic because they cannot  afford

to  incur  medical expenses. When there is  a  big

crowd,  they  have to line up in the  hot  sun.  I

would  like  to  ask the Government  whether  such

treatment of the poor people is proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, we can take a look at the other

side  of  the  picture. In Upper  Serangoon  Road,

there is a new community centre which is closed in

the  day. It is only used in the night when  there

are  a  few people playing some games. At the  9th

milestone,  Punggol, there is not  even  a  single

clinic  although  it is a very crowded  area.  The

Government  would do a better job  if  they  spend

money  on  the  building of more clinics  than  on

community centres. We made these proposals  during

the Hong Lim by-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember that when the P.A.P. came to

power  in 1959, the former Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Ministry of Health, who is now the Member

for  Nee  Soon, invited me to visit the Woodbridge

Hospital  which is in the constituency of Punggol.

I  had occasion to visit the voters living in  the

neighbourhood  and I noted that the workers  lived

in  a  crowded  area. In some cases,  many  people

lived in a small room. The ventilation was bad and

so  was  the other aspect of health. Therefore,  I

asked  the Minister for Health to pay a  visit  to

this  place.  He  agreed to  do  so  and  we  went

together  to inspect the quarters of the  workers.

The  Minister  for Health agreed to my  suggestion

and  promised to do something about  it.  He  even

went to the extent of saying in an angry tone that

this  came about as a result of colonial rule.  He

told  the  workers  that the Government  would  do

their best to improve their living conditions. But

now the Minister has changed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2735</b></font><br><br>

and  the promised improvement has not come  about.

I hope the new Minister for Health will one  day

pay this place a visit. A man with the physique of

the  Minister for Health will not be  able  to  go

into  the building. I am not making a joke at  his

expense, but it is a fact that the building is too

small for him to enter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Deputy  Prime Minister referred to  what  the

Government   have   done  in   respect   of   road

construction in the rural areas. Yes, we agree and

we  cannot  deny what they have done, but  what  I

want  to  say  is  that they have not  been  doing

things  in a positive manner. The construction  of

roads  and  the  installation of  standpipes  were

carried  out  to  a great extent  by  the  present

Member for Hong Lim who was then the Minister  for

National Development. Within a short period of one

year  about 300 standpipes were installed. I spent

two weeks working on the job. In the morning I had

to get up at 6 a.m. to go out with the engineers-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is going

into  details, such as how the Member worked,  and

so  on.  We are discussing the speech setting  out

the Government's policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I will not take long.  I  am  just

mentioning  it  in passing. And so this  work  was

done,  to  a great extent, by the former  Minister

for  National Development. The remaining  part  of

the  work  has  been done by the Urban  and  Rural

Services   Consultative  Committee.  Its   present

President  is the Member for Tampines who  is  now

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Deputy  Prime

Minister. He lives in the rural area and he  knows

this  area  well. He is an old man to whom  I  pay

respect. He is one of those old men whom I respect

most.  So I hope he will, in the spirit of service

to  the  people, carry out work in the rural  area

with  the powers which I hope the Government  will

give him. I believe that during his term of office

he will be able to-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2736</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Member  should discuss the Government policy,  and

not, the  Member  for Tampines' personal  policy.

Will the Member please come back to the subject of

the debate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am of the

opinion  that  this  work in  the  rural  area  is

closely   connected  with  the  Urban  and   Rural

Services  Consultative Committee. Now I am  making

some  views in this respect. I hope that  this  is

not a departure from the debate. What I have been

saying is that the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Deputy   Prime  Minister  knows  full   well   the

conditions   in  the  rural  area.  I   hope   the

Government will give him more powers to enable him

to do some work in the rural area during his term

of  office.  In the meantime, with the  additional

powers  he  has, he will be able to do  some  more

work  for  the welfare and interest of  the  rural

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me touch upon the

land and building constructions in the rural area,

especially the procedure for applications to build

houses.  During the general elections, the  P.A.P.

used  to  promise the people that once t  came  to

power  it  would  simplify  all  applications  and

procedures  for permission to put up  houses.  But

now,  as  far as I can see, there has been  little

improvement in this line. I am of the opinion that

the  Planning Department is closely related to the

rural  area, because mans parts of the rural areas

have been referred to as "the green belt" on which

no  houses  will be allowed. On the one hand,  the

land in the rural area is not well defined as  far

as the boundaries are concerned. So when the rural

people apply to the Land Office for permission  to

put  up houses, they are always turned down by the

Planning  Department because there is  a  lack  of

land.  Now,  if  a piece of land is  not  defined,

well, there will be no

roads. It does not mean that inside the land there

is  no  system of roads. If this situation is  not

improved, then the

rural  people  will  find  it  difficult  to   get

permission  to  put up attap huts. The  procedures

regarding  such applications should be  simplified

as  far as possible. It is the stand of the United

People's

Party which has not changed at all. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2737</b></font><br><br>

we  were  struggling with the  P.A.P. we  had  the

courage  and confidence to fight it. We the  United

People's  Party will continue the work left  behind

by  the P.A.P. in the City Council and we will  try

to  do  our  best  to express the  opinion  of  the

people  and  to  alleviate  the  suffering  of  all

classes of people.

<br><br>8.08 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  two and a half years ago the keynote  in  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech was one  of  great

confidence  and optimism regarding the  future.  In

that  speech  he  gave us three forecasts  of  fine

weather  ahead.  The  first  was  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  would build up a climate of  confidence

for  great  expansion  and industrial  growth.  The

second  forecast was that there would be  political

stability since the Party in power held 43  out  of

51  seats  in the Assembly. The third forecast  was

that  there would be no industrial unrest;  instead

there would be industrial peace with justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time the Opposition was very small

in  number, but we warned the Government that there

would  be  hidden rocks ahead, that there would  be

unseen dangers-

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thirteen unseen rocks!

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - and that there might be

stormy  weather. Sir, at that time the  Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis were Members of  the  Government  Party.  Today  the hidden rocks  have  become

visible.  Today, the three weather  forecasts  have

proved  to  be  wrong.  Instead  of  a  climate  of

confidence,  we have today a climate of uncertainty

among  the  people. Instead of political  stability

as  promised,  there is now great instability,  and

the  Government  majority has been reduced  to  one

vote.  Instead of industrial peace,  there  is  now

grave   industrial  unrest  and  an   epidemic   of

strikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see Singapore becoming a veritable battle-ground of two contending groups of trade unions - an

unfortunate  state of affairs which the  Government

seems  unwilling  to tackle vigorously.  Apparently

things have been allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2738</b></font><br><br>

go  on  indefinitely. Under the circumstances,  no

wonder  the tone ,in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech  this  year  is  no longer  optimistic  but

instead is a very cautious one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government now talks about two roads - the main

highway  leading to peace and prosperity, and  the

sidepath leading to disunity, to chaos and to  economic  ruination. Sir, we contend that we are  not

at  the crossroads. We contend that since 1959 the

people  of  Singapore  have  been  led  down  that

sidepath to chaos and economic ruination. Sir,  we

hold  both the P.A.P. and the Barisan responsible.

They misrepresented the sidepath then as being the

main highway. And today, instead of having greater

peace, unity and prosperity, we are already  in  a

serious  state of affairs. We are not  facing  the

crossroads.  We are not facing a political  crisis

or  economic crisis. We are now in the midst of  a

political  and an economic crisis. I am  sure  the

P.A.P. now agrees, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of unemployment has been soft-pedalled. We know, and all political Parties know,

that  we  are  facing  a very  grave  situation  as

regards  the  unemployment problem. The  Government

has  seen fit, while mentioning the seriousness  of

the  situation, to underplay it and say that it has

been  partly alleviated by the present boom in  the

building  industry.  Employment  figures  in   that

industry  show  that the number of people  employed

has   not  reached  the  level  of  that  in  1957.

[Interruption]  We  will come  to  that,  Sir.  The

Government    has   decided   that,    under    the

circumstances,  it  is  impossible  to  solve   the

unemployment   problem   without   remedying    the

political situation. We are not allowed to touch on

the  question  of merger, Sir, and so  I  will  not

refer  to  that.  But in the Four-Year  Development

Plan,   they  did  say  that  under  certain   very

favourable   circumstances  described   as   "under

conditions  of maximum acceleration" the Government

hoped  to  solve  this problem by inducing  private

investors to invest to the tune

of   $600  million  to  provide  jobs  for  30,000

workers.  The rate estimated would be $20,000  per

job  per  worker.  Sir, that is the  target  which

under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2739</b></font><br><br>

present  circumstances we know cannot be  achieved,

even  in the next two years. If the conditions were

as  in  the  Federation, one  could  say  that  the

target  could  be achieved. But under  the  present

conditions,  what  do we see? Instead  of  maximum

acceleration,  we might describe the conditions  in

Singapore  as  those  of  maximum  retardation  and

friction,  because  in the struggle  for  political

power  between the Barisan group and the Government

group,  the welfare, the livelihood, the prosperity

of  the  people have become subordinated.  This  is

most  unfortunate, because the situation is  really

grave  and almost desperate. When we think  of  the

workers  of  Singapore, people  have  not  realised

that  we must think not in terms of the workers  in

employment   only  but  also  of  the  workers   in

unemployment  and  those  leaving  school   seeking

employment.    According   to   the    Government's

estimate,  there  will be in  1964  something  like

83,600  unemployed.  Sir,  I  believe  this  is  an

underestimate. Very likely the figure is very  near

100,000  or even more. It has not been realised  by

many  people that there is another picture somewhat

hidden,  and  that  is that the number  of  workers

employed  has since 1957 been reduced by  something

like  15,000. I shall be quoting figures to support

this.  So we have a double picture of this tragedy.

One,  employment since 1957 becoming less and  less

and  less;  more  and  more being  retrenched.  The

number  in  the queue of unemployed seeking  employ

ment  increasing  year  by  year  because  of   the

thousands coming in from the schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> No birth control!

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister

has  estimated that the annual intake is  something

like  15,000, increasing year by year. In the  1960

Annual  Report  of  the Labour Department,  Command

Paper  24  of  1961, the total number  of  employed

workers  in  Singapore  was  123,000  in  1957.  In

September 1959 it went down to 106,800, and in  the

following year, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2740</b></font><br><br>

September 1960, it went down again to 105,600.

I am quoting this sentence, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The above figures give a picture of declining

employment.'

<br><br>A total reduction of 17,400 workers in three

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the field of building construction,

regarded  as  the most optimistic  field  that - I

agree - shows the same decline from 1957  and  a

slight rise, I might say, beginning in 1960.  We

hope  building  construction  will  increase  in

volume as the years go on. The figures, however,

from  1957  have  been  very  discouraging.   In

September 1957, there were 15,000 workers in the

construction industry. In 1958, 12,000  workers.

I think-

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Member  is  going  into too many  details.  This

decline  in unemployment has been dealt with  at

length  at the beginning of this session by  the

Opposition Members who put the question  to  the

Government  side. Even during this debate,  this

decline   has   been  quoted   in   the   Labour

Department's Report. The Government has given an

explanation. I think the hon. Member should come

back  to  the general principle of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am touching on

something  quite  new. It has  been  shown  that

unemployment has been increasing-yes. But it has

not  been shown that the employment figures have

been  decreasing. I am showing here that by  the

time  we reached September 1959, it has gone  up

to 8,000.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member

can  just  touch on it as a passing remark,  but

not in detail.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If that has been accepted by

the  Government, Sir, we proceed  to  the  next.

What  was this factor that happened in 1957 that

brought  about an economic crisis? In 1957,  the

People's Action Party took

control  of the City Council. A new factor  came

into  the scene. Less workers in employment.  In

1959,   another  new  factor  came  on  to   the

political scene.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2741</b></font><br><br>

The  P.A.P. won  control of this Assembly  by  43

against  a  small Opposition. Strange to  say,  the

victory of a Party that has declared itself  to  be

for  the  workers  resulted in  a  less  number  of

workers  being  employed. Sir,  today  the  Barisan

star  has come out of the lightning or from  behind

the  lightning.  It  remains  to  show  whether  in

future  the  people have learnt a  lesson,  whether

the  workers of Singapore are going to suffer  some

more.  We  hope that by this time they have  learnt

to read the signs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959 when we warned that there would be

rocks  and stormy weather, they laughed at us.  Now

we  see  the rocks here, [Laughter] and we  realise

that it is not a laughing matter for the people  of

Singapore.  They  laughed,  Sir,  but  we  did  not

laugh.  They took a tiger, put a pink ribbon  round

it  and  then told us and the public,  "This  is  a

tame  pussy-cat  being domesticated.  There  is  no

fear at all."



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> It will bite you!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Today they have learnt that we

must  give respect to the tiger and let it be free

in its own habitat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are behind you!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> We cannot expect to ride the

tiger and fare well. Maybe they fare well. But  we

do  not fare well. The Prime Minister has given up

the  role  of trying to hide his tiger. We  notice

that the Member for Queenstown is undertaking this

job.  Maybe being a doctor by profession, Sir,  he

hopes to chloroform-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Member  should bear in mind that we  are  debating

the  Government policy as outlined in the Yang di- Pertuan  Negara's  speech. When listening  to  the

Member, it seems to me that he is completely  away

from the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2742</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

trying  to  give  the  cause  of  this  political

instability which is a very important  factor  in

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. I am trying

to  show  that  this political  instability  will

continue  so  long as the tiger is being  treated

like a pussy-cat. If the Barisan leader is trying

to  treat  it in the way the Prime Minister  did,

then  he may regretfully meet with the same fate.

I  was  trying to show that he, being  a  doctor,

might  try  another  method,  to  chloroform  the

tiger,  but in the struggle, the stopper  of  the

chloroform bottle might get loose and the  doctor

himself  become chloroformed. I am  glad  to  see

that   Members  of  the  Government   know   from

experience that this can happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Stamford made a statement

with  which  we  wholeheartedly agree.  She  said

there  are women who want employment in order  to

secure bread and freedom. The only thing is  that

she  limited that freedom to freedom so that  the

wife could be independent of the husband. Sir,  I

am  sure,  in  fairness to husbands,  she  should

allow  the  same  freedom  to  the  husbands.  In

political  life  the same principle  holds  good.

When  we  want  bread and freedom for  ourselves,

whether we are in a community or in a party or in

a nation, we must concede that there must be also

the same desire to allow bread and freedom to  be

available  to  people of other  groups,  even  to

other  political Parties, and other  communities.

In that spirit democracy will prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch very briefly on certain

aspects   in   the   policy  statement   of   the

Government. First, on housing. Few people realise

that  whenever  private enterprise  builds  three

houses in the city area, one house is donated  to

the  Government, and for every four houses  built

outside  the  city  area,  another  goes  to  the

Government. So that by encouraging private people

to  build,  workers to own their own houses,  the

Government  is  lightening the burden  that  they

could  carry  themselves.  No  doubt  they   have

removed the development charges, but I have  been

told that they have increased the deposits to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2743</b></font><br><br>

point  where they will become a deterrent. I  hope

the Government will look into this matter because,

if  it is their desire to encourage housing,  here

is  one way by which they can encourage it. Let us

remember that Government will be benefiting in the

long  run  not only through houses,  as  they  are

donated  to them, but by way of increased revenue,

payment of light, water and other charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on education, I understand the Government

is   thinking  of  building  multi-storey  primary

schools,  and that the first one will  be  in  the

Selegie Road area and there will be 7 storeys -





<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Ten.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Ten storeys. This has been

tried  in certain cities. When f was in New York  I

remember being shown a very tall building and  they

said  that  was a school. Sir, I hope the  Minister

has  taken  all  precautions to prevent  accidents,

because young children, being thoughtless, are  apt

to  push  one another and there have been instances

where  small  children  have  been  pushed  out  of

windows.  Luckily, in these particular cases,  they

just  fell  to ground level, about six feet  below.

Precautionary  measures  would  require  wire  mesh

over windows. Another thing is the lift, lifts  are

liable  to  go wrong. I hope there will be  liftmen

provided.  We  cannot expecct  young  children  to

know  all  these  things. After one experiment, if

the  results  are  not proved to be  very  good,  I

wonder  if  the Minister will reconsider the  whole

thing   and  have  multi-storey  secondary  schools

rather  than  primary  schools,  because  secondary

school   boys  can  always  have  their  games   on

playgrounds  sited  a  distance  away  from   their

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government carry out their policy

of  having  the good boys in schools  in  the  city

area  and  the  failures in schools  in  the  rural

areas,  great hardship will befall parents who  are

unable  to  pay  the extra transport  involved  and

they are now being forced through circumstances  to

look  for  private schools in the city area.  Under

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2744</b></font><br><br>



circumstances,   it  may   be   wise   for   the

Government to reconsider the present  policy  of

actually   killing   the  private   schools   by

allowing those private schools which are  up  to

the  right  standard to carry on,  because  they

are  also playing a useful part in solving  this

problem of education over here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the Government policy of

building  more  and more State schools  so  that

they exceed the number of aided schools, I think

it is only right that the Government should bear

the  greater  responsibility. But  let  us  also

remember  that it is important to  provide  keen

competition for the Government schools  so  that

the  standard will not be lowered. Sometimes the

spirit  of  free enterprise does more  than  the

State  can  do.  The  parents'  wishes  must  be

considered so that where they want to have their

children sent to certain schools to the  private

or  aided Chinese middle schools - there should

be  no  attempt  made to prevent them.  In  such

cases  our  Barisan friends will  not  have  any

cause  to complain because, after all,  we  must

allow  the  parents to decide to  which  schools

they want to send their children.

<br><br>8.34 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I do not wish to spend too  much

time  on  the policy statement of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. I am personally in full support

of  the Prime Minister when he thanked the Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara  for  reading  the   policy

statement in this House. He said that  we  have

made headway in achieving things for the people

in Singapore. We have made some improvements in

the   basic   requirements  of  life.   Members

opposite, regardless of whether they  are  Left

or Right, whether they are adventurists or not,

when  they  see  the results of the  P.A.P. in

serving  the people, feel a bit sour about  it.

In   the   broad  masses  there  is   political

awakening, which is unprecedented. So the Right-wing  remnants are no more hopeful. As  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis, which claims to be the  most

progressive   Party,  well,   these   Left-wing

adventurists cannot do anything good, but  they

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2745</b></font><br><br>

make  a mess of things. Their desperation and their

excitement today have come about as a result of the

selfishness of their backseat drivers, and also  as

a result of their lack of analysis of the political

situation  in Malaya. At present they are launching

a  desperate campaign which is not supported by the

people.  Neither have the people any  sympathy  for

the  campaign.  But  it  is our  responsibility  to

remind  these  reckless people that  they  must  be

rational  and  exercise self-restraint,  especially

the  Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis, when

he  said  at  a  mass  rally  last  week  that  the

Singapore  citizens  will  become  people  with  no

country-

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. This is

irrelevant and out of order. If the Member wants to

reply to the attack of the Barisan Sosialis Members

on  the Government, he is at liberty to do it,  but

he  should  not  go  into details  on  the  Barisan

Sosialis' merits and demerits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The attacks

made  by  the  Opposition Members, I can  say,  are

regrettable  because the so-called  socialists  are

playing  a very dangerous communal game.  Just  now

the  Member  for Havelock described the  Federation

Government as feudalistic and Singapore as a slave.

This,  l  think, will not do any good in regard  to

the   unification  of  the  peoples  of   the   two

territories.  In  fact, such a  statement  will  be

discarded by the peoples of the two territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the

achievements  of  the Government  in  the  past  21

years,  many of my colleagues have already  touched

upon  them  in  some detail. So I do  not  wish  to

repeat  what  they have said. I only  wish  to  say

something  about  the Work Brigade  today  in  this

House. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for  Toa

Payoh has attacked the Government and described the

Work  Brigade as a concentration camp. He  mentions

how members of the Work Brigade are restricted. But

he forgets that, in the past, he was all praise for

the  Work  Brigade  soon after  its  inception  and

establishment. So you find a lot of contradictions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Member for Toa Payoh. He is a man  of  no

principle. It seems be has forgotten that when  he

was  responsible for the Work Brigade, he made use

of  his  position  and power  to  give  favourable

positions  to  those in whom he had trust  and  to

those  who followed him. Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,

the Work Brigade has come to the present situation

of  turmoil and trouble and I think the Member for

Toa  Payoh has a certain responsibility  for  this

state of affairs. Can he deny he has agitated  the

rebellious  members to form a union? The  Chairman

of  their Action Committee is an important  leader

in  Geylang  East.  The Barisan  Sosialis  Members

think  that by going through their stooges in  the

Work  Brigade they can agitate members in the Work

Brigade  to form a union to go against the  Govern

ment,  so that they Work Brigade will be dissolved

as  a result of their activities. But the facts of

today  have shattered their beautiful dreams.  All

the 10 camps of the Work Brigade have come back to

normal.  About  1,600 members are  now  leading  a

normal  life  of  discipline and doing  collective

work.  So the plot of the Barisan Sosialis leading

to  the dissolution of the Work Brigade has failed

miserably.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we  have  the

responsibility to reveal the sins  and  crimes  of

the rebellious members of the Work Brigade and the

Barisan Sosialis. Because of their foolish act  to

defy  authority, some 300 innocent members of  the

Work Brigade have suffered. Members of the Barisan

Sosialis must be responsible for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Toa Payoh

has  smeared the Work Brigade without any  grounds

at all. It is really shameless of him to make such

an  attack and smear. There is no need for  us  to

refute him at all. He says men of the Headquarters

in  the  Work Brigade, when going round the camps,

found   magazines   published   by   the   Nanyang

University Society, namely, the Torch, but we have

not  discovered any such magazines. What  we  have

discovered are some applications for membership of

the Barisan Sosialis. So you can see the intention

of the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>

Sosialis  in the Work Brigade. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  because the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

have tried to do something about the Work Brigade,

I know they are now in a state of desperation. Let

me  remind them that the Work Brigade of today  is

fully supported by the broad masses of the people.

Barisan Sosialis Members have talked at length and

made  irresponsible attacks and criticism  on  the

Government. They are very naive indeed in so doing

and  it  is  a matter for regret as far  as  I  am

concerned. They are trying their best to do things

in  their own way in Singapore in order to achieve

their political aims. They just adopt all sorts of

tactics   to  mislead  the  innocent   people   of

Singapore.  These  are hard facts  which  we  must

face.  Why  should  they not lead  these  innocent

people  in the right way? Why should they  try  to

adopt  unprincipled  means  to  mislead  them?  We

believe  Members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  will

perhaps  feel  as  sad as we  do  over  the  whole

situation  when  they  discover  that  their   own

children   have   been  misled  and   tricked   by

politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh was responsible for the

Work Brigade before hoe became a turncoat. It  was

the  same in those days as it is now. There is  no

one trying to force members of the Work Brigade to

join any union. But today, the hon. Member says it

is  like  a  wartime concentration camp.  This  is

nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my opinion that

it  is  not  easy to he a fighter of true socialism

especially   in   a  place  like  Singapore   where

political  influence  is still  in  existence.  The

people  are  quite happy with a peaceful  life;  so

they  do  not wish to have radical changes made  to

the   existing   system.  In  the   meantime,   the

colonialists are taking advantage of this  weakness

of  the  people. They are trying to perpetuate  the

existence of this social system in order to  obtain

benefits  for  themselves. We  are  aware  of  this

present   phenomenon  and  so   are   the   Members

opposite. When anti-colonial people have some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2748</b></font><br><br>

power, it is easy for them to be influenced by the

colonialists.  The Members in the Opposition  were

at  one  time champions for the cause of the  poor

people but when they came to power, they just  did

things  in the interest of a minority. As a result

of   this,  they  have  not  only  changed   their

political  stand but they have also changed  their

mode of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Members in the

Opposition   have  made  criticisms  against   the

Government  today. In their criticisms  they  have

ranged  from the important question of  merger  to

the  question  of primary schools. All  they  have

said  boils  down to this, that the Government  is

always wrong, but they have never pointed out  how

and  where  we  have been wrong. They  have  never

suggested how things should have been done.  I  am

of  the opinion that if the Opposition Members are

men  with conscience, who have the interest of the

people  at  heart, they should not play  political

games to distort the policies of the Government in

this House. They should sincerely try to work  for

the  people  of Singapore. It is only  right  that

they should work for the welfare of the masses.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is getting  late  now

and  therefore  I will cut off two-thirds  of  nay

speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House is debating the third policy

speech  of  the Government which was delivered  by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It tells us that  the

Government  has entered its third year of  office.

The  P.A.P. called  the  first  year  a  year  of

reformation, and this year a year of construction.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> On a point of order,

Sir.  This  theme  has been repeated  by  all  the

Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis - the  year  of

construction, the year of  liquidation, and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2749</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I wish to remind hon. Members

of  the Standing Order. In fact, I was on the point

of  calling the Member for Choa Chu Kang  to  order

of  order. May I remind hon. Members that they will

be ruled out of order for repetition?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, all along the P.A.P. Government  have

been   boasting   about   1960   as   a   year   of

construction.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hen.

Member that he said that the time was getting  late

and  he wanted to cut off two-thirds of his speech?

May  I  also remind him that he should address  the

wise he will get more excited?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I hope I can get the co-operation  of

the   Members  opposite.  But  if  they   want   to

interrupt, I intend to speak for three hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Ministers, Parliamentary

Secretaries   and   Assemblymen   said   that   our

criticisms  on the policy speech and the  examples

we  quoted were based on a distortion of facts.  It

is  regrettable that in the course  of  the  Budget

debate,  the  Government have  not  realised  their

past  year's mistakes. In this connection,  I  wish

to  make  use of some simple figures to  point  out

where  they have failed. In this year's Development

Estimates,  a sum of $166.2 million was  voted  for

the  Government, but as a matter of fact they  have

only  used  $67.8  million up to the  end  of  this

year.  It  is only 41 per cent of the total  amount

voted.  Therefore,  this year of  construction  has

become  a  year  of disappointment and  a  year  of

failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two days, the Government

Ministers,     Parliamentary    Secretaries     and

Assemblymen  have stressed in this House  that  the

criticisms  put forward by us were groundless.  The

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National  Development  also pointed  out  that  our

criticisms were based on a distortion of  facts.  I

would like to point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2750</b></font><br><br>

out who is really distorting facts or ignorant  of

the  facts.  The  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister   for  National  Development  said   that

agricultural production has increased  because  of

the   help  given  by  the  Government  and   that

therefore we are able to export our foodstuffs  to

other  countries.  I do not know  whether  he  has

investigated the real state of affairs or he wants

to deceive the Members of this House. I would like

to  point out that what he said is a distortion of

facts.  I  wish  to quote from the Report  of  the

Select Committee on the Agricultural Leases  Bill,

1961, which was published on 15th May. On page A10

of  this  Report there is a memorandum  which  was

submitted to this Assembly by Dr Tham Ah Kow - the

Director  of the Department of Primary Production.

The   Speaker  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Select

Committee.  The second paragraph of the memorandum

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A large quantity of eggs, vegetables and fruit,

however,  has still to be imported. In  1959  the

imports in respect of these items are as follows:-



<pre>

              Type                            Quantity

   (i) Eggs                              136,000,000 pieces

  (ii) Vegetables locally

         grown in Federation                  20,000 tons

 (iii) Vegetables imported from

         places other than Federation         96,000 tons.'

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore

have  to  spend $49 million on foodstuffs imported

from  other countries. The Parliamentary Secretary

to the Minister for National Development said that

we  exported our foodstuffs to other countries.  I

hope  the  Minister could defend him. I  hope  the

Minister for National Development can point out to

us  whether  the  report  is  wrong  or  what  the

Parliamentary Secretary said is right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order.

To  say  that  we do not export our foodstuffs  to

other countries is wrong. As far as we know-

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.

The Member is going to make a long speech. I think

it is not a point of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2751</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, this is mentioned by the Director of

Primary  Production.  He  is  an  expert  on  agriculture.  He understands his work. He  also  knows

the  agricultural output of Singapore. I think  he

knows  better  than  the Parliamentary  Secretary.

What  the Member knows comes from the Director  of

Primary Production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the

Parliamentary   Secretary  said   the   Government

provided  many roads for the people this  year.  I

have  studied the Estimates. There is not an  item

of  provision  of roads. There is a provision  for

the  repair of roads, but no provision for  roads.

What  the  Government provides is  electricity  or

water supply but not roads. I do not know-



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order,

Sir.  What  I  said just now was the provision  of

electricity  and  not  provision  of   roads.   He

mentioned everything together, including roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps he can

listen   to   the  tape  record.  Just   now   the

Parliamentary   Secretary   was   talking    about

reclamation  of land in Sungei Boyang.  I  do  not

know  whether  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   has

revealed how much the Government has spent on this

work  out  of  the total vote in the  budget.  The

Government  should complete this plan. Mr  Deputy

Speaker,   Sir,   when  we  were  discussing   the

Estimates we pointed how the Government has failed

in  this  respect but because of the limited  time

we, were  not able to do it in detail.  Therefore

the whole project to reclaim land is a failure. It

should be completed this year and not started just

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Education has said that ten years hence the P.A.P.

Government  will be able to build more schools  to

accommodate students and then there will not be so

many  private schools. I believe what the Minister

meant  when  he talked about private  schools  was

aided  schools. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  can  the

P.A.P.  Government survive to  1964?  We  are  not

sure,  about  it. However, since the Minister  for

Education has said that ten years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2752</b></font><br><br>

later  the  Government can build many  schools  to

accommodate  pupils,  I  want  to  point  out  his

intention and motive for saying this. I  got  this

impression and I hope the Parliamentary  Secretary

to  the  Minister for Education can  reply  to  us

whether after ten years there is no need for aided

schools to exist in Singapore. Does the Government

think  that the present aided schools do not  help

the   Government  in  solving  the   question   of

vacancies  for  the students? Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  this  is  a  very serious statement  if  the

Government  does not clarify this  point  clearly,

whether  by  aided schools in Singapore  it  means

Chinese,  English  and Tamil  schools.  All  along

these  aided  schools in the past 100  years  were

supported  by  people  who  gave  money  to  these

schools.  Especially under the colonial rule  they

were  struggling to exist, to carry on  to  expand

national education. According to what the Minister

for  Education has said, does the Government think

that  ten years later all these schools will  have

to  be closed down? Does the Government think that

they want to take back all these aided schools ten

years later? On this point I hope the Minister for

Education or his Parliamentary Secretary can  give

us clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the whole content

of  the  policy speech, we can see that next  year

there  will  not be any development in  Singapore,

and  that the development next year is only a  con

tinuation  of  what the Government is  doing  this

year. The whole policy speech as delivered by  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara, has been described by  our

leader  as  a  collection of reports from  various

departments and are then later submitted  to  this

House.  Many  projects which were  mentioned  last

year do not appear in the policy speech this year.

For  example, in the labour sphere last  year  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara said that the Trades Union

Bill would be tabled after amendments, but in  the

whole  policy speech this year we do not  see  any

indication that the Government is going  to  table

this Bill. Does it mean that the P.A.P. Government

is  going  to  give up its policy of unifying  the

trade union movement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the political stability

and  economic  expansion of a  country  depend  on

whether the Government has met the demands of  the

people materially and spiritually. As regards  the

material demands of the people, my colleagues have

made  very detailed criticisms, and I am not going

to repeat the arguments here. The people of

Singapore  cannot  see  any  achievements  by  the

P.A.P.  Government in the past two years. What  do

they  get  from  the  year of  construction?  What

benefits do they derive? They have lost their  confidence in the so-called construction work by  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as has been fully said

by  the Member for Bras Basah, the greatest  enemy

of  the  people  is colonialism. On the  spiritual

demands,  what the people want is greater  freedom

of speech, of assembly, of organisation, and other

activities.  All these freedoms are not  mentioned

in  the  policy speech delivered by the  Yang  di- Pertuan  Negara.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the

people of Singapore have placed high hopes on  the

P.A.P.'s fighting for these freedoms. What is  the

result?   The  result  is  that  they  have   been

disappointed. The P.A.P. Government have  deviated

from  their  stand. Not only have the  people  not

received any material benefits, but they have also

not received any spiritual benefits too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under parliamentary

democracy, if the deeds and words of the Party  in

power depart from the Party's original stand,  the

people will be the first to suffer. Without citing

concrete  facts to prove that the Party  in  power

has  now  pursued a Right-wing political line,  we

cannot  prove they are doing so. Now,  I  want  to

quote  some  of  the speeches made by  the  P.A.P.

leaders  to prove that the P.A.P. are now pursuing

a  Right-wing  political line and that  they  have

gone  contrary  to their pledges made  during  the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has failed

in construction and has also failed in politics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save the time of this House, I do not

intend to quote old newspapers and magazines.  But

if  it  is  thought necessary, I shall  quote  the

relevant  articles  to  prove  my  arguments.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  after carefully  listening  to  my

speech,  I  believe  you will understand  why  the

people  of  Singapore are not satisfied  with  the

P.A.P.  Why has the P.A.P. lost the confidence  of

the  people?  Why is the policy speech  empty  and

vague?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 31st May, 1956, at the

Joint   Conference   of  the   Central   Executive

Committee  and  the branches, the  Prime  Minister

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must point out that what we want is only

internal  self-government. But we must  not  allow

the  British  to control our State, to  manipulate

our military and economic activities.'

<br><br>In 1958, the leader of the Party, in the Fourth

Souvenir of the P.A.P. said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'1958 saw the end of a historical stage in

Singapore, and in this coming year, Singapore will

get internal self-government. There will

be   a   popularly  elected  government  and   the

political status of Singapore will become a  semi-colony. However, defence and foreign affairs  will

still   be  in  the  hands  of  the  colonialists.

Therefore,  we  cannot say that our  campaign  for

independence will come to an

end.'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from these speeches by the

Prime  Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,  we

can  discern  clearly  our present  mission.  Both

speeches  also show us the political situation  in

Singapore, namely, that Singapore is still a semi-colony.  We still do not have full internal  self-government.  We  must carry on with  our  struggle

against colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has

discarded the anti-colonial fighters and  has  come

to  a compromise with the colonialists. Their stand

in  not  distinguishing between friends and enemies

is  a departure from the original stand. I ask  the

P.A.P. to reply to us as to who has really departed

from  our  political  stand  and  principles.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, in July 1956 at a mass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2755</b></font><br><br>

meeting held at the Badminton Hall to protest

against the failure of the constitutional talks,

the Prime Minister said :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In a democratic society every legal political

Party has the right to hold mass rallies to convey

their   opinion  to  the  people.  But   now   the

Government  is  in control of the  radio  and  the

Press,  and our Party cannot convey our  views  to

the people, except by resorting to the holding  of

mass  rallies. However, the police have  tried  to

hinder  us. After a protest by our Party  leaders,

our application for a

permit to hold a mass rally was approved.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, this was spoken by the Prime Minister

in 1956. But today, in

1961,  what  is  the  situation?  The  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar is now our Prime Minister. We  would

have thought that, as a Party which is consistent,

they should have rectified all the bad practices

in the past. But instead of

doing that, they are worse than the previous

Government. Not only do they

control the radio and the Press-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon.

Member relate what he is now saying to the policy

speech delivered by the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara? I have reminded  hon.  Members

time  and  again that this debate must be confined

to the policy of the Government as outlined in the

speech.  I ask the hon. Member to relate  what  he

has  been saying to any part of the speech we  are

debating.  If he can do so, then he can carry  on,

but if, he cannot, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I was aiming at was to

point  out  to  you  that the Government  and  the

Ministry of Home Affairs have departed from  their

original

stand in dealing with democratic rights and civil

liberty.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is there any

passage in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech

which touches on that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pointed out that the

whole construction work was a

failure. The people are not satisfied with

what  the Government has done because it does  not

meet  the  material and spiritual demands  of  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2756</b></font><br><br>

Mr Speaker, Sir, let me point out

what the Prime Minister said during the

May Day celebrations in 1955. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Today [meaning Labour Day] we are happy because

the  workers in Singapore are awakened  now.  They

know  how  to use their strength to improve  their

living  conditions.  We have proved  that  we  are

united.'



<br><br>He also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Today the workers are still living in a

miserable  condition. They are not free.  Even  on

this  day there are five or six strikes staged  by

the workers. Do you think that we workers like  to

strike?  No.  A strike is the last weapon  of  the

workers.  The workers are compelled to  strike  by

the  big-bellied capitalists. These  strikes  show

that  the  people  are  still  living  in  a  very

wretched  condition. We appeal to all  workers  in

Singapore  to  support  the  workers  who  are  on

strike.'



<br><br>He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do you think that we have democracy when we can

meet here? This democracy is only a bluff. In  the

day-time you can hold a meeting, but at night  you

cannot  hold  a  meeting. All of us must  remember

that  the Emergency Regulations are still  hanging

over  our  heads. Without the abolition  of  these

Emergency Regulations, we are not able to  improve

our living standards.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 1st July, 1959, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his policy

speech to this House said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The best way of ensuring industrial peace is to

encourage  workers  and  employers  to   use   the

machinery  of  collective  bargaining  instead  of

taking direct industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implies strengthening workers' organisations

so  as to enhance their bargaining position vis-a-vis  the employers. This means the emergence of  a

unified labour movement.'





<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, during the 1959 election,  what

was the labour policy of the P.A.P.? They said  we

must  have a strong trade union movement so as  to

be  able  to safeguard the interest of the people.

In  order to achieve this aim, we must revise  the

T.U.C.  Constitution or absorb the T.U.C. into  a

new  organisation. Mr Speaker, Sir, our Prime Minister  was  shouting  that  the  workers  must  be

united. We must support the workers

on strike. We must abolish the Emergency

Regulations. How fine and beautiful are these

phrases! How progressive are these phrases! But

now when the

workers are forced to strike, he says these

strikes are political strikes. When

workers support the strikes, he says the workers

are inspired by the Communists.

When workers demand unification of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2757</b></font><br><br>

trade  union  movement, he  says  the  trade  union

organisations  are  heavily  infiltrated   by   the

Communists.  When people ask for the  abolition  of

the   P.P.S.O.,  he  says  this  is   because   the

Communists are afraid of the P.P.S.O. When  workers

demand  the  cancellation of yellow  trade  unions,

the  Government dissolve the Trades Union  Congress

and  openly support the, splinter trade unions. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in the past workers were  forced  to

strike.  But  what about now? Are the workers  glad

of  striking? In the past the workers were told  to

be  united. What about now? Is there any reason why

they   should  not  be  united  now?   Should   the

Government be allowed to dissolve the Trades  Union

Congress?  I  hope the Government and the  Ministry

of Labour can answer these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Emergency Regulations are a

means    of    suppressing   the   anti-colonialist

fighters.  When the P.A.P. was formed in 1954,  the

abolition of these Regulations was also one of  the

objectives  of  the P.A.P. When  the  P.P.S.O. was

tabled  in  this  House, the  Prime  Minister  both

outside  and inside this House opposed it. All  the

progressive   organisations   in   Singapore   also

attacked it. They held several meetings to  protest

against  it. Perhaps you can recall that  when  the

P.P.S.O. was  debated in this House,  many  people

outside  this Assembly wore black bands and carried

banners  to protest against it. In this  House  the

present   Prime  Minister,  then  the  Member   for

Tanjong  Pagar,  also attacked the unreasonableness

of  this Bill. What about now? The P.A.P. not  only

does  not want to repeal the P.P.S.O., but it  also

extends it to five years instead of one year for  a

review.  Should this be done by a socialist  Party?

The  Prime Minister, when he attacked the P.P.S.O.,

was a non-Communist socialist-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

made  his  point.  Let  us  not  go  into  further

details.  He  has  attacked Government  policy  in

retaining  the  P.P.S.O.,  and  I  think  that  is

enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I want to ask

the   Government - who  have  departed   from   their

original   stand  and  their  policies?   Who   are

inconsistent? Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1956, the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2758</b></font><br><br>

Minister,  on the 8th of December at a  mass  rally

in  the Badminton Hall, posed three questions.  The

first  was  that those who were detained should  be

brought  to trial in an open court or be  released.

The  second was to convene a round-table conference

of  all  the political Parties. The third was  that

the  Lim  Yew Hock Government had carried  out  its

anti-Communist campaign. Would the British  respect

him? He was wrong. What the British wanted was  not

his   anti-Communist  ideology.  What  the  British

wanted  was the wealth of the people in Malaya.  If

Lim  Yew  Hock  wanted to be a  national  hero,  he

should emulate President Nasser of Egypt. He should

not  collaborate with the colonialists.  He  should

lead the people to attack them. Lim Yew Hock wanted

to  be an anti-colonial hero, but at the same time

he-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Whatever has all this got to

do  with the Government policy we are now debating?

We  are  now debating the Government policy as  con

tained in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. What

has  all  that got to do with it? It is  completely

irrelevant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I want to ask the Government  is  that

they  should  release the political  detainees  as

soon    as   possible   without   any   conditions

whatsoever. Mr Speaker, Sir, in order  to  assist

you  in understanding my argument, I must say that

my  argument  is based on what the Prime  Minister

has  said  before.  In this way,  I  will  not  be

accused by the Government as being a Communist. It

was  the  Prime  Minister himself who  claimed  in

those days that he was a non-Communist socialist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are greatly disappointed in

the   policy  statement  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  especially in regard  to  the  Employment

Exchange  of the Labour Department. The Employment

Exchange  has this year given jobs to  only  1,400

people in Singapore - on the average of less than 4

persons per day. I am doubtful indeed whether  the

Government is justified in spending so much  money

and  energy in running a big organisation such  as

the Employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>

Exchange which can give only 1,400 jobs to  people

in  a  year. Has the Employment Exchange lost  the

confidence of the employers in Singapore?  Perhaps

the  employers  in  Singapore do  not  go  to  the

Employment  Exchange  to get  their  employees.  I

remember at one time the Government did appeal  to

employers  in  Singapore  to  make  use   of   the

facilities of the Employment Exchange to get their

workers.  In the meantime, it was also the  policy

of   the   Government  to  get  people  from   the

Employment  Exchange to fill Government vacancies.

But  today, what we can see is that it  has  given

only 1,400 jobs to the people of Singapore. I hope

it  will truly shoulder its responsibility so that

many  people in Singapore who go there  hoping  to

get  jobs will not be disappointed. In fact,  many

people   who  are  registered  in  the  Employment

Exchange  have  to wait for several years  without

getting  any jobs. I hope the Minister for  Labour

will   be  able  to  get  co-operation  from   the

employers as far as possible. He should appeal  to

the employers in Singapore to make full use of its

facilities  so that more and more people  will  be

able  to benefit from registration there. In  this

way the people can have more confidence in it.



<br><br>9.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to do my

best to make my

speech as short as possible. Since June 1959, when

this State began its self-government under the new

constitution,  this House has heard  three  policy

statements delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

on  behalf of the Government. I am of the  opinion

that  of the three policy statements, the  one  we

heard on 31st of October this year is most void of

content. It is the most hollow of the three policy

statements. I have been reading it over  and  over

again,  but  I  am unable to find  anything  about

social reforms therein. Apart from the mention  of

merger, this present policy speech is the same  as

the policy speech delivered by the governor of the

colonial government from year to year. Formerly, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>

British   Colonial  Government   ruled   Singapore

through  a  Governor,  and  the  policy  statement

delivered  by  him was mainly concerned  with  the

construction of roads, the building of houses, the

increase   of  hospital  beds,  the  building   of

schools, the expansion of social services and  how

the  Government was going to expand the facilities

of  the  port and telecommunications  and  so  on.

However,  the  policy statement  of  the  colonial

Governor could never give excitement or joy to the

people of Singapore, because the people were  just

not  satisfied with such things. True  the  people

require houses, hospitals and factories, but  they

also  require  democracy and  freedom.  They  also

require  a  thorough reform in the social  system.

They  also  want  to shake off the colonial  yoke.

Based  on  this fact. Mr Speaker, Sir,  you  will

know  that  after  reading  the  policy  statement

delivered  on  the 31st October by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, the people of Singapore are  very

disappointed. This policy statement is nothing but

a  slipshod  affair. It has been  rushed  through.

This  explains how the P.A.P. Government is trying

to pin all its hopes on merger. Apart from this-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already stated time

and time again that there must be no reference  to

merger in this debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government

is  no  longer interested and is no longer capable

of  dealing  with the day-to-day business  of  the

people  in Singapore. In the first year of  office

of  the  P.A.P.,  there  appeared  in  the  policy

statement of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara some  very

good phrases which gave joy to the people, such as

social  reforms, political, economic and  cultural

revolutions,  etc. It also touched upon  the  fact

that  under  colonial rule only  a  minority  were

enjoying  certain privileges. But  in  the  policy

statement delivered on the 31st October this year,

we  do not find any more such phrases. Perhaps the

big  shots  of the P.A.P. are of the opinion  that

since  they  have taken office for two years,  the

social reforms, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>

political,  economic and cultural revolutions  have

been  achieved. So there was no need  for  them  to

mention  any  more of such things. In  the  second

year  when  the policy statement was  delivered  by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, although there  was  a

lack  of fighting spirit, we must admit that  there

was some courage ,on the part of the Government  to

admit  that it had made some mistakes and  that  it

had  its  own  shortcomings. In this second  policy

statement, the Government announced that it  wanted

to  have  more consultation and understanding  with

the  people. But in the policy statement  delivered

en  the  31st  October this year, this  courage  of

self-criticism  and this courage to admit  mistakes

and   shortcomings  no  longer  exist.  The  P.A.P.

leadership today have changed. They are  no  longer

courageous  enough  to  face  their  own  mistakes.

Recently the P.A.P. has even gone to the extent  of

putting  the blame on the Barisan Sosialis for  the

mistakes  they  made.  They described  the  Barisan

Sosialis as Communists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, let me

make  a  comparison of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

policy  statement from another angle. In 1959  when

the  first policy statement was delivered, it  was

full   of  confidence  that  the  Government  would

overcome  difficulties. It touched  upon  the  fact

that  the  Government would not hesitate  to  bring

about  economic expansion. It also  said  that  the

Government  would  not hesitate  to  do  unpleasant

things  in  the  interests of the  people.  But  in

1960, when the second policy statement was made  in

the  very  beginning, it stated that the Government

had  certain limitations in carrying out its  work.

It  even stressed that the existing conditions were

not  favourable to the achievement of  a  socialist

society.  Obviously after coming  into  office  the

P.A.P. has   met  with  many  difficulties,   but

unfortunately  the ambition and the  confidence  of

the  Government has been lessened a great  deal  by

hard facts and difficulties. This year we have  the

third  policy statement made by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.  In this we can see how the Party in  power

is miserably trying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>

to  tell  the  people, "Well, hurry  up.  You  had

better  merge  with the Federation. Otherwise  you

will be finished."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have told the

Member already that no aspect of merger can be

touched upon. He is deliberately going back to the

merger problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  P.A.P.  Government has lost  its  stamina  in

social  reform. Although there is an  opportunity,

it dare not face the influence and strength of the

colonialists. On the other hand, it is  afraid  of

the  growing strength of the courageous people  of

Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy  statement

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is nothing  but  a

statement  written  on  paper.  Even  then  it  is

capable  of  reflecting the change  of  stand  and

ideology of the Party in power in these few years.

My  colleagues have already quoted many  classical

examples  in  this  House  to  explain  how  these

changes  have taken place. They have also  pointed

out  how this change of stand and thought  on  the

part  of the Party is not in the interests or  the

welfare  of  the people. I do not wish to  repeat,

neither  do  I wish to supplement their statements

attacking the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell the P.A.P. Government that

we,  the  thirteen  of us in the Barisan  Sosialis

sitting  on  this  side of the House,  are  always

prepared to support the Government in all sorts of

economic  construction and welfare services  which

are in the interests of the people. We want to ask

the  Government to learn from its mistakes and try

to  turn away from the wrong direction so that  it

will go back to the broad masses of the people. We

also ask the Government to carry out what was said

in   the  first  policy  statement,  that  is,  to

strengthen  the  unions and organisations  and  to

give assistance to local industry and businessmen.

We  want  the  Government to  carry  out  what  it

declared   it  would  do  in  the  second   policy

statement, that is, to give assistance to  farmers

and  carry out a thorough campaign against  yellow

culture. We also contend that the present Ministry

of Education should be thoroughly reformed so that

the colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2763</b></font><br><br>

education  policy  will be discarded.  We  are  not

happy  with  changes  on the surface  only.  It  is

hypocritical.  We feel we must try all  we  can  to

help  the  development  of national  education.  We

hope  the  P.A.P. leadership will wake up  so  that

they  will  discard  all its  plots  and  intrigues

against the Left-wing progressive forces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Paint of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let the Member carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The strength of

the  people  is  invincible. It is the  people  who

direct  the  course of history. It  is  not  to  be

directed  by  a minority of people who  think  they

are  clever politicians. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have

nothing  praiseworthy to say of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's policy speech delivered this year.

<br><br>9.57 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on reading

the  Government's  policy  statement  presented  to

this  Assembly  and  read by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  on the 31st of October this year, one  most

lamentable fact comes to light. In the text of  the

whole speech, there is not one single reference  to

socialism,  nor  is  the word  "socialist"  written

anywhere. For a Party that was swept into power  on

a  socialist platform during the elections,  for  a

Party  which had written into its Party  objectives

socialist   ideals,  such  an  omission   must   be

considered  as  something  very  grave  indeed.  To

understand  why  socialism  is  excluded  from  the

Government  in its third year of office,  one  must

trace  the  events that led to the  third  year  of

office of the Government. A good way is to go  back

very  briefly  and look into the speeches  made  by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in the first and second

year   of   the   P.A.P.'s  term  of  office.   His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, on  the  1st

July, 1959 (Hansard, Vol. 11, col. 6), said in  the

Introduction:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2764</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This session of the Legislative Assembly is

another  step  away from the past.  The  immediate

future is clear and certain. During the next  five

years  a Government elected by a decisive majority

of   the   people  will,  through   peaceful   and

constitutional means, take the social revolution a

step  further. It is a Government pledged to bring

about a more just society.'

<br><br>In the same speech at column 15:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. Government stands for an independent,

democratic,  non-Communist, socialist  Malaya.  It

cannot  be  pressured  into  deviating  from  this

stand.'

<br><br>It is curious that only a month ago, the

Prime Minister, when he was addressing the

University of Malaya Students'

Union,  deviated from this stand. For in  place  of

the  word  "socialist",  he  substituted  the  word

"nationalist". And he now  pledges that the P.A.P. Government stands  for

an    independent,   democratic, non-Communist,

nationalist  Malaya. These are words  enshrined  in

Hansard and yet the Government does not pay heed to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion thanking the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  for delivering the speech on behalf of  the

Government, the Leader of the House said - I quote from Hansard,

Volume 11, column 118:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1959 conditions have now changed. The P.A.P.

has  led the people of Singapore to obtain  a  new

Constitution  which provides for complete  control

of internal self-government in Singapore.'.

<br><br>He went on to say at column 119 and 120:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The People's Action Party has a positive

ideology. We believe that our ills, the ills of our

society,  can  only he solved on  the  basis  of  a

socialist  ideology, and it is because  we  hive  a

Political  belief, we therefore have  a  principle,

and  having a principle, we have the ability to lay

down  a  line of action by which we hope to advance

our cause and the progress of our society.'.



<br><br>Brave  words, Sir! The lamentable fact is that  the

Deputy Prime Minister is not here to hear me  quote

his words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of office of the P.A.P. resulted

in  a  speech that is of a slightly different tone.

It recognises the

mistakes of the past, for it says in Hansard,

Volume 13, Col. 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government does not wish to give the

impression  that there have not been  mistakes  and

shortcomings during the past year. It is aware that

some of its measures should have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2765</b></font><br><br>

been   more   carefully   planned   and   expertly

executed. In some instances, it moved too fast and

without  preparing public opinion  adequately  for

the  changes. Some of the legislation resulted  in

inconveniences  or misunderstandings  which  could

have  been avoided by .a little more foresight,  a

little  more consultation, discussion and a little

more explanation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third speech, Sir, is more a speech given by

a  caretaker Government, for it says at column  12

of Hansard, Volume

15, No. 1, last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the immediate future, the task of the

Government  is  to proceed with the  work  already

initiated.'



<br><br>Since in the first two years of office very

little has been initiated, by implication, it must

mean that the Government has

no intention to initiate anything in its third

year of office and it must necessarily mean that

it is only acting as a caretaker Government in its

third year of office. In the first year of office,

we saw the Members on the Government Benches - I was

then privileged to be

on, their side but now I am privileged to  be  on

this   side-speak  arrogantly  with  revolutionary

fervour. The Prime Minister in Hansard, Volume 11,

column 373, said these brave words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I say, without the slightest immodesty on the

part of my colleagues and myself, that we are  the

only  group that has the coherence, drive and  the

convictions   to   build   something   more   than

ourselves - a democratic, socialist movement  within

a  revolutionary situation . .  .  If  we  do  not

continue  recruiting as we have done in  the  past

five  years, then we shall eventually  wither  and

die.'



<br><br>Further down in the next paragraph, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And you can only recruit if you convince those

whom   you   intend  to  recruit  that  you  are

recruiting for a worthwhile cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me draw one lesson for the Members on the

other  side.  There is not one single Member - apart

from  the  U.M.N.O.  [that, of course,  means  the

S.P.A.,  Sir]  Members  who  are  representing   a

portion  of  the Malay people - who  represent  the

people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the S.P.A. did not represent the people. But

now  they  represent the people because they  have

saved  the  P.A.P. The Prime Minister went  on  to

say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They represent a group which is spent, lost and

exhausted.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2766</b></font><br><br>

They  do not seem to be very much exhausted  today,

because  when  the Government falls  they  are  the

people  who stretch their hands to lift it  up.  He

then  had  these  gracious  words  to  say  of  the

Opposition - the same Hansard, column 375:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I tell the Opposition this. They provide us, and

I hope they will continue to provide us in the next

five  years,  with that vivid contrast  which  will

throw up the virtues of the P.A.P. into magnificence.'.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the Member

for Nee Soon can explain how that is connected with

the  debate we have embarked upon for the last  two

days.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Sir, I

was  just  trying to show the differences  in  the

first,  second and third speeches of the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara because-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. What have the alleged

weakness  of  the  S.P.A. and the strength  of  the

U.M.N.O. got to do with it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Sir, if I

might be permitted to answer that. In the first and

second  years  of  its  office,  the  P.A.P. could

steamroller  the Opposition. Today it cannot,  Sir,

and it is the S.P.A. and the U.M.N.O. which help to

keep the P.A.P. in office.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What has that got to do with

Government  policy as illustrated in the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech?  We  are  now  debating

Government policy. Let us get on with it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I bow to your decision, Sir.

The  financial policy of the Government lays  great

stress on industrialisation. To achieve this  goal,

the  statement  makes great play  of  the  Economic

Development  Board, the Industrial  Research  Unit,

the  Common  Market  and the Four-Year  Plan.  Sir,

these things have been said in the past and I  have

no doubt they will be said in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If they are here in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2767</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> But what good can these

things  do  for  the Government  if  there  is  no

political  stability  in  the  country?   If   the

employer-employee relationship in the  country  is

not  stable, all these very nice plans will be  in

vain.  If the Government is sincere in wanting  to

industrialise  the country, it must  pay  heed  to

stability  in  labour and employer  relationship.

One of the important ways of encouraging stability

in this relationship is to help build up a unified

trade  union movement. In Hansard, Volume 13,  the

third paragraph in column 8 of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's   speech,  reference  is  made   to   the

stability of employer-employee relationship:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A further important factor is stability in

labour-employer relationships, for nothing is more

harmful    to   economic   expansion   than    the

unpredictable outbursts of industrial strife.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. in pursuing its trade union policy

today   is  doing  exactly  the  opposite.  It   is

splitting  the trade union movement which  is  just

beginning  to  be  unified  and  splitting  it  for

political  purposes.  Much has  been  said  of  the

Government's  manoeuvres of the  trade  unions  and

the dissolution of the Trades Union Congress-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Nee

Soon  knows that Members of his Party have  touched

an  that  aspect probably about a dozen times.  Let

us not have any repetition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you for your guidance,

Sir, I  was going to say that a lot has been  said

about  it  and that I would not like to repeat  it.

If  you had been patient and listened to what I was

going to say, it would have been well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since much of the text has been covered by

my  colleagues, I will just pick up  a  few  parts

which have not been adequately touched upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing and housing subsidy. We on this side of

the   House   would   like  to  congratulate   the

Government on stating that the question of subsidy

to  the  Housing  and Development Board  is  under

review.  For we know that in the past, the  S.I.T.

houses   were  subsidised,  but  when  the  P.A.P.

Government came into office and started  to  build

cheap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2768</b></font><br><br>

housing  units for the poor people, it  was, then

discovered  that  the  cheap  houses  were  hardly

subsidised  at all by Government, for it  was  the

Government's  own admission that an economic  rent

was  charged for those houses. I believe that when

the  Government mentions "economic rent", it means

rent worked on the most economic computation,  and

if  it  is,  economic it cannot be subsidised.  We

have  read today that the Government has seen  its

mistakes  and  is  reviewing the whole  policy  of

housing  subsidy. We look forward to the day  when

the  Government will subsidise the poorer people's

houses  as  much as the middle-class  houses  have

been subsidised in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the Ministry of Health. Going

through  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,  I

find it curious that no mention has been made  of

family planning. It cannot be that because I have

left  the Ministry that no mention has been made.

If  one  refers  to  the Four-Year  Plan  of  the

Government, the biggest problem of the  State  is

the  state  of over-population and the  fast  and

rapid  growth of the population which i,  a  very

young  one;  and  the absence in  the  Government

policy   statement  of  any  mention  of   family

planning  and  birth control is surely  something

very  serious. It is said in this book, Sir, that

unless  the population growth is checked,  unless

family planning is properly taught to the people,

no  amount of industrialisation plans could solve

the  Problem  of  the people  of  Singapore.  Yet

today,  I  see the complete absence of this  very

important subject in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech.  I  recall, Sir, during the time  of  the

last   Government,  when  the  subject  of  birth

control and family planning was brought into this

House, there was a free vote. The reason was that

the  then Minister was a Catholic. Now that I see

the  total absence of the subject in this  year's

statement, I am very tempted to draw some similar

conclusions.  However, I  shall  not  labour  the

House with such conclusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the Government's intention to enlarge

the  Tan Tock Seng Hospital because we know  that

there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2769</b></font><br><br>

a  lot  of people on the waiting list for admission

to  the  Tan Tock Song Hospital. We know  that  the

only reason preventing  the  expansion  of  the  hospital  is  the

shortage of medical staff and nurses. We have  been

assured  in  this House by the Minister for  Health

and  Law  that the situation of the doctor shortage

is  much  better today. In fact, the  Minister  has

said  that  he  has  more  applicants  for  medical

officer vacancies than he has provision for in  the

Budget to take them in. It is very glad tidings  to

one  who  has been in the Ministry before  and  who

understands  how acute the shortage has  been.  But

on,  the question of the expansion of the Tan  Took

Seng Hospital, the remedy does not lie only in  the

recruitment of doctors. The nursing staff is a very

important  branch of the hospital  service.  It  is

known  that there are wards now ready to be  opened

in  many  hospitals, including the  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital,  but  are  not  opened  because  of   the

shortage  of nurses. We would, therefore, urge  the

Government to reconsider the conditions of  service

and the salary scale of nurses and to look into the

possibility of recruiting more nurses, particularly

from  the Chinese stream, into the nursing service.

In  its  first  year of office, the Government  was

quite successful in recruiting Chinese school girls

into  the  nursing school. But today, I  understand

that  applications from Chinese school  girls  have

dropped   very  considerably,  partly  because   of

dissatisfaction  with the way  and  the  method  in

which  the  courses  are conducted  and  partly  on

account of other grouses and grudges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You were there!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> However, Sir, we urge the

Government   to   look  into  the  possibility   of

enlarging  the  Nursing  Training  School  and  the

training  of  more staff, particularly the  Chinese

school girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the end of the speech

Crime.  In  column 24 of Hansard, Vol. 15,  No.  1,

dated 31st October, 1961, it is stated:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2770</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because of continued pressure against secret

society  gangsters, the incidence arising  out  of

secret  society  activities had  been  kept  at  a

reasonably low level.'





<br><br>In view of this, Sir, and in view of the fact that

I  did not get satisfaction from the Minister  for

Finance  a  few  days ago, when we  were  on  the

Budget  in  the Committee of Supply, I would  urge

the  Government  to look into the  possibility  of

lifting  the 7.00 p.m. ban on political  meetings.

If the Minister for Home Affairs thinks that it is

a  laughing  matter  and  that  it  is  an  absurd

request,  might I perhaps refresh  his  memory  by

reading  some  of the speeches made by  the  Prime

Minister, who was then a Member in the Opposition?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What has that got to do with

secret societies?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> In urging the then Government

to  lift  this ban and to allow political meetings

to be held after

seven o'clock, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, now

the Prime Minister, said this.

I  quote,  Sir,  Hansard, First Session,  Vol.  1,

dated  26th April, 1955, col. 59. This is for  the

benefit  of  the  Minister for  Home  Affairs  who

thinks that my request has been frivolous and  not

worth

considering. The then Member for Tanjong Pagar

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But we either believe in democracy or we do

not.  If  we  do,  then we must say categorically,

without qualification, that no restraint from  any

democratic process, other than by the ordinary law

of  the  land, should be allowed. If a man chooses

to  carry  a hand grenade or a revolver,  or  some

other  lethal  weapon, in times when the  Governor

and  the High Commissioner have proclaimed a state

of  emergency,  then he takes the supreme  penalty

the  law has laid down for him. But if a political

party wants to hold an election meeting, or even a

post-election  meeting after 7 o'clock,  they  are

told  : "We do not believe in democracy after  the

election.  We  only believe in democracy  once  in

four  years, for one month." That is not the  kind

of  democracy  that you can inspire men  with,  to

fight  for  and die for. That is not the  kind  of

democracy that is going to make it tick in  South-East  Asia,  if  you tell us that we  can  hold  a

public  meeting  in the heat of the  sun  at  four

o'clock or five o'clock when nobody would come  to

listen...[He  was speaking on behalf of the P.A.P. then.

But a lot of them came to listen to ours, Sir.]..

when nobody would come and listen to us, when

therefore  there would be no real  danger  of  any

democratic movement starting, but that  we  cannot

hold a public meeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2771</b></font><br><br>

after 7 o'clock, when by the habits of the

workers  they  would have returned from  work,  the

earth  has  got cooler, the walls have got  cooler,

the  night is getting mellow and warm speeches  can

he  made. But, no! That is not allowed. And yet, we

are  asked  to  believe that this is  democracy.  I

must  say,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that this is  a  very

queer and

curious democracy, ....'.

<br><br>That is only read for the benefit of the

Minister  for Home Affairs because he considers  my

request  to  be  frivolous. I would urge  him  very

seriously to

reconsider and to take cognizance of what the

Member for Tanjong Pagar

said when he was in the Opposition. Or perhaps  the

Prime  Minister does not mean it today  because  he

is in the

Government. If that is so, we would be happy if

the Prime Minister would tell

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second last item - television, Sir. We

welcome the advent of television

into  Singapore,  if only for the modernisation  of

Singapore.  But, Sir, we cannot welcome  television

to  come  into  Singapore as yet another  political

arm of the P.A.P. We would .

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that point has been

made  by  three  or  four Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. The Member is merely repeating what his

Party has said.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, if you will just bear

with me, I will not take more than five minutes.  I

would  just like to quote some of the remarks  that

the  Prime  Minister made about television  not  so

long  ago when you yourself, Sir, presided in  this

Chamber.  We would welcome television in  Singapore

as  a  medium  of  information for  the  people  of

Singapore. We certainly cannot welcome  it  as  yet

another  political  arm  of  the  People's   Action

Party.  We  do not mind T.V. P.A.P.,  Sir,  if  the

People's Action Party paid for television-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is that what the Prime

Minister said? I thought the

Member for Nee Soon was quoting from the speech  by

the  Prime Minister or the then Member for  Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not come

to  that.  If I had, I would have given  you  the

reference.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the hon.

Member  that he is repeating what his  colleagues

have said. But if he wishes to add something  new

to  what  his  colleagues  have  said,  then,  of

course, he is perfectly in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Sir,

unless  I  quote the whole thing, I must  give  a

slight-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Slant!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Twist!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Not twist - background before

I  can  quote.  Otherwise I would be  obliged  to

quote  the whole section. When the Prime Minister

was in the Opposition, he said this. I

am quoting, Sir, Hansard, Vol. 2, 5th

September, 1956, col. 62, in the third paragraph;

about six lines below:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Can there be any doubt at all that Radio Malaya

[which  is  Radio  Singapore  today]  should   be

divorced from the Government and run as a  public

corporation? Is there any real doubt that  if  we

wanted  to  introduce  television,  and  if   the

committee  sitting on it should want to recommend

it, it should be done by a public corporation?  I

am  not an uncritical admirer of the British. For

their   own   country,  they   institute   public

corporations to run their radio, but  they  allow

it   to   become  an  adjunct  of  a   government

department in their colonies.'



<br><br>"But  they  allow it to become an  adjunct  of  a

government  department in their  colonies."  Sir,

from   the   Prime  Minister's  own  words,   for

Government  to run television and radio  together

in  Singapore  would  be the  perpetuation  of  a

colonial practice.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Decolonialise yourself.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> That would be a fair

interpretation, Sir, In the next page,  col.  63,

about  half-way through, just the last  sentence,

the then Member for Tanjong Pagar said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We raised this matter of a public corporation

for  Radio  Malaya at the very  opening  of  this

Assembly last year. After 17 months of office  to

be  told that the Government is still thinking of

it,   one  wonders  what  could  have  been   the

achievement in the last 17 months.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2773</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Prime Minister has been in office for

almost  30  months, or more than  that.  Still  he

never  thought about what he said just a few years

ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Colonial days.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Colonial days?

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The times have changed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> There is no difference, Sir.

If  television run by the Government in a colonial

society is to serve a colonial Government  and  to

serve  the  motherland of the colonial Government,

surely in a self-governing country, it should only

be fair that a public corporation should run it so

that the views of the different Parties should  be

presented.  Surely what applies then should  apply

now. In any case, Sir, as I have indicated, I will

take  only  five minutes. I do not want to  exceed

that time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has been speaking

from ten o'clock!

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  a  debate of this kind where it has been  found

necessary  to see that unnecessary repetitions  are

not  made,  I find it difficult to be at the tail

end  of  all  the speakers, particularly  after  13

Barisan  speakers  who kept on repeating  what  the

first  one  had  said. So if I,  in  my  innocence,

repeat  something which the Barisan  Sosialis  have

said,  I  would ask your indulgence. All I can  say

is  that  it  has not been said by my Party  and  I

would like to say it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech, there are one or two matters which I  would

like   to   raise  and  which  I  would  like   the

Government to think about. First and foremost,  the

Tamil school teachers for high school. Sir, it  has

been represented to  me  that  there is no possibility of recruiting

any  Tamil school teachers to teach in a Tamil high

school.  There  is  nobody in  Singapore  qualified

enough to take on the job. Therefore, I would  ask,

the  Minister for Education to consider whether  it

would  be  in  keeping  with  the  policy  of   the

Government   that  qualified  Tamil  high   school

teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2774</b></font><br><br>

should  be allowed to be recruited from  India  in

the   same  way  as  the  Government  has  already

recruited  a  large number of teachers  of  Bahasa

Kebangsaan from Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other one is water. It seems that in

spite  of all the rains that we have been  having,

the  public  still have to be under  a  system  of

water rationing. It would seem that even the  gods

are not pleased with the P.A.P. Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> We do not believe in God. We

are atheists.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister does

not believe in

God,  so he says. But when the water shortage  hit

Singapore the Prime Minister said, "Only the  gods

could  save  us." And the only way the gods  could

save  us,  according to Chinese culture, would  be

for  the  Government just to strangle  itself  and

that would ease the ire of the gods and more water

would flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one very important matter that has not

been  touched upon by the Government nor  by  many

speakers on this side of the House. What  I  refer

to  was the world-shaking event that was disclosed

by the Prime Minister in his speech last year when

he  moved  the motion of thanks for the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. He said, if  I  remember

rightly,  that the Communist forces  in  Singapore

were  building  up.  If  I  may,  Sir,  with  your

indulgence, quote from Hansard, Vol.  13,  No.  2,

col. 54 [3rd August, 1960]. This is what the Prime

Minister said last year:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Meanwhile, Communist sympathisers and activists,

who  had scattered and gone under cover before the

last  elections, began the work of regrouping  and

reorganisation. Over the last 14 months, a  build-up  of their ground strength through ground cadres

working  on the workers has been taking  place  in

the   trade   union  movement.  These  pro-C.   P.

activists  have worked hard to secure the  support

of the

rank and file.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when he made that pronouncement last year,

we in the Opposition at that time did not have the

Barisan  Sosialis with us; they were on the  other

side.  We had, of course, the three U.P.P. Members

with  us.  We in the Opposition, particularly  the

S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance, told the Government that

if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2775</b></font><br><br>

they  were really sincere in meeting this  threat,

then  the only way for them to do it was to cleanse

the  Party  from within, and I gave them  instances

where  the  Party could be cleansed.  I  would  not

like to quote from Hansard, Sir, but I think I  can

remember  what  I  said.  I  said  those  political

bodies  who were not loyal to the Party  should  be

dismissed.  The People's Association and  the  Work

Brigade   are   Frankensteins   created   by    the

Government,  and the Government should  take  steps

to  see that these Frankensteins do not come out to

devour  them. I said a number of other things  too.

But  then  the Prime Minister -  it was typical  of

him - came along and said, "This discredited  Member  for Cairnhill, who lost the general elections,

has the nerve to stand up here and teach me how  to

suck  eggs." Look at what happened. Those 12  awful

disclosures  over Radio P.A.P. We told  them,  "You

sack  these people in your midst." "Oh, no. We  are

a  clean Party. They were comrades of ours. We were

non-Communists. We had no Communists. No, we  never

had  them." But then let us examine those 12  awful

disclosures  over Radio Singapore. The  very  first

thing  they  said was, "Yes, we had the  Communists

working  with us in 1954." Yet they deny here  that

they  ever  had Communists working with  them.  The

previous  Government took action  against  what  we

then  did not call Communists - because we did  not

feel  that we should call them Communists;  but  we

called them subversionists; people who were out  to

destroy the security of Singapore. We had by  force

of  circumstances  to arrest  them.  What  did  the

present  Prime Minister, who was and is the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar, do? He sat here and  tabled  a

motion  deploring the undemocratic  action  of  the

Government.  He said those were his comrades;  they

were   good  fighters;  they  are  not  Communists.

Today, he has admitted that

they are Communists. I never called

them that. The Prime Minister called

them Communists. Talking of inside

pressures, they have not yet learnt-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2776</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> They are behind you now.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in 1959, when they came

to power, there were 43 of them and we faced them.

We  were  happy to face them because we could  see

them  and therefore we knew what they were up  to.

Unfortunately for us now, we have 13 behind us and

we do not know what is going on behind. Because at

times while sitting in front, I can hear a lot  of

noise  coming  out attacking the  P.A.P. although

they graduated from the University of the

P.A.P., attacking the P.A.P.-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They have never attacked S.P.A.!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I knew they have attacked

S.P.A. just a few times. Apart from that, what  I

want  to  point out is this, if I may. That  today

we  have in this debate 13 Barisan Members who ran

down  this  Government  more  bitterly  than   the

previous  one. More bitterly because some  of  the

things were due to some personal hurts which  they

had  suffered and the awful disclosures that  they

had to make. Yet out

of  the  13  who  spoke against the Government - I

look  through the records and I see that 8 of them

were  then speaking against poor me and my friends

here -   the Government was good, the  Government

was   first-class;  the  Opposition  was   talking

rubbish  and  all that. Now they have joined  this

side,  maybe more of them may come over, I do  not

know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us come to these "awful disclosures". I

am  afraid  I  have to speak out very strongly  on

this because it would appear that in spite of  the

fact  that they come out today - I mean, the  Prime

Minister comes out today and openly calls his  ex-comrades  Communists,  Communist  front  men,  Communist  sympathisers.  At  one  time  it  was  the

lunatic  Left  and  Communist;  now  it  is   real

Communist. Yet he says, "Oh, no, I am not going to

do  anything. I am not like that foolish  Lim  Yew

Hock. He did all those things. We are not going to

fall  into the trap that we laid for Lim Yew  Hock

and  into which he fell." Sir, I think it is wrong

of him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2777</b></font><br><br>

to  say such things. If he does not intend to  look

after  the security of the country, then he  should

not  go out of his way to smear them as Communists,

fellow   Communists,  and  Communist   front   men,

because   by   openly  calling   them   Communists,

Communist  front  men, and Communist  sympathisers,

and  saying, "You can have your fun, boys," you are

just  giving encouragement to people who will  say,

"Well,  it is all right. I do not mind joining  the

Communist ranks now because the Government  is  not

going  to  do  anything about  it."  You  are  just

encouraging  people to come out and join  them.  If

they  are  really  Communists, there  is  only  one

answer.  The security of the country is  vested  in

the  Government.  It is the most sacred  duty  that

the  Government has to look after. It  is  not  for

them  to  say,  "No. We had slept with  them  since

1954,  but only last July they came out."  At  that

time,  I  said you cannot sleep with the Communists

without getting contaminated. Now they say, "No,  I

did  not  get sufficient enjoyment and it  is  time

for  me  to go and tell the world." It is all  bad.

They  have  a Ministry of Culture and that  is  the

kind of culture the P.A.P. has-

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No honeymoon.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is another one about the

"Plen".  The  Prime Minister said, "I  had  a  talk

with  the  Plen in 1950." My God, if  I  had  known

there  was  a  Plen, I would have taken  the  great

Prime  Minister and put him in Changi.  I  did  not

know  that.  But then it does not matter.  What  he

said  about this Plen was funny. Here is the  great

Prime Minister. He knew the Plen in 1958. But  when

he  became the Government, he said, "I went to  the

Special  Branch and saw the picture of  the  Plen."

May I quote that little bit here-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member

for  Cairnhill not to go into so many  details?  He

can  make his point anent the Government policy  in

these  matters but he should not go  into  so  many

details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2778</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am talking

about the Government's policy of sleeping with the

Communists when it suited them and then denouncing

them when it no longer suits them-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is exactly what I have

indicated  to the Member for Cairnhill, that  that

is  the  policy; he has made his point. But  going

into   these  little  details  will  not   improve

matters; it will only waste time.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am talking

of  the  Prime Minister whose primary duty  is  to

look  after  the  security  of  the  country.  Yet

although he went to the Special Branch and saw the

picture,  he  now  says, "Oh,  I  never  told  the

Special  Branch. The Special Branch  can  find  it

out."  This  is what the Prime Minister  with  the

Special  Branch at his service should do - see  that

the  Special Branch is properly informed  and  not

come  and say, "I know who the Plen is. I saw  the

picture. But I never told anyone." As if it was a

clever  thing  to  say! As the Prime  Minister  he

never  told  his own Special Branch who  the  Plen

was. Nobody is, going to believe it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We are not strangers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member:</b> But I do believe.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what hurts the S.P.A. is

this.  The Government have admitted now that  when

they  were  nearly swallowed by the Communists  in

August  1958 - when  they had six Communists  versus

six  non-Communists - they did not know what to do.

But  then poor me at that time felt that those who

were  out  to  damage the security of the  country

should  not be allowed to continue to do,  damage.

So the previous Government took in five. I want to

say  here,  Sir, since all these awful disclosures

that  have come out of it, Sir, it was because  it

was, felt that perhaps if the P.A.P. could be  rid

of  the Communist stranglehold on them they could

come out clean. I knew

they could win and come out clean and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2779</b></font><br><br>

run  the country clean. Instead, immediately  after

their  victory, they said, "Oh, comrades come out!"

They  released  all  the  eight  before  they  took

office.  It  does not matter if they  released  the

eight.  They gave them jobs at $1,100 a  month.  We

kept  telling them it was wrong, "Do  not  do  it,"

and  they  told  us to suck eggs. Now  they  openly

admit  that  they  have  been  sleeping  with   the

Communists. They now say that what they  have  done

other  people should not do. Sir, there are  people

who  feel that it is this group of people who  have

brought  the  P.A.P. to power and  they  happen  to

fall out together at the same time. The P.A.P. are

now  trying to say that only they had the right  to

be  friendly with the Communists. Anyone  else  who

wants  to  be  friendly with the  Communists,  like

their   ex-comrades,  is  ridiculed,   jeered   and

laughed  at.  So  the  P.A.P. could  do  no  wrong,

according  to  them.  Fortunately,  Sir,   in   the

Negara's speech the most important part of  it  has

been  settled. So we say that as far as  the  other

part goes, the Government has failed the people  of

Singapore,  and we will show by our  vote  that  we

consider  the Government has failed. Many  previous

speakers   have  spoken  on  the  first   year   of

reorganisation,  the second year  of  construction,

and  the  third year of liquidation. But I  say  to

the  P.A.P. that the day of their funeral  will  be

the  day  of the general election and they will  be

buried   so   deeply   that   there   can   be   no

rejuvenation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Sir, before, I sit down, to answer the

unjust attack levelled at us by the Members of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. One Member who spoke  before  me

said  that the S.P.A. was giving a helping hand  to

the  P.A.P.  Previously,  there  was  also  another

Member  of the Barisan Sosialis who said  that  the

S.P.A. and the P.A.P. are going together. Let  me,

as  leader  of  the  S.P.A., say solemnly  in  this

House  that we will at no time have anything to  do

with the P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And, in fairness, we must say

that  there have been no overtures from the  P.A.P.

to us nor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>

from  us  to the P.A.P. of any coalition. We  know

them and because we know that they have not played

the right thing by the people of Singapore, it  is

our  duty to see that they are knocked out of  the

Singapore  political field. In spite  of  all  the

exposures by the Barisan Sosialis Members, I would

like to say that it was we on the Front Bench  who

were able to expose certain acts of the Government

that  should have been challenged. As a result  of

pressure  from us and with the help of Members  of

the  Opposition - we were united in this - we got  the

Government more or less to bow down to the  wishes

of  the Opposition insofar as the 1963 Budget  was

concerned.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

listening to Members of the Opposition, I  find  I

am  now  faced with the task of sifting the  chaff

from the grain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said once before that I am quite prepared

to  listen to any constructive suggestions made by

the  opposite side; but when it comes to  spending

hours  in  this Chamber listening to  rubbish,  it

takes  quite a lot of patience to understand  what

the Opposition is driving at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like, before going

into generalities, to answer a few specific points

raised  by Members of the Opposition and  which  I

think   ought  to  be  answered,  because  it   is

necessary to dispel any false allegations made  by

the other side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Farrer Park and Cairnhill have

again  and  again harped on water  rationing.  The

Member  for Farrer Park, in particular, asked  the

Government  to consider using Johore  River  as  a

source of water supply instead of proceeding  with

the  waterworks at the Scudai River.  Now  it  is

important  that I must place before the House  the

true   picture  of  the  history  of  negotiations

between  the Singapore Government and  the  Johore

Government. In 1927, an agreement was entered into

between  the  Sultan of Johore and  the  Municipal

Commissioners of Singapore for the use  of  Gunong

Pulai and Pontian as sources of water supply. This

agreement   expired  in  1948.  In   1952,   fresh

approaches were made between the then City Council

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>

the  Johore Government to renew the use of  Gunong

Pulai  and  Pontian  and, at  the  same  time,  to

include the Tebrau and Scudai Rivers as sources of

water  supply. No agreement, however, was  reached

between  the Johore Government and the  past  City

Councils.  In 1958 a proposal by the City  Council

to  the  Johore Government to include  the  Johore

River  in  the  agreement was turned  down.  After

this,  nothing  more was heard  about  the  Johore

River.  When  the P.A.P. formed the Government  in

1959,  we  inherited a situation  where  no  fresh

agreement  had  been signed between Singapore  and

the  Johore Government for the extraction of water

from  Johore sources. It was only in October  this

year  that  an  agreement  to  use  Gunong  Pulai,

Pontian, Tebrau and Scudai Rivers was signed.  Now

that  this  agreement has been signed, the  Johore

Government has agreed to open negotiations for use

of  the Johore River. These negotiations have just

started. It is not possible to predict when a firm

agreement  can  be  arrived  at  with  the  Johore

Government for the use of the Johore River. In any

case,  any scheme to extract water from the Johore

River  will take four years, costing $50  million.

It  is not possible for Singapore to wait for four

years  without looking for other sources of  water

supply.  The  Government,  therefore,  decided  to

proceed with the project to extract water from the

Scudai River. It will take only two years, costing

$20 million. The output from the Scudai River will

be  the  same  as  that of the Tebrau  River.  The

Gunong Pulai, Pontian, Scudai and Tebrau Rivers as

sources  of  water supply should be able  to  cope

with  the demand for water until the Johore  River

Waterworks  Scheme is implemented at  some  future

date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that it is not that the

Singapore  Government is reluctant to  go  to  the

Johore River for our water supply

but  that  a concession from the Johore Government

must  first be obtained. Past City Councils failed

to obtain this concession, and it is only now that

the  Johore  Government has agreed to open  formal

discussions on the use of the Johore River.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Lady from Mountbatten alleged that

since  the  P.A.P. took over the Government, food

prices have gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>

up.  She quoted from the Malayan Statistics. I have

just  referred  to  the latest  Malayan  Statistics

dated October 1961 and nowhere in the Statistics is

there  any  indication  that  there  has  been   an

increase in food prices. In January this year, ikan

tamban   (sprat)  cost  41  cents  per   kati.   In

September, it was 39 cents per kati. Pomfret - which

the Member for Mountbatten described as the food of

the  bourgeousie - or  what  the  Malays  call  bawal

puteh,  cost $2.42 a kati in January this year  and

the  price in September was only $2.17 a  kati.  In

January,  the price of rice was $1.25 per  gantang;

in September, it was $1.29. Poultry cost $1.60 per

kati  in January and $1.57 in September. From these

figures, it is quite obvious-

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Chinese New Year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Still far away as yet.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> January.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> February. It is quite clear

that  the  prices  of food have therefore  remained

more  or less at a steady level and there has  been

no  increase  in  the  cost of living.  The  slight

increase  in  the price of rice is a reflection  of

the  large purchases made by China to cover up  the

agricultural deficit in that country.  It  is  only

natural  that  when  there are competitive  buyers,

there is an increase in price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of unemployment is not a new one. In

fact,  when  we first came to power in  1959,  this

problem was very clearly stated, to the people when

we  held  a meeting at the City Hall steps  on  2nd

June, 1959. The Member for Tanglin has alleged that

there has been less employment during the tenure of

office  of the P.A.P. Government. However, I  would

like  to  inform the House that his  allegation  is

false.  From figures in the Malayan Statistics,  in

September  1959,  the  total  number  of   workers,

excluding  clerks,  peons, watchmen,  domestic  ser

vants   and   shop  assistants,  was  106,771.   In

September  1960,  the number was 105,605.  This  is

only  1,000  less  and  is part  of  what  we  call

"fiction"  unemployment, that is  the  workers  who

change

their jobs to look for other jobs. With



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2783</b></font><br><br>

the   boom   in   the  building  and  construction

industry,  there is an increase in the  number  of

workers  engaged  in  this  industry,  as  I  have

already explained. The statistics for 1961 are not

yet  available, but I am convinced they will  show

an  increase in the number of persons employed. In 1962-



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I think I will wind up now,

Sir, In 1962, when there is an acceleration in the

development  programme of the  Government,  it  is

likely  that  the figures of people employed  will

also be increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park did raise an important

point  and that was a suggestion made by  him  that

the Industrial Arbitration Court should present  an

Annual  Report  which will show to the  public  the

usefulness and importance of this Court.  In  fact,

I  understand  the  President of  this  Court  will

publish  the Annual Report which will be  available

by January 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the Member for Farrer

Park  was  on the terms of service of the President

of  the  Industrial Arbitration Court. It  is  true

that  he  was  appointed on a three-year  contract,

but  his  contract of service however does  not  in

any  way  affect his status or interfere  with  the

execution  of  his  duties  as  laid  down  in  the

Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References have been made by Members of the

opposition to the Government majority of one.  They

have  been made by Members of the Barisan Sosialis,

the  U.P.P. and  S.P.A.  But  let  me  remind  the

Members  that the new Government in Australia  also

has  a  majority of one in the House of  Parliament

and  the  Australian Prime Minister,  Mr  Menzies,

who  I think is more experienced than any of us  in

this House, has said that he is delighted with  his

majority - [Interruption] No. I  would  say  this  to Mr Menzies: we are doing fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much use of the smear has been made by the

Barisan Sosialis on the use of the military in  the

recent City Council strike



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2784</b></font><br><br>

and  the trouble in the Work Brigade. Let me  say

this  :  the first duty of any government  is  to

maintain peace and order. The task of the  police

force  is  to  uphold  the  law.  It  acts  as  a

deterrent  to  evil-doers. The military  is  only

called  in when backing-up force is necessary.  I

hope Members of the Opposition are not suggesting

that the 800-odd troops in the Singapore Infantry

Regiment are to be deployed only when there is  a

possibility  of  a  foreign  army  invading   our

shores. That would be ridiculous indeed.  One  of

the functions of this small military force is the

maintenance of internal security. Now, as long as

workers  strike  peacefully and do  not  seek  to

create public disorder or damage public property,

or  intimidate and injure members of the  public,

we  leave  them  alone. But  when  any  group  of

persons  seek to disrupt the peace by a  show  of

violence,  then violence must be counteracted  by

an  equally firm determination on the part of the

Government  to  uphold orderliness  in  order  to

protect the public. No responsible government can

allow  persons to go on a rampage of  destruction

throughout the City. We are not the first to  use

the  military  to assist the police  to  maintain

tranquillity. Previous governments have done it the  Government  of  the Member  for  Anson,  the

Government of the Member for Cairnhill. In  fact,

I  can  quote  other instances. When rioting  and

disorder  broke out in Little Rock in the  United

States  over the question of admission of negroes

to  schools attended by whites, it could only  be

contained by the use of the army. If the  Barisan

want other examples, we need only remind them  of

Hungary  and  Tibet.  The employment  of  violent

tactics  by any group is anti-social and  against

the  welfare  of the community. It is  the  first

duty of any government, be it Left-wing or Right-wing, to uphold peace and orderliness in the  use

of forces at its command. It gives us no pleasure

to  deploy the Singapore Infantry Regiment in the

recent  City  Council strike as we are  naturally

exposed to the smear of using armed force against

violence.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You have earned it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2785</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But we are not like the

Member for Anson. As the Minister for Finance has

said,  he was driven from pillar to post  because

he  wanted  to make everybody happy. Let  me  say

this:  we  will  not  shirk  our  duty  as   a

government. The House is fully aware that  if  we

had not taken prompt

action,  the violence which appeared in the  early

days  of  the  strike  would have  grown  to  such

proportions as to provoke rioting in the city.  As

it  turned  out,  the use of armed  forces  had  a

salutary effect on a small group of people who had

made  up their minds to use violence to intimidate

not  only the Government but also members  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. fought the general elections in

1959,  we were the only Party to draw up  a  Five- Year  political programme found in The Tasks Ahead

to   which   the   13  Members  of   the   Barisan

contributed  little  to its thinking.  But  it  is

gratifying  that the Barisan Sosialis nevertheless

throughout  this  debate still make  reference  to

our   booklet  The  Tasks  Ahead.  In   order   to

implement  this  political programme,  we  had  to

have  an economic programme. Therefore, some  time

was  spent when we formed the Government  in  1959

to  draft  out the Four-Year Development Plan.  As

far  as our political policy is concerned, it  has

already  been  enunciated  in  The  Tasks   Ahead.

Therefore,  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech

only  seeks  to  explain the steps the  Government

intends to take next year to implement the  Government's  political policy through  its  Development

Plan.   In   the  implementation  of  a  political

policy,  we  have  encountered  difficulties   and

sometimes even resistance. It may be that part  of

our political programme is acceptable and part  of

it  is  controversial.  We  do  not  claim  to  be

infallible.  If  we  have made mistakes,  then  we

must obviously be told where the

mistakes are so that we can rectify them. The six-day  week  for English schools, for instance,  has

not brought happiness

to teachers in these schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sure of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2786</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But if it is the view of

educationists and parents that this policy  should

be  reviewed, we are going to have it re-examined.

In  fact,  the Minister for Education has  earlier

today  announced that he will set up a  Commission

of  Inquiry  into the six-day week.  Such  is  the

parliamentary democratic system which we  hope  to

operate.  The Government's policy is debated,  the

Government's Budget is debated-how much the  Prime

Minister spends,

how much the Deputy Prime Minister gets in

allowances is debated. All this is

done  without  fear of reprisal.  Members  of  the

Opposition,  including the Member for  Anson,  can

either be constructive or destructive. But I  will

say  to them; if their idea is to spend their time

in  this Chamber only to jeer, then I say  I  will

respect  them  more  if  they  also,  particularly

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis, have the courage

to  jeer  in Moscow or Peking where the government

is monolithic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express our thanks to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered

on behalf of the Government at the opening of the

present session of this Assembly."

and endurance in keeping up with this House during

these six weeks' of sitting?

We wish you and your staff a Merry Christmas and a

Happy New Year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And I for my

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, when

the  Leader of the House said what he said, he  was

expressing the sentiments on behalf of all  Members

non-party basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May the blessed spirit of Christmas

you  and  your staff a very Happy New  Year  and  a

Merry Christmas to everybody.

rule all these speeches out of

order!  But  may I, especially on  behalf  of  the

Assembly staff, thank you, leaders of all Parties,

for  your very kind words and appreciation of what

they  have done for the Assembly. I myself,  I  am

sure, have proved to be a bit impatient at times,

but I think, with the goodwill of the season - the

Christmas  season  and the New  Year  season -  all

Members  have been able to take it. May I,  on  behalf  of the staff and myself, wish all Members  a

very  Happy  Christmas and a very  prosperous  New

Year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, I think Members will not disagree with

me, directed the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly

to close this Assembly tomorrow and give the staff

a holiday for the whole of tomorrow.
