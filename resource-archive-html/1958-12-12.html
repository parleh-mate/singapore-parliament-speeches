<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TELEVISION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government Policy on Introduction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Lee  Choon  Eng</b> asked  the  Chief  Secretary whether   the   Government   is   considering the introduction of television in Singapore next  year, and if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



will  make  a  statement  on  the  policy  of   the

Government  towards the introduction of  television

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Sir, the Committee which was

appointed to examine this matter recommended in its

report, which was tabled as Command Paper No. 20 of

1957,  that television should be run in conjunction

with  our broadcasting. The Government agreed  with

this   recommendation   and,  therefore,   deferred

consideration until the future of Radio Malaya  had

been  settled through the negotiations  which  have

been  taking  place with the Federation  Government

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the exact terms of the financial

settlement  consequent  on  the  operation  of  two

separate   Broadcasting   Departments   from    the

beginning  of  next year have not yet been  finally

settled with the Federation Government, it is clear

that  there  will  be  no  reconsideration  of  the

decision  to  break up the Pan-Malayan  department,

and  the Singapore Government is therefore free  to

make  its  own  plans  for the future.  As  already

announced,  plans  are being  put  in  hand  for  a

commercial service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television, however, as indicated in the report

of  the Committee, would entail a very considerable

initial outlay of Government funds, whether  it  is

operated by the Department of Broadcasting  or,  as

recommended in the report, by a public corporation.

In the present financial stringency, the Government



does not consider that the provision of these funds

would be justified nor would it be proper to commit

the incoming Government to such expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Government  prepared to give  it  to  a  commercial

enterprise if it is too much of a financial  burden

to the present Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, in the report to which I

referred,  the  Committee advised  against  putting

this  medium  of publicity and information  in  the

hands of private interests. This raises a matter of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



major  policy  on  which this Government  does  not

think  it  would  be right to commit  the  incoming

Government.

<div align="center"><b>PERMITTED ITEMS FOR IMPORT FROM DOLLAR AREAS</b></div>

<br><br>10.04 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it has been agreed with

the Federation Government to liberalise as from 1st

January  next year the list of items permitted  for

import from the dollar areas. Hon. Members will  no

doubt  have read in the newspapers the announcement

of   the   Minister  for  Commerce  and   Industry,

Federation of Malaya, in the Federation Legislative

Council  on  10th  December.  There  are  23  items

affected  and  since they are identical  with  that

announced  by the Federation Minister, I shall  not

read them out but table the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List of items handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This will be circulated with the

Official Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the list of items-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Trucks (lorries and parts)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[3rd December, 1958], "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>10.07 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Mason -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Mason (Nominated):</b> I rise with a plea

for   sanity.   On  3rd  December,  the   Financial

Secretary  informed this House at the  commencement

of his speech that 1958 has not been a particularly

easy  year.  Most businessmen will  have  described

1958  in  considerably stronger and more derogatory

terms.  The Financial Secretary went on  to  inform

the House that the recession in trade in the U.S.A.

was  being felt in Singapore in the spring of  1958



and  to  use his own words, "By May,, money  became

tighter.  Trade  drifted into the doldrums" - a  true

enough  picture.  And today there  is  little  real

promise of any improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore business is still on the sick list, and

it   is   only  after  a  fairly  long  period   of

convalescence  can it be expected to improve.  What

medicine  has  the  Hon, the  Financial  Secretary

prescribed  for  the  patient that  he  so  clearly

diagnosed  as sick? Nothing less than a steep  rise

in company tax of 10 per cent - a medicine which will

undoubtedly send the patient back to his sick  bed,

if not into the morgue! However, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



we must assume that Government have had to agree to

this  rather  extraordinary  measure  in  order  to

assist  our  friends  north of the  Causeway,  who,

unlike  Singapore,  are faced  with  a  very  large

deficit - surely  a  noble  gesture  on   our   part.

Particularly when one realises that had the Company



tax  in  Singapore remained at 30 per cent and  the

Federation  Company tax been increased  to  40  per

cent,  we would have seen an immediate reversal  of

that  flow  of  industries which have been  leaving

Singapore for the Federation. How sad the  Minister

for  Commerce and Industry must be to see  such  an

opportunity wasted. Nevertheless, Sir, the proposed

action  is  in  accordance with the policy  of  all

Parties in this House, namely, that of co-operation

with the Federation, and no doubt it will meet with

this House's approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of the proceedings, most hon.

Members  no  doubt expected that, apart  from  some

minor  juggling with tariff duties,  the  Financial

Secretary  would resume his seat. Not at  all.  The

Financial  Secretary went on to  inform  the  House

that although the Federation Government cannot  see

its way to take similar action, this House is to be

asked  to approve a rise in the rate of income  tax

on   personal   incomes - a  proposal  surely   quite

contrary to the agreed policy of co-operation  with

the  Federation  Government. With your  permission,

Sir,  I  will  quote the Financial Secretary's  own

words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore has no satisfactory future unless she

is associated in the closest possible way fiscally,

financially and economically with the Federation."



<br><br>How  then  does  he reconcile his  suggestion  that

Singapore should take independent action? No  doubt

in  his  reply the Financial Secretary will  assure

hon.   Members  that  he  is  confident  that   the

Federation  will follow our action in  due  course.

How   often,   Sir,   have   such   prophets   been



discredited?  If  the  Federation  Government  find

that, by having a lower personal income tax - however

small   the  difference  may  be - they  can  attract

business and businessmen, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



why  should they throw away such an advantage?  Why

then,  when  Singapore  is  struggling,  does   the

Financial Secretary seek to handicap us out of  the

race?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deeply sympathise with the Minister for

Commerce   and  Industry  who,  with  his   Pioneer

Industries Bill, Control of Manufacture  Bill,  and

other Bills, is doing all he can to assist industry

in  this  Colony,  and  now, if  this  motion  goes

through,   will   see  yet  further   reasons   for

businessmen  to  prefer  the  Federation  to   this

Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of this debate, hon. Members may be

informed  that the difference is so small  that  it

will  not make any difference, that it will not  be

sufficient inducement for industry to move  to  the

Federation.  That,  Sir,  is  not  the  point.  The

principle  of  a Pan-Malayan fiscal  policy  is  at

stake.  There is an old proverb, "Great  oaks  from

little  acorns  grow", and if this  House  approves

this  dangerous motion, we may well in  the  future

find that a precedent has been established and that

personal  income tax in Singapore is always  higher

than  that  in the Federation; that is  until  such

time  as  all business has moved from Singapore  to

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I referred to an understatement

by the Hon, the Financial Secretary regarding 1958,

but surely, Sir, he must claim the privilege of the

greatest  understatement of 1958  when  he  blandly

informed this House that different rates of tax  on

individual   incomes  being   used   in   the   two

territories   will  not  cause  any  administrative

inconvenience or difficulty. I can only think  that

he   meant  that  it  would  not  cause   him   any

inconvenience personally. I do not for  one  moment

imagine  that  those officers who are charged  with

the  collection  of  income tax  will  endorse  his

opinion.  There are many people whose  incomes  are

unaffected,  whether they live and  reside  in  the

Federation  or  in  Singapore.  Surely  then  those

people  will elect to reside in the Federation.  It

could  even  be that this, if I may say,  ludicrous

suggestion  might result in loss of  collection  of

income  tax  in Singapore, instead of  earning  the

paltry $5 million which seem to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



worrying   the   Financial   Secretary   so   much.

Furthermore, differences in rates of income tax  in



countries   so  adjacent  as  the  Federation   and

Singapore must lead to further evasions of  payment

of  income  tax.  No  administrative  difficulties?

Nonsense!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, of course, what line the P.A.P.

will take on this matter. If their leader shows his



usual honesty in these matters, he will undoubtedly

attack  this  motion. At the last sitting  of  this

House,  the  hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  stated

that   the  Federation  sets  the  pace.  He  will,

therefore, surely maul the suggestion that on  this

occasion we should set the pace. If he does not,  I

can  only  assume  that he is so confident  and  so

certain  that  this  motion is dangerous,  so  ill-advised  and so down-right silly that  it  will  be

worth thousands of votes to his Party next May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is difficult, almost impossible, for

Government  supporters to vote  against  the  Party

line.   But   I  would  like  to  remind   Members,

particularly  those who have recently  crossed  the

Floor,   of  the  Financial  Secretary's   personal

opinion. In his speech, these are his very words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my humble opinion, while an integrated Pan-Malayan economy would be to the incalculable

advantage  of  both territories, Singapore  has  no

satisfactory future unless she is associated in the

closest  possible  way  fiscally,  financially  and

economically  with  the  Federation.  All  possible

efforts must be directed over the next two or three

years to achieving this association."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is practically an invitation to vote

against his own proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am Malayan-born. I have worked all my

working  life  in this country. This  is  the  last

speech I shall make in this Assembly. I have no axe

to  grind All I say to the Financial Secretary  is:

let him practise what he preaches.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Financial Secretary has  in  his  Budget

speech not only referred to the 1959 Estimates, but

has also reviewed the Estimates for 1957 and 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the events for which this Government was

responsible was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



Malayanisation Scheme. Sir, the people of Singapore

were  in favour of this Scheme because they thought

that,  by this Malayanisation Scheme, quite a  good

amount  of  the  money that has been  paid  to  the

expatriate  officers could be saved; and  secondly,

the  local officers who are promoted to fill  those

vacancies  would be able to work for a lesser  pay,

and,  as a result, Government would be able to save

quite  a  large sum of money. But now, this present

Government  has let down the people  of  Singapore.

They  have  not  only given an enormous  amount  of



money   as   Malayanisation   allowances   to   the

expatriate officers, but they have also allowed the

local  senior officers who are filling these  posts

to  draw  the same amount of pay and allowances  as

was drawn by expatriate officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Budget, the personal emoluments

alone come to about $115 million, i.e. 40 per  cent

of  the entire Budget. I shall quote an example  of

how    the    Singapore   Government,    by    this

Malayanisation  Scheme, has wasted  a  big  sum  of

money.  Sir, I am taking my example from the Public

Works  Department. An engineer who  is  in  a  very

junior grade, say, for example, draws $800 a month.

The  senior officer, who was supposed to draw, say,



$3,000   a  month,  by  taking  advantage  of   the

Malayanisation Scheme, retires. The next  man  gets

in;  he retires. And then another man gets in.  But

all  these  men  who are getting  to  the  top  are

receiving  the same amount of pay. If there  is  an

engineer in a junior post who wants to retire,  let

him  retire  when he is in the junior capacity.  By

taking advantage of this senior capacity allowance,

the  senior officer retires, and when he  does  so,

the  junior  man takes his place and  receives  the

same  allowance  and  the same  pay.  If  a  junior

officer retires when he is drawing $800 or $1,000 a

month,  he  is  supposed to get $30,000  under  the

Malayanisation Scheme; but when he moves  up  to  a

senior position,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



he is not only drawing $3,000 and allowances but is

also  getting  the  benefit of  the  Malayanisation

Scheme  by  which  he will be able  to  draw  about

$100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I examine very closely the implications

of  this Malayanisation Scheme, I personally cannot

but  feel  that it was merely a conspiracy  between

certain   local  senior  officers  and   expatriate

officers conveniently to collect big sums of  money

at the cost of the Singapore taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is a good case to review the salary

scale of senior Government officers. With this  end

in  view, I would ask this Government to set  up  a

Salary  Commission to review the  salaries  of  the

senior  officers  who are drawing,  say,  $500  and

above.  Pruning must start from the top and not  at

the bottom, which the Government usually does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that recently there was a scheme to reduce

the  salaries  of  the lower-paid staff - the  Normal

trained teachers, nurses and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I wish to express the hope

when  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  replaces   the

Governor, it will not cost the same amount of money

which  goes  to  meet the expense to  maintain  the

establishment  of the Governor. Pomp  and  ceremony

must  give  way  to  the needs of  the  people  and

Singapore  cannot  afford to imitate  the  colonial

system and the ancient monarchies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that when the present Governor

vacates his residence, this palatial building could

be  used  as  a  museum or as  an  art  gallery  or

converted   to   some  educational   or   aesthetic

activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to congratulate this

Government  on  introducing  relief  work  for  the

unemployed. Quite a lot of people in Singapore  are

without  jobs.  But  the $1.5 million  provided  is

quite  inadequate.  I would request  Government  to

make  provision  for  at least  $2  million  or  $3

million  from the money taken from the  highly-paid

senior officers in Government service.

<br><br>10.28 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in my opinion, the Budget for 1959 was drafted

by some very clever men with a view to pulling wool

over  the eyes of the public. The Budget will  not,

in fact, improve the standard of living of the man-in-the-street. It provides nothing new in the  form

of  improving the standard of living of the people.

What  the Government is asking from them is to  pay



more  income  tax,  pay  more  for  cigarettes  and

unemployment.  As  a direct result,  Government  is

forced to increase company tax to meet the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government increases company tax to

bring  it  at  par  with the Federation,  I  wonder

whether    this    will    affect    the     future

industrialisation of this country.  We  are  facing

unemployment, and need more and more industries  to

absorb  the  unemployed. It  is  the  duty  of  the

Government  to  give  all  possible  assistance  to

industry,  so  that  people may  be  encouraged  to

invest  more in Singapore. There will then be  more

employment for our youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has increased the taxes

just  to  please the Federation. I do not know  the

reason  why  such  a  heavy  tax  was  imposed   on

companies. I want this House to know that this Bill

has a far-reaching effect on the economy and social

standing of this country. Let me ask the Government

one  question. Has the Federation at any time shown

a  willingness to co-operate with us, unless  their

interests  are involved? I am sure all  will  agree

with me that there must be mutual understanding and

co-operation in all undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Budget now, let me recall a

statement  made by the Hon, the Financial Secretary

when  he  said that the revenue for the  year  1959

will be a record one in post-war years; but he  did

not  say  a word about the expenditure which  beats

all  previous records. In other words, we will have

a  record revenue but with greater expenditure than

in  previous years. Government has no plan for  any

capital expenditure. We have to increase income tax

and duty on cigarettes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of the Budget is that money is

being provided for all Ministries, although many of

them  will  have to undergo clerical changes  after

the general elections next year. I am at a loss  to

understand  as to what will happen to  the  surplus

money  voted for these Ministries when they undergo

changes.  We may accumulate this as a gift  to  the

British  Government, which is what the  Progressive

Party did in 1950!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a standstill Budget and, as such, I

do  not  wish to go into detail. However,  I  would

like to point out that this Budget is drawn up with

a  view  to  collecting the maximum from the  rate-payers and to providing them with little amenities,

which  is contrary to democratic principles. May  I

remind  hon.  Members of the House that  they  have

been  elected  by  the people to look  after  their

interests  and not to repress them in the  name  of

democracy  or socialism? Sir, we have to carry  out

the  mandate  of the people and we have  to  answer

them  very  shortly  when we stand  on  the  public

platform again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to unemployment, I would like to

point this out to the Minister for Labour. In  page

1   of   the  Strait's'  Times  of  Thursday,  11th

December,  1958,  the speech  of  the  Minister  of

Commerce and Industry, Federation - not Singapore - was

reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He disclosed that more than 40 new factories

will begin operations in Malaya next year."



<br><br>This  shows  how much the Federation Government  is

doing  for  the welfare of the people.  Further  to

that, Sir, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Closure of even one factory will throw hundreds

of people out of work."



<br><br>He  expressed  concern over the families  of  these

hundreds of people by saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This means that thousands of human beings will

suffer   because  their  families  will   also   be

affected."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that he has at heart the interest not

only of the workers who will be unemployed but also

their families. That is very clever of the Minister

of Commerce and Industry of the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the ban on textiles, Sir,

which  was imposed by the Federation with  the  co-operation   of   our  Minister  for  Commerce   and

Industry,  the  Minister of Commerce and  Industry,

Federation, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We appreciate this point of view as we realise

that  Singapore lives by trade and without  it  she

dies."



<br><br>That means we are depending on trade. If we have no

trade, it means we are finished and the only  thing

that  we  can  get  is  a lot  of  grass  all  over

Singapore.  Sir, the Minister said on 4th  December

that at the end of the three-month period, he hoped

to impose anti-dumping legislation so that it would

then  be  possible  for Singapore  to  receive  her

unrestricted  import of textiles, and  other  goods

for that matter, if she so desires. Sir, now is the

time  for  the  Hon. the Minister for Commerce  and

Industry to consider lifting this ban so that every

one   of  us  can  enjoy  this  Christmas  and  the

approaching Chinese New Year with cheaper goods.



<br><br>10.37 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  introducing increases in tax,  the  Hon, the

Financial Secretary said this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing has been done to upset the economy of

Singapore.  The incidence of taxation has  been  in

strict  proportion  to  capacity  to  pay  and   no

hardship  has  been  caused  to  anyone ... It  [the

Government]  has  merely done what was  required  to

make income meet expenditure."



<br><br>Sir,  I  find it extremely difficult to agree  with

his  remarks. It must be recognised that as far  as

income  tax is concerned, the rate is already  very

high,  especially  when compared  with  laces  like

Hongkong  which, after all, in functional activity,

is  similar  to  that of Singapore. The  individual

maximum  rate  at  one time was  the  same  as  the

company rate. It has only been increased last  year

from  30  per cent to 40 per cent, and  now  it  is

proposed to increase it to 50 per cent. We see,  on

the  one  hand, that the Government  is  trying  to

attract  investments  in  industry  by  introducing

measures such as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



Pioneer  Industries (Relief from Income  Tax)  Bill

and  the  Industrial Expansion (Relief from  Income

Tax)  Bill - not  that we believe anything  big  will

come  out  of it - but nevertheless it is  the  right

thing  to  do  and  even  the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary is hoping for a good atmosphere to  raise

loans  because  increasing  development  cannot  be

entirely   financed  out  of  revenue  or  reserves

hereafter; but almost in the same breath, it  seems

to nullify its own aims and hopes by proposing this

crushing increase in income tax. Industry is a long-term  venture. The Hon. the Minister  for  Commerce

and  Industry had often deprecated that people here

were  only  interested in short-term turnovers  and

was  always  urging people to look ahead.  Even  if

there are bold people who could be attracted by the

Government's  measures of tax relief to  invest  in

industries,  none  could be  so  optimistic  as  to

expect any worthwhile return during the first  five

years allowed for relief; but when they look beyond

these  five years to find not only a high  rate  of

tax  but  a frame of mind on the part of  those  in

authority   that  rigidly  justifies   this   heavy

incidence with such lighthearted remarks  that  the

Government has merely done what is required to make

income  meet  expenditure,  then  even  those  bold

people  will  surely have no need  to  think  twice

before  they  discover that there is, in  fact,  no

attraction at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not without competition. Every

country  in  this  region, not excluding  Australia

which  the  Hon. the  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  has  included  in  his  list  of  capital

exporting countries - all these countries are craving

for  investments, and the attractions  in  many  of

these  places  are better than ours.  How  can  the

Government  expect any investors  to  come  forward

when  they are even now taking steps to deter them?

Individual  taxpayers, and this  category  includes

shopkeepers  both proprietary and  in  partnership,

need  as  much  as  companies  to  have  sufficient

reserves from earnings in order to expand  or  even

to  maintain their business, because they  have  to

continue  to  extend  credits  and  other   capital

formation if they are to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



handle  the  same volume of business from  year  to

year.  If they are taxed too high, they are  unable

to  do  so  and the potential from which we  derive

this  tax  is  gradually  weakened.  Even  with   a

business which can maintain its profits, one effect

of  this increase will be to deprive or to decrease

whatever  the  employee gets as bonus,  or  as  any

other form of reward at the close of the year,  and

business generally will not be able to pay the same

dividends.  Sir,  I  personally  know  of  two  big

businesses  which have been trying to overcome  the

bad    times   they   were   encountering   by    a

reorganisation. The announcement of  this  increase

has  decided  them  to fold up altogether  and,  of

course, a lot of people are out of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is a clear indication that a heavy tax

kills  enterprise. Who would be willing to risk - and

all enterprises are risks - when he realises that  on

a 50/50 chance if he loses, he loses a whole dollar

of  his  capital,  and when he makes,  he  is  only

allowed  to retain 50 cents? There are, of  course,

those who would, because they have to do something,

but then there is this added incentive for them  to

evade.  The  estimate for collection of income  tax

for  1959  shows  a decrease of $10  million  which

Government  fully knows is due to reduced  earnings

of some companies during the last 12 months, and it

shows  that  reduced earnings must now be  punished

with  a  higher rate. The most curious thing  about

this  is  why  individual tax which had  only  been

increased last year by 10 per cent should again  be

increased  by  another 10 per cent  this  year.  In

spite  of  the Government's protestations  that  we

should  agree  with the Federation in  all  things,

including  monetary, fiscal and economic  policies,

why  should  we find it necessary to disagree  with

the Federation in this respect of tax policy? Is it

merely  on  the grounds that it will not cause  any

administrative  inconvenience and difficulties?  My

hon, friend here has been more eloquent than I  in

this  respect, but I think the civil  servant,  for

one, will wish that he were in the Federation,  and

no doubt others too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deficit budgetted for - $21 million - represents

only an item of development;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



$20  million having to be  transferred  from

revenue to Development Fund. The Hon, the Financial

Secretary   has   said   that   future   increasing

development cannot be totally financed from revenue

and must be financed largely from loans. There are,

of  course,  mounting expenditures  on  the  social

services,  particularly  education,  which  it   is

estimated will increase by $10 million every  year;

and  there are the personal emoluments which is $10

million  over  1958.  Can  these  be  financed   by

increasing  the  rate of income tax  from  year  to

year? For instance, the increase of 10 per cent  in

company  tax  yields $10 million which approximates

the  increase  of  $10 million for education  every

year.  Next  year we raise another 10 per  cent  in

company  tax.  This will be eaten up  by  education

alone and so on until we tax the companies 100  per

cent.  What then? Will it catch up with  the  ever-

increasing  expenditure?  It  is  clear  that   the

pattern  of  taxation to which the  population  has

been accustomed has been exhausted. If the goose is

not  to be further weakened, ways must be found  to

curb this increasing expenditure and new avenues of

revenue  must be sought. Why always pick on  income

tax?  I  am wondering what is wrong with the Social

Welfare lottery and the tax on bookmakers which has

so often been mooted. These will surely bring in at

least  $10  million with no hardship to anyone.  If

there  are any objections, whether on moral grounds

or  on  whatever grounds, then what is being  done,

and is it possible to eliminate these activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tax the businessmen seems to be the easiest

way  out  for Government, because the businessmen's

voice is feeble. But care must be taken to see that

this  section must not be unduly weakened,  because

it  is this section which will at all times provide

for our upkeep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary has said that

"the  new Government will be considerably exercised

to  find  means  of taxation which will  not  weigh

penally on any particular section of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



the  community or business interests in  Singapore,

which  will  not harm the economy . . ."  Strangely

enough, I suggest it is doing just that.



<br><br>10.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after  hearing  the warning by the hon.  Mr  Mason

that  those  who  have  crossed  the  Floor  should

consider  very  carefully  before  supporting  this

motion,  I feel that I must in duty bound  give  my

personal opinion of what I think of the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike previous Budgets which had so many items

for  Members to pick on, this year's Budget has one

very important item to which several Members before

me  have  referred,  and that is  the  increase  of

income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mason also commented that it might not be possible for Members of the Opposition Benches who

have crossed the Floor to vote against this motion,

but I think there is nothing to prevent any of such

Members  to  give their personal opinion  which,  I

believe,   is   in  accordance  with  parliamentary

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly agree with Mr Mason that the

increase  of  income  tax - either  company  tax   or

individual  tax - will  certainly  drive   not   only

industries  but  also personnel to the  Federation.

The  Government, prior to the introduction of  this



Budget,  said  that it would produce  a  standstill

Budget, but it is rather surprising and alarming to

find  now  that it has thought fit to introduce  an

increased tax on income and an increase in duty  on

smokes.  Most  of the industries in  Singapore  are

going  over  to  the Federation, and  I  understand

quite a lot more will follow suit very soon.  As  a

result of the increase in tax on personal income, I

am  quite sure that our top officers, good officers

and  efficient  officers will also be  thinking  of

going  to the Federation, because the tax there  is

not  as  heavy  as  what we are going  to  have  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the use of having self-government if

we   do   not  have  industries  here  to   provide

employment  and the efficient officers to  run  the

government?  Certainly it is no use to  have  self-government if there is nothing left in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Government is always trying

to   introduce   legislation  in  line   with   the

Federation of Malaya. But in this case it  has  not

followed  the  Federation. I am told  that  in  the

Federation there is no increase of such income tax.

Why  then should we have an increase in income  tax



here? I wonder whether the Financial Secretary  has

consulted the Federation regarding this increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Financial Secretary in his speech has

said  that the increase in income tax is very small

and  that,  in his personal opinion,  it  will  not

affect the ordinary man. But I would like to remind

the  Hon, the Financial Secretary that little drops

of  water make a mighty ocean. It may be $10  here;

it  may be $10 there; and then from the $10 it will

come  to  $100; and that $100 will come to  $1,000.

Can  an  ordinary  man afford to  sacrifice  a  few



dollars here and a few dollars there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Financial Secretary that

when  the duty on smokes was increased, a Bill  was

introduced in this Assembly. I opposed it. At  that

time it may have been a matter of five cents. Today

we are going to have to pay another five cents more

per  packet. A man who smokes three packets  a  day

will  have  to  find an extra 15 cents  a  day - that

makes it $4.50 a month. The Financial Secretary did

not  agree with me that when the tax on smokes  was

increased  it would not affect those who  smoke.  I

will  read an extract from his speech made when  he

introduced the Budget:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Collections of customs duties have certainly

fallen  below the estimate, particularly in respect

of liquors and petrol."



<br><br>I warn the Financial Secretary that any increase in

tax  will  certainly affect the income, or revenue,

because  if there is an increase it will  certainly

affect consumption which will be decreased. For the

salaried  man,  his salary will  remain  the  same.

There   is   no   increase.  In   some   Government



departments  there  may be  a  yearly  increase  in

salary, but that increase is very small. If that is

a fact, where can he find extra money to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



his  budget? In the case of the Government, it  can

of  course  introduce  tax increases  to  meet  its

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote another extract from the Financial Secretary's Budget speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would be dangerous to allow our reserves to

be  run  down too far. We must safeguard  ourselves

against  the  financial consequences  of  a  severe

recession  in  trade:  we  must  retain  enough  to

finance  public works as a measure of  unemployment

relief in time of depression;".



<br><br>Now the Government can find money by an increase in

tax  to  meet  all these things. But where  can  an

ordinary  man find this money? So the only  sources

for  him  to  find this money are  either  to  beg,

borrow  or  steal. If he borrows  money,  he  finds

himself  in the soup. If he is a civil servant  and

he gets himself in debt and he does not declare it,

he  is  subject  to dismissal from the  service.  A

story  appeared in the Singapore Standard yesterday

of a man - a father of seven - who was sacked.



<br><br><div align="center">"Father of 7 Gets A Shock </div>

<div align="center">Sack For Govt. Clerk Who</div>

<div align="center">Got Into Debt"</div>



<br><br>Sir,  this  poor  man has seven children  and  just

because he could not balance his budget, he had  to

borrow.  As a result of this, he now finds  himself

out  of employment. That makes the situation worse.

Now where are his seven children going to get their



food?  If  this man did not borrow, then  the  next

alternative  would  be for him to  rob.  What  else

could he do but rob? Is it right to rob, Sir? If  a

man  robs, he will find himself behind bars. It  is

not that he should rob; it may be that, because  of

circumstances, he has got to rob. My view  is  that

the  Government,  by introducing this  increase  in

tax,  is  trying  to  encourage  people  to  commit

crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a man does not want to borrow or to rob,

then the last alternative is to seek corruption. We

want an efficient public service here. We certainly

do not want to encourage corruption. Summing up, if

a  man  wants to find money to balance his  budget,

three  sources are open to him - either borrow, steal

or  seek corruption. Sir, in this matter I am  just

expressing my personal opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



This  may  not be the Government policy, but  as  a

Back-bencher I feel that I have a right to  express

my  personal opinion. But I should like to say that

the  Government  is very courageous in  introducing

this  increase  in tax on the eve  of  the  general

elections.  I  must congratulate the Government  on

its courage.

Financial Secretary firstly, for having presented a

Budget  which is in accordance with all  the  other

previous  Budgets in principle, and secondly,  that

we  should  wind up the four years  of  the  Rendel

Constitution  with a much reduced  special  reserve

fund   than  when  this  Government  first  assumed

office. We are not really interested in what is  in

the  Budget, and what is out of the Budget, because

everybody  knows  that this is a Budget  for  about

four months, or five months at the outside. But for

the  assurance  that there would be election  writs

before  the  end of this Assembly,  we  would  have

moved  that  this  Budget be  drawn  up  for  three

months' expenses only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from a special reserve fund of over $100

million  when  the Labour Front Government  assumed

office  in  1955,  it  has now  gone  down,  or  is

expected  to  go  down,  to  $65  million - this   is

according  to the speech of the Hon, the  Financial

Secretary - including  $20  million   for   Christmas

Island.  It  means  that the  Government  has  been

spending from reserves and is leaving us with  much

less  money to spare than when they first began.  I

do  not  know whether this is a Labour Front Budget

or  a  Singapore People's Alliance's Budget.  I  am

told  that  the S.P.A. has not even been officially

formed  and  has  not even been gazetted  as  being

exempted  from  registration  under  the  Societies

Ordinance.  Presumably it is still a  Labour  Front

Budget,  and therefore it will absolve  the  Member

for  Queenstown,  who has Just joined  the  S.P.A.,

from the embarrassment of having to support it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are surprised that the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  should have had the audacity to  say  in

this  Assembly  that they can quite safely  put  up

company tax to 40 per cent. He was the same man who

told  us  last year that there should be  a  safety

margin  of at least ten, if not more, per cent.  We

were  the  first to advocate that they  should  tax

companies  up  to  the hilt, according  to  British

standards,  because most of them in  any  case  are

registered  in  Britain or the investors  are  from

Britain. They can easily go up to 9s, in the  pound

without affecting anybody's pocket other than  that

of  the British Treasury. But to do this at a  time

of slump, having missed all the millions of dollars

that could have been collected as extra revenue  in

the last three years, is the height of idiocy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the income tax, may I say this? It really

depends upon how much the difference is. For people

like  the hon. Mr Mason and his friends,  if  they

have  large  holdings  in the Federation  and  some

holdings  in  Singapore, it might  be  worth  their

while to reside in Johore Bahru and get a fast  and

comfortable  car to travel down to Singapore.  Then

they   pay  Singapore  income  tax  only  on  their

Singapore investments and businesses and Federation

income  tax  on  their Federation  investments  and

businesses.  Quite  frankly,  we  would  not   have

started  this  if we were confronted  with  such  a

situation, but the Labour Front has got  a  lunatic

fringe  about  it which sometimes is quite  useful.

They  are prepared in their last desperate  moments



to  strike  out in all directions. I  say  if  this

works  successfully  and  the  $5  million  can  be

collected without a change in residence of all  the

wealthy  men  who have businesses in Singapore  and

the  Federation, then why not? If it cannot  be  so

collected without adverse results, then no doubt  a

future  government will put matters right.  But  we

certainly  will  not  take  serious  objections  to

collecting an extra $5 million provided it  can  be

so  collected. We have to take the word of the Hon.

the  Financial Secretary that it can  be  collected



expeditiously and efficiently and that in any  case

we are quite sure to get $5 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to make some reference to the way

in  which  the  Hon, the Financial  Secretary  has

glossed  over  certain things.  For  instance,  his

explanation  of the savings on personal emoluments.

He  says that in 1959 it is expected that a sum  of



$114.9   million   would  be  spent   on   personal

emoluments as compared with $123 million  in  1958.

Sir, this is an astonishing proposition because  he



goes  on to admit that he does not think that  next

year  actual  expenditure will fall short  of  $114

million.  Earlier when he dealt with what  was  the

actual expenditure on personal emoluments for 1958,

it was not $123 million but it was $104 million. On

page  3  of the stencilled document which he handed

in,  he  said  that  expenditure  was  to  be  $104

million.  In other words, there is going to  be  an

actual estimated increase in personal emoluments of

$10 million, and it is completely dishonest to lead

us to believe -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled out the word

"dishonest".  The hon. Member should not  use  that

word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am not suggesting moral

dishonesty.  I  am  just  suggesting  that  it   is

dishonesty in the technique of presentation.  I  am

not in any way imputing moral disapprobation of the

Hon, the  Financial  Secretary's  character   and

integrity.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is what the hon.

Member  thinks,  but  I  have  overruled  the  word

"dishonest"  and I ask the hon. Member to  withdraw

the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If you please, Sir, I was just

on  the  point of doing so but before I did  so,  I

thought  that I should explain what I  intended  to

convey.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the hon. Member withdrawn the

word?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I have. Sir, this is a

standstill Budget and we have very little  to  say.

If  and  when  the time comes for a review  of  the



financial  situation in 1959,  we  can  assure  the

House  that  there are many items in the  Estimates

which will disappear or be radically pruned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



although we are not suggesting for one moment  that

we  will  follow  the footsteps of the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  (Mr A. R. Lazarous). I do  not  know

which  P.W.D. engineer has stepped on his  toes  or

who  has  been very strict over his contracts  with

the  P.W.D.  I fully sympathise with  some  of  the

sentiments which he has expressed, but I would  ask

him  when  he speaks on these matters to  remember:

(1)  that we have got to be factually accurate; and

(2)  that  when  we  hit out at  the  local  senior

officers, we must make sure that we are hitting out

at the right persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not the persons who agreed to

Malayanisation terms. The Malayanisation terms were

agreed  to  between a group of expatriate  officers

and a group of elected Ministers in the Federation,

and  what  the Hon, the Chief Minister of Singapore

did  was  to hide behind the sarong of the Minister

in  the Federation. That is why we are saddled with

the  Malayanisation terms. But that is all past and

gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to prune the salaries of our professional

officers and our Division I officers, but there are

certain  limitations  which we  must  observe.  The

first   point   is  that - according   to   the   new

Constitution - their basic salaries, as distinct from

their  allowances which amount to 30 odd  per  cent

over  and  above  the  basic  salaries,  cannot  be

touched. The second point is that there are  limits

in  the realities of the situation; that unless one

can  pay  a  reasonable remuneration for skill  and

talent  in  competition with  what  the  commercial

world  can  offer,  then  of  course  we  may  find

ourselves   landed   with   highly   unsatisfactory

instruments  of  policy.  But  even  within   those

limitations,  I would like to say that  the  senior

Government officers should disabuse their minds  of

any  illusions that they can, in the  tradition  of

the  M.C.S., do the minimum amount of work for  the

maximum amount of pay, and with the maximum  amount

of  retirement  benefits. We expect from  them  the

maximum amount of effort for the minimum amount  of

returns we offer. What was been given them will not

be  taken back and will be honoured by a subsequent

Government, but we expect them to do their duty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some curious items in the

Estimates which we shall touch on in greater detail

when we come to the Committee of Supply; but it  is

typical  of the four Budgets that have gone through

that  no  imagination whatsoever has been shown  to

the  realities of our situation. $727,040 is  being

spent on the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

Everybody  knows that the Malayan Navy was  not  of



much  use  to  Singapore and,  quite  rightly,  was

handed over to the Federation of Malaya. Why should

we spend over $700,000 a year for the entertainment

of  a  few  people  who like to inspect  people  in

sailors' uniforms on H.M.S. Laburnum in Telok  Ayer

Basin?  I  do  not understand it. I  am  told  that

H.M.S.  Laburnum  is  not renowned  for  its  naval

exercises,  but for the piddling and tippling  that

goes on on board at all hours of the night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also $573,230 for the Malayan Auxiliary

Air  Force,  half of which is for payments  to  the

R.A.F. for services. Nobody believes that  we  are

training  local  pilots. I do not  know  what  this

money  is being spent for, who is burning  up  high

octane  fuel and paying the R.A.F. for the  use  of

its  services, and we see no reason why that should

go on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sum of $546,200 for civil defence.

Nobody is suggesting that this sum is going to help



us  if an 8,000-mile missile, with ten megatons  of

explosives  in  its  warhead,  were  to  arrive  in

Singapore  from  somewhere  north  of  the   Arctic

Circle.   It  is  time  to  reappraise  all   these

unnecessary expenditures. However, I do not  expect

the   Ministers,  despite  all  their  agility   in

changing  names  and colours,  have  been  able  to

master  the intricacies of finance and the  Budget.

They  have  left  it  entirely  to  the  Hon, the



Financial   Secretary.  I  will   give   him   this

credit - that at least he has not, on the eve of  the

winding  up  of the officio cum elected  Government

under  the  Rendel Constitution,  left  it  with  a

deficit as wide as the one which the Federation  of

Malaya  has left for the year 1959. If  that  is  a

fact  then I think we have to be grateful for these

small mercies. We know that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



reserves have gone down, but we know that at  least

some  effort  is being made not to  let  the  whole

wealth of this little island drain out to sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would warn the elected Ministers that with

three  months  to go, there should be no  monkeying

about with the Budget. When a vote of $320,000  was

given   for  rural  development,  nobody  mentioned

anything   about  using  it  for  the   relief   of

unemployed persons. Then as the election looms over

the  horizon,  the $320,000, instead of  going  for

rural   development,  is  used   for   unemployment

relief - $3  per  day  to a few  unemployed  persons,

presumably  to build roads in the rural area.  That

is not the way to budget. We are asked to approve a

whole  year's  Budget  by a  Government  which  has

promised to go out of office by 2nd April, 1959. We

would ask it, in the few months left to it, not  to

depart  from  what  each  sum  of  money  has  been

specifically earmarked for. And it is the  duty  of

the  Financial Secretary and Director of  Audit  to

see that that is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the last Budget by an

official.  We hope that the next Budget  will  show

more  imagination than the four years of the Labour

Front-UMNO-MCA, (now SPA), Coalition Government has

been able to produce.



<br><br>11.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Financial  Secretary has suggested that this  is  a

courageous Budget in as much as the Government  has

resisted  the  temptation to tie the hands  of  the

incoming government in regard to the policies  that

it  may  wish  to adopt after the coming  election.

That  is not quite the way it strikes us. Where  we



can  give  credit is in the fact that at long  last

The  Government has taken heed of our  advice  over

the   years   and  made  some  attempt  to   reduce

expenditure; to be precise, from an estimated $277-million this year to $268.5-million next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not judge Budgets simply by the figures

that  are  presented to us. We judge them  by  the

accomplishments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



of the past year or years, and by the intentions of

the  Government in the future. Whatever the  merits

or  demerits of the actual estimates, this  is  the

Budget of a tired government, lacking in confidence

in  itself,  unwilling or unable to  plan  for  the

future, because manifestly it has no plans  and  no

hopes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that has astonished us is that

the new Alliance, when it was formed, announced  no

programme,  no plans, and no policies.  Of  course,

you  cannot  frame a Budget if you have no  policy.

Here  is  a time - if ever there was one - if you  have



confidence  in  yourself and in the future,  for  a

newly constituted Alliance to frame and proclaim an

imaginative, challenging, election-winning  Budget,

something calculated to rally all democratic forces

to its side. But instead, we are given a standstill

Budget in a world that is moving fast, because  the

Members  on the Front Bench opposite are too  tired

and too stale to do anything but stand still.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn at this stage, Sir, to company tax

and  examine it now, on the Second Reading,  rather

than  later,  we would say this: that  in  view  of

Singapore's financial position at present, it seems

that  we must accept as inevitable the increase  in

company tax proposed. But we must not overlook  the

fact  that this increase will not help to create  a

favourable  climate for the expansion  of  industry

and  the  launching  of new enterprises  which  the

Government  professes  to wish  to  encourage.  You

cannot  expect industrialists and investors  to  be

anything  but  hard-headed in these matters.  Long-term  investments require a long view ahead.  While

it  is  true  that  the  new  legislation  allowing

remission  of  taxation - the pioneer industries  and

industrial  expansion schemes - is a step forward,  a

33 1/8 per cent increase in company tax, in the same

breath  so to speak, is a step back again.  Let  us

now  have  a look at income tax revenue during  the

Government's  period of office. In 1956  the  yield

was  $68.3-million;  in 1957  it  dropped  to  $65-million;  in  1958 it will have been maintained  at

approximately the same figure of $65-million, as  a

result  of an increase in the rate of personal  tax

from 30 to 40 per cent. At



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



the  same  rate  of  tax, the  Financial  Secretary

estimates  the yield of tax in 1959 at $55-million.

He therefore proposes to increase company tax by 10



per  cent  to  regain  this $65-million  mark,  and

personal tax by 10 per cent to bring the figure  to

just  over  $70.million. We now have a  picture  of

what  is  happening. Since 1956,  the  Government's

first  full  year in office, we are increasing  the

yield  from income tax by roughly $2-million,  that

is  to say, from $68.3-million in 1956 to just over

$70-million in 1959 through the drastic measure  of

raising  personal tax from 30 to 50  per  cent  and

company  tax  from  30 to 40 per  cent - an  eloquent

testimony  of our declining prosperity  during  the

Government's term of office. As I said  last  year,

it is only too clearly revealed that Government has

failed  to expand commerce and industry during  the

past three years, for if commerce and industry  had

expanded,  it would be reflected in the income  tax

yield.  It follows, therefore, that as a result  of

the  decreased spending power that must come  about

in  1959 through increased taxation, the income tax

yield  will again drop back to something like  $55-million or $60-million in 1960. Increase in the tax

rate  one  year has as its corollary the inevitable

falling off in yield in the following year, and the

law  of  diminishing returns begins to operate.  It

would  be difficult to say where and when the limit

will  be reached, but we must be getting very close

to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must accept the present increase as

forced upon us as a necessity, we must give warning

that  such a large increase, at a time when we  are

by  no means out of the recession, is not going  to

help  to produce an expanding economy, more capital

investment  and more employment. It  is  abundantly

evident,  Sir,  that  the  Government  machine  has

failed to tick. Where are the promises of the years

gone by? Let us have a look at a few of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Ministry of Health, there is the sad story

of the District Hospital. First, it was to be built

in  Kallang,  then at Bedok, and now we  understand

that it has been scrapped altogether and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



land  given  back to the owners. Total  achievement

after   three   and   a   half  years - no   District

Hospital - except  that we believe that  the  Thomson

Road  Hospital  for  the  chronic  sick  is  to  be

converted  into  one - and we know  what  conversions

cost.  In  any  case, we end up with one  hospital:

instead of two, and that one not even finished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the drive against tuberculosis,

which is much more important even than that against

polio,   although  it  is  less  spectacular,   the

position  seems  to  be one of extreme  anxiety.  A

special  Survey has been carried out for which  the

Government is to be commended. But yet at the  very

time   when  more  cases  of  hospitalisation   are

inevitably being discovered, and will be discovered

in  the future, the number of beds available at the

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital is being reduced by turning

a ward into a nurses' hostel - another conversion and

more costs - a change of policy and wastage of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the Ministry of Education.

Here we find failure to build secondary schools  in



reasonable  proportions to primary  schools - only  9

against 59, or I against 6 approximately - and  as  a

result  a  desperate scramble to  gain  entry  into

secondary  schools,  resulting  in  corruption  and

leakages  in the all-important examination  papers.

And  what  is worse - many children are getting  into



primary schools only at the age of 8 plus. There is

also  the disappointment caused by the cutting down

of  the  cultural affairs allocation,  on  which  I

shall have more to say later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In commerce and industry, the Minister has had a

hard  row  to hoe. It was once said of Shelley  the

poet that he was "an ineffectual angel beating  his

luminous  wings in vain". I would hardly  call  the

Minister  either angelic or luminous, but otherwise

the  description might be applicable. Last  year  I

brought  to his attention the Government's  failure

to  expand  industry,  quoting employment  figures.

These  are worth repeating and bringing up to date.



In  March  1956 the number of workmen  employed  in



manufacturing is 57,332; in March 1957,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



55,011;  and  March  1958,  51,296.  And   in   all

industries  the  figures are (in thousands)  124.6,

123.2,  and 118 respectively. The trend  is  worse:

the   slip  backwards  is  going  faster.  But  the

population  increases each year by an amount  equal

to the total number employed in manufacturing. That

is a sobering and depressing thought. Last year the

Minister  pooh-poohed these figures,  stating  that

they  gave a false picture, that these figures were

the  returns  of  different  employers,  and  if  a

reduced  number  of employers sent in  returns,  it

could  not be helped. I submit, Sir, that  if  less

employers send in returns, it must be because there

are  less  employers. If it  is  not  so,  let  the

Minister present the true figures. But the Minister

went on to give a glowing picture of the number  of

industries  that were about to be set  up,  but  he

could not disclose the nature of them. Whether many

of these mysterious industries have materialised or

not,  we  do not know; but what we do know is  that

there  are less persons being employed in  industry

today  than  there were a year ago. And  now,  only

this month, after years of prompting from this side

of   the  House - I  will  not  weary  you,  Sir,  by

repeating what I said before - the Pioneer Industries

and the Industrial Expansion Bills have come before

us, too late to have the impact they might have had

two  years  ago.  And  with  what  irony  are  they

introduced, hand in hand with the increase of 33 1/3 per cent in company tax!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, we must turn to housing. The Financial

Secretary  pointed out that 9,000 units of  housing

will  have  been built during the lifetime  of  the

present Government up to the end of this year.  But

let me remind him that 2,900 of these were built in

1955,  that is to say, they were planned  and  were

being  constructed  before the  present  Government

took  office. In other words, only 2,000  per  year

have   been   built  since  then  under  Government

responsibility.  Let  me further  remind  him  that

residential buildings of all kinds, whether by  the

S.I.T., P.W.D., City Council or private enterprise,

were  5,740 in 1955; 4,445 in 1956; 3,351 in  1957;

and only 2,826 up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



to  September of this year - a sad story of declining

achievement.  We  are  now  told  that   Government

housing  development  will have  to  decline  still

further for lack of money. But what has happened to

the  scheme  to  allow  people  to  buy  their  own

apartments in S.I.T. housing estates, so that  they

can enjoy ownership of their own fiats? This system

has  been  adopted in many parts of the world.  The

legal  difficulties have been overcome. Why has  it

not   been   introduced  here,  as  the  Government

promised?  Is  the scheme lying forgotten  in  some

dusty drawer in the Minister's desk, when it should

have  been  introduced in the  new  Queenstown  and

Kallang housing estates, and the sums required made

available  for further construction?  The  Minister

has something to answer for here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, let us examine the record of the

Ministry of Communications and Works. Firstly,  the

deferring  of  a  proper  public  transport  system

regarding  which no progress of any  tangible  kind

has  been made in three and a half years.  With  no

reorganised bus routes, we still find our  children

having   to   go   to   school   expensively    and

extravagantly in cars and pirate taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the failure to solve the problem of

floods,  so  that  now  the main  trunk  road  from

Singapore  to  the Federation can be flooded  to  a

depth of four feet outside the University of Malaya

as  a  result of a two-inch thunderstorm. And  what

comfort  had the Minister to give to this House  on

the 5th November last? I quote, Sir, from col. 913:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...had the tide been higher or had the

rainstorm gone on longer, the flooding in the areas

affected  on  Monday would have  been  considerably

worse."



<br><br>So much for the Minister's theoretical socialism in

the fact of hard facts - and wet ones at that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly and lastly, the abandonment, or certainly

the  deferment  of  Phase III  of  the  Paya  Lebar

Airport  development which deals with the  handling

of passengers and freight, and in this airborne age

gives    visitors   to   Singapore   their    first

impressions.  It  is  admitted  that  the   present

terminal building is inadequate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



that  it  will  cope  only inefficiently  with  the

traffic which the new aircraft of 1959 will  bring,

but we continue to stagnate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder with these dismal failures facing them,

with    their   broken   promises   and   shattered

aspirations, the Government is trying to  save  its

face  by changing its name, and by laying the blame

on  subversive  elements. But if we are  forced  to

apportion  blame, perhaps it would be fair  to  say

that the Government has never really recovered from

the  ebullience of its first year in office,  under

another leader who led it at a galloping pace  down

jungle  paths  from  which  it  was  difficult   to

extricate  itself.  To  change  the  metaphor:  new

brooms  are  apt to sweep too indiscriminately;  in

1955 in the present Government; and in 1958 in  the

City  Council, so that the crockery goes  into  the

dustpan as well as the dirt and the rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let us leave the past on one side for

one  moment, and consider the future. The Financial

Secretary  has stated that the cost of  the  social

services will continue to rise year after year.  It

is  abundantly true of education, and perhaps  less

so of health. I have pointed out a few other things

which  the Ministers of the Government had promised

to  do  but  had to abandon. But it is  clear  that

however  heavily  taxed we may  be  by  normal  and

practicable  methods  of taxation,  revenue  cannot

rise beyond a certain limit. Somewhere between  the

estimated  $264-million for 1959  and  $300-million

would  be a reasonable guess. What then are  we  to

do? If there is a limit to increase in revenue,  we

must  of  necessity  look for  ways  and  means  of

reducing expenditure on a permanent basis. We  come

to  the  conclusion, as we must, that the  cost  of

administration on this small island of  220  square

miles  is  out of all proportion to the returns  we

get and to what we can reasonably afford. We cannot

afford  the  luxuries of the democratic system  but

only the essentials; by which I mean that we cannot

afford    the    cost   of   a   multiplicity    of

administration - a  central or  national  government,

local government as represented by the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



Council  for one part of the island, and  four  new

District Councils for the rest of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often refer to Singapore as a City State. Why

do  we not run it like a City State under a single,

streamlined, rationalised administration?  Most  of

us  have  been  brought up to  accept  the  British

pattern    of   central   government   and    local

government - I have certainly been very close  to  it

myself - but it is becoming clear that we must recast

our  thinking and reshape our ideas, and  have  the

courage   to  admit  that  it  is  not  necessarily

satisfactory on a small island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government scrapped the City and

Island   Council  purely  and  simply,  I  suspect,

because  the  Rendel Commission  proposed  it,  and

substituted separate City and District Councils  at

enormous  extra expense. The decision was taken  in

1955.  The  necessary Ordinances  were  passed  two

years  later - in about August 1957 - but still,  after

another  one  and  a quarter years,  there  are  no

District  Councils. At one time we stood poised  on

the threshold of District Council elections, to  be

held  in April of this year, but now they have been

conveniently forgotten. The Government has not  had

the  courage  to  admit them to be administratively

unwise,  and  yet they hesitate to  put  them  into

operation.  And is there a loud public outcry  over

the  delay?  There is not. The reason I suggest  is

not  far to seek. A new head of expenditure in  the

Estimates, Head 44, District Councils, adds  up  to

$3�-million. If we turn to the Explanatory  Notes

on page 476 of the Estimates, we will find what has

happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Rural Board was abolished when the above

three  Councils were established" -



<br><br>The Rural  Board has not been abolished -



<br><br>"and the staff split up and posted  to the three Districts Council Offices.  As

the  then existing Rural Board staff was inadequate

to  meet  the  resultant needs, the  following  new

appointments or posts were authorised in 1958 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Executive Officers, six"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



and so on. I will not read the rest, as it is there

for  Members to read. A total of 62 new  posts.  In

addition,  the  following posts have been  seconded

from  the  Medical and Health and the Public  Works

Department  respectively to come under  the  direct

control of the District Councils, and there we have

a  list  of,  curiously enough, another  62  posts.

Briefly,  an  increase in staff and an increase  in



decentralization  among  the  technical   officers,

tending to a loss of efficiency and co-ordination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, side by side with this, we have the

Rural  Development  Panel set up  under  the  Chief

Minister, because of the tendency of a lack of  co-ordination - I will ask you to look at  page  466  of

the Estimates where you will read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The activities of various Departments and

organisations concerned with the rural  areas  have

tended  to  be unco-ordinated in the  past  and  an

authority  to plan the development of  these  areas

and  to  co-ordinate  the activities  of  the  many

authorities concerned with rural affairs was  found

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rural Development Panel has therefore been set

up  consisting  of  Heads of Departments  concerned

with   rural   development.  A  Rural   Development

Commissioner will chair the Panel. The  Panel  will

serve  in  a consultative and advisory capacity  to

the   Commissioner  who  will  ensure  co-ordinated

action. The Commissioner will frame a comprehensive

development  plan. He will have a staff  of  eleven

field  officers, mostly Chinese speaking, who  will

work in association with the respective departments

and the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel will consist of: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Agricultural Officer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Chief Fisheries Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Chief Veterinary Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Registrar of Co-operative Societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Rural Health Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Deputy Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Director of Social Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Director of Information Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Senior Executive Engineer, Rural.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)Deputy Secretary (Administration), Ministry of Education."



<br><br>But  no  District  Councillors, and  not  even  the

Chairman  of  District Councils.  A  separate  body

altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rural Development projects will include matters

of  land usage, drainage and tenure security...  They

will  arrange for supplies of foodstuffs and  later

improved types of livestock... They will be concerned

with improvement of roads, water supplies and other

amenities"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



which we need not mention here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One policy leading in one direction and another

in  the  opposite direction. Contradictions leading

to  duplication, delay, frustration and sheer waste

of   money!  The  people  of  Singapore   are   the

sufferers, not the gainers. They pay more in taxes,

and get more administration but less results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we are not thinking of a return to a

City  and  Island  Council. We are  thinking  of  a

complete   rationalisation  of  our  administrative

system  in  the  hands  of a single  democratically

elected  body.  In the past year we have  seen  the

City  Council pulling in the opposite direction  to

the Government - something we cannot afford, whatever

our  views  may be on which is the right direction.

Soon  we may find the District Councils pulling  in



different directions from the City Council and from

each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one simple illustration. The boundary

between  the  City and District Councils  for  many

miles runs down the middle of roads, Braddell  Road

for example. The City Council may want to resurface

and  widen their half of the road, even to  make  a

dual  carriage-way, but the District Council, which

will be responsible for the other half of the road,

may  have  other ideas. So nothing will happen  and

the road will deteriorate, and it will cost more to

put it in order in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the present and future state of

our  finances cannot afford what I have called  the

luxuries  of  the  democratic  system  where   each

authority can follow contradictory policies. At the

moment,  health is administered by both  Government

and  the  City  Council. The latter  builds  infant

welfare  centres, and the former district  clinics,

and both cable for Professor Sabin's polio vaccine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads are in the hands of the Government, the

City  Council, the District Councils and  now  even

the   Rural  Development  Panel.  There   are   two

assessment offices and two policies. Traffic is  in

the  hands of the City Council in certain  aspects,

the  traffic police and licensing under  the  Chief

Secretary, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



transport  to  some extent under the  Minister  for

Communications and Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is to be a Government housing

authority,  local  governments  are  in  charge  of

building plans and construction by-laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could continue to cite examples, but the

final one is the question of public utilities.  The

McNeice Report recommended placing public utilities

in  the  hands of a corporation or Board.  However,

our  view was that so long as public utilities  are

properly  administered  without  politics  becoming

predominant, the City Council could safely be  left

to  run  them and we believed it to have  been  the

Government's view also. That at least should be the

case.  Not  only have public utilities  become  the

play  of  politics, but engineers  and  technicians

have   departed   until  the  efficiency   of   the

electricity  and  water undertakings  is  in  grave

danger.  We  believe  now  that  a  corporation  is

essential so that the life-blood of electricity and

water can be safeguarded. So we say rationalise our

administration and cut out waste, so  that  we  can

better   utilise   the  small  number   of   expert

technicians remaining to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we show to the Federation and to our

neighbours  and to the world that we  are  bent  on

putting our administrative house in order, reducing

our  overheads  and  lowering our  expenditure,  we

should attract both the Federation and the world to

our  door-step.  Indeed, eventual merger  with  the

Federation will be easier if we have one  clear-cut

administrative body from which certain subjects can

go  under  central  control  with  the  minimum  of

reorganisation.  We  shall  appeal  more   to   the

Federation if we are a financial asset  and  not  a

liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my next point: merger with the

Federation is the desire of all Singapore political

parties, but we believe that the first step  should

be  an economic merger rather than a political one.

If  we could come closer together economically  and



look  at ourselves as a single economic unit,  both

countries would benefit. It has been suggested that

if the Federation Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



could  have  a  say in  the  working  of  the

Singapore Harbour Board, it would be as realistic a

step  in the economic field as having a say in  our

internal security in the political field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take another example - in the field of

electricity. The Federation Government is launching

a   new   hydro-electric  scheme  in  the   Cameron

Highlands.  This will cost millions,  but  it  will

only  be  able to serve areas of central Malaya.  I

believe  the  only  power station  south  of  Kuala

Lumpur  is  in  Malacca. Is there  any  reason  why

Singapore  should not be responsible for  providing

power to the south of this? A Singapore Electricity

Board  could work closely together with the Central

Electricity  Board  of  the Federation.  I  believe

Singapore   already  supplies  Johore  Bahru   with

electricity.  Why  cannot this  sort  of  thing  be

developed  on  a  joint planning basis,  to  mutual

benefit?  In  other words, the greater mingling  of

the  two  countries  in port facilities  and  power

supplies - to mention only two possibilities - would be

of immense advantage to both of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever the future holds, we are in fact on

the  eve of great events and the next four or  five

years may make or mar our destiny. If Singapore  is

to  be prosperous, then it cannot be the prosperity

of  the  few:  that  is  not Socialism,  but  plain

commonsense. An age of austerity is coming,  and  a

very large number of people reaching quite far down

in  our social strata must be prepared to accept  a

less  extravagant way of life. We  are  a  shallow,

pleasure-loving community, finding enjoyment in the

things  that  money can buy and not in  the  richer

things of the intellect and of the spirit. For this

reason,  I deplore the cutting down of the cultural

affairs  grant. I do not say that $100,000  can  do

the trick any more than $50,000, but any Government

worth its salt must do all in its power to interest

the  population in cultural pursuits and interests.

This  part  of  the  world  is  not  only  rich  in



biological, zoological and botanical treasures  but

in  subjects  of  sociological,  ethonological  and

linguistic  study - great avenues  of  knowledge  and

research



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



waiting to be explored. In the artistic sphere,  we

have few creative writers and musicians, poets  and

painters,   through   lack  of  encouragement   and

incentive and not through lack of talent.  What  is

the  use  of writing a book in Singapore if  nobody

cares to read it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of this House said a year ago that

we  cannot  afford  a Nature Reserve  or  even  the

Botanic  Gardens, for we need the  space  to  build

houses  or  grow vegetables. The truth is  that  we

shall have to look for far larger areas of land  on

which  to settle thousands of our citizens  in  the

not  too  distant future. Having passed legislation

for  a  44- or 48-hour week, we must see  that  our

people  learn how to use their leisure to the  best

advantage.  Unless we encourage cultural  pursuits,

we  cannot  have people with sufficient imagination

and  enthusiasm to solve the problems that face  us

in  the  future. If you encourage people to  write,

you  encourage them to think, and if you  encourage

people  to  take  up  scientific  or  literary   or

linguistic studies for their own sake and  not  for

pure  monetary gain, you will encourage  people  to

think  on creative lines and hence to try to  solve

the  difficulties of modern Malaya. There are  many

more  worthwhile things to do than eat a ten-course

dinner,  pick  up  a  tip for  the  third  race  on

Saturday, or gossip and drink in clubs and  coffee-shops - things  that  are  much  cheaper   but   more

rewarding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view of how we must go forward in the next

few  years is this: rationalise our administration,

unify  our economic affairs, simplify our  mode  of

living  for  the  greatest  good  of  the  greatest

number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I started by deploring the

standstill  policy of the Government, without  plan

or  programme, as a wrong approach if they want  to

capture the hearts and minds and enthusiasm of  the

electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ended, I hope, by being just a little more

constructive,  a  little more  positive  about  the

needs  of  the  future. The Liberal Socialists  are

ready  to pool their ideas and plan for the  future

hand in hand with all other true democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



forces  on  this  island,  provided  there  are  no

prejudices, personalities and reservations  allowed

to  stand  in  the  way, to cloud and  distort  the

vision of our essential goal. Time is running out.



<br><br>11.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member for Tanglin appears to me to be a first-class  surgeon but this Budget which  he  tried  to

analyse is a dead Budget. Sir, I may be wrong but I

am sure that the House heard the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  say  that  we shall have an  opportunity  to

review  the  whole  financial aspect  in  the  near

future.  Sir,  that means that the P.A.P. wish  to

have  a chance to review the whole financial aspect

in the near future - this is exactly according to the

rumours in the market, and you can rule me  out  as

irrelevant!  Sir, who believed that the  principles

of  the  P.A.P. are very near those of the U.M.N.O.

and  Party Ra'ayat? Sir, Dr Toh Chin Chye said  he



believed  it! Who believed that the Hon, the  Chief

Minister, when he decided to change the name of his

Government  to  the  Singapore  People's  Alliance - U.M.N.O. - M.C.A.  Coalition  Government,  failed  to

inform his right-hand Minister, who happens  to  be

the leader of U.M.N.O. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

anticipated  that he was going to be irrelevant.  I

think this is absolutely irrelevant. Please keep to

the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I will come to the last

point.   What  has  made  the  Financial  Secretary

prepare  such  a  Budget?  I  do  not  call  it   a

standstill one, Sir, I call it a deadly blow to the

Government,  whether  it  is  named  the  Singapore

People's Alliance or the Labour Front Coalition.  I

have  warned this House three times before to adopt

an old Chinese saying. "Open out more fountains and

restrict  the outflow." In the case of a  merchant,

it  means  that  he  must know how  to  manage  the

business  properly. I wish to say that  1958  is  a

year  of uncertainty and insecurity. It is  also  a

year  of instability, and you can find this comment

not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



coming from the Opposition but also coming from the

Financial   Secretary.  The   Financial   Secretary

touched on the subject of raising of loans,  and  I

thank him very much for very frankly giving all the

facts.  Sir, I wish to begin with column  1057.  He

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now as regards the raising of loans, it must be

confessed  that the prospects seem to  be  becoming

less and less bright."



<br><br>Sir, I carry on, but please carefully follow:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking back over the years since the war," -



<br><br>In other words, during the period of colonial rule -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore has had a quite astonishing record as

far as loan floatation is concerned."



<br><br>Sir,  I  wish the Financial Secretary will  explain

why  he  purposely  wanted  to  give  such  a  nice

compliment to the colonial regime? And now we  come

to column 1058 - still during the colonial period:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It speaks volumes for the prosperity and

stability   of  Singapore  and  for  the   external

reputation  of the business acumen of its  Citizens

and the soundness of its administration."



<br><br>And   this   administration  is  not  the   present

Government but the previous Government. I  wish  to

repeat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It speaks volumes for the prosperity and

stability   of  Singapore  and  for  the   external

reputation  of the business acumen of its  citizens

and the soundness of its administration."



<br><br>Sir,  was  it  not  a very strange  thing  for  the

Financial  Secretary to pay such a high  compliment

to  the  past  administration? Now we come  to  the

present stage. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...money has become increasingly tighter and

the   banks   and  other  bodies  which  subscribed

handsomely to loans in the past have no longer  the

same resources to do so."



<br><br>I want to ask why the Financial Secretary failed to

give  us the details - why the banks and other bodies

which  subscribed handsomely to loans in  the  past

have failed to do so now? And, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirdly, a large number of the private provident

funds which invested in Government and City Council

loans in the past have been wound up or reduced  in

scope."



<br><br>I   think  this  is  the  worst  of  all - this  part

regarding the loan in the last paragraph. He said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor do I think that they will improve until

uncertainty is removed from the political scene and

investors  are  satisfied  that  the  attitude  and

policies  of the Government in power in the  future

are  likely to be such that the investment of large

sums on long term is safe."



<br><br>Sir,  what does it mean? It means that the  present

Government admits that it is unstable and that  the

investors have no faith and no confidence  in  this

Government.  Therefore, Sir,  I  am  not  wrong  in

criticising  this Budget as being a dead  one.  The

Financial  Secretary  in  presenting  this  Budget,

knows  that  the Government is going  to  face  the

electorate very soon, and yet he presented a Budget

which is still accused by many hon. Members of this

House  as  being  vote-catching. I  think  this  is

absolute nonsense! This Budget, to me, is the  last

colonial coffin nail for the Labour Front Coalition

Government.  Sir, you may want to know  why  I  say

this? Today's Straits Times came out with the news:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"S.P.A. will press for independence.</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departure From The Belief That Merger With The

Federation Must Come First".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it at least brings us hope that the Labour

Front   Coalition  Government  has   admitted   its

mistakes  and has now, after 3 years and 9  months,

produced a programme for the people to decide. They

are faced with these questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are we separated from the Federation of Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is it good for us to merge with the Federation of Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Even if we want to, will the Federation agree?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) When will the people of Malaya and Singapore really begin to have a genuine interest or

show a combined determination to merge?



<br><br>Sir,  I  would like to quote what a famous  ancient

Chinese  poet said, "You want to advance, you  must

pretend  to  retreat." Don Juan,  when  courting  a

beautiful  lady  never said, "I love  you,  I  love

you!"  So  if  we  really want to  merge  with  the

Federation of Malaya, we must not follow  the  line

practised today. It only frightens the Tunku and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



I  would also like to say that surely creates a bad

impression on the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the S.P.A. has been called a Rojak

Party, the S.P.A. should be proud. Rojak is a  very

popular  national dish, and it is  much  better  to

have  it  than  Dr  Toh and the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar to have salad in the beautiful Island

Club. Salad is an imported dish, but rojak, Sir, is

a truly popular national dish. So good luck to you,

S.P.A.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In past years we have wasted time in creating

unnecessary misunderstandings which actually deepen

the  differences between the Federation  of  Malaya

and Singapore. Why, Sir? How many times have I said

that  we  are  lucky  to have such  an  experienced

businessman  as  our  Minister  for  Commerce   and

Industry.  He is young, eager, enthusiastic,  hard-working and industrious. But Sir, as long as  there

is  no Pan-Malayan economic policy - and I would like

to  repeat  it a million times - we are only  wasting

time and public money. The Financial Secretary,  of

course, is very smart. He only quoted a line or two

regarding our industry:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the field of industrial development, an

Industrial  Promotion Board has  been  established,

legislation   giving   tax   relief   to   selected

industries  is in the process of being  introduced,

arrangements  are being made for the protection  of

selected industries, and a `Buy Singapore' campaign

is  about to be started. A Tourist Promotion Bureau

has been established."



<br><br>A    28-page    Budget   speech    but    regarding

industrialisation and trade just only that part!  I

am  sure  that the Financial Secretary will explain

why he said, "Oh! there is no confidence to attract

more  industrialisation in this country." Deep down

in  his heart, Sir, I am sure he knows what I  know

regarding  merger. The Financial  Secretary  cannot

expect  a  Pan-Malayan  economic  development  plan

although economically we are one unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder why the Minister for Commerce and

Industry has not answered my question. Has he  ever

consulted the Federation Government as to what type

of  industries they want to promote? What  type  of

industries they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



are prepared to give to Singapore? We could come to

some arrangement on that. But at present, Sir,  the

Federation  apparently wants  industrialisation  in

every  sector  and  wants  to  leave  no  room  for

Singapore.  Sir, what is the use of this  so-called

Industrial Promotion Board? What type of industries

can  the Director of this Board have confidence in?

Can  he  say to any industry "Yes, you go ahead.  I

will  subsidise you. I will subsidise your land.  I

will  even  give  you  technical  advice."?  It  is

useless! Take soap factories. When you buy 10 cases

from  a  Federation soap factory, you are  given  3

cases  free of charge. They have big capital and  a

major share of this capital is, I believe, owned by

Europeans.  Yet,  because  they  operate   in   the

Federation   they  are  protected.  In   Singapore,

although  a  soap factory is run by  genuine  local

nationals, it is not protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to education, Sir, I want to criticise it.

We  know how courageous and determined the Minister



for  Education  must  be  in  taking  the  risk  to

disagree with his colleagues in many respects. But,

Sir,  if we believe in a merger with the Federation

we must have a Pan-Malayan unification of education

policy.  But  we do not have! Chinese  schools  and

Malay  schools are termed vernacular  schools.  Yet

the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar championed  the

cause  of Malay as the lingua franca! And he  is  a

learned,  well-informed and intelligent person!  If

you have travelled to India, Switzerland or Canada,

Sir,  I  do  not  think you will find  the  genuine

national  aspiration in the last two  countries  as

strong  as Mr Nehru's. Yet Mr Nehru has  admitted

that  there  is no likelihood of making  Hindustani

the lingua franca of India in 50 years. And look at

the language row that has occurred so many times in

Ceylon  and India! Why should political capital  be

made out of the language issue in this country? The

main  stumbling block to a merger between Singapore

:and the Federation is not because' Malaya is to be

made  or  not  to  be  made the lingua  franca  and

therefore  our  Malay  brothers  from  across   the

Causeway say, "I do not want to merge". Sir, let us

face  the  facts.  We do not have  a  unified  Pan-Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



education  policy and, therefore,  the  people  are

going  to be as ignorant as they are now.  Over  80

schools  have  applied  for  grant-in-aid  but  the

Budget  shows only 26. And I do not know  how  many

Malay schools have applied for such aid - I have  not

yet  checked  the figures. If we sincerely  believe

that  Malay  must  be  the lingua  franca  in  this

country, how can we prepare such a Budget? There is

not   even   a   Malay   secondary   school   being

constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everything is linked with merger. The

question of merger has become a nightmare not  only

to  politicians - useless and selfish politicians - but

also  to  the  ordinary citizens. They are  worried

about the word "merger". They are afraid: they  are

excited;  they do not know what to do!  Sir,  where

are our political leaders going to lead us!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is useless for me to go into detail

regarding  this "dead" Budget as I have termed  it.

1958  is  a year of instability and insecurity  and



although there have been no riots and no industrial

disputes,  yet  the  employment situation  and  the

business recession worsen day by day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Financial Secretary has had the

courage  to increase company tax and personal  tax,

yet  he  shows a reasonableness in his  estimate - he

only expects $65-million in 1959 as compared to the

estimate of $68-million in 1958. Why, knowing  that

next year business will not be good and it is going

to collect much less than in the year 1958, has the

Government   increased  the  tax   especially   the

personal income tax? The Financial Secretary  said,

"All  right, if you earn $4,000, you only  pay  $20

more; $7,000, you only pay $60 more." Sir, that $20

or  $60  to  a  wage-earner,  say  a  clerk,  means

something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I will point out one more strange thing - it

is  the first time that the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  has in his Budget speech failed to criticise

the Hon, the Chief Secretary who I think is the one

who should come under heavy fire. The crime wave is

increasing day by day. In broad daylight, just opposite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



a  police  station there was  a  cold-blooded

murder - two persons were killed. The crime  wave  is

so high, and yet many responsible leaders including

the  great  leader of the people,  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar himself, have failed to touch on this

subject. I would like to know why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this Budget is a

P.A.P./colonial Budget. The colonial Government  is

preparing a smooth way for the P.A.P. to come  into

power,  by sabotaging the existing governing  Party

which  is  so unpopular, so useless, and  so  high-handed.  And when the P.A.P. comes into power,  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara might receive  orders  from

Mr  Lennox-Boyd  saying,  "Dissolve  the  Assembly

because  the  state of affairs in Singapore  is  so

chaotic and because you people do not know  how  to

run  your  country."  I have heard  this  from  the

people many times, "As soon as the hon. Member  for

Tanjong Pagar becomes Prime Minister, we will  take

a slow boat to somewhere else, maybe Ulu Pandan !



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget is neither good for the people

nor for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is an appropriate time

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I think so, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  first  of  all  wish the Hon, the  Financial

Secretary well in his retirement, as this  will  be

his last Budget speech. As you know, he was once my

colleague  in the old Council. He has  worked  very

hard   and   honestly  for  the  benefit   of   the

Government.  My  criticism will  not  be  levelled

against him personally, but against the Council of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



Ministers.  He  is  only one of  them.  It  is  the

elected Ministers who make the final decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary has painted a

very gloomy picture of Singapore. Let us see why it

is  so. Sir, the present Government inherited  from

the  former Council a very sound economy and enough

money  in their coffers. The Government have,  from

time to time and year by year, been warned that  if

they  want to remain economically sound, they  must

practise    economy    in    administration.    But

unfortunately,  they  nave  blundered.  They   have

betrayed  the voters who have put them into  power.

When  the  Labour Front took office  in  1955,  the



position  was: liquid reserves, over $200  million;

duty   on   cigarettes -  full   rate   $6.70,   and

preferential rate $6.26 per pound; duty  on  petrol

68  cents  per gallon; income tax 30 per cent.  Now

that  they are vacating their office, what are they

leaving   to   the   incoming  Government?   Liquid

reserves,  about $83 million; duty  on  cigarettes - full  rate $10.50, preferential rate $10;  duty  on

petrol  $1 per gallon; income tax, 40 per  cent  on

companies  and  50  per cent  maximum  on  personal

incomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these three and a half years, the

Government  have ruined the economy of  this  great

city.  This is proved from the figures. It  is  the

figures that count, not propaganda and talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the higher the taxation, the higher the

cost  of  living  will be. Each and  every  one  of

us - the  trader, the worker, the shop  assistant  or

the clerical class - will suffer in the same way.  If

the  cost  of  living is high, the result  is  that

Singapore  as  a  free  trade centre  and  entrepot

cannot  exist.  A manufacturer in Singapore  cannot

compete  with others outside because  his  cost  of

production will be very high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of growing population is not

new.  Only a foolish Government will attribute this

position  of  high  living cost to  the  growth  of

population.  The  population  has  been  increasing

since  1945.  This Government came into  office  in

1955.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that income tax will be payable by

those who are best able to pay. That is quite true.

But  Singapore  as  a city is in  a  very  peculiar



position,  and has got to provide bread and  butter

for its workers, labourers and others through trade

or  industry. Now, if the tax is so high, - I am not

grumbling,  personally; many  of  us  here  do  not

grumble personally about the increase in tax - it  is

the people as a whole who are going to suffer. How?

Will an investor come to Singapore if be has got to

pay such a high rate of taxation? Why should anyone

try to have factories in Singapore when the returns

are  poor?  The  investor  wants  to  find  maximum

security  for  his money and also maximum  returns.

Now,  many politicians in this House agree that  we



need foreign capital, but the actions of the Labour

Front  Coalition Government - now under  a  different

label  possibly, I do not know - have created such  a

position that they are driving away the capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at Hongkong. The income tax there is

only  12� per cent. Look at our sister  territory

Borneo.  Their income tax is 20 per cent. Even  the

Federation's  income tax is lower.  As  my  friends

sitting  on  my side have pointed out, and  pointed

out rightly, the head offices of many companies and

factories  here will migrate to some other  places;

first to the Federation, otherwise elsewhere.  That

is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax on petrol has been increased from 68

cents to $1 per gallon. To day, a group of three or

four  assistants  might jointly  own  a  car.  They

themselves drive the car. But the increased tax  on

petrol has hit them. What will these people say  to

the  present Ministers? "We have put you in  office

and  what  have  you done to us?"  The  same  thing

applies  to  the smokers. Of course, the  Ministers

will   say   that   we   have  locally - manufactured

cigarettes. But why should we deprive these smokers

of the chance to smoke whatever brand they like?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question arises as to how the extra

money  is  to be found to meet the deficit  in  the

Budget. The reply is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



simple. It has been given time and time again.  Cut

down  the  administration costs. The administration

costs  absorb about 55 to 60 per cent of the  total

revenue. A small city like Singapore is swallowing,

in administration costs alone, so much of the total

revenue.  The Government should cut down travelling

and entertainment allowances, and even salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has no natural resources of its own. It

has a population of 1� million, and the number is

growing  bigger. It has therefore to  live  on  its

wits.  The householder must live within his income.

If he lives by borrowing, he will go to bankruptcy.



Singapore  is  but  a bigger house.  The  Ministers



should   similarly  behave  in  a  proper  way   so

Singapore should live or exist within its income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has misruled the city during

these  three  and  a half years.  The  results  are

higher   taxation,   widespread  unemployment   and

misery. The Government's expenditure has been  very

extravagant.  The  Ministers' salaries  alone  cost

about  $1�  million.  Travelling,  amusement  and

entertainment  allowances cost  about  $1  million,

including  the cost of bringing experts over  here.

Some  might  describe  this  expenditure  of  $2�



million  as chicken feed. It is indeed so to  those

who sit on the Government side. But even half of it

could  have  been saved to help the unemployed  and

their  children  in  buying  bread  and  milk.  The

Government  have  never thought of  their  welfare.

They have no time to think about them. During their



rule  of three and a half years (about 1,270 days),

the  Ministers  have been out of Singapore,  absent

from   their   duties,  for  1,100  days!   It   is

astonishing  that  in  a  city  of  the   size   of

Singapore,  each and every Minister  and  Assistant

Minister   should  have  spent  so  much   of   the

taxpayers'  money  on  travelling!  Was  it  really

necessary? I say no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preceding seven years, unofficials who had

to go to conferences overseas at the request of the

Government had to sacrifice their own income, their

business profits or vacation leave in order  to  do

so.  They had been to these places before. They did

not go there for sight-seeing or anything of that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



sort.  They  were asked to go there to  oblige  the

Government.  During these seven years, their  total

travelling costs did not come up to even  the  cost

of one trip of an elected Minister today. Those who

doubt  this  can look at the facts. One ministerial

trip today has cost much more than all the trips of

the unofficials made during these seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an unscrupulous merchant, when he is unable

to  pay  his  debts,  will just declare  himself  a

bankrupt  and  change his name.  Today  the  Labour

Front's elected Ministers are politically bankrupt.

They  have changed their name. But those whom  they



have  taxed are not going to be fooled.  They  know

the  Ministers  are not attending to their  duties,

that  they  have  been absent  from  their  office.

Today's  voter  is  not a fool.  The  Labour  Front



Ministers  will  be sadly mistaken  if  they  think

that,  by  changing  their  names,  they  will   be

returned to office again or even to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is quite well known as a central

city  in  South-East  Asia and  an  entrepot  trade

centre. What publicity does it want for travelling?

If  only  $10,000 or $15,000 is spent on  publicity

printing and through the Press, it will bring  more

results.  The Council of Ministers go out and  when

they come back, they report, "Sorry, we cannot  get

the  capital unless there is stability here."  Sir,

the  right thing for them to do would have been  to

resign in June 1956 when the ex-Chief Minister gave

up  his  portfolio. They were a minority Government

and  they  had to pull along with the help  of  ex-officios  and nominated Members, plus favours  from

this  side,  from  one or the  other  Party.  Their

resignations would have brought stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary touched on

loans, that it will be very difficult in future  to

get  loans subscribed from outside. This  is  quite

true.  But  why  has the position arisen  that  the

Government  have  to  seek loans,  when  they  were

placed  in  a financially sound position when  they

assumed office? They have finished our money.  They

are  worried. But even now we need not  go  out  to

find loans. We have in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



enough  money.  The only thing lacking  is  a  good

Government  responsible to the voters.  We  do  not

want  a  Government which, once they  get  elected,

change  their  seats  and  their  Parties.  A  good

government inspires loyalty from its partners. Such

a   government  can  bring  stability  and  inspire

confidence in the public. Loans could be  obtained,

Sir.  We  have  the  Central  Provident  Fund.  The

currency   fund  surpluses  can  be   invested   in

Singapore  in  land development  or  some  sort  of

Singapore security? Why `should we invest overseas?

What for? Of course, the reply would be to keep our

dollar strong and stable, but the same money  could

be invested here soundly and we need not go out and

find money at a higher rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the insurance companies - they drain

away   premiums  in  millions.  Why  can   we   not

nationalise life insurance companies? Why should my

premium  be invested in any other country? Why  not

in  Singapore? The Government say they  will  think

about  it; but they do not do it because  they  are

too busy planning their trips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy of future governments should be

at  least  to have one man employed in a family  so

that   there  will  be  less  expenditure  to   the

Government, no worry and less burden on the  Social

Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people talk of merger and independence.

Independence cannot be won by taking trips.  It  is



to  be  won  by  ourselves in Singapore,  not  from

outside. No tom-tom business is necessary. You have

got to sacrifice. Everybody wants merger. Many have

spoken about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, projects like the International Airport, the

formation  of  the Singapore Telephone  Board,  the

construction of Nicoll Highway and Merdeka  Bridge,

the  Polytechnic, housing development, and  so  on,

were  planned by the previous Legislative  Council.

Most  of  these  items  were in  the  1955  Budget.



Nothing that this Government has done is new.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as education is concerned, I have to

give  this  advice, not, of course, to the  present

government but to the one which is coming  in,  and

that is that they should formulate a policy whereby

they should produce craftsmen and mechanics and not

persons  qualified  only  for  clerical  jobs.  The

clerical  service is saturated, and if the incoming

government's  policy is not on  these  lines,  then

Singapore will be heading for trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the life of this present

Government, I will be failing in my duty  if  I  do

not  say a few words about the Ministry of Commerce

and Industry. I attach the blame on the Council  of

Ministers - not  on a particular person.  It  is  the

Council  of  Ministers who make the decision.  Sir,

the  Ministry of Commerce and Industry is the  only

Ministry - possibly Finance is the second Ministry - on

which  Singapore  has  got  to  exist.  Trade   and

industry are the two things on which Singapore  has

got  to  exist. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce

has  to be guided by experienced persons. In former

years  they had a Trade Advisory Council and Govern

ment  seldom rejected their advice. A sound  policy

would   follow  from  their  advice.  If  that   is

followed, our trade will brighten up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I have always been telling the

Government  that, in order to reduce  unemployment,

encouragement  should be given  to  handicraft  and

cottage industries. Sir, in other countries, big or

small,  this  has priority. Women and children  and

old pensioners, those who cannot actively work, can

do  something in the house and sell their  products

and  thereby make a living out of that. I have said

from  year  to year in this Assembly that  you  can

always   get  experts  from  E.C.A.F.E. to   give

assistance  in  this. What you have  to  do  is  to

establish  a  Marketing Board. A poor man  produces

something;  but he cannot keep it for days  in  his

house.  If there is a Marketing Board, he  goes  to

the Board and the Board either buys it or gives him

a  little in advance and then sells it later.  Sir,

where  are  we going to sell all that is  produced?

There are, thousands of people visiting Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



So  many articles made in other countries are being

sold  in this City. Why not our own? The only thing

necessary is trading initiative. A Marketing  Board

is necessary. But the Government will say that they

have  tried, but with no results at all. If you  go

to  Burma,  India, Pakistan, or Ceylon,  handicraft

and  cottage  industries are given priority.  Those

who  stay  at home work at them and they have  some

income from that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Defence. I remember at the

last  Budget  sitting. I fought hard to  scrap  the

Navy. The Government has been sleeping over it  for

more than three years. At last, at the end of their

term of office, they are now doing it, or have done

it.  Now, a small city like Singapore is vulnerable

to   any  attack.  Should  we  spend  thousands  or

millions of dollars on defence? And defence against

whom and for whom? Defence is not in our hands.  It

is  the United Kingdom Government's responsibility.

That does not mean that we should not build up some



sort of defence internally. I think we ought to  do

that. There is no question about it, but there is a

limit.  What is wanted? Those of you who were  here

during  the fall of Singapore will agree  that  the

only  defence  which  could have  been  useful  was

against  air attacks. Even today, if this could  be

developed, the money spent on that will be  rightly

spent.  All other means of defence are useless  and

we should not unnecessarily waste money on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other subjects which I will take

up  in the Committee of Supply, but I will say this

to  the voters: elect your Ministers correctly, not

like  the  Labour Front Ministers who have  brought

misery and ruin to Singapore even under its changed

name.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon, the

Financial  Secretary  in  his  Budget  speech - I  am

referring to column 1063 of the Hansard - said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Security and confidence in Singapore as one of

the  main  trading centres of the world  have  been

maintained."



<br><br>Sir, I entirely disagree with that statement. If we

want Singapore to be one of the trading centres  of

the  world,  I think that we should adopt  an  open

door  policy for all types of goods to flow in here

freely  and regard Singapore as an entrepot  centre

for  goods  to Indonesia, Burma, Thailand,  Sarawak

and  Borneo.  Singapore is in a unique position  in

this  part of the world to handle this type of  big

business.  The Government have been in  office  for

nearly  four  years,  and only  talk  and  talk  of

Singapore as an entrepot centre and its effects  on

the people of Singapore and the wor1d. What we want

is action and not just words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to quote

a statement made by the Ministry of Commerce to the

Straits Times on 6th January, 1958:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"Import Control on Red China Cement</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importers of Chinese cement in Singapore and the

Federation  will  now  have to  apply  for  special

licences   before   placing   orders   with   their

suppliers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore Ministry of Commerce and Industry

spokesman  told the Straits Times last  night  that

this step was necessary because cement produced  in

the  Federation  was  facing competition  from  Red

China cement."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have mentioned in the past

that  if  any  hon. Member wishes to quote  from  a

newspaper,  he ought to produce that newspaper  and

not  a  mere cutting. Perhaps the hon. Member  will

remember that in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Thank you, Sir, I will remember

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following up this ridiculous restriction, the

Singapore  Government has prohibited the import  of

certain  types  of  goods from  China  because  the

Federation  Government says so.  Government  should

realise  by now that this action is detrimental  to

our trade and the people of Singapore at large. Why

must  we  follow  the Federation  Government?  Just

because  they say, "We want it", therefore we  must

follow their action. That is most ridiculous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should realise by now that we have

spent  millions and millions of dollars, or  wasted

this money on such small items like the stockpiling

of rice. Why cannot that be removed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order that our people here can live

decently and comfortably, I am of the opinion  that

we  should  adopt an independent policy  in  trade,

which is our lifeblood, and this lifeblood must not

be drained away at all costs. With encouragement, I

hope  that  trade  and  industry  will  expand  and

perhaps  produce a healthy economic structure  that

will  in  turn  result  in  more  dollars  for  our

Treasury  and  also help to solve  the  problem  of

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to relax the tight

immigration laws so that people with money can come

and invest in this country. We must always remember

that charity begins at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Financial Secretary said at col. 1058 of

the Hansard dated 3rd December, 1958:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the prospects of raising loans are not

particularly bright.".



<br><br>Sir,  how can the prospects be bright when our  own

elected  Government chose to invest 25 per cent  of

the  Central Provident Fund overseas? Just work  it

out - 25   per   cent   of  the   Central   Provident

Fund - millions and millions of our valuable dollars!

And  I  am  not  really surprised,  Sir,  that  the

irresponsible   statements  made  by  irresponsible

politicians   have   also  deterred   people   from

investing  money here. So how can  we  have  loans?

Now,  as  the  Financial Secretary said,  even  the

banks  and other bodies which subscribed handsomely

to  loans  in  the  past have no  longer  the  same

resources  to  do  so. Why? Because  they  have  no

confidence. How can you raise loans and ask them to

subscribe to them? The position is such that people

with  money  are  investing in Hongkong.  They  buy

houses  in  Hongkong. They put  their  earnings  in

Hongkong. Many of them also invest their  money  in

England,   Australia,  India  and   elsewhere.   If

Government are sincere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



about  doing a job in the interests of the  people,

they can provide more houses and cheaper houses for

the  people. We have, Sir, about 15,000  people  on

the  waiting  list for houses but  Government  have

only erected 1,000 or 2,000 and they come back with

the  answer  or  an excuse, "Oh,  we  cannot  erect

houses on that land, until we drive so and so  out.

But we will not do that!" That is all nonsense!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even regarding the Health services, Sir. We can

provide more outdoor dispensaries or clinics in the

rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> On a

point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way? Mr

Minister, the Member has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> They do not look after their own

jobs, but they look after their own interests. Even

in the midst of a polio epidemic - a very serious one

at that - the Minister chose to run away to Japan, in

spite of appeals by Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Education, Sir, col. 1065 of the Hansard says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"59 primary and 9 secondary schools have been

built."



<br><br>Why  cannot  we  build  more secondary  schools  to

absorb those students? The Government are not aware

of  the grave problem of the teenagers who have  to

leave   school   for  failing  their  examinations.

Government  must, provide more trade  or  technical



schools for these school-leavers. Do they want them

to  roam  about the streets? It is no  wonder  that

crime is on the increase every day in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much has been said about merger with the

Federation. All of us want merger, but the way  the

Government are going about it is not dignified.  No

doubt  we  want to merge with our big  brother  the

Federation  but  we  must  also  look   after   the

interests of the people of Singapore first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do the Federation think of us? Have they any

consideration  or any sympathy towards  our  people

here? We hear about merger day after day, until  we

get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



tired  of  it. There are four important things  for

the  Singapore Government to do: (1)  housing;  (2)

health;  (3)  education; (4) welfare. Do  not  talk

about  merger.  We must think of our ownselves.  We

must   work   hard,  so  that  we  can  live   here

comfortably  instead of relying on the  Federation.

The Federation is a very rich country. What have we



got  here?  Just because the Federation  Government

want  to  do  a certain thing, must we follow?  The

Federation  want us to do that. Must we  agree?  We

are   dignified  and  we  must  have  a   dignified

approach,  even if we want to consider the  problem

of  a merger. I consider all the moves made by  the

Government are undignified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis)</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,  as  usual the Budget only gives us a partial

picture of the national economy. It is a tabulation

of  what  revenue Government will receive, what  it

proposes to spend, and how it proposes to reconcile

expenditure with revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of personal income tax and

company  tax is a bold measure as the Labour  Front

Government is about to fade from the scene.  It  is

as  a  Labour Front/Liberal-Socialist Alliance that

it draws near Judgment Day. Do the Government think

that they are actually having Socialist principles?

Like  repentant sinners, they seek to  make  out  a

strong  case for their existence and for the things

they should have done, but they have never done it.

Sir,  one  result  of the delay in  not  increasing



company tax earlier is the Government has failed to

reap  the revenue available in the prosperous  days

since  rubber  was  nearer the  $1  mark.  If  this

measure   had  been  taken  four  years  ago,   the

Government could have accumulated enough surplus to

see  it through the leaner days, and need not  have

to  abandon a number of projects because of falling

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of increasing company tax, Sir, was

raised  a  few  years  ago and the  then  Financial

Secretary justified his refusal to increase company

tax  on the grounds that a 30 per cent company  tax

was   necessary  as  an  inducement   for   foreign

investors   as   well  as  local   investors.   The

implication, Sir, was that an increase  in  company

tax  would  drive away foreign capital.  The  large

profits  which companies reaped then were sent  out

of the country and were enough inducement even with

higher  personal  income tax or  company  tax.  But

today the Financial Secretary comes forward with  a

proposal to raise company tax when the profits  are

not  so  high.  Sir,  as was  to  be  expected  the

increase in personal income tax and company tax has

raised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



protests from certain business interests,  and  the

capitalists  are also protesting. Each  time  taxes

are  raised,  it is the invariable cry to  proclaim

that  firms  will find it impossible  to  carry  on

their business and the country will go to the dogs.

Sir,  this  is  a dead-end Budget for  a  group  of



political gamblers playing out their last throw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

hon.  Member himself has coined that phrase, but  I

would  ask him to withdraw the phrase dealing  with

gamblers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I withdraw it.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  Singapore is a tax-free country, everybody will

be  happy; but since we can only run the government

by  paying  for  the  amenities  provided  for  the

people, taxation is therefore inevitable. With  the

programme  drawn  up by the elected representatives

in  this House, social services must need more  and

more  money  to meet the construction of  more  and

more   hospitals,  schools,  and  so  on.  However,

taxation must be imposed in such a manner  as  will

produce sufficient revenue on the one side and,  on

the  other, it must not injure the economy  of  the

country. More important to bear in mind is the fact

that  the  increase of taxation should be  done  in

such   a  way  that  the  nett  value  of  taxation

collected would be increased and not decreased.  If

it  is not for the good intentions of the Ministers

in  providing  better amenities for the  people,  I

would say that they have not been too well advised.

From  the point of taxation, Sir, I always  say  we



must  take a sane attitude. We must always consider

our position in relation to our neighbours. We must

always  bear  in mind that Singapore is  only  next

door  to  the Federation of Malaya. It is connected

by  a  causeway which is three-quarters of  a  mile

long. We need more capital; we want more factories;

we  want  to help people who invest money here,  in

order  to help us with our employment problem.  But

if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



we  take  any action which will drive them over  to

the  other side, then I say that that action is not

wise. There are two ways whereby business may  stay

in  this  small island. One is that capital  should

want  to  come  and  remain in  Singapore  for  the

building   of   factories,   for   running   better

businesses.  We  must also look at  factories  from

another point of view. There must be people to  run

such  factories.  If  the factories  concerned  are

worthy of consideration, then the executive must be

men with the highest qualifications. If we increase

personal income tax, would it be conducive for  the

man  who  is going to run the factory to remain  in

Singapore? Would it not be better for him  just  to

rent  a  house in Johore Bahru and have residential

qualification in Johore - say going up  there  during

the weekends, visiting his Johore residence once  a

week,  and  saying,  "I am ordinarily  resident  in

Johore  Bahru,  but I am working in Singapore."  If

such  were the case, would not his tax benefit  the

Federation  of Malaya, whilst we want,  to  have  a

little  bit  more  tax  from him  to  increase  our

revenue, and losing the whole lot! The talent  will

go  over to Johore while he earns his livelihood in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this from another point of view. If

there  were two jobs offered - one in the Federation

and  one  in Singapore - both paying $2,000 a  month.

Where  would  the man go to? Would  he  go  to  the



Federation  or would he want to come to  Singapore?

No  man is unselfish. No man is not going to  think

about  money  if  it is earned by  him.  Many  such

people  come from overseas, and I personally  think

that  probably  he would go to the  Federation  and

live there, thereby losing for us the tax we should

get from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from the beginning I have said that,

factories can only be run on capital and talent. If

we  have the capital here but no talent to run  the

factories,  we will again lose in the end,  because

the  factories will have to shift over to the other

side.  I  think  this  point  should  be  carefully

considered  by the Government and see  what  better

method there is to help Singapore out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days ago we saw an effort made by the

Minister for Commerce and Industry, an elected man.

He is concerned about the unemployment problem, and



getting  more capital into Singapore. He  therefore

introduced  Bills  in this House for  exemption  of

taxation for companies, pioneer industries.  He  is

working  in  the right direction. I  supported  him

wholeheartedly,  and  I  would  say  that  if   all

Ministers  have the same view, then  Singapore  can

move merrily along the road to prosperity. However,

the  elected Minister for Commerce and Industry  is

not  going to be backed up by another Minister, one

who is responsible to Her Majesty's Government, the

present  Financial Secretary, who is  nominated  by

the  Governor. He is not responsible to the  people

of  Singapore. He is only interested in seeing that

the  Budget is balanced. Whatever happens does  not

matter.  This is his last Budget speech, and  I  am

happy  that  it will be his last. In fact,  I  have

been  observing all these four years,  that  if  it

were  not for the nominated Members in this  House,

the Government would have done a little bit better.

I  quote  a few instances, so that Members in  this



House  may  be more familiar with what is happening

behind the scenes rather than what is presented  in

the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elected Ministers wanted to provide more

amenities  for  the  people.  They  wanted  schools

built.  They wanted many things done. But that  had

to go through the hands of the Financial Secretary.

Sanction  had to be obtained from him. In fact,  in



many  instances, Ministers find that they  have  to

quarrel  with  him in order that  they  might  draw

money  for the welfare of the people. The Financial

Secretary  says  that this is a standstill  Budget,

and  that  he  is carrying out the  policy  of  the

Government  by creating a standstill  Budget.  That

may  very well be so, but I think that when we talk

about  a  standstill  Budget, we  cannot  say  that

everything  is  standing still.  No,  some  of  the

things refuse to stand still. Birth rates refuse to

stand still! Children refuse to stop growing!  They

must grow! People who are in school now cannot stop

in  Form  V  or in the Senior Middle III  and  stop

proceeding to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



get  their  certificate! They must get  ahead!  All

these  things must come, and although it may  be  a

standstill Budget, the important things that cannot

stand  still  must  be provided for.  I  know  many

schools   have   plans  to  start   building.   The

Government have agreed to help them, but with  this

standstill Budget, how are they going to help them?

How  are the plans going to be implemented? I  know

the  elected  Ministers are  willing  to  help  the

people. But I am afraid the Financial Secretary  is

not  of the same frame of mind. I am of the opinion

that the elected Ministers have not got the full co-operation  of nominated Ministers. I think,  if  we

have  always  been  following  the  Federation   of

Malaya,  in  all  things - whether  it  is  finance,

trade,  education or taxation - we should also follow

them  in the matter of changes in the Constitution,

and  that we should ask our appointed officials  to

leave  gracefully before their time, or  we  use  a

little  force and show them the door, even,  before

the  new Constitution comes into play. I am certain

that  it  will receive the support of  the  people.

While  I  attach no blame whatsoever on matters  of



taxation  to the elected Ministers - they  have  done

their  best - I  also feel certain that  the  general

direction they have given to the Minister in charge

of finance has always been backed up by the best of

intentions to assist the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of such assistance can be seen by the

fact  that  the Chief Minister is creating  another

department called the Rural Development Department,

and that the Commissioner is asked to assist in the

neglected   areas   in  the  rural   districts   of

Singapore.  I  certainly  welcome  this  move.  The

Government  have  intended to  improve  roads.  The

Government  have  intended  to  assist  the  people

living  in those areas with better and more  modern

amenities.  That  is  in the right  direction.  The

Government are going to help unemployed people  get

employment through the creation of that department.

That  is only right, and I hope that the people  of



Singapore will come forward and help the Government

in  carrying out that scheme to help themselves.  I

certainly think that more concrete steps like  that

will  help  to  make the people feel  that  elected

Members of this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



are  always thinking about their welfare  and  will

move  in  such a manner as to assist  them  in  the

maximum measures possible.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be very



gratifying,  I am sure, to the public of  Singapore

to  see their elected stalwarts, after having  said

their  little  pieces prepared for the  newspapers,

fading  out one by one from this Assembly  Chamber,

so much so that a few minutes back the stalwarts of

the  Liberal-Socialist Party were no more  in  this

House, and now we see the redoubtable champions  of

the  people, the People's Action Party, no more  in

this  House  to  watch after the  public  interests

against  this "bad" Government. That is the  amount

of  interest they take in the affairs of the people

of Singapore. I wish the public could see the state

of  affairs on the Opposition Benches at this stage

and  on a debate which has an important bearing  on

the public purse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Kampong Kapor this morning

touched  upon  the banning of Chinese textiles.  He

pleaded  that  this ban should be  removed  because

Christmas was coming and the Chinese New  Year  was

coming. In my reply to him previously, Sir, I  gave

him   an   assurance  that  this   ban   would   be

reconsidered towards the end of this month  in  the

light of the circumstances then prevailing and also

in  the  light of the progress which the Federation

Government    is   making   in   its   anti-dumping

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin expressed great happiness

at  the fact that the Government have succeeded  in

cutting  down expenditure. But at the same time  he

criticised   the   Government   for   producing   a

standstill Budget. He said the Government was tired

and  therefore could not produce anything else than

a  standstill  Budget. I cannot see  the  logic  of

these  two  statements.  They  are  conflicting  in

character   because,  if  he  is   happy   at   the

Government's cutting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



down of expenditure, he must also be happy that the

natural  sequence  of  this  action  would   be   a

standstill  Budget. If he wants a  go-ahead  Budget

with   progressive  expenditure,   then   naturally

expenditure would increase and he would not then be

able  to express his happiness at the cutting  down

of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member quoted employment figures for

Singapore's industries and total employment figures

showing a downward trend over the last three years.

Sir,  that  is a fact. I have stated all  along  in



this  House,  even  as recently  as  last  week,  I

believe,  that  we  are proceeding  on  a  downhill

course in our economy, and that there is nothing we

can  do  about it. But, of course, the  reasons  be

cited   were   entirely  different,  blaming   this

Government for not doing anything. His reasons were

entirely  different  from  those  quoted   in   the

newspapers as coming from the Secretary-General  of

his  Party, who bluntly blamed the People's  Action

Party.  But the hon. Member for Tanglin thought  it

fit to blame this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Opposition Members are not aware that

there  has  been  quite  a severe  recession - though

temporary, fortunately for us and for the  rest  of

the  world. Sir, we, who depend on trade and on the

economic  conditions of other countries,  would  be

the  first  to  be  affected by such  a  recession.

Fortunately, as the Financial Secretary has pointed



out  in  his  speech on the Second Reading  of  the

Bill,  the effects of that recession were not  more

severe than they had been; but a recession of  that

nature  is something over which we have no control.

Neither could any other country have any control. I



suggest  that the reason why there is this downward

trend  is  not,  as  the  hon.  Member  has  fondly

suggested,  because  of  the  ineptitude   of   the

Government, but because, as I have often  said  and

as  his  own  Party's Secretary-General  has  often

said, it is due to the extreme left-wing in part of

our  politics.  I  have also to  admit - and  I  have

admitted  it  in  the past - it is also  due  to  the

policy  of the Federation Government in imposing  a

tariff at the Causeway on our industrial goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member complimented me for having

brought  up  the Pioneer Industries  Bill,  but  he

bemoaned  the fact that it is too late.  And  this,

Sir,  is  a  trick -  33 1/3 per  cent  increase  in

company tax. Now from 30 per cent to 40 per cent is

really  a  10 per cent increase, but of course,  if

you put it in a different way, it is 33 1/3 per cent

increase - he is quite correct. That is a very clever

way of putting it for public consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to point out the

contradictory policies of the Government in  having

District  Councils  and  a City  Council.  My  hon.

colleague the Minister for Local Government will be

more competent to talk about it, but I may just  in

passing  refer to one or two points. He asked  what

would  happen if a road - half of which  was  in  the

City  Council  side  and  the  other  half  in  the

District Council side - had to be repaired  and  the

two  bodies did not agree with each other? Sir,  it

is  quite possible that they might agree with  each

other  on  repairing that road, but that point  was

conveniently lost sight of. Usually in this  world,

agreement  is  reached on most points; disagreement

arises  only on a few points. But the disagreements

are  highlighted and therefore they  appear  to  be

big.  But  if one pauses to think of the number  of

things  on  which agreement is reached between  two

parties,  then  I think one will not  take  such  a

pessimistic viewpoint as the Member for Tanglin has

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that merger with the

Federation  would be easy if we had  one  clear-cut

policy  today in the Government. I suggest that  it

is  not because of a lack of a clear-cut policy  by

the  Government, but because of the  fact  that  we

have  too  many political Parties. If we  had  less

political Parties with more clear-cut policies,  we

probably  would  be  nearer to a  merger  with  the

Federation. Perhaps I might amplify this point.  It

is  noticeable now in those circles where the  rich

congregate,  drinking their beers and having  their

fat  lunches,  that  there is a  feeling  that  the

P.A.P. is swinging to the right. Now the P.A.P. has

always  been  recognised as  an  extreme  left-wing

Party. That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



what  I  meant  when I said less political  Parties

with  more  clear-cut policies. One does  not  know

where one stands with certain Parties. If only they

would  declare their stand to a certain section  of

the  public when they go and talk, "Oh", they  will

say,  "the  capitalists are bad. The White  man  is

bad!  This is bad, and that is bad!" Then they come

back  and have their lunch and their beer and their

golf  with another section of the public; and  they

will   say,  "Oh,  we  want  to  encourage  foreign

capital. We will see that capital flourishes",  and

all that sort of thing. One does not know where one

really is. I would suggest that if hon. Members  in

this  House were to decide once and for  all  where

they stood, it would help Singapore a great deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer has a point which

he  is  very  fond of repeating, and  that  is  the

travelling allowance of the Ministers. But before I

come  to that, Sir, there is one other thing  about

his speeches that has struck me. The hon. Member is

sometimes  vehemently opposed  to  colonialism.  He

shouts  this  out in this House in the presence  of

the official Ministers here; but at other times  he

takes  pains  to  defend the  previous  Government,

which was a colonial government. So one really does

not  know whom he champions - the people's Government

or the colonial Government. He says this Government

have  inherited certain reserves from the  previous

Government  and we are ruining the economy  of  the

country. He says the elected Government is  bad  as

compared to the previous colonial Government. He is

welcome to that comparison. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says, "Look at Hongkong and Borneo! They

have  a  lower rate of taxation." We need not  have

any  taxation at all if we do not want to,  but  we

must have it in order to survive, and also in order

to  provide the social services which the  previous

Government  did not provide. Does the  hon.  Member

want  the  people  of Singapore to  live  like  the

people  of  Hongkong  do  in  some  parts  of  that

territory - in slum areas? If he, who is the  elected

representative of the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



would  advocate that the people of Singapore should

live in slums like animals, just as they do in some

parts  of Hongkong, then it is up to the people  to

reform  their opinion as to whether he is  suitable

to represent them or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also asks, "Why do we not cut

down  the salaries of the civil service?" Sir,  the

high  salary structure of the civil service - I admit

it  is  top-heavy - was  not fixed  by  us.  We  have

inherited  this salary structure from the  previous

colonial Government in whose Legislative Council he

had  been  a  Member for at least two terms  before

this Assembly came into being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is always convenient to quote figures

showing  that the Government have spent so much  of

the   reserves,  that  these  reserves  have   been

reduced, that the Government have raised taxes  and

put  Singapore in a very bad economic  position.  I

would like to refer hon. Members to cols. 1064  and

1065  of the Hansard of 3rd December, 1958, namely,

the  speech  given by the Financial  Secretary,  in

which  it  is  clearly shown where the money  went.

Social  Services  expenditure  in  1954  was   $197



million;   in  1959  it  will  be  $264  million - an

increase  of  35  per cent. Here is the  breakdown:

Education in 1954 cost $30 million; in 1959 it will

cost   $63  million - more  than  double.   How   the

Government  have been spending money on  education!

The total school population has increased by 66 per

cent during the last three years - from 1955 to 1958.

The  Government have got to find the money, but the



money  cannot  be found by the waving  of  a  magic

wand.  Then  the expenditure on Medical and  Health

will  have  risen from $20 million in 1954  to  $34

million in 1959 - approximately 70 per cent increase.

The expenditure on Social Welfare will rise from $7



million  to $11 million - 60 per cent increase.  $223

million has been spent on development, out of which

$56 million went on housing - the provision of houses

for the poor people. All these figures are given in

the  Financial Secretary's speech, but hon. Members

on the opposite side have probably gummed those two

pages up so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



that  they could not see those figures. $85 million

went on other public works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one hon. Member was talking about 1,000

houses having been produced and so on. The fact  is

that  out  of a total of 20,000 S.I.T. houses  that

have  now  been erected, 9,000 units and 300  shops

have  been erected in the last three years,  during

the  life  of  this Government. The S.I.T. started

building on a small scale pre-war. After the war - I

think  since 1948 or 1949 - 50 per cent of the houses

that  have been built have been built in  the  last

three  years,  the  other 50 per cent  having  been

built in the preceding 7 or 8 years. All this costs

money.  On top of that, half the rentals  of  these

houses are subsidised by the Government. This is to

help the poorer section of the population. All that

costs  money,  and  it is no use  saying  that  the

Government   have   increased  taxation.   Who   is

suffering  as a result of this increased  taxation?

It  is  not  the poor man. The man who earns  about

$10,000 a year or more pays a little more in income

tax.  Can  any  hon.  Member on the  opposite  side

suggest, by any stretch of the imagination, that he

is  a  poor man who earns $10,000 a year, or nearly

$1,000  a  month?  These are facts,  Sir,  but,  of

course, hon. Members on the Opposition Benches  are

quite   capable  of  hiding  the  facts  in   their

presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the vexed question posed by the

Member   for  Telok  Ayer  of  travelling  by   the

Ministers. I have a suspicious feeling, Sir,  that,

since  I  was  the last Minister to have  travelled

this  year,  I might have to justify my travelling.

The  Colombo  Plan Conference is  a  conference  of



Ministers  of  countries. There are 18 full-fledged

countries  and  three who are not - ourselves,  North

Borneo  and  Sarawak - we  are  part  of  the  United

Kingdom delegation. It is customary, Sir, that  all

the  countries send Ministers to these conferences.

The  importance of these conferences lies not  only



in the discussions held at the meetings but also in

the  fact  that  an opportunity is  given  far  the

Ministers  present  to  meet  one  another  and  to

discuss in private various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



things, and it has happened many times that  a  lot

of   things   have  come  out  of   these   private

discussions.   Sir,  it  has  been  customary   for

Singapore  to  send a Minister to the Colombo  Plan

Conference  and to other international  conferences

like  that. The hon. Member himself went many times

as  a Member of the previous Legislative Council at

the   taxpayers'   expense,  though   he   had   no

ministerial responsibilities to the public, but  he

had  not seen fit at those times to think about the

taxpayers' money or to criticise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer also raised the

question of handicraft industries. He cited  Burma,

Indonesia,   Pakistan   and   Ceylon   as    having

handicrafts.  He forgot one thing, Sir.  Handicraft

is  a by-product industry of certain waste products

which  a  country may have. In fact, most of  these

countries   have  a  varied  type  of  agricultural

production, and out of this agricultural production

you get a lot of waste materials which are utilised

in  handicrafts.  We  have none  and  therefore  we

cannot have a big scale handicraft industry as such

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru talked about the

restriction on imports of cement from China. Let me

assure him, Sir, that there is no such restriction.

The  only  thing is that we issue specific licences



for  import  of cement from China but there  is  no

restriction on the issue of such licences. They are

issued  freely.  Sir, I cannot  understand  why  he

should  say  that  there is a  restriction  on  the

import of cement from China. There is none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he chided the elected Government for

investing 25 per cent of the Central Provident Fund

money overseas.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Is it not true?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> He is well aware, Sir, that

Provident  Fund investments are controlled  by  the

Board  of the Provident Fund, and the Board act  as

trustees  for the public whose monies are  held  by

the  Provident Fund, and as trustees  they  have  a

legal  duty  to  see  that  the  funds  are  safely

invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member started shouting about

merger.  He said the way the Government  was  going

about it was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



dignified.  And then he climaxed his criticisms  on

merger  by asking: "Why should we talk of  merger?"

Yet,  Sir, I have on many occasions heard his Party

Secretary saying that the Party line is merger with

the  Federation. In fact, only last week, I  think,

the  newspapers carried the Liberal-Socialist Party

line  on merger, but the hon. Member does not  seem

to toe the Party line. He asks, "Why should we talk

of merger with the Federation?" Those, Sir, are the

inconsistencies of hon. Members -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Independence!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - who, after delivering their

speeches nicely written out for public consumption,

fade  away from this Assembly Chamber and  have  no

more interest in the proceedings.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few of the

Opposition Members have seen fit to allege that the

Government have done nothing during the  past  3�

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to submit that the Coalition

Government during its term of office have made  far

more  progress  in almost all directions  than  any

other administration in Singapore has been able  to

make, despite attempts by certain political Parties

to   disrupt   the   progress  of   the   Coalition

Government. Sir, ours is a record of which  we  are

proud  to present at any place and at any time.  It

will  be  written  in gold in  the  annals  of  the

history of the elected Governments of the people of

Singapore.   We   have   repeatedly   refuted   the

distortion  of our records and I am glad  that  the

people  have now begun to realise the truth of  the

matter,  the honesty and sincerity of our Ministers

and  the Government in the discharge of our  duties

and responsibilities to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one hon. Member stated that this Budget

appears  to  be  a "tired" Government's  Budget  in

which  there  is no plan and no programme.  Sir,  I

completely  disagree with this  statement.  On  the

other  hand, I believe that this year's Budget  was

deliberately made a standstill Budget for the  main

reason that the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



Government should be left to review the  Budget  in

the  light of its own policies. Sir, I will  assure

the  hon. Member and this House that when  we  form

the new fully elected government next year, we will

revise this Budget and amend it in conformity  with

the  new  economic, social and dynamic policies  of

the new Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget before this House is in no way a

"tired"   Government's  Budget.  Our  new  policies

cannot  be revealed at the moment. They are  secret

and  they  will be presented to the people  in  our

manifesto in the coming general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Mason has stated in this

Assembly  that  the  increase in  company  tax  and

income  tax  is  causing hardship to companies  and

individuals.  I  believe  this  increase  is  fully

justified and I am convinced that it will not be  a

burden on the companies and individuals. Sir, in  a

democracy,  everyone who is able  to  pay  adequate

taxes  must  pay to the government for the  welfare

and  happiness of the people. I do hope, Sir,  that

the  companies  and individuals will  change  their

outlook  and have a national outlook in our  future

economy.  May  I also hope that the  companies  and

individuals  accept these increases  cheerfully  in

the interest of the people?



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir. Before dealing with the

speeches  of hon. Members, there are a few  general

remarks which I would like to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, nobody, with the

possible exception of the Member for Tanjong Pagar,

has  said  anything  about the fact  that  we  have

virtually balanced the Budget and have handed  over

a  financial position which is sound and completely

under control. I am sorry to labour the point, Sir,

but  I  think  that if one remembers the  pressures

under which the Government has worked and the  vast

amount  which  it has achieved, then  one  realises

that  this  balancing  of  the  Budget  is  a  very

considerable achievement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second place, Sir, while everybody with

perhaps one exception has complained bitterly about

the  increase in taxation and had made  some  quite

astonishing  statements about the  consequences  of

the  measures  which we have introduced,  only  one

hon.  Member has suggested what we should do as  an

alternative  for  the  purpose  of  balancing   the

Budget.  This is very strange, Sir, for  I  imagine

that  all  hon. Members who have spoken  appreciate

the  virtues  of making revenue balance expenditure

and of cutting one's coat according to one's cloth.

Am  I to take it, Sir, that prudent businessmen who



have  spoken and who presumably have some sense  of

responsibility  for the Colony's finances - otherwise

they  would  not  be  sitting  where  they  are - are

prepared  to face a deficit of $20 million  in  the

present circumstances with equanimity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the hon. Members, Sir, who spoke referred

to  the  new measures of taxation which  have  been

introduced and I shall endeavour to reply  to  them

at  the  risk  of being repetitive. In replying  to

this  debate, I shall have to repeat  most  of  the

points   that   I  shall  have  to   mention   when

introducing the Bill and the motion standing in  my

name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Mason, Sir, criticised the increase

in  income tax and company tax in very strong terms

indeed.   He   did  not,  of  course,   offer   any

alternative  to  the balancing of  the  Budget.  He

stigmatized   the  increase  in  company   tax   as

downright  silly  and  calculated  to  thrust   the

convalescent body of Singapore business  back  into

its  bed  of sickness. This, of course, is absolute

nonsense.  We  are confident that even  in  present

circumstances  Singapore  business  can  bear  this

impost, still expand and still make its profits. We

would  not have imposed the increase in tax  if  we

had  not been confident of that. Incidentally, Sir,

I  regard the hon. Member's veiled suggestion  that

we  should take advantage of the Federation  having

raised company tax to keep ours at a lower rate  as

most  reprehensible, as I did the other  suggestion

that the Federation might take advantage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



of  our  higher rate of individual tax in the  same

way.  Does the hon. Member not realise that we have

the   closest   possible  consultation   with   the

Federation in these matters?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also some wild statements about the

dangers of having different rates of individual tax

in   Singapore:  the  administrative  inconvenience

would  be appalling; taxpayers would arrange  their

incomes  so  as  to  avoid tax; salaried  employees

would  leave Singapore for the Federation,  and  so

on.  These statements merely indicate a fundamental

ignorance  of  income  tax administration.  As  the

present  basis  of assessment and  collection  will

remain  as it is, there is no question of taxpayers

moving  their  sources  of  income  to  suit  their

convenience.  The  only  criticism  which  can   be

levelled is that some taxpayers might be tempted to

change  residence,  but I honestly  doubt  if  this

criticism is very realistic. The difference of rate

has to be very wide to cause this to take place and

those  who  make the change must be satisfied  that

the   differential  is  likely  to  exist   for   a

sufficiently   long  time  to   make   the   change

worthwhile. Only the very large taxpayers would  be

likely  to consider such a move and there are  many

aspects  of  the matter which they  would  wish  to

consider with great care before making a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew spoke of the

very  high rate of personal income tax in Singapore

and  drew  comparison with Hongkong.  I  must  say,

however, as I will show when introducing the  Bill,

that our rates are still low compared with those of

other   countries.  Hongkong,  of  course,  is   an

exception  and I think that we would all wish  that

the  economic  conditions which exist  in  Hongkong

could  be duplicated in Singapore. The hon.  Member

was,  of course, incorrect in saying that we raised

income  tax  last  year. The last increase  was  in

1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must argue with the hon. Member when he called

the  increase in company tax crushing.  As  I  will

show  when  introducing the Bill we  still  have  a

considerable  margin  of  advantage  compared  with

other countries. Nor can I agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



that   the  new  taxes  weigh  penally  either   on

individuals   or   companies.  I   appreciate   his

suggestion  about welfare lotteries and  a  tax  on

bookmakers.  I personally would welcome  a  welfare

lottery,   preferably  in  conjunction   with   the

Federation of Malaya, because I think in  that  way

we  might  extract the maximum financial advantage,

but   I   think  that  he  has  rather  tended   to

overestimate the yield. A tax on bookmakers  raises

very difficult problems indeed, and the yield would

not be great.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Queenstown spoke about the

increase  in  income  tax  causing  a  movement  of

officers into the Federation, but I think  that  he

must  have gained a wrong impression of the  effect

of the new rates. I will explain this later when  I

move a motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar accused us of

running  down  our  reserves. In the  first  place,

these reserves were largely accumulated as a result

of  the  Korean war boom and the inability  of  the

Government  to spend all it wished. Over  the  past

four  years  we have spent exactly $140-million  of

these  reserves.  In  doing  so,  we  have  avoided

increasing the public debt and interest in  Sinking

Fund charges. We have let the loan market free  for

the  City Council and enabled it to do a very great

deal  of  development  in the  field  of  essential

public  utilities. In addition,  we  have  achieved

what I regard as a monumental amount of development

on  our  own account in social and other  services.

Despite  all that we have done, we have managed  to



hand  over a sound financial position with adequate

reserves.  What would he have had us  do?  Let  the

reserves  accumulate and do nothing for the  people

of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also spoke in strong terms about the folly in

increasing company tax at this juncture, and  asked

us why we had not raised it earlier. We only regret

the  necessity in doing it at the present time, but

it is not folly, far from it. We are satisfied that

the  increase can be absorbed even at  the  present

time. As regards the question of why we have not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



raised the question of company tax later, that is a

matter  which  I will go into when I introduce  the

Bill dealing with the increased rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards individual rates, I can assure the

hon.  Member that we would not have raised them  by

the  small amount that we have done if we  had  not

been  quite  certain that it could be done  without

loss  of  revenue or loss of taxpayers and  without

danger to the Pan-Malayan approach to income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Rural Development Vote, what is

more  of the very nature of rural development  than

the  construction of kampong roads and drains? That

is  what the Rural Development Vote is being  spent

on at the present time. Does he think that this can

be  done without labour? Does he suggest that there

should be no unemployment relief?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may say so, my friend the hon. Member for

Tanglin   spoiled  what  I  thought  was  a   quite

excellent speech by referring to the Budget as that

of  a tired government. That, of course, is not the

case.  We have cut our coat according to our cloth,

and   avoided  cutting  patterns  for  non-existing

cloth.  It  is difficult to be imaginative  without

funds,  and  the  general impression  one  gets  in

today's  debate  is that funds are the  last  thing

which  hon.  Members would be prepared to  provide.

The  question  of  selling fiats is  not  quite  as



simple as he would have us believe, but it is being

looked   into  by  the  Government.  I   was   most

interested   to   hear  his   proposals   for   the

rationalization of administration of Singapore, and

I  hope  he  will develop his arguments further  at

another time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards flood alleviation, we are pressing

ahead  as  fast as funds will allow.  Part  of  the

troubles of which he is aware is caused by  housing

development.  The passenger transit  phase  at  the

Airport has not been shelved. It is the third phase

of   a  planned  development  of  the  Airport.   I

appreciate what he says about cultural affairs  but

I  think the amount provided will be sufficient for

all practical purposes in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi asked a string of

questions which I doubt if I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



have sufficient time to answer in full. I must deny

his  statement that in my Budget speech I attempted

to  glorify the colonial Government at the  expense

of the elected Government. Nothing was further from

my  thoughts.  I  merely  stated  facts  about  the

position  as  regards  the  long-term  loan  market

which,  as  everybody will admit, is  as  much  the

result of world conditions as local conditions. The

market  conditions  for a floatation  of  long-term

loans   have  changed  very  greatly,  particularly

during  the last four years. People are  no  longer

attracted by long-term low interest-bearing  loans.

Emphasis  is  on short-term loans. As  regards  the



lack  of  confidence, there is  always  a  lack  of

confidence at the time of political change. That is

inevitable. It has been aggravated at this time  by

the vehemence of certain political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to have said so little about

industrialisation. It was merely because I did  not

wish  to steal the Minister's thunder by taking  up

too  much  time. I was astonished to hear the  hon.

Member's  statement to the effect that wage-earners

were  affected  by  the increase  in  the  rate  of

individual income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must thank my friend the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer  for his kind words about the Budget.  I  must

point  out, however, that this Budget was  prepared

by  the Chief Minister and all the other Ministers.

The  figures  which deal with the reserve  position



are  correct.  I do not question them.  But  he  is

quite  wrong when he said that we have  ruined  the

economy. The figures certainly do not suggest  that

at all. They merely point out that we have balanced

income  and expenditure and have done a very  great

deal  of development work, and yet are left with  a

sound position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of population is not a new problem, as

he   says,  but  it  is  a  problem  which  becomes

progressively more acute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax rates are not so high as to discourage

investors.  It is wrong to say that we are  driving

away   capital.  On  the  contrary,  We  are  doing

everything we can to attract it. As long as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



company  rates  are  the  same  as  those  of   the

Federation, there will be no migration of companies

to  the Federation on that account. The increase in

petrol  duty  in  the  past  has  long  since  been

absorbed  without  any  difficulty.  There  is   no

hardship, as I will point out in due course, in the

new  cigarette duty. I wish somebody would  explain

to  me  how  we  can  cut  down  in  administrative

expenses.  For  four years now I  have  heard  hon.

Members  of  the Opposition say these must  be  cut

down,  but  never on one occasion have  I  had  any

concrete suggestion as to how that might be done. I

think  we have done everything we possibly  can  to

reduce administrative expenses to the minimum.  The

hon.  Member  has much to say about  administrative

salaries  and about the monies spent in  travelling

and  on  entertainment. I must say, Sir,  that  the

amounts  of  money spent under these  headings  are

absolutely insignificant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt already with the question which he

raised  in connection with the floatation of loans.

We  feel confident that the Central Provident  Fund



will support any Government loans in the future. He

has  suggested  that we might invest  the  currency

funds  locally.  I think a certain  amount  can  be

invested locally, but it must be remembered that it

is absolutely essential to keep the backing for the

currency  liquid, available at all  times.  In  the

absence of a local loan market, it is impossible to

invest locally and keep the fund liquid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate what the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru

has  said about the entrepot trade. I think it will

be generally agreed that we have done everything we

possibly  can to maintain the free port  status  of

Singapore  and  to  encourage the  entrepot  trade.

However,  I  cannot agree with him that  we  should



follow an independent trade policy. As I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



said  on  a  number of occasions, it is  absolutely

essential  that  we form a common  economic  policy

with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must confess, Sir, that I have never

heard so much unadulterated rubbish as I have heard

from the hon. Member for Serangoon this afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon, the

Financial  Minister  must know that  "unadulterated

rubbish"   in  reference  to  an  hon.  Member   is

unparliamentary, and I ask him to withdraw it.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have  His Excellency's authority to move the Second

Reading of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is a very simple one. Its object is to

increase the rate of tax on the chargeable  incomes

of  companies from 30 per cent to 40 per  cent,  to

enable companies to deduct tax at the new rate from

dividends  paid to shareholders, and to enable  the

new  rate to be levied on the chargeable income  of

non-resident individuals, trustees (other than  the

trustees  of incapacitated persons) and  executors,

and  on  the interest on debentures, mortgages  and

loans  paid to non-residents. To this end, sections

43,  44  and  45  of the Income Tax  Ordinance  are

amended in the manner indicated in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to increase the rate of tax on the

chargeable incomes of companies has not been  taken

lightly or without careful consideration of all the

implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been of the opinion for some

time  that  the  rate  of tax  could  be  increased

substantially.  It  has  been  supported  in   this

opinion by its Economic Advisers who have both held

the  view  that  the  rate could  be  substantially

increased without doing harm either to the  general

economy  of Singapore or to the companies affected.

It  has  been  supported by an examination  of  the



results  achieved  by companies  operating  locally

over  a period of years, which, by and large,  have

been  extremely  good. It has been supported  by  a

comparison of the company rate in Malaya  with  the

rates  applied  to  companies  operating  in  other

countries. It has been supported by the  fact  that

leaders of the business community have from time to

time privately expressed the view that company  tax

could stand some increase without causing very much

harm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government has so far been unwilling to

take  action to raise the rate of tax because other

sources of revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



still  remain  to be tapped; because  the  pressing

need  for  more  revenue which  would  justify  the

imposition   could  not  be  clearly  demonstrated;

because,  in this more than in any other sphere  of

direct  taxation, common action with the Federation

was  essential; because we wished to do  everything

possible to attract investment capital and  because

we  feared that an increase in the rate of  company

tax,   in   the  absence  of  any  counterbalancing

legislation  such as Pioneer Industry  legislation,

might inhibit investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the matter has been precipitated by the

need for more revenue to meet the cost of essential

services  like police, defence, education, medical,

health, and communications, without which companies

could not exist, far less make profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for increased revenue has been clearly

demonstrated and the point need not be  elaborated.

Similarly,  I  think  it  has  also  been   clearly



demonstrated that Government expenditure  has  been

cut  to  the bone and that provision has only  been

made  for what is generally agreed to be essential.

I  mention this because, in the past, any  increase



in  direct, or indeed in any, taxation has met with

a   storm   of  protest  against  the   waste   and

extravagance   of   Government   expenditure,   the

argument being that no increased taxation would  be

necessary  if  Government  would  only  limit   its

expenditure to what was essential. The argument  is

no  longer valid - if indeed it ever were valid.  All

other  sources  of  revenue  within  the  customary

pattern  of  taxation have been  exhausted.  Direct

taxation under the Income Tax Ordinance is the main

source  remaining. Of the sources in the  field  of

direct taxation, company tax is the most productive

and  likely  to give the greatest yields  over  the

longest  period.  The Government has  therefore  no

option but to avail itself of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, the Government regrets

that  it  has to introduce this measure at  a  time

when the economy is in process of throwing off  the

effects  of  a  recession. It would naturally  have

preferred  to delay introduction until the  economy

was back in full stride as it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



were.  This, however, has not proved possible.  The

need for revenue outweighs other considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it must be pointed out that the

effects  of the increase will certainly not  be  as

disastrous  to the economy as some of  the  critics

who  have  ventilated  their views  would  have  us

believe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase is from 30 per cent to 40 per cent

and it is generally accepted that 30 per cent is  a

very  low  figure. Neither the increase itself  nor

the  new  rate  can  be called crippling,  as  some

critics  have termed it, and I confidently  believe

that  companies operating in Singapore will be able

to absorb the increase without undue difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of 40 per cent still maintains a

fairly substantial favourable margin compared  with

the  rates in other countries from which one  might

expect  to attract investment capital. For example,

in  the United States, companies are charged  at  a

graduated rate which varies from 42 per cent to  52

per  cent. In Canada, 18 per cent is charged on the

first $25,000 of profit and 45 per cent on anything

in  excess  of $25,000. In the United Kingdom,  the

standard rate is 42� per cent plus a profits  tax

of 10 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the new rate compares very favourably

with  that  in most of the countries in Asia  which

can be regarded as competing with us for investment

capital. For example, the standard rate in India is

30  per  cent with a surcharge of 30 per  cent.  In

Ceylon the standard rate is 45 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these considerations, I doubt very

much  whether the increase in rate will  act  as  a

special disincentive to investment capital. In  the

first  place, capital looks mainly to questions  of

"yield".  It asks itself whether the prospects  are

sufficiently good to justify investment.  Will  the

investment be safe enough? Will it yield enough  to

meet  all expenses, including tax, and yet  make  a

larger  profit  than  it would make  elsewhere?  If

these  criteria are applied to the past, the answer

must be a spontaneous, unanimous and overwhelming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



affirmative.  There  is  perhaps  more  uncertainty

about  the  future.  That  is  inevitable  in   the

circumstances, as I have said in other connections.

But  I am sufficiently confident in the common  and



commercial  sense  of the people of  Singapore  and

their elected representatives to believe that  they

will  do  nothing  to  destroy  but  everything  to

improve the climate for investment. In short,  once

the  political  picture clarifies itself,  I  think

that  the  prospects for investment in  the  future

will  be  such  that  it will  take  more  than  an

increase of 30 per cent to 40 per cent in the  rate

of company tax to deter investment capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these considerations, however, the

Government is in process of introducing legislation

which  will  give tax concessions to new industries

and   to  existing  industries  which  inject   new

capital. As far as such undertakings are concerned,

these    measures   should   counter-balance    any

detrimental  effects which might conceivably  arise

as  a result of the increase in the rate of company

tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate of tax applicable to

executors and trustees will not involve the  degree

of hardship which appears at first sight. Executors

are  entitled to claim relief at the increased rate

of  40 per cent in respect of all distributions  to

beneficiaries  which are made within  a  prescribed

period, with the result that beneficiaries resident

in  Malaya are likely to receive the same amount of

income as they could have received if the rate  had

not   been  increased.  So  far  as  trustees   are

concerned, they distribute the income of the  trust

under  deduction of tax and beneficiaries are  able

to  claim repayment or a set-off, as in the case of

company  dividends, in respect of the 40  per  cent

tax deducted from what they receive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to non-residents, it is

administratively desirable that the rate should  be

the same as that at which companies deduct tax from

dividends. The great majority of non-residents  who

derive income from Singapore do so in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



form of company dividends: if the non-resident rate

were greater than the rate at which tax is deducted

from  dividends it would be impossible  to  collect

the difference from non-residents: if the rate were

lower,  every  non-resident would automatically  be

entitled  to  claim  relief  in  respect   of   the

difference  between the non-resident rate  and  the

rate  at  which  tax  has been  deducted  from  his

dividends,  and a substantial amount of  additional

work  would be thrown on the Income Tax Department.

Bearing in mind that most non-residents either have



a  title  to  claim a proportion  of  the  personal

reliefs  and the graduated rates of tax  under  the

provisions   of  section  40  of  the  income   Tax

Ordinance,  or  are  resident in territories  which

give  to their residents double taxation relief  in

respect  of income which is taxed both in Singapore

and in the territory of residence, the increase  in

the  rate  to  40  per  cent will  add  little,  if

anything, to their existing tax bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much has been

said about the increase of income tax in the Budget

speeches,  and I will therefore be very  brief.  As

you  will see, Government expenditure has increased

by leaps and bounds. That is why taxation has to be

increased  to  meet the increase in expenditure.  I

quote, Sir, from page 13 of the Draft Estimates. In

1954,  the  expenditure was about $249 million;  in

1955,  when  there  was  a  trade  recession,   the

expenditure was about $198 million; but in 1956, it

was  $222  million; in 1957, it was  $238  million;

and,  for  the  present, the  expenditure  is  $265

million.  The  Financial Secretary might  say  that

this  is inevitable. At this stage, I am not  going

to oppose such an increase, since the doers of this

wrong  act will be staying in office for only three

more  months. The new Government will, I  am  sure,

reduce  not  only income tax, but also the  tax  on

petrol, tobacco and some other items.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Financial Secretary has said that nobody

has  given  any concrete suggestions as to  how  to

reduce  the  deficit  in the Budget.  I  think  the

Government has been told every year to cut down the

administrative  costs. I have said it  every  year.

You  might  ask  how? Sir, I have  said  that  non-Singaporean officers - may I use the words expatriate

officers', who are not Singaporeans, Sir? Will  you

allow that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> In the past, expatriate officers

had  been  drawing high salaries, and  rightly  so,

because  they had to run one house in Singapore  or

in  Malaya,  and one house in England or  India  or

Ceylon,  or  wherever it may be, and the  cost  was

therefore  very high. But this should  not  be  the

case  as  and  when these officers are replaced  by

local  men,  including the Ministers.  I  will  say

this: that, as far as the lower-grade officers  are

concerned,  they  should  be  properly  paid.  They

should  not  be made to suffer. But  do  the  local

officers  in  the higher grades really require  the

same  level  of  salary  scale  as  the  expatriate

officers?  They were able to live on  a  salary  of

$200  or $500 or $600 before. Why should they  want

to  live  now on a salary of $1,500 or $2,500?  The

Government should therefore cut down the salary  of

these officers, and not make the taxpayers bear the

increased   cost   of  Government  expenditure   by

imposing higher taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got very little to add, for this

Government,  or these people who form  the  present

Government,  will  not see this House  again.  They

will  not be elected and put to office in the  next

elections.  Therefore,  they  will  not  be  in   a

position to increase taxation.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

oppose  this  motion.  As  I  have  mentioned  this

morning,  the  present  Government  is  in  a  very

peculiar  position  in  that  it  has  a  nominated

Minister  for Finance to present the Budget,  which

is  an  anti-climax. Also, it has been admitted  by

the mover of this motion, that it is not opportune



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



at  this  juncture to increase the rate  of  income

tax.  What I would like to emphasize, Sir, is  that

our  economic stability is not only affected by the

present  world  trade recession,  but  it  is  also

affected  by  our economic policy. We do  not  know

what  the  Government's economic policy is  at  the

present  time.  Is it Pan-Malayan? Has  Singapore's

economic policy of increased taxation followed  the

Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has said that he is

confident that, with this increase in taxation,  he

can expect an increase in revenue. Sir, you may  be

right  if  you  say that to, say, a primary  school

student. One plus one is two. When you increase the

rate  of taxation, you can expect a bigger revenue.

But  there  is  also another method of computation.



Two plus zero is also equal to two. Therefore, Sir,



if you now increase the rate of company tax, do you

expect  to  attract investors to this  country?  Of

course not! If you cannot attract investors to this

country, how do you ever expect to have any company

making  a  profit to pay tax and thus increase  the

Government's revenue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can quote an editorial comment in the

Nanyang  Siang  Pau  on this Budget.  The  Editor

viewed   with   mixed  feelings  the   Government's

proposal  to  increase the rate of  taxation.  This

Government - by   which   I   mean   the    Financial

Secretary - is  not  facing  realities.  It  is   not

adopting a practical approach in the preparation of

this  Budget. You know very well that  business  is

very  bad and yet you expect to be able to tax  the

profits  of  a  company. It is just like  borrowing

money  from a beggar. You know he is a beggar,  and

yet you expect to borrow money from him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

should remember that he is addressing the Chair.  I

am not the Financial Secretary or the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir. I think there are

many  ways  of increasing our revenue to  meet  our

financial   commitments,  other  than  the   simple

process  of passing a Bill to increase the rate  of

taxation. Maybe I am not qualified to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



predict  that in 1959 the Government  will  not  be

able  to  collect the $55 million in  tax,  as  was

envisaged by the Financial Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Sir, from the businessmen to the men-in-the-street - taxi drivers, trishaw riders, workers

in the factories - when you ask them about the future

of  this  country, you will be surprised  with  the

answers.  They all give the same answer, "No  good.

The  future  is no good. Business is no good."  The



people  generally  have  lost  confidence  in   the

future.  Why? Why does the Financial Secretary  not

find out the fundamental cause of the trouble which

has  brought about the economic instability in this

country, and then find a solution to the problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Opposition Members

only  know how to criticize the Government but  are

never   able   to  put  forward  any   constructive

suggestions.  I  would  like  to  put  forward  two

suggestions  as  solutions to  our  economic  ills.

Either one of them will help to solve our problems.



One  is the well-known formula - let Singapore  merge



with  the  Federation  of Malaya  immediately.  The

other formula may be new, Sir, but it is already so

commonly  discussed in the coffee-shops and  market

places. It is that it is time for Singapore to have

its  own  independent economic policy to  safeguard

its  rice  bowl.  All  say  that  it  is  time  for

Singapore to think of a way to make its own living.

Political  leaders  may  continue  dreaming  of   a



political  merger or marriage with the  Federation,

and  believe  in  the sincerity  of  a  Pan-Malayan

economic unit, Sir, but I do not think that the man-in-the-street believe in it. The picture is  clear.

I  am  sorry  to  have  to  quote  one  Legislative



Councillor in the Federation Government who  asked,

"Why  should we lose $20 million a year by  selling

Federation fish to let Singapore fishmongers make a

profit?"  And  this Legislative Councillor  shouted

loudly,  "Why  should  we let  Singapore  pineapple

canners  benefit to the tune of millions of dollars

by canning our pineapple?" Sir, all these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



things  should be sufficient for us  to  take  deep

thoughts.  What made such a responsible Legislative

Council Member on the opposite side of the Causeway

regard Singapore as neither a prodigal child nor  a

deserted brother?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly oppose the Bill, not because in

principle  we should not tax the rich.  I  for  one

think  that  if  we can pass a sort of  super-tax - a

person whose income is more than $20,000 a year can

be  taxed  90 per cent, because the average  living

standard  of Singapore is $10,000 a year - I  do  not

think  everybody will grumble, but not a tax  on  a

common  clerk who is earning about $400 or  $500  a

month.  He  has  got to pay more tax  in  order  to

contribute to what, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member is

forgetting that we are on the Income Tax (Amendment

No.  2) Bill. We have not come to the motion  about

personal tax yet. We are on the companies still.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, in conclusion, I wish to

make my point clear. I oppose this increase of  tax

but not on principle. At this juncture for the Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



the  Financial  Secretary, knowing full  well  that

times  are  hard, a recession is on, the  political

situation  is  unstable and the  situation  is  not

under control, to introduce this Bill with the  co-operation of the present Government Benchers  seems

somewhat  fishy, and it all the snore convinces  me

that  it  will  pave  the way for  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar to become the next Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this motion is to give effect

to  the proposals for the change in the rate of tax

on  the  chargeable incomes of resident individuals

which I outlined on the 3rd of December



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, the new scale provides for alterations

in  the  "platform" or "slabs" of chargeable income

and  for  different  rates of tax  on  the  various

slabs. The changes can best be seen by a comparison

of  the old*  and new+ scales which have been in the

hands of hon. Members since 3rd December.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What perhaps is more important from the point of

view  of hon. Members is the increase in the amount

of  tax  on  chargeable incomes at  various  levels

which  results from the new scale. Here again  this

can  best  be  seen  from the schedule+  which  was

supplied to hon. Members on the same day.  It  will

be   seen   from   the  schedule  that   chargeable

incomes - that  is incomes after all allowances  have

been deducted - of under $4,000 attract no additional

tax.  At  $5,000 the increase is $20;  at  $10,000,

$150;  at  $15,000,  $300;  at  $20,000,  $550;  at

$25,000,  $800;  at  $30,000, $1,300;  at  $40,000,

$2,550; and at $50,000, $3,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another table++ which I think has been in the

hands  of  hon. Members - if it has not been,  I  can

supply  them with copies - shows what is  called  the

effective  rate  of  tax  at  the  new  rates.  The

effective  rate of tax is the percentage which  the

tax  which  a taxpayer actually pays bears  to  his

assessable  income. These figures have  been  given

for  single men, married men, married men with  two

of a family, but it should be noted that allowances

other than personal and children's allowances  have

been  excluded.  This table shows that  for  single

men,  the  effective rate of tax on  an  assessable

income  of $5,000 is 2.1 per cent; on $10,000,  5.9

per  cent;  on $15,000, 9.4 per cent;  on  $20,000,

12.3  per  cent;  on  $30,000, 16.8  per  cent;  on

$40,000,  20.6 per cent; and on $50,000.  24.5  per

cent.  I  would  like  Members  to  pay  particular

attention  to these percentages. For a married  man

with  two  children,  the effective  rates  are  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$10,000 - 2.3 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20,000 - 8.6 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$30,000 - 13.8 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$40,000 - 19.6 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$50,000 - 21.9 per cent.

</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the matter into its proper perspective,

one  must compare these rates with those applicable

to  a  married  man  with  two  children  in  other

countries. For example, in the United Kingdom,  the

effective rates are as follows:



<div align="center">

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$10,000 - 11.9 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20,000 - 22.6 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$30,000 - 30.3 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$40,000 - 36.3 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$50,000 - 41.5 per cent.

</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effective rates in the U.S.A. range from 3.7

per  cent on incomes equivalent to M$10,000 to 26.1

per  cent  on  M$50,000; the  equivalent  rates  in

Australia  range  from 10.3 per cent  to  39.1  per

cent; in New Zealand from 5.1 per cent to 37.9  per

cent; in India from 6.8 per cent to 20.7 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equivalent rates prevailing in Ghana, Canada

and  South Africa are very similar to the  proposed

new rates for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ceylon the effective rates are as follows:



<div align="center">

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$10,000 - 8.6 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$20,000 - 20.0 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$30,000 - 20.5 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$40,000 - 34.0 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M$50,000 - 38.0 per cent.

</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be appreciated from the information which

I  have  given  that the taxpayer in  Singapore  is

still relatively well off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact, having regard to the standard

of  living  in Singapore, I have little doubt  that

the  taxpayers  who will be affected  can  shoulder

these  increases  without any hardship  whatsoever.

Nothing  will  make me believe that a  man  who  is



earning  $15,000 cannot pay an additional  $150  in

tax,  or  that a man who is earning $25,000  cannot

pay an extra $550 in tax and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the mildness of the additional burden

placed  on taxpayers, these measures have certainly

given rise to a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



amount   of  criticism.  That,  I  am  afraid,   is

inevitable. Perhaps, I may be allowed to deal  once

again  with the points on which criticism has  been

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point of criticism - an old chestnut - is on

grounds of alleged evasion of tax. Critics will say

why  raise the tax when so many people are  evading

tax at present rates? Why not catch the evaders and

obviate  the necessity for increasing rates?  Well,

Sir, the answer to that is that I think it safe  to

say that the amount of evasion which is alleged  to

take  place is exaggerated. This point has  already

been  debated in the Assembly but perhaps I may  be

allowed to go over the ground once more. I doubt if

there are many potential taxpayers in Singapore  of

whose  existence the Department is  not  aware  and

whose  cases  are not examined. No man registers  a

motor car without coming under the scrutiny of  the

Comptroller. No man hires a telephone  without  the

same  thing happening, and so on. We have very many

sources  of  information about potential  taxpayers

and  all  indications and suggestions are  followed

up.  At  present, the Department has the  names  of

some  160,000  persons registered  on  its  records

while  about  25,000 fresh cases are examined  each

year.   I  do  not  think  that  many  escape   the

attentions  of the Comptroller. I do not  say  that

evasion does not go on. That is inevitable  in  any

country. But it is not nearly as widespread  as  is

generally  believed by those who do  not  have  the

full  facts,  and  I  know that the  Department  is

becoming  more and more expert in dealing with  it.

Many  large-scale evaders have already been brought



to  book and at the present time there are over 200

cases  being  subjected to detailed  investigation,

but  due  to the absence of publicity arising  from

the  secrecy provisions of the Ordinance, the  true

nature and extent of this aspect of the work cannot

be   generally  appreciated.  In  short,  Sir,  the

criticism  that  increases  in  tax  would  not  be

necessary if the Department did ifs job properly is

simply not justified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism has been that the new rates of

tax  will  discourage local investment.  I  do  not

think  that  this will be the case.  In  the  first

place, the increases are not sufficiently great  to

make much difference to the actual amount available

for  investment. The increases can have very little

effect  on the question of yield and all the  other

factors that investment capital takes into account.

Secondly, I should have much more sympathy with the



argument if in fact the money had been invested  in

the  past. But it has not. It has been salted  away

in different directions. If it is not going to come

forward  voluntarily  in  the  interests   of   the

territory in which it is made, a little more of  it

must be extracted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism will be that it is unwise for

Singapore  to  go ahead alone without corresponding

action in the Federation. The argument here will be

that independent action may disrupt the Pan-Malayan

approach to income tax and that the different rates

may  cause  taxpayers  to  change  their  place  of

residence. Superficially these arguments might have

some  force.  In  fact, however, they  have  little

validity. There is, as I see it, little danger that

independent  action in this sphere will  jeopardise

the Pan-Malayan administration of income tax. There

might  have been some danger of this in  the  past.

But  I  do  not think that danger exists  now.  The



Federation Government appreciates that our need for

revenue,  arising  from  a desire  to  balance  our

budget,  necessitates a move which it is unable  to

take  at the present time. It will stand to benefit

from our action to a certain extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think it unlikely that the increase in

rates  is sufficiently great to cause taxpayers  to

change  residence. A change of residence is  not  a

move  which  one  makes  lightly  or  without  full

consideration  of the consequences and  I  am  sure

that  the larger taxpayers who might be tempted  to

consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



such  a  move  are sufficiently men of  affairs  to

ponder  the  wisdom of incurring  expense  on  what

might  conceivably be a costly move to no  purpose.

With  rare exceptions, the place of an individual's



residence is largely determined by the locality  of

his  employment or the headquarters of his business

and I am confident that it would take far more than

a  minor increase in taxation to influence  him  to

change it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, questions may be asked why we have not

reduced personal allowances in order to broaden the

base of the income tax pyramid. Now that, Sir, is a

matter in which I am particularly interested. If  I

may express a personal opinion, that is, an opinion

based  purely  on  a slight knowledge  of  taxation

matters, budgetary policy, and of the difficulty of

balancing the budget, and without reference to  any

`political  consideration, I should  say  that  the

base  of the tax pyramid must be broadened and more

people  brought within the scope of income  tax  by

lowering  the personal allowances. In  my  opinion,

Singapore  cannot much longer afford the luxury  of

having  personal  reliefs  which  are  amongst  the

highest  in  the world and rates of tax  which  are

amongst the lowest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a

Bill  and a motion on this subject today. Both will

be  passed. But what is interesting is this - we  can

liken the Federation and Singapore to the head  and

the tail of a horse respectively. In respect of the

Bill, the head nods and the tail wags and the  Bill

is carried through. In the case of the motion here,

the tail wags but the head



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



refuses   to  nod!  I  would  like  the   Financial

Secretary  to  use  his  good  offices   with   the

Federation of Malaya and plead with them, as he has

so  very  often  pleaded with  them,  to  level  up

taxation policies. I would suggest that if he  were

not  influential enough, the Secretary of State for

the  Colonies might be brought in and persuaded  to

act as an umpire to help us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954 Singapore was on top of the world. The

Federation of Malaya then said, "Why should  we  be

separated  from Singapore? We want to be together."

Today  I  regret it is a different  story.  We  are

asking  the Federation, "Can we join you?" What  is

the  reason for all this? I can say that  there  is

only  one  reason -  that  Singapore  has  not  been

setting  an  example  in the matter  of  peace  and

stability for the country. Extremist elements  have

come  in  to destroy our stability and precipitated

actions  which  are prejudicial and detrimental  to

Singapore. I would like the people of Singapore  to

take note that this is their country and if we want

our  country to be always on top and always in  the

lead, then we must have responsible leaders to help

us  out. Leaders of the past whose names have  been

brought  into this Assembly, have been  branded  as

not having done good to the people, but I would say

that they did keep Singapore in the forefront.  The

younger set, with ages around 21, 22, 23 and so on,

who  are allowed to cry out against the old people,

have  come  on  to the scene. See  what  they  have

brought to Singapore! We are now at the tail-end in

this  race  and I hope that we will not be  dropped

out.

<br><br>4.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have His Excellency's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section 11 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160 of

the  Revised  Edition), resolves that  the  Customs

(Duties)  (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1958,  published

as Notification No. S 300 in Gazette Supplement No.

83 of 3rd December, 1958, as contained in Sessional



Paper No S.L. 42 of 1958, be confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this motion is to seek the

approval  of  the Assembly for the changes  in  the

tobacco tariff which were introduced on the 3rd  of

December   and  which  are  contained  in   Gazette

Notification No. S 300 of 3rd December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the tobacco tariff are briefly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) reversion to the original method of calculation of duty by weight;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the introduction of a "step" in the tariff for imported cigarettes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an increase in the duty on imported cigarettes above the "step", and on all

brands   of   imported  pipe   tobacco,   to Federation levels.



<br><br>The  reasons why these changes have been introduced

are briefly as follows.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the change in the method of calculation

of  duty  on  imported cigarettes and pipe  tobacco

which  was  introduced  in  October  did  not  work

particularly  well in practice. It led  to  certain

anomalies  which were undesirable and  contrary  to

the  long-term fiscal objectives of Government. For

example,  it  led  to  certain  popular  brands  of

cigarettes  in  tins  costing more  than  the  same

cigarettes  in packets with a consequential  switch

in  consumer preference and a corresponding  effect

in  yield of duty. Again, it led to certain  brands

of cigarettes costing more in Singapore than in the

Federation,  which was contrary to  the  policy  of

Government in the matter. Yet again, the yield from

the  measures introduced in October promised to  be

disappointingly  small. In all  the  circumstances,

after  very  careful thought,  it  was  decided  to

abandon  the  scheme introduced in October  and  to

revert to the method of calculation on weight alone

which  had been used for very many years both  here

and in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government has been considering for

some  time  the possibility of differentiating,  in

terms  of  duty  and consequently of retail  price,

between the two main groups of imported cigarettes,

namely,  the  popular  brands  of  cigarettes  like

Capstan, Players, Gold Flake, Churchman, and so on,

and the cheaper brands like Rough Rider, Double Ace

and  Torchlight.  The  object  is  to  extract  the

maximum amount of revenue from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



the tobacco tariff and at the same time to continue

to   provide   a  satisfactory  type  of   imported

cigarette for those who cannot afford the increased

cost  of  the more popular brands. It has therefore

been decided to make a "step" in the tobacco tariff

between imported cigarettes weighing less than 2.32

lbs, per  mille and cigarettes weighing more  than

2.32  lbs, per  mille.  The former  category  will

consist   of  the  Double  Ace,  Rough  Rider   and

Torchlight brands and the duty will remain  at  the

existing  level of $8.60 a pound full and  $8.10  a

pound   preferential.  The  latter  category   will

consist  of all other imported cigarettes  and  the

rate  of  duty will be raised to Federation levels,

namely  $10.50  a  pound  full  and  $10  a   pound

preferential. And since we do not at this  juncture

intend to increase the duty on cut tobacco imported

for   the   local  manufacture  of  cigarettes   by

mechanical  means, there will also be yet  a  third

category of cigarettes which will retail at  prices

substantially  below the Rough Rider  category.  In

short,  by  introducing a "step"  in  the  imported

cigarette duty tariff, we are providing three broad

categories  of good quality cigarettes and  meeting

the needs of all purses of all in-come categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in duty has been dictated by an

urgent  need  for  revenue.  It  should  not  cause

hardship.  It has been maintained in the Federation

for a number of years without causing hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these changes in tariff will have

been seen from the revised price lists published in

the  Press  by the main distributors.  The  general

effect   is  that,  while  the  prices  of  locally

manufactured cigarettes and imported cigarettes  of

the   Double  Ace  category  remain  at  pre-budget

levels,  the  prices  of cigarettes  like  Players,

Capstan,  Gold Flake, etc., which make  up  a  very

large proportion of local consumption, go up  by  5

cents for 10. At the same time, as a result of  the

removal of the element of duty calculated on c.i.f.

price,  the  price  of some of the  more  expensive



brands  of  cigarettes which had as a result  risen

above the price current in the Federation, has  now

been lowered to the same level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that these increases in duty will

yield rather more than $5.5 million in a full year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, certain dangers inherent in

the  creation of a "step". It creates a  margin  of

price  advantage of which those concerned with  the

marketing  of the cheaper brands might possibly  be

tempted  to  take advantage. It is sincerely  hoped

that they will not yield to this temptation because

the  Government would be most unwilling to have its

plans   for  the  benefit  of  the  general  public

frustrated by selfish interests, and I am sure that

it  would  be  prepared to take drastic  action  to

ensure that this was not done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of smuggling.

Smuggling has always existed and will always  exist



as  long as the Rhio islands are part of the  trade

area  of  Singapore;  as  long  as  re-exports  are

allowed  freely;  and as long as  tobacco  duty  is

levied  in Singapore. It is only natural  that  any

increase  in duty in Singapore should increase  the

incentive to smuggle and it is only to be  expected

that  the  increases now introduced  will  lead  to

increased activity on the part of the smugglers. On

the  other  hand,  the  Preventive  Branch  of  the

Customs  Department is now better equipped than  it

has ever been before to deal with this nuisance and

I  think  it safe to say that all those people  who

see  in the increase in tobacco duty an opportunity

to line their pockets by smuggling will be in for a

very hard time. But there is another aspect of  the

matter. Before the cigarettes can be smuggled  back

to  Singapore, they have to be despatched  to  Rhio

and  we  now have a deplorable situation  in  which

certain  firms,  while gladly  accepting  all  that

Singapore has to offer in the way of a secure  base

for  their business activities, seem quite prepared

to  stab her in the back by exporting cigarettes to

Rhio  regardless of the possibility  that  a  large

percentage of their exports will in due  course  be

smuggled  back.  I think that the time  is  rapidly

approaching  when  drastic  action  must  be  taken

against this short-sighted trading practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
