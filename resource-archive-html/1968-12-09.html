course,  that  in  some  Commonwealth  countries  this  subject   is

agitating  the  minds  of some people. In the  Australian  House  of

Representatives on Friday, 22nd November of this year, a proposal to

reduce  the  voting age to 18 was rejected. I think the best  policy

<div align="center"><b>METRIC SYSTEM</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Introduction in Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Finance if the Govern

ment  will consider introducing the Metric System at this  stage  of

the  Republic's  development  so as to  conform  with  the  practice

obtaining in most developed countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

conversion of the British system of measurement the so-called pound-

foot-gallon  system  to  the metric system  has  been  engaging  the

interests of many countries of the world in recent years, especially

those  in the Commonwealth and the United States. There is no  doubt

about  the  many advantages of the metric system which is  based  on

scientific  conception  and  has  a  direct  parallelism  with   the

universally-used decimal system of numbering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875 in Paris by 18

pioneering  countries, more than 85 nations have adopted the  metric

system  officially. They represent roughly more than 60 per cent  of

the  world's aggregate gross national product. More than 50 per cent

of  the world's trade is based on the metric system. The percentages

will be greater when the United States adopts the metric system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While both the United Kingdom and the United States of America are

signatories  to the Metre Convention, it was only in May  1965  that

the  United  Kingdom  declared its intention  of  using  the  metric

system, and it was only until this year, i.e. 1968, that the  U.S.A.

decided to initiate a three-year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



study  on the transformation to the metric system. Australia, Canada

and  South  Africa  are  believed to be  seriously  considering  its

adoption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the change-over to the metric system involves not only a

basic change in the system of measurement of the country, e.g.,  the

replacement  of old measuring devices and machines by new  equipment

and  the  resultant  costs, it would also  require  a  national  re-

orientation  towards the use and conception of  the  new  system  of

measurement. This indeed was the reason why the United  Kingdom  and

the  United States, though among the first signatories of the  Metre

Convention, are only now considering its adoption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally true to say that the earlier the change-over is

brought about, the less expensive the operation will be and the less

difficult  will  be  the problems associated  with  the  conversion.

Transformation to the metric system, however, is a long process. The

traditional  habits  of thinking and conceiving  of  quantities  and

comparing  them with each other grow up with one from childhood.  It

is  not  just  a  simple matter of changing the  physical  equipment

required  for  weights and measures, but a change  in  thinking  and

conception in the new units of quantity is also required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful change-over could only be brought about with the

agreement and co-operation of every sector of the economy  industry,

trade, education and so on, and not by Government enforcement alone,

although  Government initiative is required. This is  a  problem  of

great complexity affecting the whole society. School text-books, for

example,  would  need  to be re-written when  we  adopt  the  metric

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many problems associated with the change-over as well

as  the  large financial costs that would be involved, it  would  be

desirable  to adopt the metric system in the end. In fact,  a  study

has  already been initiated at our Industrial Research Unit to  look

into  the  many  problems connected with the change-over.  An  ECAFE

adviser



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



on  Industrial  Standardization, who had  earlier  assisted  in  the

conversion  to  the  metric system in India, has  estimated  that  a

period  of  five to six years would be required to bring  about  the

desired change in Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>BOARD FLATS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Revision of assessment rate)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <B>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</B> asked the Minister for Finance whether, in

view  of  the policy of the Government to promote home ownership  by

workers of Housing and Development Board flats, the Government  will

consider  revising the present rate of assessment, which is  36  per

cent  of  the  annual  value, or the basis of assessing  the  annual

value, of flats purchased under the Board's "Home Ownership Scheme".



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Property Tax Ordinance prescribed a single rate of 36  per

cent  from  1st  January, 1961. However, to give  relief  to  owner-

occupiers,  it  was  decided that they  should  be  allowed  to  pay

property  tax at the previous rates. This resulted in a multiplicity

of  rates, and some owner-occupiers were allowed to pay 18 per cent,

23 per cent, 27 per cent or 36 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationalisation of property tax rates for the whole island has

been under study, and it is the intention that the anomalies will be

removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special concessions to Housing and Development Board flat dwellers

will not be fair to other residents living in the same area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Government consider exempting purchasers and transferors of  Housing

and  Development Board flats from paying increased stamp duties, the

legislation of which will be contemplated in the near future?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the answer is "No".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary

kindly  throw  some  light  on  the  removal  of  anomalies  in  the

assessment rates -whether they will be revised upwards or downwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the whole subject is now under study and

the  question  of  assessment rates will  be  rationalised.  At  the

moment, I cannot say anything more than that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Courtesy campaign)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he

will consider conducting a further campaign to remind civil servants

that  courtesy and willing assistance are expected of  them  at  all

times when dealing with members of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in 1959, after the P.A.P. Government assumed office, steps were

taken  to ensure that civil servants deal with members of the public

with courtesy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudeness and discourtesy to the public were made disciplinary

offences,  and  disciplinary regulations were amended  to  enable  a

Permanent  Secretary  to  appoint  a  Division  I  officer  to  make

enquiries and deal with such complaints speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics of the Central Complaints Bureau, which was set up

in 1962, show a steady decline in the number of complaints, dropping

from  1,064  cases  in 1963 to 604 cases in1967. Not  all  of  these

complaints were justified. Today, it cannot be said that discourtesy

among  civil servants remains a major problem. In view  of  this,  a

further campaign is not deemed necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, isolated instances of discourtesy may still occur. To

eradicate  these, members of the public can do their part by  giving

full details of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



such  cases to the Heads of Departments concerned or to the  Central

Complaints Bureau or to their respective Members of Parliament.

<div align="center"><b>(Arrogant attitude and incompetency)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether

his  attention  has been drawn to complaints by the  public  against

Government  officers  in  certain  departments  for  their  arrogant

attitude and incompetency: and (b) if he will take steps to maintain

administrative efficiency at a high level and ensure that Government

officers adopt a proper attitude when dealing with the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there are more than 50,000 Government employees. In the  first

eight  months of this year, 17 complaints of discourtesy and  15  of

bureaucratic  behaviour  have been made to  the  Central  Complaints

Bureau. These figures do not support the implication in the question

by  the  Member  for  Sembawang that this  is  a  problem  of  grave

magnitude.  The  present disciplinary procedures  are  adequate  for

dealing with offences of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, members of the

public  who  wished  to  apply  for a certain  thing  wrote  to  the

departments  concerned  but  the letters  were  said  to  have  been

mislaid. Was this not the negligence of the officers concerned?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are instances where squatters were affected by resettlement.

When  they applied for resettlement, they were asked to obtain other

information. Was this not a case of trying to make matters difficult

for the public'?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of lost

correspondence, if the Member for Sembawang can give particulars  of

such allegations to the heads of the relevant departments, I am sure

they will be looked into. I am afraid I did not quite catch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



his second question. Will the hon. Member please repeat it?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the first part of the supplementary question

of the Member for Sembawang referred generally to the civil service.

I  think  the  second part of his question had to do with  the  Land

Office and I do not think it need concern you now, Mr Tang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,I will submit

particulars of my allegations to the relevant Ministry.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS RESIGNING AFTER SPECIALISED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TRAINING ABROAD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Wastage of public funds)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Finance what measures

are  in  force to prevent a waste of public funds by the resignation

of  a  civil  servant  who  has  been sent  abroad  for  further  or

specialised training at considerable public expense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, when an officer in the civil service is selected for a training

course or scholarship award, he is required to sign a bond with  the

Government  in  which he undertakes to serve the  Government  for  a

specified period, normally five years, after completing his  course.

He  is  also  required  to  provide two  sureties  guaranteeing  his

performance.  In  the  event  of any breach,  the  officer  will  be

required  to  compensate  the Government by  payment  of  liquidated

damages,  the amount of which is calculated according to the  amount

the  Government has expended on him and the period (or the remaining

period) which he is obliged to serve the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the incidence of officers resigning before completing the

period  of  their  bond  is low - 17 out of 479  who  returned  from

overseas during the period 1964 to 1968. And in every case,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



there  is  no  loss of public funds, as the Government  is  able  to

recover the amount of liquidated damages stipulated in the bond.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>(Dismissal for indebtedness)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Finance if civil

servants are dismissed from the Service for indebtedness as a  rule;

and  whether  he  will  consider applying a rule  to  give  a  civil

servant, who is indebted, a second chance to prove his worth in  the

Service if his case deserves it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  under  civil service regulations, an officer may be  dismissed

from   the   service  on  account  of  indebtedness.  This   extreme

punishment,  however, is meted out only in bad cases. Thus,  out  of

123  cases  of  indebtedness which came before  the  Public  Service

Commission for the period 1st January, 1966, to 30th June, 1968,  53

cases resulted in dismissal and nine in compulsory retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first offender is normally given a warning only, if the amount

of debt is small and his work and conduct are satisfactory. Cases of

dismissal usually involve officers who are habitual borrowers with a

long  history of unsettled debts. Such officers are generally  found

to  be of questionable integrity and are unfit for retention in  the

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is anxious to retain the better and more efficient

officers in the service and would be prepared to give an officer who

is indebted a second chance in deserving cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Numbers in acting and "officiating" capacities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many

public  officers were serving in an acting capacity on 1st  October,

1968, and how many such officers have acted for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



than two months; and (b) whether there are officers "officiating" in

unfilled  posts  in  the Service, the number of  such  "officiating"

officers  in  the various Ministries and departments, and  why  such

"officiating" capacity is necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there was a total of 946 public officers serving in an  acting

capacity  as on 1st October, 1968, of whom 785 have acted  for  more

than two months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the acting posts are in Division I 363 out of 946 as at

1st October, 1968. The reasons for this large number of acting posts

have been the expansion of the service and the establishment of  new

Ministries  and  Departments (for example, the Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs,  the Ministry of the Interior and Defence, the Ministry  of

Science  and Technology and the Technical Department in the Ministry

of  Education)  and  the difficulty in recruitment.  This  situation

should improve with the promotion exercise to be conducted soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is "Yes". The number

of officers "officiating" in unfilled posts in the service as on 1st

October, 1968, was 47. Such "officiating" appointments are necessary

as,  in some cases, there was no suitable officer in the next  lower

grade  available to act. Under present regulations, where a post  is

more  than  two grades higher than that of the officer's substantive

appointment, he may only "officiate" in the higher grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Officiating" appointments may also be necessary in the

professional services if, there is a shortage of qualified officers.

Here,  capable but unqualified officers in lower grades in the  same

department  are  asked  to "officiate" pending  the  recruitment  of

qualified officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, where there is a shortage of officers in certain grades of

appointment  and where officers in other classes of appointment  are

suitable, they are asked to "officiate".

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Finance what

percentage  of the weekly Toto takings is apportioned to  the  first

prize; and, on the average weekly prize money, what is the estimated

first   prize  for  the  fourth  week  immediately  following  three

consecutive weeks during which that prize has not been won.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  of the total stake moneys collected weekly for the 6-out-of-49

draw,  half the amount is set aside for prizes. Fifteen per cent  of

the  prize money is apportioned to the first prize. Assuming  weekly

average sales of $200,000, the prize money for the first prize  will

be  in the region of $60,000 for the fourth week if it has not  been

won  for three consecutive weeks. However, Singapore Pools (Private)

Limited guarantees a sum of $100,000 for the first prize even though

the accumulated sum is less.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Defence the number

of  cases  of  head injuries suffered by scooterists, motor-cyclists

and  pillion-riders in road accidents during the period 1st  May  to

30th  September, 1968; in how many such cases were the injuries  (i)

serious  but non-fatal: and (ii) fatal; and what percentage  of  the

serious and fatal cases were instances of persons not wearing  crash

helmets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  were  670 cases of head injuries suffered by the scooterists,

motor-cyclist, and pillion riders in road accident from 1st  May  to

30th September this year. Of this number, 138 cases were serious but

non  fatal,  and  28 cases were fatal. 97.8 percent of  the  serious

of crash helmets through education rather than by legislation.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) what

action  is taken on information received from members of the  public

of  vehicles which emit excessive exhaust smoke; (b) how many  cases

of  prosecutions there were against owners or operators of  vehicles

emitting  excessive  exhaust  smoke between  1st  January  and  30th

September, 1968; and (c) what were the results of such prosecutions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, usually on receipt of

information  from members of the public regarding vehicles  emitting

excessive exhaust smoke, action is taken under section 37 (1) of the

Road Traffic Ordinance whereby the Deputy Commissioner of Police  or

the  Registrar  of Vehicles may require the owner  of  any  licensed

vehicle  to  produce  his vehicle for inspection.  At  the  time  of

inspection,  a  policeman is present and if the car inspected  emits

excessive  exhaust  smoke, a report is made by  the  police  officer

present and appropriate action is taken, whether or not an informant

is  prepared to give evidence in court. The police send an offer  of

composition of $20 to the owner of the vehicle. If the owner of  the

vehicle  refuses to accept the offer of composition,  a  summons  is

taken out against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 1st January, 1968, to 30th September, 1968, a total

of  2,938  reports  were  made against vehicles  emitting  excessive

exhaust  smoke.  In  every case, the owners  of  the  vehicles  were

offered  a  composition of $20. A total of 502 summonses  have  been

applied for and are due to be issued by the Traffic Courts.

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Penalties for contravention)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether

there  have  been  cases of contraventions of the  National  Service

Ordinance, and how many; (b) what penalties have been meted  out  to

the  offenders; and (c) if he is satisfied with the manner in  which

the Ordinance has been implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were 448 cases of

contraventions  since  the  National  Service  Ordinance  came  into

effect. The main types of contraventions are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before enrolment, wilfully failing to turn up for registration or

wilfully failing to

appear for medical examination when directed to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After enrolment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) failure to report for training; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) being absent from training without leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the total of 448 were dealt with in court, pending, 154

pending police investigations, and eight are missing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I think the Ordinance has been satisfactorily

implemented. If we compare the number that has responded to national

service  with  the number of convictions, the percentage  is  almost

negligible. This in itself shows how successful national service has

been.
