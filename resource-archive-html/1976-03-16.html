<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of Singapore

for the financial year 1st April, 1976 to 31st March, 1977.

contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of 1976. For convenience, I shall

take the totals for each head of expenditure in the Main

Estimates and the Development Estimates as they appear in

the fifth and sixth columns respectively of the Summary of

Estimated Expenditure on page 43 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which  amendments stand  on  the  Order  Paper

Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D in respect

of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved to seek some clarification and

information in respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



of our Judiciary and the appointment of High Court Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge in Singapore that the waiting

period for a case to be heard in the High Court is

lengthening. One of the reasons for this sorry state of

affairs is the shortage of judges. From the Estimates, it

is noted that provisions have been made for one Chief

Justice, six High Court Judges, three Registrars/Senior

District Judges, one Deputy District Judge and seven

District Judges/Deputy Registrars. The total provision this

year is an addition of only one District Judge. Can the

Minister let us know the number of vacancies there are at

the moment among the ranks of our District Judges and High

Court Judges? How many High Court Judges are re-employed

after retirement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly said that justice delayed is justice

denied. It is important that our cases are heard

expeditiously and justice meted out swiftly. If, as a

result of shortage of judges, cases are long delayed, then

remedial measures must be taken to put right this position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that in the High Court, in respect of

capital punishment cases where two Judges sit on the Bench,

when a case goes up for appeal and the Appeal Court decides

to send the case down for a retrial, the case could not be

retried as the result of a shortage of Judges. If this is

so, then immediate remedial measures must be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister tell us what he proposes to do in

respect of filling up the vacancies?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Minister cannot

tell him much because he is not in charge of appointments

of High Court Judges or even Judges in the Lower Courts.

But the Member may well be aware that Judges of the High

Court are appointed by the President on the advice of the

Prime Minister, and it is incumbent on the Prime Minister

to consult the Chief Justice before appointments are made.

If I may say so, one must be very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



careful when appointing judges. They must be men of

experience, ability and integrity, and have had several

years of legal experience at the Bar or in the legal

department of the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in the High Court is that Mr Justice Tan Ah

Tah retired in November last year. So there is one seat

vacant. Mr Justice D'Cotta retired at the end of February

this year but he has been re-appointed for another six

months. Mr Justice Choor Singh is due to retire in July,

and whether or not his employment will be extended depends

on the Prime Minister after consultation with the Chief

Justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for delays in the High Court, this is not just because

there is one judge short. Cases take some months or even

years, at least for civil cases, to go to trial after

pleadings, interrogatories, discovery of documents and a

convenient date to counsel for both sides and the

litigants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not seem to be a shortage of judges in the

District Courts or the Subordinate Courts. There again the

appointments are made by the Legal Service Commission

headed by the Hon, the Chief Justice. I am in no position

in this House to make comments on the appointments. Beyond

that, the Member may rest assured that the appointments and

state of the cases in the High. Court, or even the District

Courts, are in the hands of capable persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance from the

Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,884,550 for Head D ordered to stand part of

the Main Estimates.

of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head J -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead ABA 1107*. (* The  same  amendment also stood in the names of Messrs  N. Govindasamy and P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, throughout the whole of this debate on the Budget I

would like to emphasise, wherever I may, the theme of how

necessary it is for Singaporeans to show regard for one

another. With this particular amendment. I would like to

refer to the problem of the attitude of civil servants to

the public. Complaints in this House have been regular as

almost to be ritualistic regarding discourtesy shown to the

general public when they have approached various offices.

or service centres, for example, the Immigration

Department, the Registry of Vehicles, the Hawkers

Department; or the hospitals or clinics arid so on. Yet the

problem still remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to senior Government officials, there have

been attempts to bring to the attention of officers the

need for courtesy when dealing with the public. Circulars

on courtesy in the civil service and relations with the

public have been dutifully sent around to Permanent

Secretaries and various officers on distribution lists. And

these circulars have even attempted to analyse what has

contributed to the problem. The Central Complaints Bureau

has. I am told, been asked to investigate more effectively

complaints of discourtesy and petty bureaucracy and yet

right up to the moment the problem still remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not exemplify. Every Member in this House can come

up with instances of thoughtlessness and officiousness.

What is wrong? Is it that something fundamental has been

overlooked in the attempts to tackle this problem? It

cannot be that the public are just cussed, that they insist

on having indelibly imprinted in their minds a poor image

of Government departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that just as the bad impression of

Government can become ingrained in the minds of people, so

the principal way to ensure that this does not happen is to

have the commitment to courtesy ingrained in the minds of

the civil servant, not merely at the level of contact with

the public but right up the line to the top-most

administrator. The concern of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



civil servant that should be his constant preoccupation is

not merely the accomplishment of a job and closing of a

file, but the citizens' welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the civil servant has frequently become so

task-oriented that he alt too often forgets whom he is

serving - what he is doing the job for - namely, the

people's well-being. And every now and then he just wants

to get on with the job, ignoring the sensitivities and

needs of the very people he is supposed to be doing the job

for. I hope when we are inducting our new administrative

cadres into what should be their vocations, this point of

commitment to concern for the individual will be stressed

from the beginning. I imagine that it is because of the

absence of this concern that there has again and again been

complaints about discourtesy and bureaucratic indifference

in the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how can this commitment be demonstrated? Perhaps we

can ask some pertinent questions. Do our leaders in the

civil service, our super civil servants as they have been

described (although I do not quite understand this term),

do our top bureaucrats show their concern for the

conditions in which people meet the civil servants, the

conditions in which the civil servants themselves have to

work the whole day long? Is an office environment conducive

to a good relationship between the civil servant and those

he has to serve? Are the public served in surroundings of

cleanliness and reasonable comfort, or do we find light and

ventilation deficient and the organisation of space

uneconomic, long queues, long waiting periods, and so on.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are toilet facilities adequate, canteens offering

reasonable service, or is it perhaps that no such amenities

exist at all? Are signboards properly displayed, or are

they tatty-looking, bent or frayed at the edges, and have

unofficial doodlings all over them? Are those who handle

the public properly trained to feel sensitive, to put

themselves in the place of the petitioner, the client? If

there is a possibility that members of the public may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



not understand rules and procedures, are these

adequately explained?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now such concerns, I think. Mr Speaker, Sir, should

be the subject of attention at the very centre of

management in the bureaucracy. Senior civil servants

can be expected to set the standard and the example

of demonstrating such interest and commitment, not

through circulars only, but by action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point that one line of example also

is to show human and personal concern for one's very

own subordinates. I would like to hear more often of

a subordinate being frank, straightforward, firm and

forthright with his superior, albeit maintaining due

respect for him. And superiors should show courtesy

and consideration towards their subordinates, and

patience in the face of difficulties encountered. Intelligent attention to the human element in the

work situation is in keeping with the best modern

administrative practice everywhere. Moreover, if

there are good manners and human respect within the

civil service family contributing to an esprit de

corps, this will show in the attitude towards the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, while senior officers have decided that inductees

into the administrative service should have the

experience of sitting with MPs in their meet-the-people sessions, let me invite senior officers

themselves - those near or at the top - to come and

see for themselves how people at the grass-roots

feel. The experience would be salutary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have brought up this matter because the closest the

public  come  to an appreciation of Government  is  at

the  point  of  contact with civil  servants.  If  the

impression  they gather at this point  of  contact  is

unfavourable, then I am afraid their attitude  towards

Government  will  be  affected  by  this  unfavourable

experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, when I first filed this

amendment. I had the intention of enquiring into the

need for the setting up of this Establishment Unit

with 102 Division I officers, headed by a Deputy Secretary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



Grade E. But since then, the Minister for Finance in his

Budget Statement has clarified the functions of the

Establishment Unit in the Prime Minister's Office. There

has also been a press write-up on the Establishment Unit.

presumably based on a release from the Prime Minister's

Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this, Sir. Where is the Prime Minister's

Office going to find the 102 high calibre officers,

especially in the 25-40 age group? If you look at Appendix

A of Cmd. Paper No. 4/76, you will notice that every

Ministry is dismally understaffed, especially in respect of

Division I officers. There are

2.455     Division I vacancies in the Government service

alone. However, I do welcome the establishment of such a

unit to spot outstanding talent among our administrative

officers, and that it would also be responsible for career

development and training, postings, transfers, secondments,

and administration of the merit increment ~c he me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Katong has said, perhaps another

area that this Unit can look into is the frequency of

complaints we hear in this House as well as outside, about

the rudeness and arrogance of our civil servants.

especially those who man the counters and come in contact

with the public. Perhaps this Unit must be armed with not

only the carrot but together with the carrot, the stick as

well.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is noted

that an Establishment Unit has been set up in the Prime

Minister's Office to coordinate the career development of

all Division I officers in the whole Civil Service. This

Unit has, as its main function, to look and fill the void

left by promising officers in the 30-45 age group. In

addition to this, the Unit has also to look into the career

development and training, postings, transfers and

secondments, and administration of the merit increment

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder why this Unit is only interested in

Division I officers. What about the promising, able and

experienced officers in the other Divisions? They too

should also be taken care of by this Unit. Some of them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



may not have university degrees, but then they may be

excellent innovators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the merit increment scheme is only

meant for Division I officers. Here again, what about

officers in the other Divisions who have performed well in

their duties? Will they also not be considered for this

merit increment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not want to stand as a

defender of rude, arrogant, unfeeling and discourteous

civil servants. Where they exist, where they can be pin

pointed, action will be taken. There is for senior civil

servants a Civil Service Staff Development Institute which,

amongst its other duties, tries to involve the civil

servants in the wider aims of Government and the duties of

the Administration. The Civil Service, with the help of the

Public Service Commission, have tried to define those areas

where the public comes into contact with the officials,

whether it is the Immigration Department, the Registry of

Vehicles, the hospitals, clinics, post offices, wherever

there is a counter, and attempts will constantly' be made

to improve the way in which the public at large is being

served.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me pick up the point made by the

Minister for Katong. He invited senior civil servants or

super civil servants, as he has superciliously referred to

them, to sit with him at his meet-the-people sessions.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of clarification. He is a

Member and not a Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Katong. Thank you.

Sir, let me explain to him that if we pick out the really

outstanding civil servants to sit with him or to sit with

the other MPs in the meet-the-people sessions, he ought to

look out and make sure that he is not displaced in some

future election. We are professional in our relations with

the public. That is part of the business of the MP. If he

is not good at it, then he would probably not be here. A

civil servant who can both do his job as an administrator

and be good at the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



relations side of it, who is able to say `No" to an

obstreperous, vehement and insistent constituent who wants

the answer to be "yes" and wants his MP to bend the rules

in order that the answer is "yes", would have learnt the

secret of politics and will comprise the Government. So I

think it is not an invitation to be made lightly and in

jest. Perhaps if the Member for Katong knows how to keep

his constituents happy whilst having to say "No" to them in

the politest of terms, he should patent the secret, hide it

away in a file, and never show it to a good civil servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me place this against the broader context. First,

I am glad that this is the maximum of criticism. There is

no charge of dishonourable, corrupt or other practices. If

M Ps come here and complain of discourtesy, inadequate

toilet or canteen facilities, tatty signboards, all this is

in part a reflection of our relatively healthy state of

affairs. In fact, we should have a conducted tour for MPs

and some of their constituents, who complain of the

bureaucratic practices, of parts of the Third World, and

when they come back they would be extremely grateful that

they have Singapore and the Singapore Civil Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said and done, I think we have to take

this in the context of our total society. Consideration for

each other, courtesy or the lack thereof, comes out of a

long cultivation of good habits. It is extremely difficult

to be polite and courteous to a crude, obstreperous and ill-mannered person. It is a two-way process, whether it is the

SBS bus drivers and conductors against passengers, whether

it is motorists versus lorry drivers, or motorists versus

motorists, or motorcyclists versus motorists, whether it is

jostling at the National Stadium or in the schools, it is

the general tenor of behaviour, the accepted standards of

conduct of a society as a whole. In the last 1 7 years, or

perhaps I should go back to 1955 when we had the first

elected Government and the pressures of elected

representatives wanting less high- handed treatment for

their illiterate, ill educated constituents, things have

improved. But they can improve only so far as the general

level of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



conduct and courtesy between our citizens can improve. I

have known of communities where people are elaborately

courteous to each other because of the nature of long years

of cultivated breeding, cultivated nurturing of good public

behaviour. Words like "I am sorry" or "please" are not

something one hears over the telephone. They are "What?".

"Who are you?" And if you say. "Sorry, it is the wrong

number", they say. "Oh!", not "I am sorry". But what an

absolute waste of time that you should be the person

answering. If you are wrong, you should not be there.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have picked up the telephone and have had to deal with

telephone operators who did not know who I was and treated

me just like a member of the public. So I have a fair idea

of the general level of public conduct. But they pick it up

first at home, then the neighbourhood, their friends, then

in the school reinforced by fellow students and teachers,

then out where they work, their friends, their bosses and

the people they meet and frequent and are together with.

This is a slow and painful process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can have the very converse where you have

all the manifestations of good behaviour but actually a

crude vicious inner self. I have known of capitals in this

world where, having nudged you out of the bus queue - this

was 20 or 30 years ago when I was a student - they say.

"Pardon me." They give you a sharp nudge and they are on,

and you are off, the bus. They say. "I am sorry". They have

all the external manifestations of a cultured well-bred

person. Which would you have? An honest straightforward

Singaporean who says. "No", "What". "Who is there?" or a

hypocritical one who says. "I am terribly sorry," when he

is not. The Member for Katong should think these things

over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Unit in my office, it is a difficult business

identifying talent. Why Division I? Because that is more

than I want to handle. The PSC, together with the

Establishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance, will look

after everything. But an urgent situation has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



arisen to spot talent at the top. I do not agree with the

Member for Telok Blangah that the Ministries are

understaffed. They say that they are understaffed because

this is Parkinson's law. Every Permanent Secretary says

that there should be so many Deputy Secretaries, so many

heads of departments.

-    and so on. A manpower survey conducted by the

Development Unit shows that the public sector is taking too

many engineers and other professionals as against the

private sector, and that we should do with less. And if

there are efficient men, the right people to do the right

jobs, then we will not only do with less but we will do

better with less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may read an extract from the circular which was

signed by the Head of the Civil Service. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Unit will be responsible for:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) career development and training;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) postings, transfers and secondments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) merit increment scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers likely to make the top superscale grades will

have postings to broaden their experience and test their

mettle. There will be accelerated promotions whenever

performance matches the promise. This need to discover

outstanding ability and administrative talent has become

pressing because of the void in numbers of able officers

in the 30 to 45 age group caused by many promising

officers leaving to join the private sector in the years

of rapid economic growth.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very painstaking business, trying to spot the

difference between ordinary pebbles and a gem on the beach.

A gem before it is polished is often indistinguishable. But

if one looks closely and long enough, picks up the right

one even if it is one in five and the wastage in testing is

four out of five -putting a person to trials to see whether

he comes up with the right answer, whether he is

imaginative, he is creative, he has got the right approach,

he has got the decisiveness; once he has made up his mind,

he has got the stamina to pursue his recommendations to

fruition - then even if it is the right one out of 10, I

think we are lucky. Whether it is in the civil service or

whether it is in the political side of Government, the

problem has always been that the more able the person is,

the more the workload is put on him in order that the job

gets done. Perhaps the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



for Katong was giving unwitting praise to the few. They

carry an enormously disproportionate burden of the load

because they have been found to be reliable and able to get

things done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Anson. I am not interested in

whether an officer has got a BA.. MA.. Ph.D., or D.Sc. Can

he get a job done? Can he get a team to work with him? Is

he a talker or a thinker, or a talker and a doer? The best,

of course, is the man who thinks before he expounds and

having expounded he then acts. But at the end of it all are

the results. It has got nothing to do with whether he has

got a Ph.D, or a School Certificate or even a Std. VI

qualification. In the old days, Std. VI would have taken

you very far. It is whether you have got this up here and

whether you have got that drive. But the chances are, with

our methods of universal education and selection all along

the way, race after race, year after year, if you cannot

make a simple BA., then it is hardly likely that you will

be able to last the marathon. And that is what we are

looking for - people who can last the pace, not just one

test but having passed it he will have three or four more

quickly passed on to him. Every Minister can testify that

when you discover such a person, then a large section of

your Ministry and its problems are taken off your shoulders

and you get happy reports every month; and after a while

every three months, and after a longer while you begin to

take reports only once in six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have made my position clear. We are the

political side of the Service. I do not defend rudeness. I

do not defend arrogance. I do not defend mediocrity. I do

not defend the desire to do the minimum and get by. But

this is what we have got. This is after 17 years of PAP

government. I think it could have been better, but it may

have been a lot worse. In fact, let us start off in the

knowledge that it is better and let us make it better. But

to make it better, let us not come here with any scales

over our eyes. True MPs must make some noise for querulous

constituents. But it is extremely difficult.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



when the answer is "No", to make a member of the public go

away happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as MPs know and even as Ministers know, some fellow

Ministers have the habit of passing on the buck. So the MP

comes here and passes on the buck to the Minister. I have

got a lot of experience with that. I get Ministers passing

on the buck to each other and they land up on my plate.

Finally, the answer is still "No", because if you say "Yes"

then you have changed the rules for everybody and an

unworkable situation is created. So the man who knows how

to say "No" and keep his constituents happy and have them

voting for him at the next elections should quietly

congratulate himself either at his innate good nature that

God has endowed him with or for his cultivated sense of

self-discipline that keeps the face in relaxed and happy

countenance, while he is really fed up to the teeth with

troublesome constituents. Whichever way it is. I hope all

MPs will look after their constituents, keep them happy

even when the answer is "No" because, as you know, if the

answer is "Yes" he would not be looking for the MP,



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, may I just point out to the Hon.

Prime Minister that the figure I have quoted in respect of

the shortage of staff is not mine. It is the Government's

figure found in Cmd. Paper 4 of 1976.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was fully aware of that. I am

questioning whether that figure represents the actual

required vacancy that should be filled. I do not doubt that

it represents vacancies in Establishment posts which have

been approved by the Establishment Branch of the Finance

Ministry. I do not doubt that. But if you go right back to

1955 when I was sitting opposite, you find that there were

always vacancies. If you want to be a General and everybody

wants to be a General, you cannot be a General unless you

have got lots of troops - and I think all M Ps are familiar

with this. If you want to be a Brigadier, you must have a

brigade. If you want to have a brigade you must have three

battalions and that means you must have three CoIonels. But

there is only one Colonel and, in fact, one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



Colonel alone can do the job well. So he says. "All right,

we will have one and two vacancies", i.e, the Brigadier. If

he has only got one person, then he ought to be a Colonel.

This has been going on a long time. I am not at all

convinced that that represents the actual needs in the

Government Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Prime Minister

has certainly given me plenty of things to think over and I

am very grateful for the very forthright way that he has

dealt with the questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry, Sir, that the Hon. Prime Minister has

thought that I was supercilious. It was not my intention at

all. I may sound supercilious right now. If one were to

ask: is the "Minister for Katong" supercilious? I do not

think he will find a consensus among my colleagues. I am

very sorry that he has carried that opinion away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to assure the Hon. Prime

Minister that, in the midst of all the stresses, I shall

follow his advice and maintain a very calm, polite,

courteous attitude to all those who may place a strain on

my patience, as I hope I have not placed too much of a

strain on the Prime Minister's patience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BAA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek

clarification from the Honourable Prime Minister with

regard to my observation on anti-pollution measures. In the

first instance, the $10 provision for Head of the Anti-Pollution Unit needs explanation. I am sure Members will

not disagree with me when I say that this is an important

Unit. Assurance has already been given by the Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



State in the Prime Minister's Office in reply to my remarks

as contained in Hansard, Vol. 31, column 708. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Unit is taking every effort to ensure that the air

around us is pollution free, so that our people can lead a

healthy life wherever they may live.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that two years have passed with a token

provision of $10 for each year. I was just wondering

whether there is anybody suitable to take charge of this

particular Unit. In my last question to the Minister of

State in the Prime Minister's Office, I notice that three

officers were sent overseas. It therefore certainly looks

strange to me that this Unit is still without a Head to

direct and coordinate anti-pollution measures, although

there are already so many officers around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw the attention of the

Prime Minister to is the question of pollution caused by

the Ministry of the Environment itself. I refer to the

Tampines Refuse Dumping ground which is situated near the

estuary of the Serangoon River. The area around the swamp

is being dumped with trade refuse from the city and garbage

from the many residential estates. During spring tides, the

water comes right up to the mouth of the river, and when it

recedes, rubbish and refuse are simply washed into the

straits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the question of lorries of the Ministry

of the Environment. They carry stinking watery wastes which

drip along the road, whilst lorries carrying sand are

usually parked by the road side to make sure that they

conform with the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, I have been asked to reply on behalf of the

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the Member's first point, the post of Head of

the Anti-Pollution Unit has been filled since 1971. The

incumbent is presently the Acting Permanent Secretary of

the Ministry of the Environment, but his salary is paid out

of the Ministry's vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pollution by the Ministry itself, it is the

practice now to build a bund on the side of the Serangoon

River, so that as little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



rubbish as possible goes into the river. But I agree with

the Member that when there is high tide there is some

pollution in the river. The Member will be happy to know

that the construction of the new incinerator at Ulu Pandan

will reduce the pollution in Punggol. This incinerator is

scheduled to be completed in 1979 or 1980. It will have

electrostatic precipitators to minimise air pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to lorries which carry rubbish. I agree that sometimes

water trickles down. Most of the lorries are new ones. They

are compact and no water flows out. We have about 70 old

lorries which are still in use, and on rainy days when the

rubbish is wet it trickles from the back and produces a

terrible stench. But we are in the process of getting rid

of these lorries. I do not want to blame the Minister for

Finance, but with more money we can get rid of the old

lorries. However, there are priorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1002*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the implementation of national service we are

happy  to  see  the  good results it has achieved.  Through

national service we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



have been able to improve our security and enhance defence

capability and social stability. We can talk of the many

advantages of national service in relation to our defence.

There are hardly any shortcomings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recalling the day when national service was first

implemented, many of us were worried because most parents

at that time did not quite understand the significance of

national service. Because of their traditional belief, the

parents tried to prevent their children from joining the

combat units of the national service. During that period

the Ministry of Defence was beset with difficulties and the

Minister himself had to crack his head to solve such

problems, and his hair turned gray because of it. However,

after some time parents gradually came round to accept the

principles and need for a full-time national service for

our young people. Some parents would not like to see their

children being drafted into full-time national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been a change now. Many parents would

offer all sorts of excuses to get their children

transferred to part-time national service when they are put

into full-time national service. If their application is

not approved they will be dissatisfied and disappointed. I

think we must do something to stamp out such tendency,

because this will affect the young people in the national

service. Most of these parents are from the lower strata

and are not well educated. They are farmers, fishermen,

workers and widows. The youngsters who come from such

families should join the full-time national service because

such experience will be useful to them in future. However,

they cannot recognize the usefulness of full-time national

service. I do not understand what is the reason for this.

Perhaps something has gone wrong in the Ministry of

Defence, or perhaps the parents are prejudiced. I would ask

the Minister whether he is aware that more and more parents

are applying for a transfer of their children to do part-time national service. Is there any measure to stop such a

tendency or will these parents be allowed to apply for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



transfer of their children to do part-time national

service?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the

Ministry of Defence I would like to raise three questions.

Firstly, the high accident rate incurred by drivers and

mobile riders was a matter of great concern in the SAF

sometime ago. Every possible step was taken to raise

driving standards. To promote offence-free driving, an

outright bonus of $50 was given to drivers/riders in full-time service who completed at least 2.500 miles of offence-free driving within a three-month period. May I know how

this incentive has improved the standard at driving in the

Army? To-date how many instructors have qualified for this

bonus?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly. Sir, some students who come from not-so-well-off families have been granted scholarships by foreign

countries. These scholarships are not easily obtained. But

then after getting it, their parents find it difficult to

send them abroad because of the minimum $30,000 deposit

required as a guarantee that the student will return to do

national service. How are these poor people going to raise

such a big sum of money? It is not easy to raise it, and

because of this some of these students have to forgo their

scholarships. I know of one instance where the number of

scholarships granted per year by a foreign country to local

students has been reduced because of this requirement. May

I suggest to the Minister to relax this requirement for the

poor students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the Government has put emphasis on rules

about long hair and pinched-up caps among our recruits. Yet

it seems to be a common practice among some national

servicemen particularly those attached to the Police Force,

to keep long hair and even put on tiny caps over their big

heads. Even some of the senior officers are sporting long

hair, both in the Army and the Police Force. How are they

going to control their subordinates? It is time a check was

made on all these recruits.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I would

like to touch on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



similar subject of safe driving by Mindef drivers. I am

interested to know what programmes are afoot to improve the

driving standards of these Mindef drivers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I am in sympathy with what the Member for Bukit

Panjang has said. As far as possible, the policy is moving

in the direction he recommends, that is, enlist everybody.

In the past, of course, it was not possible to do so

because there was limited requirement for manpower. But

lately Government has decided that national servicemen can

be enlisted to do full-time national service in the Police,

the Fire Brigade, as well as the Vigilante Corps. I do not

expect that in future there should be much difficulty over

this. But it is not possible to insist that every youth

does full-time national service because there are cases

where genuine hardship will be caused by doing so. That is

the only ground on which we can allow deferment from

national service. Parents who feel that economic hardship

will be caused by national service call-up can make an

appeal to the Appeals Board where cases are fully

investigated, and in a fair number of instances appeals are

allowed, something like 30% of applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding national service drivers, in my view they are a

much maligned group. We have been keeping records of

accident rates over the years and the figures show that in

the last few years there have been 2.5 accidents per

100,000 kilometres travelled. Accident is defined to

include cases where the fault is not with the Army drivers

alone but with the civilian drivers also. A study of Police

reports shows that in all accidents involving Army and

civilian drivers, the blame lies equally with the civilian

drivers as with Army drivers so that, in effect, as far as

accidents due to Army drivers are concerned, the accident

rate is something like just over one per 100.000

kilometres. This is not a very high rate of accident

considering that Army drivers on the average have just one

year's driving experience. We recruit more than 2.000

national service drivers each year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



and since they do two years' national service the average

experience is one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce the rate of accidents we have

introduced this bonus payment referred to by the Member for

Anson, whereby a driver gets $50 bonus if he has an

accident-free record over three or four months. The matter

is being reviewed because, although many drivers have

qualified for this bonus and quite a large sum has been

paid on this account, the accident rate remains about the

same as it was before the bonus was paid. I am afraid this

privilege may have to be withdrawn and other means found to

improve their driving standards. Perhaps stiffer penalties

may be more effective than the bonus payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On scholarships, the position is this. Where the

scholarship is a genuine one granted under the auspices of

the Public Service Commission, then of course there is no

question of paying any bond to ensure that the scholar

comes back to do his national service. Where it is a

private scholarship, then the matter is referred to the

Public Service Commission to see whether it is really a

meritorious award or whether it is some kind of a fiddle,

or whether in fact it is a minor kind of academic

institution. If the PSC says. "Yes, this is a good award".

then of course no problem arises. However, if the PSC says.

"This kind of scholarship is humbug", then the scholar is

not allowed to leave the country. He has to do his national

service first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On long hair, I cannot speak for the Police. But so far

as the Army goes, nearly all battalion camps have a camp

barber and recruits are taken there on the first day and

are charged 60 cents a hair cut. So far as the active

battalions are concerned, there are regular muster parades

and I do not think there is a problem with national

servicemen. However, once a soldier leaves the Army and

goes back to civilian life, he acquires all the bad habits

of the civilian, including long hair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days when reservists were called back for

their annual in-camp training,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



the officers were of course quite taken aback by a number

of long hair styles, and they had to borrow barbers from

several camps. But this did not work too well because camp

barbers gave them a 4 x 2 Army-style haircut and there were

howls of anguish from the reservists, some of whom claimed

probably with justification that they needed long hair

because they were fashion designers or this and that. So

morale in that battalion camp dropped very low and we had

to consider what options were available. One, of course,

was to treat every case on its own merits. That was not

possible in the Army. Either they all wore the same kind of

hair style, or sent to the camp barber, or not at all. So

in the end we decided that so long as a reservist has a

decent haircut, in accordance with the photograph put up by

RTS, he is allowed to carry on. Longer than that, he goes

to the camp barber and he has to pay 60 cents for his

haircut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, however, in between the annual in-camp

training what do they do? They have to report once a month

to their Reserve battalion headquarters and, of course,

their hair could be quite long on those occasions. If they

turn up in uniform, they give the Army a bad impression. So

the way out is to allow them to come in civies and thereby

avoiding some of the criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as long hair is concerned, we are trying to

control it as best as we can, and we have been successful

in the active battalions. But for the reservists there must

be some give-and-take and within that situation we are

doing as well as we can,



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have here a cutting from

yesterday's Straits Times which says. "Runaway truck

crashes into garden, hits car".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the hair cut. I think most probably they wear

wigs. Otherwise, after a haircut, how could they still have

long hair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, what is more worrying

is not so much the accident frequency rate. It is the

accident severity rate. I believe the size of the vehicle

is such that accident severity rates are pretty high

indeed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



So I feel more emphasis should be put on inculcating safe

driving habits among Army truck drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider this seriously because

if this is not done then it can be quite terrifying for

people to drive along Upper Changi Road. Tampines Road and

other roads that are heavily used by Army vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, on a

point of clarification. If my memory serves me right. I

think the Minister's announced policy on deferment from

full-time national service is that only the sole

breadwinner of the family will be exempted. I believe he

made that statement in this particular House. But what he

said earlier on does seem to suggest that there could be

some change in the consideration of application for

exemption from full-time national service. Would the

Minister please clarify that point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would also like to ask the Minister

whether he would consider exempting construction workers

from full-time national service. We are still not getting

enough of this type of workers, and the majority of them

are work permit holders. For those who work in high-rise

buildings, I think the hazards that they are exposed to are

surely much greater than in the national service. So if

they are prepared to take a more hazardous job. I feel that

we should give them the deferment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not think there is a contradiction

between what I say now and what I said the last time. The

sole breadwinner would be exempted naturally because if he

is called up for national service then there is economic

hardship. But it does not work Out as simple as that. For

instance, if the sole wage earner in the family cannot

prove that he earns much more than what he will earn in the

Army, then there is no hardship in calling him up for

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about construction workers, they do

not qualify for exemption. We, however, do run a special

scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



whereby apprenticeship training schemes requiring two to

four years of indentured apprenticeship come under special

arrangements where industries have a need for skilled

workers and these skills can only be acquired by long

training over two to four years. What we do is when the

Industrial Training Board recommends a case we send him off

for three months basic military training with SAFTI. After

that he does his apprenticeship training for two years or

four years, at the end of which he comes back for his

reservist training in the PDF battalion where he does the

more simple military chores. But I do not think it is

feasible to disrupt national service on grounds of working

in the construction industry. Once you allow that, the

question is: just where do we stop? Apart from that, it is

a very rare Singaporean who wants to work in the

construction industry. Most of these tough jobs are now, I

believe filled by work permit holders.

should all be allowed deferment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the vote for the Ministry of Defence

this year is $650 million, an increase of $10 million over

that for last year. Defence takes up the second largest

share of expenditure of the whole Government Budget. There

is no doubt that it is necessary to allocate a large sum of

money for our defence, because we must build up our defence

on a sounder and more secure footing. All the basic

facilities should be adequate and sophisticated enough to

ensure that our defence credibility is satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this I would like to put forward certain

complaints about certain defects which exist in the daily

administration in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Armed Forces so that the Minister could take

measures to rectify the shortcomings. Before I do so. I

would like to congratulate the Minister on the fact that.

over the past year from my contacts with members of the

public. I have found that national servicemen and their

parents are generally quite satisfied with life in the SAF

camps. The bad behaviour of some members of the SAF, for

example, whistling at girls on the roadside, has lessened.

There were very few such complaints against national

servicemen. There is a marked improvement in their

discipline. However. I have some questions to ask:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question relates to what has been done to

promote and strengthen the national consciousness and

patriotism of our national servicemen. This is an important

aspect of our objective because Singapore is a newly

independent country. After a decade of independence we have

to see that such patriotism and national consciousness are

inculcated in our national servicemen. In addition to

military training and learning of discipline, I do not know

whether such patriotism and national consciousness form

part of their training. Are these values being consistently

taught to our national servicemen as part of their training

or as a kind of indoctrination? However, from what I have

understood up till now, the only two activities are

recreation and sports which are popular in the military

camps. With regard to subjects like ideological training, I

wonder whether such relevant topics are taught to our

national servicemen. This is important because it will

nurture their patriotism and boost their morale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard criticisms levelled against our national

servicemen that they are reluctant to undergo military

training and that they are eager to be discharged from the

national service. If that is the case, it means that the

SAF has not done well in the field of education and that

our national servicemen have not realised the significance

of national service. I, therefore, hope that the SAF will

give due regard to this aspect of their work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that some national servicemen have

been indulging in undesirable habits. I have received such

complaints from parents and I have also knowledge of

certain cases. It appears that certain boys who had good

clean habits before their enlistment quickly took to

drinking and smoking as soon as they were drafted into the

national service, to the great disappointment of their

parents. I hope the Minister would order the SAF to ban

drinking and smoking among the national servicemen in the

barracks so that they would keep their good and clean

habits in and out of the cam PS,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly. I wish to refer to the possible reduction of the

period of training for the reservists. I have received

complaints from some parents that the requirement of

reservists to undergo one month's training every year has

caused great inconvenience to those who are employed or in

business, because they had to leave their job or business

as there were no adequate substitutes to fill their posts.

In order to help these reservists to solve their problems,

I would urge the Minister to consider reducing the period

of re-training, say, from one month to one week. I do not

know what the Minister would think of this suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly. I would like to touch on the question of

raising the leadership qualities of the officers. At the

beginning of this year at an Officers' seminar the Minister

emphasised that the officers should take on more

responsibilities. This was reported in page 3 of the S/n

Chew Jit Poh of 23rd January, 1976. The Minister pointed

out that as officers they should adopt practical methods to

solve various problems and should not pass the buck. The

Minister also disclosed that a system is being set up in

the Ministry of Defence to evaluate as well as promote the

leadership capabilities of the officers and their ability

to carry out duties. I fully agree with the Minister in

this constructive measure. Only in this way can we be

assured that the leadership qualities of the officers will

constantly be raised. The officers should exert their

authority in leadership and show off an image to be looked

upon with respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



by the rank and file. In order to achieve this objective

the officers should not be capable only of giving orders to

their subordinates but should try to be looked upon with

esteem by their subordinates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a tragic incident occurred in the past in which

a soldier killed his superior officer. Whoever was to be

blamed, the fact remains that this incident took place and

it must have been due to some serious cause. What was the

cause? Was it because of the incompetent leadership of the

officer, or because of his abuse of power, or was it

because of the ferocity or viciousness of the soldier

concerned? I do not know. I believe all officers should

learn something from this incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard the reservists talking about life in

the camp. They talked about certain officers who impressed

them very much, and they have learned something useful from

such officers. At the same time, they also talked about the

bad behaviour of



some officers who used to lose their temper and find fault

without any rhyme or reason, and accused them for not

polishing their shoes well and dressing properly. The

soldiers had to put up with the bossiness of such officers.

The leadership of such officers is comparatively less

effective. We should not only inculcate patriotism and

national consciousness among the rank and file but we

should also see that the leadership qualities of the

officers are raised so that our national servicemen may be

moulded into a good army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, many of my colleagues have touched on the

numerous traffic accidents involving SAF drivers. There was

an accident the day before yesterday. A military truck

first knocked down a car and then a lamp post, before it

finally crashed into a garden and rammed into another car

in the garden. Such an accident is more thrilling and

exciting than what we have seen in the films. I would like

the Minister to inquire into the cause for the frequent

occurrence of such accidents. More care should be taken in

selecting the drivers and training them properly. If the

drivers are not good or not careful, many people could be

killed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I reply very

briefly to the Member for Sembawang? If a lad at the age of

18 has no feelings of patriotism when he joins the Army.

then it is quite impossible within two years to instil in

him any such decent feelings. Therefore, we make no attempt

to do so. I think the Member for Sembawang should remember

what Lenin said, because he is the master in transforming

man's mind. He said if you want to make him a good

Communist, you must start on him at the age of six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for young men being reluctant to become national

service soldiers and not realising the importance of that.

I am afraid there is very little choice. If they do not

turn up when they are called for national service, then

they go to gaol. As for national servicemen having clean

living before they join the Army and developing bad habits

after that, well, maybe that might have happened. But it is

more likely that the parents are not aware what children

they have. Reservists are given make-up pay. If there is

any inconvenience to the employers, then they can make an

application for a deferment of reservist training. As I

have said previously in this House, this was fully

considered and applications are allowed when a case is

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, about good officers and bad officers. The Member for

Sembawang has said that an officer who insists that his men

are clean and tidy and shine their boots, and so on, is a

bad officer. In my view, he is a good officer. Good

officers are seldom liked by soldiers. But they are

respected and they are obeyed, and you therefore get a good

fighting unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that in the Budget Estimates, provision has

been made for certain improvements in nearly every

hospital. May I know what improvements are going to be

carried out in these hospitals, and how could these

improvements be felt when there is an acute shortage of

medical personnel at the moment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of doctors in many hospitals,

and as a result doctors are overworked. At times this

affects the necessary attention of many emergency cases,

resulting in poor treatment of patients. If I may just

quote a recent case. A school van carrying children from

the Serangoon Kindergarten was sending the children home in

Paya Lebar. It skidded along Bartley Road and the children

were badly hurt. Two ambulances arrived around noon and

sent the children to the Toa Payoh Hospital. At Toa Payoh

Hospital the children were not given immediate attention.

The badly injured children were given first aid treatment

only, while the other children with bad facial cuts.

bruises, and one with a torn lip were not given attention.

They were left to be attended by an anaesthetist from the

Singapore General Hospital. This medical officer did not

arrive till late in the evening. Finally at 6.30 p.m, one

of the parents became worried and went to look for a

surgeon at a nearby hospital, namely, the Mount Alvernia

Hospital. The child was rushed to the hospital and an

emergency operation was conducted to stitch the torn lip.

By that time it was too late as the tissues of the torn lip

had dried up and stitching was difficult. This clearly

shows that experienced personnel and equipment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



are not readily available for emergency cases. Something

must be done to make our General Hospital more efficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, outpatient charges had been raised from $2 to $3.

and now it is $4. I wonder whether this is reasonable?

There are times when medicines bought from private

dispensaries or sin seh shops which cost less seem to be

more effective than those given in the hospitals. Why is

this so? I suggest that treatment in the hospitals should

at least be worth the cost the people have to pay. Nobody

wants to be sick. Sickness may befall on a person at any

moment. $4 may be a nominal charge to those who are earning

a very high income, But $4 can go a long way to those in

the lower income group. Furthermore, after the first visit

in which a patient has to pay $4 he may be required to

return for a further check-up. Each time he returns for a

check-up, he has to pay $4 and it goes on until he is

completely cured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there is such a thing as a waiver of charges.

But how often is this given? How willing are the hospital

authorities to grant a waiver of charges to certain

patients? It is quite pathetic to see people suffering

because they are unable to pay their hospital charges. For

instance, recently an old lady who fractured her leg had to

go for an X-ray and was warded. She had to pay for medical

treatment, ward charges and a few other charges. The bill

came to quite an amount, so much so her children withdrew

her from the hospital and did not send her back, simply

because they could not afford to pay for the treatment any

further. Moreover, the poor old lady had to be transferred

from one daughter's house to another, never given a proper

treatment, because her children could not afford to pay it.

Can the Minister reduce the medical charges for the poor?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir, I am not aware of the accident, which the Member for

Anson mentioned just now, involving school children who

were travelling in a bus. If he could give me particulars

of the date and the time when they were taken to Toa Payoh

Hospital, I would be able to find out more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



about the treatment that was given to the accident

victims. However, I can assure the Member for Anson

that it is not true that the Outpatients Unit at Toa

Payoh Hospital is manned by an Anaesthetist. I must

confess that the Accident and Emergency units in the

hospitals are not up to the standard that I would want

them to be, and currently my Ministry is undertaking

an exercise to reform them. We have, in fact, sent

three persons abroad recently to study how emergency

operations are carried out in other hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the cost of ward charges. I can

assure the Member for Anson that there is always a

social worker in the hospitals who looks into the home

background of the patient. If the social worker finds

that such a person is unable to pay for the ward

charges or medical treatment charges, then it is quite

possible for a petition to be made to the Medical

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent who will refer it to the Ministry which

will, in turn, examine the application and, if

necessary, charge at a lower rate or even waive the

charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I think it ought to be made quite clear

that the hospitals do cost the Ministry a very

substantial sum of money and our job really is to

teach the people of Singapore not to get into

hospitals. In fact, I am thinking of a scheme whereby

patients could be treated as outpatients at home

rather than in hospitals, partly because of the

increasing cost of hospital charges and partly because

it has been shown in other countries that more deaths

occur through cross-infection at hospitals than if the

patients had been treated as outpatients. Nonetheless,

I like to assure the Member for Anson that the

Ministry of Health is not that inhumane as to impose a

heavy penalty on very sick patients who deserve a

waiver of fees. If he can put up the case to me, we

can always look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1105*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite often we hear of reports that some nurses in

hospitals have been rude to patients. There are also

allegations that some of them seem to order patients

around, especially those in `C' class wards. On the other

hand, what makes the nurses behave in this manner? Well, to

some extent, it could be that they themselves are not

treated in a proper manner by their superiors. So, under

provocation, with no peace of mind but with pressure of

work, the poor nurses may at times show their frustration

towards the patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints from nurses in the

General Hospitals that some of the Hospital Sisters and

Matrons do not show any tact. They scold, shout or even ill-treat the nurses in the presence of visitors. As there is a

drastic shortage of staff, the nurses are overworked. They

have to do more than their daily assignments, and their

meal-times are very irregular. At times, the nurses have to

work longer than their normal working hours because the

handing over of duties to the next shift is not efficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been occasions when the duty roster was

changed, causing inconvenience. A nurse turned up for the

early shift according to the roster. After working for a

few hours a last-minute change was made and she was told to

go back and to report again for the late shift for that

day. In other words, the nurse reported for the 7 am, to 2

p.m, shift but was told to go back at 10 am, and to come

back again for the night shift beginning at 9 p.m. She was

not compensated for the extra hours that she had put in,

although she was promised. Some of them are told to do odd

jobs in the presence of visitors, thus degrading them or

embarrassing them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the complaints. There are many

other complaints but I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



want to mention them here. However, I trust the Minister

will see that the nurses in the hospitals are treated well

by their superiors and not bullied, so that the patients

will not suffer because of their frustration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe a survey of all registered nurses and

midwives will be carried out by the Ministry very soon. The

information is collected for the future planning of nursing

manpower in hospitals and outpatient clinics in Singapore.

I wonder what will be the outcome of this survey but let us

hope, that we can have better terms of service for our

nursing staff.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Song):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this House

will recall that in the 1973 and 1974 Budget. I voiced

strong reservations about the pathetic state of health of

the Health Ministry and its hospitals.' The then Minister,

and subsequently his rather short-lived Minister of State,

had chosen mischievously to avoid the debate squarely and

instead performed cosmetic surgery to facelift a badly

scarred Ministry. Now that the Ministry changes leadership

after eight lean years, doctors and patients are eagerly

waiting for the rain after the humid long hot summer. A new

Minister brings new hope and expectation, and I have chosen

to speak today confident that a new spirit of dynamism and

enquiry is in motion. Rest assured that, doctors and nurses

are amongst the most agreeable lot of homo sapiens, and our

patients exemplarily patient and tolerant. We shall give

the new Minister plenty of time to settle down to his

unenviable job of salvage and acute resuscitation.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we in Singapore have the best doctor

population ratio of 1: 1200 in South-east Asia. This

measures creditably even against the advanced countries in

the West. Our patient-care is fairly good, though it is

admittedly a long way from ideal. It is also true that

increasing numbers of Malaysians. Indonesians and even

Westerners have come here for medical care



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



making Singapore, in the words of a certain Minister. "the

centre of medical excellence in South-east Asia". We have

never ceased to publicise Singapore's pre-eminence in

medical standards in this part of the world and the medical

profession will continue to promote and organise

international conferences, seminars, and meetings for the

advancement of medical knowledge and expertise. Singapore

is generally well regarded for the quality and standard of

its doctors, specialists and medical services. Unlike

doctors from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, our doctors are

accorded instantaneous full registration in the United

Kingdom and other parts of the Commonwealth. Patients going

to China in the past few years with blind faith seeking

cure with the acupuncturists were sadly disappointed and

referred back to us for medical attention. Chinese medicine

is no magic formula. We take great pride in our medical

school which is 71 years of age today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the entire medical set-up in Singapore

today there is an all-pervading mood of disaffection, and

restlessness among the doctors, dental surgeons, nurses and

even ancillary Division IV staff. The attitude has

regrettably become one of "if-you-can't-stick-it, hang it."

Institutional practice has today become a stepping stone to

private practice. Worse still, and this demands urgent

attention, increasing numbers of doctors and specialists

emigrate to Australia, New Zealand. Canada. United States

and the U.K, seeking greener pastures. It is not enough for

us in the political leadership to say "good luck, bon

voyage and May God Bless You". It is neither correct for us

to just throw stones at these professional people and label

them as "quitters". Why should this sorry state be so?

Surely Hippocrates oath, which every medical student takes

on admission to the University, is not entirely lost. Has

the medical profession shunned the lofty heights of a

sacrifice and selflessness and the noble profession of all

virtue and-no vice? I believe. Sir, many factors

contributed to this sick malaise. I am confident that our

leaders are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



generally aware of the problems facing the medical service.

I feel, however, that notwithstanding the above, the

Ministry's prescriptions to tackle the issues will remain

haphazard and ineffective as long as the medical service

remains a low priority on the Cabinet's abacus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was re-zoned into four catchment areas to

alleviate pressure on the Singapore General Hospital. After

almost a year in operation, demand on the Singapore General

Hospital remains high. It is hoped that with time the

peripheral hospitals will assume a greater load of patient-care. A new Singapore General Hospital costing, in all.

some $200 million is under construction to replace the old

Outram Road General Hospital. A new Teaching Hospital at

Kent Ridge is on the planning board, costing, many millions

more. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister what his plans

are to staff these large hospitals. No doubt more doctors.

specialists, dental surgeons, pharmacists, nurses and

ancillary staff are needed. Otherwise we shall be spending

hundreds of millions of dollars to erect gigantic white

elephants. The Teaching Hospital in a neighbouring country

is a constant reminder that impressive, expensive hospitals

can be built given the money, but finding the required

number of doctors and other staff to run them is to me an

entirely different proposition. To me a happy doctor in a

cow-shed is more productive than a grumbling stethoscope

behind four great walls, and a smiling nurse who calls her

patients first names in a small unassuming hospital is more

therapeutic than that pompous touch-me-not impersonal

creature on two legs that patrol the corridors of imposing

institutions - all morning glory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the then Minister proudly proclaimed that only

90-plus doctors resigned from the service while 110 joined

making a net gain of doctors in the Ministry of Health. To

me this is a very naughty reply from a clever politician.

He omitted the breakdown analysis of these figures in terms

of experience, qualification and training. May I humbly

submit that 90 captains leaving and 110 captains joining

the SAF is quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



different from 90 captains leaving and 110 recruits joining

the SAF. What are the figures for doctor resignations this

year? How many doctors and specialists have emigrated to

other countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew the attention of this House to the high proportion

of non-citizens in the medical school two years ago. In a

graduating class of about 120 last year some 50% were non-citizens and today in our hospitals we have an acute

shortage of housemen. This situation will continue unless

measures are taken with haste to encourage more

Singaporeans to study medicine, I shall be most grateful if

the Hon. Minister could provide figures to show that

corrective measures have been taken to ensure a continuing

supply of new doctors to run our hospitals. As I have

mentioned before, non-citizen graduates of our medical

school are birds of passage: they have amply proven to be

so: and they cannot be relied upon to man our hospitals.

Are we then to recruit doctors from, say, the Indian sub-continent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with dental officers is even more pathetic

and appalling. Because few Singaporeans chose dentistry for

a profession, the Government instead of encouraging

students to study dentistry opted to spend some $5 million

~to train a corps of dental therapists. Each dental

therapist-in-training receives an allowance of about $300

per month. I am amazed at this scheme. If only the same

money were made available in the form of scholarship to

students to take dentistry, I am confident there shall be

in a few years increasing numbers of fully qualified dental

surgeons who are best trained to care for our nation's

dental health. In the meantime Division II registered

dentists and quacks are having a field day. I wonder how

many Members of this august Chamber can claim to have a

family dental surgeon. Equally I wonder how many Members

present here this afternoon have lost salvageable teeth so

necessary for mastication, if not cosmesis by an

inadvertent visit to a dental quack!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are so many doctors and dental surgeons unhappy?

Doctors work long and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



irregular hours, frequently exceeding 100 hours a week.

Their work is exacting, seven days a week. A wrong

diagnosis, an inadequate resuscitation, an incomplete

surgical exploration, otherwise termed surgical

misadventure in the wee hours of the morning when this

Chamber and all Singapore are fast asleep, may end up in

the never-never territory of the inquisitive pathologist at

the mortuary. Patients and relatives rightly demand

courtesy, good manners and care even during odd hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for a salary revision for doctors and dental

surgeons, and I am not satisfied with the mini-adjustments

that were made. The vast majority of medical officers have

seen no change in terms of employment for more than 10

years. Of course, they receive NWC recommendations - who

has not in Singapore? The case of the housemen is a unique

exercise in salary revision. The housemen got a salary

adjustment from $750 to $850 per month last year after an

unfortunate though abortive exercise of not reporting for

work on the first day. They thought initially they had won.

Instead they discovered later that, in fact, they lost. The

Ministry of Health assisted by its clever lieutenants, the

Director of Medical Services and his Deputy Director, won.

How? Annual vacation for housemen was slashed from four

weeks to two weeks. I am sure this House needs a lot of

persuasion that the housemen got a pay rise. May I plead

with the Hon. Minister for fair play and fair reward for a

good day's work. Let us not play games. Let us not resort

to Change Alley tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If doctors cannot be given a fair basic salary

commensurate with their work, then may I suggest they be

paid overtime pay so that the civil service salary

structure need not be disturbed. This is a reasonable

request and details can always be worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.K. last year there was tremendous dislocation of

the medical service when the National Health Service

doctors and hospital consultants went on strike or worked

to rule in their fight for fair pay and service conditions,

and I am sure our doctors here do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



not wish to resort to silly industrial action in pursuit of

fair play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago the then Health Minister reported to this

House that 200 units of flats will be built for doctors

working in public hospitals. Today no further development

is heard. I am reliably informed that the Ministry is still

thinking about it -- one of several thoughts that hopefully

one day will see the light of dawn. Housing is a very

serious problem not just for our doctors but for our young

professionals and our middle income wage earners. It is one

area that the Government can help and must help

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional practice has definite and certain

advantages and opportunities such as training facilities.

experience and work satisfaction that private practice

cannot offer. Few doctors would leave the serviie if they

can be kept reasonably happy at work. If they leave for

private practice, it is more often than not, in pursuit of

money. If this is so, then it is indeed a sad reflection on

the medical profession but sadder still it is a reflection

on the moneytheistic society that we have nurtured over the

last decade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



facilities in their hospitals, they say that our medical

standards are very high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Anson mentioned that some nurses

who were not treated well by their superiors would vent

their grievances on the patients. I think this is possible,

especially those elderly nurses who have to allocate work

to the other nurses. For -instance, on a Sunday the wards

do not need as many nurses, but they would nevertheless

send a great number of nurses to man the wards. If the

Minister were to visit such wards, particularly in the

Maternity Hospital, he would find such instances there. I

think this is one case that the Minister should give his

attention to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain spinster nurses attached to the Family

Planning Unit. These nurses do not have their own families.

So if the Minister wants to promote family planning, I do

not think that it is proper to post spinster nurses to that

Unit. They should not be asked to work in the Family

Planning and Population Board.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am not quite sure

what questions are being asked of me. However, to come to

what the Member for Anson has said with regard to the

behaviour of nurses in our hospitals, I would like to say

that, by and large, I believe the nurses are doing their

best. I would like to ask any Member of this House whether

he would like to take on the job as a nurse and work on a

night shift and, probably with a wife waiting for him in

the house, to see whether he would be able to withstand all

the stresses and strains that are demanded of him without

losing perhaps his composure. That settles the complaint

that nurses are rude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have initiated a scheme in the Ministry whereby nurses

are being encouraged to regard patients as human beings and

not just objects to be treated. Somebody has given us a sum

of $10,000 and this has been deposited in the POSB. The

interest accrued will be used for merit awards to nurses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



commended by the Medical Superintendent or the Heads of

Units. It will not be granted on the basis of patients

voting for the best nurse, because it is not possible to

ask a pediatric patient or a geriatric patient or a

mentally unsound patient at Woodbridge Hospital to vote

which nurse is the best nurse. Hence, we have to have a

scheme which will allow some Unit Heads leeway to judge

which nurses are performing their duty and more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from receiving complaints that nurses are rude, I

have on the other hand received letters, and there have

been letters written in the Chinese papers, commending on

the good behaviour of nurses. I have been very pleased and

I have transmitted these letters to the Medical

Superintendent of the hospital concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe we are facing a situation where it is

impossible or difficult to recruit nurses. On the contrary,

the demand to enter the nursing profession is there and I

can assure the House that we will be able to tap the best

of applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the younger nurses are bullied by their

superiors, that is a matter which I am not aware of. All I

know is that I visited a private hospital recently and when

it was known that I was going to visit this private

hospital, everything was made spick and span. The

attendants and the nurses were alerted. Patients were given

new pyjamas and the Administration told me to come along

again another time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that sometimes the administration of a

hospital can be slack. Because a hospital operates 24 hours

a day for 365 days a year, many of those working in the

hospital - doctors, nurses and paramedical staff - sometimes, do take things for granted and that many of the

routine matters appear to them to be unimportant whereas

they are important to patients. I have emphasised to the

Medical Superintendents that this point must be looked into

and I hope to see a distinct improvement. The Member for

Kim Seng himself incidentally works in the General Hospital

and so he should be in a position to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



know whether there is any improvement or not., If he does

come across rude nurses, please do let me know and if he

comes across affectionate nurses, please also inform me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to emigration of doctors. I am afraid this is

a problem which is of concern to the Government. As such.

we did do a survey on doctors who were in Government

service, asking them the reasons for leaving the Ministry

of Health. The first results which have been evaluated have

come in. The reasons given for leaving Government service

are as follows:



<pre>

 Higher income                              - 48.1%

 More job satisfaction                      - 25.5%

 Better working conditions                  -  5.2%

 More freedom                               -  6.7%

 Completion of contract or termination

   of temporary appointment                 -  4.5%

 Other reasons	                            - 10.0%

</pre>



<br><br>So there are at least 48.1% of doctors who were honest

enough to admit that they were leaving the Government

service because they could earn a higher income. I am just

asking myself: how long is the Member for Kim Seng going to

stay with the University too' I hope he does not let me

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact of life that doctors are mobile. At one

dinner function I had occasion to meet the President of a

Royal College of Surgeons from the United Kingdom. I asked

him why did he study medicine instead of engineering, since

his country was in the forefront of the industrial

revolution and that engineers performed a dominant role in

promoting economic growth in his country. His answer was

very simple: medicine is the most secure job. It means that

doctors can move about, particularly doctors in the English

speaking world. Singapore doctors are brought up in the

English language and so they are welcome to migrate to

Australia. Canada, the United Kingdom. New Zealand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



and the United States. It is a fact of life that many of

our young graduates, while preparing for the final year for

M,B.B.S., do go up to Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur to take the

external examination conducted oy the American Council for

Foreign Medical Graduates, so that after they have

graduated they could put after their names "M.B.B.S.,

E.C.F.M.G.". I am not sure whether the Member for Kim Seng

has done that, but he should know as he has lived in a

hospital among the medical undergraduates, most of whom

have done this. This applies not just to the Malaysian

undergraduates but also the Singapore graduates as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that we are critically short of doctors, I have

no  hesitation to impose compulsory national  service  .for

women  doctors, just as of this moment  male  doctors  are

obliged  to undergo 2� years' national   service.  Some  of

these  national service doctors come under the  control  of

the Ministry of Health. Others are under the      Singapore

Armed Forces. There is indeed a complaint about discrepancy

between  the     treatment accorded to male  graduates  and

female graduates and I give due notice that (it may  be  at

some  future date) I will make it compulsory for all  those

who have undergone an expensive medical education to return

in  kind by performing similarly 2� years' service  in  the

Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recruitment, loss and establishment

strength  of doctors. I can provide figures for four  years

as follows:



<pre>



              Number of Doctors

                         Resigned

           Recruited     or Retired   Net Gain

1972           61            59          2

1973          144            61         83

1974          119            87         32

1975           90            74         16



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that those whom we recruited were of

medical officer grade and many of them did not have a

higher or postgraduate medical qualification. Some of those

whom we lost did have seniority and specialist

qualifications. In 1975. 13 Singapore citizen doctors with

a higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



qualification and 42 without a higher qualification, had

resigned. Among Malaysian citizen doctors, no one with a

higher qualification had resigned, but nine without a

higher qualification had resigned. One doctor from India

with a higher qualification had also resigned and there

were others too - one with a higher qualification and two

without a higher qualification - who had resigned. I must

confess that it is not a good trade-off -losing an

experienced doctor and gaining inexperienced medical

officers. But we have to face the fact of life that many

doctors do make use of our hospitals and the University as

a stepping stone whereby they can acquire experience at

public expense and after some time they resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was at the University it was very marked indeed

that the moment someone was promoted to an Associate

Professor, he was called "Professor" by his students and

patients. In less than three years, most of them would

resign. So knowing that this is the way doctors behave, I

think the remarks of the Member for Kim Seng should be

directed at his own colleagues and not to the Minister for

Health who, after all, is trying his hardest to keep the

doctors. It is not in my position to go along and give them

more money. This is a prerogative of the Treasury which

ties salaries up to other professions. But if taxpayers are

willing to pay a special sum of money for better health

service, then we can suitably reward doctors, nurses and

other para-medical staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Kim Seng were to go round and propagate

his idea that there should be a special health service tax.

then I think it is quite possible for us to retain our more

senior doctors so that they do not go into private practice

or migrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live to regret what I said in a speech when I was at

the University - that Orchard Road was the Harley Street of

Singapore. The end result was that "specialist centres"

popped up all over the place. Orchard Road is bigger than

Harley Street now. Anybody who has got a little cubicle in

the complex called the Specialist's Centre becomes a

specialist.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Whether or not this helps the migration of doctors from the

public sector to the private sector is debatable. I thought

I was boosting the morale of the doctors, but it turned out

to the disadvantage of the Ministry of Health and the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that doctors are not stupid. They do read

their newspapers. They follow political events in the

region and they know what has happened in Indo-China. When

a three-star General buzzes off to the United States, he

becomes either a taxi-driver or a waiter in a restaurant.

On the other hand, ri you are a doctor and you migrate to

the United States you are wanted. I have my own forebodings

that a good number of our doctors in Singapore are

registered not only in Singapore but also registered

overseas, because Australia. New Zealand and the United

Kingdom permit the registration of doctors even though

their physical presence is not required in those countries.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember it was last year, just before the Australian

Government announced the closure of its registry for

medical doctors, when I was told the story that SIA was

carrying Singapore doctors to Perth or Sydney and Qantas

was bringing them back, These are human failings and

doctors are not without their failings. I would be the last

person to say that doctors are "Gods". Although they are

healers, they do look after their own welfare as well. Let

us be honest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng would be a good Political

Secretary to me if he is willing to serve in my Ministry at

a salary of $1,750 per month. He can resign from his

present post in the University where he is probably getting

more than I can give. He can be my Political Secretary and

do a little campaigning on how to keep our doctors in the

Ministry and in Singapore. It will not be a great loss as

long as these doctors stay and practise in Singapore. But

it will be a loss when they migrate. It is a fact of life

that even Colombo Plan scholars who were sent abroad to

study medicine, had paid up their bonds at substantial

rates, $40,000 each, and just buzzed off.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was responsible for trying to bring the establishment

of the Medical Department in the University of Singapore to

full strength by changing the scheme of service in the

University, hoping to get better and brighter young doctors

willing to teach. But unfortunately not all of them have

lived up to my expectation. Worse still, the seniors have

set the bad example in that after promotion either to the

professorship, associate professorship or even to senior

lecturership, they would pack off within three years or so.

This is the answer to the Member for Kim Seng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the nurses, my sympathies are always with them.

Mind you, if you are a patient in a hospital, you see the

doctor only once in the morning. But the nurses see you for

24 hours a day. If I were the Member for Anson, I would be

very careful when talking about the behaviour of the

nurses, because they are going to look after me for 24

hours a day. The doctor diagnoses the ailment and puts the

stethoscope to your chest. The technician takes your

electrocardiogram. The doctor then prescribes the medicine

and that is that. It is the nurses who give you the

medicine and the injection. It can be very painful

sometimes if they inject you at the wrong place. Mr

Speaker. Sir, I really do not know how to put my finger on

the particular problem that the Member for Anson or the

Member for Kim Seng has raised,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one point raised by the Member for Kim Seng is about

dental therapists. In China they have what they call "bare-foot" doctors. It is a very simple philosophy which is

being practised in many developing countries, viz., make

the most use of whatever manpower resources you have. It is

impossible for a country with 800 million people to provide

medical services of the standard that we see in Western

countries. I do not see how China will ever have such large

numbers of Western-trained doctors to serve every commune

in the countryside. Therefore, they have a short course of

three years for "barefoot" doctors after which they can

provide primary health care.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same situation applies to Singapore, particularly to

dentistry. I do not say that Division II dentists are

quacks. By gosh! I have not yet been to a Division II

dentist but my old amah used to go to a Division II dentist

and she paid only $3 for a tooth extraction, If she had

gone to a Division I dentist she would have to pay $30

There is an enormous difference in fees between going to a

Division I dentist and a Division II dentist. The dental

therapists that we are recruiting will come from the dental

nurses who would have to have a minimum of five years'

experience after three years' training. Dental students who

graduate from the University of Singapore undergo a mere

four-year course of training, immediately after which, even

without housemanship, they are allowed to treat patients by

themselves. On the other hand, dental therapists are not

permitted to do so. Even after training for four years,

they need to have ten years' supervision by professionally

qualified dentists before they are allowed to go on their

own. Therefore, if a patient has to decide whether he

wishes to be treated by an experienced person or by an

inexperienced one, he would rather be treated by a person

who has the requisite experience. Much of the bread-and-butter of dentistry involves simple filling and extraction,

Dental therapists are not allowed to perform an operation

on the soft tissues. They are not allowed to do

orthodontics whereas the professional dentists are allowed

to do so.The difference is that dental therapists do not

have the two year-course of Higher School Certificate that

the University dentists have. All in all. I think it is

very unfair for the Member for Kim Seng, who has just

returned from London and who was not here when the Dentists

Registration (Amendment) Bill was passed, to give the poor

dental therapists a bashing. We have got the first batch of

dental therapists in the first year of training. They will

not pass out until after 1978. Even so, they would have to

have another 10 years' supervised experience before they

can be out on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a mistake of the Ministry of Health to have

allowed the Division II dentists'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



registry to run down. The end result is that dental

assistants who had been hired by these dentists are finding

themselves out of job because their bosses have retired and

they have not been replaced. I know it because they have

written to me. We have got to understand what exactly it is

that we are prepared to pay for. If the taxpayer in

Singapore is prepared to pay a special levy for medical and

dental services, then I would be fully in favour of

charging the taxpayer accordingly and give the service that

he is asking for. But the Member for Anson earlier on

complained about the increase in hospital fees. Here, we

have a contradiction. On the one hand he wants a service

and on the other hand he refuses to pay. You cannot have

your cake and eat it. Either you pay for what you consume

or you do not consume because you cannot pay. Again, this

is a problem which is being examined very closely in my

Ministry apart from the other programmes which we hope to

implement within the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above all this. I would like to emphasise that

the Ministry of Health's primary function is probably less

curative and more on preventive medicine. The way to do it

is to activate medical education for the man-in-the-street,

so that he learns how not to fall sick and, therefore, how

not to go to the hospital. It is not necessary for a sick

person to be referred immediately to a hospital. There are

outpatient dispensaries where doctors are well qualified to

examine the patients and the charge is only $3, including

medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that the medicine

dispensed by the hospitals is not effective whereas the

medicine dispensed by the Chinese sin sehs is effective. He

rather shook me. If that is true, then I think we ought to

close down our hospitals and advise all patients to seek

whatever treatment is available in town. But I do not

believe it is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have allowed the Minister to go on

longer than what he is allowed. Unless he really gets on,

we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

Health.

nurses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> If the Minister were to go to a

hospital  without prior notice, he will then find out  what

is  actually happening there. But if he were to ring up the

Director  of  Medical Services and say  that  he  would  be

right.  He must make a surprise check in order to find  out

what is going on in the hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another amendment under subhead BAA 1 107*. (*The amendment reads as follows:-

(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1107.)

My comments on both these subheads are related and, as such.

could I have your permission to range my comments on both subheads?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Thank you. Sir. The Minister for

Health has tried to explain away the shortage of doctors in

the Ministry of Health. But I am sure that not only myself

but other Members of the House are still not too happy with

his explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a reduction of 55 Division I posts in

subhead AAA 1111. I can reasonably assume that in the

Ministry of Health most of the Division I posts would be

held by doctors. If my presumption is correct, then the

reduction in the posts of doctors is, to say the least, a

little disturbing. Is the reduction provided for because

the Ministry is unable to fill the present establishment

vacancies of 398 Division I officers? There have always

been complaints of a shortage of doctors in Government

hospitals. What is the position now? Why is there this

reduction of 55 posts in subhead AAA 1111?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of doctors in the Government

service. It is, therefore, disturbing to note that so many

qualified doctors are performing administrative ,functions

in the Ministry of Health. Some of these doctors have been

trained at high cost, and many of them are specialists who

are in short supply. It would be more appropriate to

utilise these trained specialists and doctors in treating

the poor than to make them fill up forms, statistics,

ordering hospital equipment and other supervisory functions

which could very well be performed by non-professional

administrative officers. I am told that in advanced

countries there are special courses for hospital

administrators who need not be qualified doctors. Could we

also not look forward to the day when our doctors will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



employed only to cure the sick and not for filling up

forms?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints of doctors in the Government

service is that there are insufficient promotion prospects

in our medical service. That is one of the `easons why many

doctors have resigned. Of course, the other main reason is

that they could hope to make more money in private

practice. Although the Minister for Health mentioned that

48.1% of our doctors have resigned because there is more

money outside than in the public service, I believe the

figure could be much more than 48.1%. If money is the only

reason for their leaving, it is deplorable to find that

dedication to curing the sick is associated with the amount

of money that can be made. Perhaps, there must be something

wrong with our teachings in schools, or, more in the case

of doctors, our teachings in the medical faculty of our

University. There have also been cases of our professional

people, doctors included, emigrating from Singapore. This

was accepted by the Minister just now. One begins to wonder

if, in the University, whilst teaching medicine proper

ethics are also being taught with regard to saving I yes as

well as the social obligation to the people of Singapore

who foot the bulk of the bill of the School of Medicine.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints of lack of promotion prospects are genuine and

yet under BAA 1106, the Senior Physician, Grade D post, has

been abolished. Under BAA 1107, three posts of Deputy

Medical Superintendents. Grade E, positions have also been

abolished. Similar reductions of senior posts are `also to

be found in the Toa Payoh Hospital. This is not conducive

to our retaining senior doctors who aspire to be promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that in the Physiotherapy Department, with an

establishment complement of 32 physiotherapists, we only

have 22. This is a shortage of 31%. For the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32 physiotherapists on the establishment, there is only one

promotion post of a senior physiotherapist. Some

physiotherapists have worked for 13-14 years without any

promotions or any prospects for promotions in the near

future. Turnover is very high I am told. In recent years.

industrial accident cases have been referred to the

Physiotherapy Department more frequently than ever, so that

the department is unable to cope with and to give

sufficient help to the victims. Rehabilitation of

industrial accident cases has been neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our specialists and Heads of Medical Units

resigned without training other officials under them to

take over, creating a vacuum. Sometimes one begins to

wonder if they are deliberately creating a scarcity.

thereby making themselves indispensable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be grateful that not all Heads of Units and

specialists are in this category. I was therefore very

pleased to note that the President found it fit to bestow

the Meritorious Service Medals on Professors Wong Hock Boon

and Seah Cheng Siang for their devoted service in

establishing and training specialists in their School of

Post-Graduate Medical Studies, Together with these two

professors, we must also be grateful to the team of other

lecturers and staff who assist them in their training of

specialists in this School of Post-Graduate Medical

Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint of doctors who have resigned is about

the poor working conditions in our hospitals. In the case

of the Singapore General Hospital, the complaint is

generally true. I know because I have been there. In some

wards, no private rooms are available for doctors to do

their work or rest when they are on call or on a long

stretch of duty. There is a vote in the Development

Estimates for improvement and redevelopment of the

Singapore General Hospital. I hope this complaint will be

taken care of from this vote



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the reduction of 55

Division I posts, as mentioned by the Member for Telok

Blangah, is due to the fact that there is now available

local post-graduate training facilities. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



are supernumerary posts which were held against doctors who

once upon a time were sent abroad for training. But as we

now have these facilities, it is considered not necessary

to have that large number of supernumerary posts. However,

that does not mean that we do not want to recruit an

equivalent number of doctors. I must confess that the

Establishment List presented by the Ministry of Finance is

more mystifying than clarifying. I myself had to do a

little piece of research to answer the question which has

been raised by the Member for Telok Blangah. May I refer

him to this little booklet called the Establishment List of

Singapore for the Financial Year 1st April, 1976 (031st

March, 1977 (Paper Cmd. 4 of 1976). I was very puzzled

indeed why there was a reduction of three posts at Grade E

level in the Singapore General Hospital. Let me do a little

explanation. I wonder whether the Member for Telok Blangah

has got a copy of this book.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes. I have.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If he were to turn to page 39, under

subhead BAA 1109, Radiologist. Grade G, he will see down

there Note (iii) which says. "Includes one prf Senior

Radiologist. Grade E. One ms (107)." So I had to go and

find out what is the meaning of "prf" and "ms". If he turns

to page 5, he will find out what is the meaning of "prf".

It says. "Post(s) regraded from ..." and "ms" means

"Present holder promoted on merit to scale  . That is one.

If he looks under "Surgeon. Grade G, there is a footnote

(iv) which says. "Two prf Senior Surgeon. Grade E and two

prt Senior Registrar/Registrar/Medical Officer

(111/116/124). Two ms (107)." All that it adds up to is

that these are three physical bodies who have been promoted

to Grade E although they were holding a post in Grade G.

They have recently undergone a promotion exercise and so

they are in Grade

E. So there is no loss at all in the total number of Grade

E posts. If he were to go through the pages for the

Ministry of Health, he will find similar explanations as

given in the footnotes. I am afraid this is a sort of Alice

in Wonderland puzzle for me. It is like a Cheshire cat.

Sometimes it eats and sometimes it does not eat.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, as I said, I am just wondering

whether this is all done deliberately to confuse the people

into believing that we have got sufficient Surgeons and

sufficient senior officers. However, since I have got some

more amendments later on. I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BHA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how Changi Hospital is being managed.

Recently a motorcyclist who was travelling along Upper

Changi Road met with a serious accident. It is believed

that a motor car which was coming from the opposite

direction overtook a moving bus and collided head-on into

this poor motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was very badly

injured in the left leg and lost a right knee cap. After

the accident, the driver of the car abandoned his vehicle

and fled. A number of people gathered to see the injured

boy who appealed for help, but none gave him a helping

hand. Fortunately a few off-duty workers who were

travelling along that road saw the plight of this poor boy.

They took the initiative to take the boy up to the Changi

Hospital. This is where the comedy begins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital authorities at Changi did not treat the

injured boy simply because the hospital did not have the

necessary facilities and expertise to treat his injuries.

He was then taken back by the off-duty workers to the scene

of the accident and left to lie there. In the meantime, an

ambulance had gone to the scene of the accident and left,

Another ambulance had to be summoned by some people to come

and fetch the injured boy to the Singapore General Hospital

for immediate attention, Three hours had elapsed before a

major operation was performed. What is important is that

the authorities at Changi Hospital should have taken

immediate steps to send the boy in their own ambulance to

the nearest hospital that has got the facilities to treat

the boy, instead of leaving him to the off-duty workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



who then decided to take him back to the scene of the

accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder why the Changi Hospital cannot manage with

such emergency cases. I hope the Minister will see that

ample facilities and expertise are made available at this

hospital as many housing estates are coming up in the

outskirts of this locality. Therefore, a fully equipped

hospital is necessary to serve the people living in that

area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Changi military hospital is

under the administration of the Ministry of Defence, and I

am afraid I am unable to answer the Member's question.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Changi military hospital has

been taken over by the Government, and the Alexandra

Hospital has also been taken over by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is that the

Changi military hospital is under the administration of the

Ministry of Defence and not under the Ministry of Health,

although it is true that the Ministry of Health has got a

few of its professional staff there to assist the soldier-doctors in the Changi Hospital. I am in no position at all

to explain away the negligence which the Member for Anson

has mentioned just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to inform the House that currently

there is correspondence going on between my Ministry and

the Ministry of Defence as to who is going to take over the

administration and responsibility of running the Changi

military hospital, If it is going to accept civilian

patients, then of course the Ministry of Health will have

to have a hand in its administration and running thereof.

But I must inform the House that as of this moment,

national servicemen are in charge of the Changi military

hospital. A statement has been issued to say that it is

prepared to accept civilian patients. I think the statement

came out two weeks ago. We should correctly make the

fullest use of the hospital. But if we were to run the

military hospital as a civilian hospital, then the cost of

running it is going to be very high indeed, because we have

to pay the hospital staff civilian rates of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



pay whereas national servicemen are being paid

national service rates of pay. And there is an

enormous difference as far as the Ministry of Finance

is concerned. Hence, the correspondence that is going

on between my Ministry and the Ministry of Defence.

But I am quite sure that in the end the Finance

Ministry will have the last say. However. I would

like to point out that civilians are now being

accepted by the Changi military hospital.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced

by $10 in respect of item Ii) of subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having thrown so many brickbats at the

Ministry of Health, I now move this amendment to

congratulate the Family Planning and Population Board

on their excellent performance. If our population

growth has been checked and if we have achieved some

success in population control, it is due in no small

measure to the work of the Family Planning and

Population Board. Credit must go to them. Our average

annual birth rate was 1.7% for the period 1971-74 and

the present birth rate of less than 1 .4% is an

achievement better than expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the trade unions have found the officers of the

Board most cooperative and helpful in organising

educational programmes for our workers as well as in

the organisation of regional seminars on family

planning and population growth. The Board should also

be congratulated for conducting family planning

education programmes in community centres and other

youth organisations. The two-child norm has its

required impact on our society. But I am afraid that

all this good work will come to nothing if, in our

hospitals, those mothers who go for ligation are not

treated with care, consideration and understanding.

Let me not say anything more about the hospitals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Member

for Telok Blangah for giving a bouquet to the Family

Planning and Population Board. I was expecting a

brickbat.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BCA 2532.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (a) of subhead CDA 3011.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am not moving my next two

amendments, in deference to the Member for Kim Seng who

has got an amendment to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 8103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is in regard to the redevelopment of the

Singapore General Hospital. The new Singapore General

Hospital is going to cost the Government something like

$200 million in total. With a provision of about 1 .900

beds as compared to 1 .400 beds at present, this new

hospital will therefore require more staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to the statements made by previous

speakers, I would like in brief, firstly, to ask the

Minister responsible if he would try to encourage more

people to join the staff of the new General Hospital, and

if he has made any move to ensure that the 200 units of

housing promised for medical officers in this House two

years ago would be implemented? Secondly, in order to

encourage more people to take up the medical profession.

would he reconsider the slashing of the two weeks

vacation leave of the house officers? Will the two weeks'

leave be restored? Thirdly, would he consider overtime

pay for the medical staff? Fourthly, with the

redevelopment of the Singapore General Hospital on the

same campus as the University Faculty of Medicine, would

he encourage more Singaporeans to go into the Faculty of

Medicine, thereby cutting down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



the number of non-citizens who are at present taking up

places which could very well be given to our own citizens?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, to answer the last

question first. It will be ideal indeed if more Singapore

citizens were to opt for medicine or dentistry. If there

was a reduction in the number of Singapore students wishing

to do this discipline. I put the blame fully and squarely

upon the professional associations themselves, the

Singapore Medical Association and the Singapore Dental

Association. At some point of time they did put out

statements that Singapore was having a surplus of doctors

and that there were no jobs for dentists. The net result of

it all was that parents who read that statement in the

newspapers believed that there was no future for their

children if they did medicine and dentistry. And.

therefore, we landed in a situation where we had to scrape

the bottom of the barrel for Singapore students doing

medicine and dentistry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the University, I remembered very clearly

that we had to lower the number of points to admit

Singapore citizens into the Medical school. I do not think

that was a very good idea because the result is that we are

going to have third-class doctors. If someone is prepared

to be trained or treated by third-class doctors, that is

all right with him. But I am not going to be treated by a

third-class doctor. I think it will do the Medical school

every harm if it was said that our students are less than

mediocre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in the field of dentistry, we are taking in

students who opted for dentistry not as their second choice

but their third or fourth choice. And so we ended up with

having three or four Singapore citizens opting to do

dentistry for a few years. It was only last year that we

got a good number of Singapore citizens opting to do

dentistry, even so not all of them chose dentistry as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



their  first  choice. What I have said for  dentistry  also

applies to medicine.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh, you have only

three more minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To answer the other question of housing

for doctors, I have looked into this problem. I am given to

understand that HUDC flats are now available for sale to

doctors, and therefore the urgency to provide housing no

longer exists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the two weeks' leave and overtime pay for

medical officers are concerned, I would suggest to the

Member for Kim Seng that he writes to me and I will take it

up. I am quite curious about the two weeks' leave for

medical officers. I did not know that the two weeks' leave

was cancelled. I do not have any idea about the overtime

pay. I have to be very careful about overtime pay because I

am in no position to guarantee overtime pay. There will be

other civil servants who will also demand overtime pay. I

think Ministers deserve some overtime pay too!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am not terribly impressed with

the  reply,  but it is much better to have  a  short  reply

rather  than  a  verbose one. In any case I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $182,257,480 for Head L ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $52,576,100 for Head L ordered to stand part

of the Development Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head M -



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1003*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ho See Beng and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment gives me the opportunity to ask of

the  Minister for his overview of the development of  post-Vietnam  politics in relation to the neutrality  of  South-east Asia and to super power assertions in the region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may be the realistic expectations of ASEAN countries

of adequately meeting the difficulties likely to confront

them in the years ahead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the ideal

foreign relation situation for Singapore is to be a friend

of all and enemy of none. I am referring to our foreign

relation situation towards the super powers. It has been

acknowledged that the best way of maintaining good

relations with these super powers is to hold them at an

equal distance. We all know that our Foreign Minister is an

able diplomat. Could he tell us the position of our

relationship with these super powers, and whether it has

been maintained at an equal distance?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, during the past few

weeks much has been said about ASEAN. I must congratulate

our officials in leaving a very good impression of

Singapore at the recent ASEAN Summit Conference at Bali.

With this important meeting we seem to have developed

closer ties in many respects with our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noticed in the Estimates that provisions of

$231,500 and $2,500,000 have been allocated for

contributions to the ASEAN Central Secretariat in Jakarta

and the ASEAN Fund respectively. May I know what role

Singapore will play in this ASEAN Secretariat? Sir.

provision has also been made for ASEAN training awards. I

wonder how many Singaporeans so far have benefitted from

these ASEAN training awards. Under this item, what courses

are being made available for this year for ASEAN people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to know what is the basis of posting

our civil servants to our embassies abroad. How long after

being attached to the Ministry are they posted to our

embassies? To-date how many of them are still waiting to be

posted overseas? I raise this question because I gather

that a number of our civil servants have resigned from this

Ministry because of delays in their postings abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement I gather that the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs is also one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



the Ministries that is short of Division I officers. How

does this shortage affect our attempt to open missions or

embassies in foreign countries. Does this shortage in any

way affect our overseas missions for purposes of trade? May

I also ask how successful have we been in all our

delegations that have gone overseas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that our trade with Japan, the USA and the

European countries has declined during the past few years.

What are our embassies in these countries doing to make

sure that there is an improvement in trade?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago our Foreign Minister led a successful

delegation to China. May I know what is the outcome of this

particular mission? Have we in any way developed a two-way

trade with China? Or has it been one way most of the time?

We have created special port facilities for ships from

China. Obviously we are importing a lot of Chinese goods

either for local consumption or for re-export. What has

been China's response towards Singapore-made goods, and

have we been successful in selling our products to them?



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I would like to answer the

questions raised by the Members for Serangoon Gardens and

Bras Basah at one go. I am also very glad to find that some

of our hon. Members are also concerned with the external

situation, especially after the ASEAN Summit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation regarding the super-powers or the great

powers in this region has reached a new kind of power

relations. After the Vietnam war all Members are aware that

American troops have been withdrawn from Vietnam and there

is also a scaling down of American presence in Thailand. In

fact, with the present mood of the US Congress, the

Americans are not in favour of putting a high stake in

South-east Asia. They do not want to be the policeman in

South-east Asia any more. If the United States show any

more interest in this region, it will be purely in

accordance with their global strategy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Members are aware of the Sino-Soviet feud

in this region. We, being a very small nation and as a

member of ASEAN, must, as the non-communist bloc in this

region, try to solve our own problems. Of course, we

welcome the great powers in the region. We welcome them if

they are able to contribute towards our economic

development and in investments and other constructive

fields. If this helps us to raise our standard of living it

is to our mutual benefit. But we must also be careful not

to become pawns in this great power struggle of

international politics. We should not be involved in their

struggle. I think that is what the hon. Members for Bras

Basah and Serangoon Gardens have in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to become a battle field or proxies of the

great powers in the region. If they want to have any

conflict, please leave us alone, although we welcome their

presence here for constructive purposes. I think it is also

in the interest of the great powers to avert the danger of

turning small wars into major conflicts. We have seen this

in other parts of the world when the great powers

inevitably got involved in bigger struggles. Therefore, it

is in their interest not to do the same in South-east Asia.

If they sincerely want world peace, then it is to their own

benefit not to get the small countries in this region

involved in their own conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with the Member for Bras Basah

that we should be friends to all and enemy to none. The

cornerstone of our foreign policy is to make as many

friends as possible. But sometimes I do not think it is

possible to avoid making enemies. If we extend the hand of

friendship, we expect a reciprocal response to the hand of

friendship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not one of the ASEAN leaders has ever criticised

any of the Communist states in Indo-China either before.

during or after the Bali Summit. In fact, if anything was

mentioned, it was always a gesture of friendship to the

newly emerged states in Indo-China, particularly in

sympathy with the long years of suffering they had had.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after the Bali Summit, a Hanoi newspaper

openly encouraged Communist elements in ASEAN countries to

overthrow the legitimate governments of ASEAN. This. I must

say, is quite disappointing because we have extended the

hand of friendship. We hope the newspaper statement does

not really represent the real feelings of all the people in

lndo-China. If that is the attitude, then it is against the

spirit of Bandung or even in the spirit of the nonaligned

group, the basic fundamental principle of which is non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. We

hope that all countries in South-east Asia, whether

communist or non-communist, will abide by this principle,

call it what you will, the Bandung spirit or the spirit of

the non-aligned group. It is only in that spirit can we

have peace and prosperity in the region and all the peoples

in the region will benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this might have been just a misunderstanding

of the real nature of ASEAN, because we have been separated

for so long. We have been under different colonial regimes

and they have just gone through a long revolution. It takes

time and we hope that with the passage of time this

misunderstanding will be cleared. Once this is so, then the

extent of cooperation between ASEAN and the Communist

states in Indo-China will be unlimited. We hope that

together we can cooperate constructively in the economic

and social fields so that the people in South-east Asia

will not become pawns in the super-power or great power

struggle and we can help each other to raise the standard

of living of all the peoples of South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our immediate task, as far as ASEAN is

concerned, is to consolidate the unity and spirit of

cooperation of the five ASEAN states. That is exactly what

we are doing. The Bali Summit was followed by the Kuala

Lumpur meeting of finance and economic planners, and I am

sure Members have read in the newspapers of the latest

developments. These are solid projects which are being

taken seriously by each individual ASEAN state, and we are

in the process of implementing such projects. We hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



the success of these small projects will bring about the

development of bigger projects. According to the agreement,

we hope to have some form of trade preferential arrangement

for the products of these projects in ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as far as the Member for Anson's question about

Singapore's role is concerned, we are a financial centre

with better facilities for technology, and we hope that

with the cooperation of all our ASEAN partners we can

together develop the natural resources of this region for

the benefit of all the people of ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point which I like to stress here is that, in order to

succeed in the collective effort of economic cooperation.

all sections of the community in the ASEAN states must bear

in mind the spirit of give-and-take and to do away with the

old habit of trying to make a quick buck. There may be some

who try to cash in on such projects and we hope that

entrepreneurs, particularly in Singapore, do not give the

impression that some of them are exploiting the situation.

Similarly, we hope that in the other states some of the old

habits will also disappear so that there will be real

cooperation in a common effort to bring about a successful

conclusion of the projects.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the ASEAN Secretariat, it was agreed last

year that the Secretariat should be based in Jakarta. At

the last meeting in Bali they have agreed to appoint Lieut.-Gen. Hartono Dharsono, an experienced Senior Indonesian

diplomat, to be the first Secretary-General whose term of

office will be two years. Subsequently Secretary-Generals

will also have a term of two years. Appointment will be

rotated among the ASEAN countries in alphabetical order.

The senior staff of the Secretariat shall initially

comprise three Bureau Directors, one Foreign Trade and

Economic Relations Officer, an Administrative Officer, a

Public Information Officer and an assistant to the

Secretary-General. The Bureau Directors shall be at least

of consular rank and each of the other officers shall be at

least of First Secretary rank. The principal consideration

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



all such nominations and appointments shall be the

attainment of the highest standards of professional

efficiency, integrity and the equitable distribution and

rotation of the post among the nationals of the ASEAN

countries. Singapore will nominate two officers to fill

these posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ASEAN training awards, they are offered by

Singapore to other ASEAN member countries. Hence,

Singaporeans are not eligible for these awards. These

training awards comprise on-the-job attachments to the

various Ministries and departments. The philosophy

underlying the offer of these training awards is to share

our experience and skill with other ASEAN member countries

so as to promote mutual understanding, and to contribute to

our common endeavour to accelerate economic development in

the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year 1976-77 Singapore is offering 112 training

awards in 37 courses to ASEAN member countries. The fields

of training vary from banking and finance to chemical and

microbiological analysis of meat and meat products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On trade missions, last year we had six, either Government-led or -

that the misunderstanding which he has mentioned could be

clarified?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, it appears to me that the other

Members would prefer you to go on. You might as well do

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> If they so wish. We have diplomatic

relations with Hanoi. We also have diplomatic relations

with Cambodia and Laos. But we do not have a mission in

these countries because of the latest developments. The

same applies to the members of the other ASEAN states. It

is difficult to establish any kind of dialogue when there

is no mission in these countries. We can only make gestures

of friendship, but these gestures of friendship have been

rebuffed with a hostile statement. It is rather difficult

to talk about having a dialogue at the moment. As the

Member for Bras Basah has said, we want to be friends. I

agree entirely with him that we want to be friends. But

when the hand of friendship is extended, we expect a

similar response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you will allow me to continue with my answer to

the Member for Anson. Otherwise he will protest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister of State had better carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I was talking about trade missions

just now. Some of the missions are Government-led and some

are Government-assisted. We had six trade missions last

year. We have visited Indonesia, Iran, China and Eastern

Europe. Trade has been generated through orders taken for

our local products during such missions. But more important

is the fact that these missions have enabled our traders to

establish useful contacts with their counterparts in the

countries visited. Initial contacts established during

these missions have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



enabled many of our traders and manufacturers to boost

their sales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of trade with Japan, the USA and Europe.

the 1975 Economic Survey of Singapore shows that our trade

with these countries has grown steadily over the past few

years, except in 1975 when there was a general world-wide

depression. Prospects for 1976 are, however, better, as

there are already signs of economic recovery in these

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the role of embassies in promoting Singapore's

overseas  trade,  our missions maintain  surveillance  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, this is an item on which I intend to

speak  at  a later stage. I would rather have my  say  now

before the Minister of State replies to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I will do that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was hoping the Minister of State will

deal with the whole lot of questions raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> In that case I will come back to the

subject of our visit to China because the Member for Anson

has raised this question. But to give the Member for Jalan

Kayu an opportunity, I will deal with his question later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the visit to China was successful. It

was the first time that leaders of the two countries had

direct discussions on matters of mutual interest. During

the visit we had the opportunity to meet the late Premier,

Mr Chou En-lai, and we held detailed discussions with the

Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Ch'iao Kuan-hua. The topic of

discussion covered international affairs, matters connected

with regional politics as well as bilateral relations

between the two countries. The discussions were free and

frank and the participants were able to exchange views on

broad international problems. Other members of the

Singapore mission also had discussions on economic matters

with their counterparts. Both sides have agreed to promote

closer economic cooperation. As a result of the visit.

China and Singapore exchanged trade and industrial missions

in the latter part of 1975.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question of overseas

postings. There is a special course of three months'

training at the University of Singapore. After two years'

training in the various Ministries, including the Ministry

of Finance, Trade Division, the EDB and in other matters

which a diplomat should know, the officer is then sent

overseas. I can assure the Member for Anson that there were

actually two resignations. There was no lack of officers.

We have enough officers for our missions for the time

being. It is not easy to choose a suitable officer to be a

diplomat overseas because he represents Singapore and we

must be careful that he has the knowledge, qualification

and also integrity, mannerism and personality for the job.

All these qualities have to be taken into consideration. I

think I will give other Members a chance to raise their

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I am very appreciative of the reply

given by the Minister of State, and I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the lengthy statement by the Minister of State

for Foreign Affairs, my entire trend of thought has been

thrown into disarray. I would, therefore, attempt to throw

his trend of thought into disarray by asking a question

which he probably would not expect. Under this subhead. I

would, first of all, take this opportunity to discuss

Singapore's position, on which he has touched earlier on in

regard to our relations and postures towards super power

politics.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the world is so polarised not just

into two areas but into three or even more spheres of

influence. Whilst on the one hand Singapore propounds a

policy of neutrality, friendship with all nations, enemies

with none, yet Singapore adopts a posture of establishing

full diplomatic relations with some super powers and yet

not with China, It is in this context



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



that I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Hon.

Minister of State: what are the considerations in the mind

of his Ministry before Singapore establishes full

diplomatic relations with China?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is part of ASEAN and three out of five ASEAN

states have already, for various reasons which are

obviously sound, established diplomatic relations with

China over the last two or three years. Singapore has

chosen for good reasons not to establish relations with

China just yet. I recognise that we have various channels

of communication as established in the past and the recent

visit of the Minister of State to that nation certainly

will lend greater impetus to further relations between

Singapore and China. What I really would like to know is:

is Singapore's posture essentially one of waiting for the

Republic of Indonesia to establish relations with China?

And will that posture be adopted even if Indonesia were not

to have relations for the next 1 0 years? I would like to

know if there are other considerations which the Hon.

Minister of State might like to share with us that might

make Singapore go ahead with recognition, independent of

Indonesia's move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the ASEAN summit at Bali. I would like to

take this opportunity to give my wholehearted support to

this concept of regional cooperation, this concept of amity

and good neighbourliness. I think it is a good thing and a

move in the right direction for all five ASEAN states. To

me, it is an awareness that had been precipitated in

particular by the collapse of the three Indo-Chinese

states. It is a kind of a shock therapy. It seems to me

that it is a common realisation that the best interest of

each ASEAN nation is best served through the collective

interest of the group. I am very happy to note that the

five nations have moved forward with great caution, with

great deliberation, and that positive steps have been taken

to ensure that we are not just coming out with another of

these international agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am taking this opportunity to ask the

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs that whilst ASEAN

today is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



essentially an economic and socio-cultural association of

nations, will the Minister of State give some kind of

assurance that ASEAN will not in the foreseeable future

turn into a military alliance, an alliance that might be

regarded by certain outside forces as another South-east

Asian Treaty Organisation? I would be most happy if the

Minister of State could give this assurance, and further.

that Singapore on its part in ASEAN and ASEAN as a whole

would collectively make no move that can be construed as

inimical to forces that are envious of the establishment of

ASEAN. Thirdly, can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

perhaps jointly with the Ministry of Defence assure us

Singaporeans that none of our troops and national

servicemen will at any time be sent to combat insurgency

movements in foreign territories?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the highlights of the ASEAN Treaty of Amity

and Concord was the statement of declaration that this

region of the world be declared a zone of peace and

neutrality. I have to grope in my mind for a well

pronounced policy that we used to espouse in the past - that we in Singapore believe in the policy of dynamic

equilibrium in this region, that policy being more

realistic because no super power would ever stay away from

an area that is a vacuum. In other words, if the Americans

were to withdraw from South-east Asia, it is very likely

that the Russians would move in, and then what? Hanoi?

China? Or the Americans back again? In view of this, how is

this erstwhile policy of ours reconciled with the

declaration of the Zone of Peace and Neutrality as stated

in the Treaty of Amity and Concord?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to state Singapore's

position with regard to the Law of the Sea Conference, in

particular to the Straits of Malacca.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, it is very obvious to me that you

meant to join with the other Members and speak under

subhead AAA 1003 rather than on this particular amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, it so happens that I was pre-empted, particularly by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first, on the

establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's

Republic of China. I think our Foreign Minister as well as

the Government have made our stand very clear, not on one

occasion but on several occasions. Our stand does not

change: we are still waiting. Our stand is that we will be

the last ASEAN country to establish diplomatic relations

with the People's Republic of China. I think this is also

understood by the Government of the People's Republic of

China.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the assurance that there will be no military

pact, I think everybody knows that after the Bali summit,

the ASEAN Heads of States were not in favour of having a

military pact. Our main emphasis was on economic and

cultural cooperation. Any kind of military pact would only

aggravate the tension which already exists, even without

the mention of the word "pact". So there is no point in

aggravating the tension which we are, in fact, trying to

lessen among nations in South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the guarantee that we will not send troops and our

servicemen out of Singapore. I think the answer should be

directed at the Minister of Defence. However, in the

absence of a pact, is there any necessity to send our

troops when there is no pact or such understanding? As far

as I know, at least there is no bilateral arrangement with

any country. In fact, in certain circumstances the sending

of troops from one country to another may be interpreted as

an interference in the internal affairs of that country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng also mentioned the Treaty of

Amity and Zone of Peace. In actual fact, the Treaty tries

to ensure that everything will be all right among the five

member states of ASEAN. There will be noninterference in

internal affairs and, I think, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



that matter unless and until a nation requests another

nation to send in troops, the act of sending troops from

one country to another will be interpreted as contravening

this Treaty of Amity. And as far as I am aware, there is no

such arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Straits of Malacca, our view is that the

Straits should be made international waters, open to free

navigation. Our delegates will soon be attending the

Conference and our main interest is to see that our rights

are maintained. We have not gone against the Indonesian

concept of "Archipelago" just for the sake of going against

the concept. I think our representative will make it clear

that our main interest is to preserve our rights in so far

as the Law of the Sea is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am fully satisfied with the

reply given by the Hon. Minister of State for Foreign

Affairs, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quantitatively, I would say that the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs has not done too badly since its

establishment. Although we have been independent for

slightly more than 10 years, we are physically represented

by Ambassadors and High Commissioners in most of the major

capitals of the world. However, having overcome the

preoccupation of making our physical presence felt, I feel

we should now aim to give broader meaning to and redefine

the role of our overseas missions.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we expect them to do? How best can we make use of

their presence abroad so as to benefit the country in more

tangible terms? These are, to my mind, some of the rather

relevant questions. In saying so, I am not thinking so much

of the traditional role of just maintaining good relations

with the host countries, which we are already doing quite

well. I am thinking more in terms of what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



these missions abroad can do to serve the needs of our

commerce and industry at home. At a time when we are

placing so much emphasis on export drive, both in respect

of goods and services. I feel that our overseas missions

can make a positive contribution towards our efforts in

this direction, provided they are suitably orientated. Up

to this point of time, I have my doubts as to whether this

is the case, notwithstanding some of the pre-emptive

statements made by the Minister of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we do have commercial secretaries in some of our

embassies abroad, I rather suspect that their presence is

no more than an ornament. I also suspect that most of them

are probably not suitably qualified or trained as to be

able to function meaningfully in serving the needs of a

trading nation, which is what we are and have always been.

In any event, considering the relatively junior position of

such commercial secretaries, how much importance do we

attach to their work at present?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited usefulness or importance of such appointees

can be gauged by the fact that a number of our Government

agencies involved in economic affairs also have their own

men abroad. Take London, for instance. Although I believe

that we have a commercial secretary at the High

Commissioner's Office, EDB and MAS have thought fit to have

their own men on the spot, not to mention the

representatives of other Government-owned enterprises. All

this seems to me to be an unnecessary waste of money and

manpower. Surely if the post of a commercial secretary is

upgraded as to carry sufficient seniority and weight, the

person, given the right calibre and training, could quite

easily take care of the affairs of both the EDB and MAS. If

need be, he could have a highpowered team working under his

direction, rather than to have several sets of people doing

roughly the same thing at present and, quite rightly, all

providing conflicting feed-back to their own respective

departments or superiors at home.



Once we are assured of a more efficient and centralised

system in the collection of commercial and industrial

intelligence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



abroad, the information can be fed back home for use by

both Government and the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our businessmen travel abroad on business, they can

also rely upon our embassies for guidance and assistance

which could be invaluable. At present I do not think our

business community knows what sort of services or

assistance our overseas missions are able to offer them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been exhorting the private sector to

innovate and to improve, but are we satisfied that the

Government is also doing the same? Are we making the best

use of available resources and facilities at our disposal?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, the suggestions made by the

Member for Jalan - Kayu are worth considering and I will do

my best to convey them to the Ministry of Finance which is

actually responsible for appointing the various commercial

attaches, secretaries and also EDB men to the various

overseas missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to inform the Member that apart

from the Ambassador, Counsellors and Secretaries, we also

have some quite efficient commercial secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that all of them are of no use. Some of them

are performing the task. An instance of what they have been

doing is the promotion of Singapore's trade interest .in

the host country, activities which will promote our

objective of increasing the export of Singapore

manufactured products. They have to issue leaflets

informing all the enterprises as to the products available

from Singapore. They also collate and disseminate all

information relating to trading conditions and regulations

and other market factors which affect Singapore's export.

They also guide visiting businessmen from Singapore and

introducing them to relevant contacts in their respective

countries, and continuously bearing in mind that commerce

and economics and politics are merely two aspects of one

whole. They therefore maintain closer liaison with other

officers in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



the mission performing political and other functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1976 the commercial and economic functions of

our overseas missions were performed by officers who were

also responsible for political and other duties. However,

early this year since the commercial secretary's service

was established some of our overseas missions have been

staffed by this special category of officers whose duty is

confined to commercial and economic work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small nation. Having served in many missions

abroad. I can say from my own experience that we are really

shorthanded. For instance, when I was posted to Cairo I had

only one First Secretary who was supposed to help me in

political affairs, one Administrative Officer doing

administration, and one Personal Assistant. I was supposed

to cover five countries, in which I had no office

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although trading and economic interest is important we

have to bear in mind that we cannot afford to spend too

much in sending out officers to a country unless that

country is vital to us economically; which we are doing. It

is no use sending a commercial attache to a place where we

have no business relations or trading arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case the suggestion made by the Member for Jalan

Kayu for a central pooling of all the resources is one

which I Think can be given some consideration, and I assure

the Member that this suggestion will be conveyed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, before I

withdraw my amendment. I feel that I ought to make one or

two clarifications. I am appreciative of the very

responsive manner I have received, but I do not think that

at any time did I suggest that the present commercial

secretaries are of no use. I am not suggesting that. All

that I am suggesting is that greater importance should be

attached to such appointments, and I think we ought to

upgrade their position so as to carry sufficient weight.

Given the right type of officer and the right measure of

training, they could perform more effectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly I did not suggest that we should send

commercial secretaries round the world. I did not say that.

What I was saying is that we should make the best use of

the existing facilities. At present I think there is

unnecessary duplication. As I have mentioned, DBS got their

own men. MAS got their own men, and the missions have them

own men. So do SIA and NOL. In London town I think we

probably have 10 to 20 people from the different Government

agencies. Obviously this is a sheer waste of money. So when

the Minister of State talked so much about not getting

enough money, he has my sympathy. At the same time,

somewhere along the line the thinking is quite wrong. On

the one hand we try to stinge but on the other hand we let

all this money go down the drain. I feel that this is a

very serious matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the limitations that his Ministry is

working up against, the Minister of State has done a very

good job. To the Minister of State, in particular. I would

like to place on record that what he has done on the

question of our relationship with Indonesia is. I think,

generally known. He has done a first-class job there.

Businessmen who have travelled to Indonesia have all said

that Mr Lee has given tremendous help. In every case they

have expressed them appreciation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are talking of Ministries on the Government, not

of individuals. We are talking of the organisation. How we

can improve the organisation, and how to institutionalise

the arrangement so that there is continuity? We just cannot

depend on a few bright officers, those that the Minister of

State just quoted, who can use a bit of initiative to go

out and give pamphlets and in that way promote the image of

Singapore. That is not what I am thinking. What I am

thinking is a rather more fundamental issue of

institutionalising our system. I think we have got to that

stage, and we must think seriously.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, would you like to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I would like to thank the Member for

Jalan Kayu for his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



compliments. If the Member were to look deepen into the

matter, he may find that it is a question of communication.

Whether on not to have all the officers centred in the

mission is perhaps a question of communication. Whether it

is more efficient for the EDB men to take orders direct

from EDB, fearing that if it goes through the machinery of

the Foreign Ministry it might get bogged down, I think all

this is a question of how to establish this chain of

communication. I agree that there is some constructive

suggestion in the point made by the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> First of all, may I suggest that proper

communication be established between the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance. On that note. I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced by $10

in respect of item )b) of subhead AAA 2110.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore was evicted from the Federation of

Malaysia in 1965. Since that day, to my knowledge.

Singapore has continued to contribute a sum to the tune of

$� million for the maintenance of Malaya Hall in London. To

my knowledge too, that Hall is not frequented by any

Singapore citizen on by any of our students in London. To

my knowledge also, it is only used by a certain sector of

people from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister of State for Foreign

Affairs why Singapore still continues to contribute $�

million a year for the maintenance of Malaya Hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Students Department of our High

Commission in London is rather poorly maintained. I would

have thought that the same amount of money could have been

better used for the promotion of activities for students

and Singapore citizens who are away in the United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, our

of our share of expenditure for the upkeep of Malaya

Hall for the period 1968 to 1969. Payment has been

financial issues between Singapore and Malaysia,

including Malaysia's contribution in respect of

Malaysian students studying at the University of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his reply to questions raised by other

Members, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs

has partly answered my original question without my

raising it, But the Minister of State has yet to

answer the unanswered parts of my original question

and some additional questions which have just come to

my mind. These questions are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. What is the total number of ASEAN nationals who

have participated in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



ASEAN training awards in the past five years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Among those students who have undergone training

under the scheme during the past five years, which

ASEAN country has topped the list?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Is his Ministry prepared to let all Members of

this House have a copy of the booklet entitled "ASEAN

Training Awards 1976-77", so that Members of the

House can be informed of the sort of training

programmes that Singapore is awarding to other ASEAN

countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Is Singapore the only ASEAN member country that

provides such awards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

ASEAN training awards scheme commenced in 1972.

Between the period 1972 and 1976 a total of 80 awards

have been made; 12 were made to Indonesia, eight to

Malaysia, one to the Philippines, and 59 to Thailand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially the courses involve on-the-job training

in the various Ministries and departments. They vary

from fire-fighting, librarianship, sewerage

treatment, to the various aspects of nursing and

medical technicians courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we will be too willing to give the

booklet on ASEAN awards to those Members of

Parliament who are interested. As fan as I am aware.

Singapore appears to be the only country that has

offered such awards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

answer given by the Minister of State. I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 4003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if it is in order for the Ministry to

pay the Area Licence Fees for diplomatic missions.

Our citizens, even our Ministers, have to pay the

fees themselves. The Ministry does not own the cars

used by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



the diplomatic missions and these missions do not work for

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a country can afford to have a mission here, it should

not have any difficulty in paying the Area Licence Fee.

Sir, the Government can exempt these missions from paying

the fee if such a payment can be treated as part of the

diplomatic immunity. But the provision shown in the

Estimates is an indication that the Government does not

think so. If the missions are entitled to exemption from

such a payment on diplomatic convention, why should the

taxpayers' money be used to disburse the missions for such

payments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the House to be informed whether the

amount shown in the Estimates is to pay for the Area

Licence Fees for cars used by the heads of missions on all

cars with a diplomatic number plate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, when the Area Licensing Scheme

was introduced in 1975 the Diplomatic and Consular Corps

made a strong representation that members of the Corps

should be exempted from payment of the Area Licensing Fee.

It was pointed Out to their representative that the

Licensing fee is a charge for which no additional service

is given. Argument was made that, under the Vienna

Convention and Diplomatic Relations, fees should only be

charged for services rendered. Having consideration to the

need to adopt a very restrictive policy in order that

minimum traffic enters the Central Business District during

the peak hours, the Government could not consider

favourably the representation of the Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a gesture, the Government approved the

granting of an area licensing disc to one flag-flying car

per full mission located within the Central Business

District. Presently. 11 missions enjoy such concession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, how come there are only 11

missions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, retrenchment exercises have been rampant in the

Republic from 1974 to 1975. While some sectors of the

economy are more directly affected by recessionary trends,

such as the manufacturing sector, not all retrenchments

carried out are justified. There is always the possibility

of a few black sheep employers taking advantage of the

present economic situation to indulge in anti-labour

practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current legislation under the Industrial Relations Act

provides limited scope for unions to check such unfair

practices by management. The provisions are restrictive as

the rule of "last in, first Out" no longer applies. Trade

unions are further hampered in negotiations by the

statutory limits on retrenchment benefits to those with

less than three years' service. It is perhaps ironical that

the three-year period intended to protect infant industries

in Singapore should have - such a wide application of the

law that trading firms and companies with long established

business in Singapore and with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



less compelling reasons to retrench can now do so as an

economic expedient without having to pay any retrenchment

benefits to employees with less than three years' service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the limited safeguards under the Act, abuses are

bound to occur. Employers must be made to realise that the

provisions of the Industrial Relations Act are not a carte

blanche for management to retrench at will non can they

flout the provisions under the coven of management

prerogatives. While the Act has been promulgated to

preserve industrial harmony so essential to the development

of our economy it would certainly not augur well for the

economy if workers' rights for job security and union

representation are jeopardised by employers who act without

any moral conscience or sense of social responsibility

towards the employees.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in one particular case, an

established trading company retrenched its entire sales

force of 12 counter salesgirls under the guise of adverse

trading conditions. Within three months the same company

recruited another team of salesgirls at lower salaries for

its sales counters. Following representation made by the

union to the Minister for Labour, the Ministry conducted an

investigation. It was found that this company had indeed

abused the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. The

company was accordingly warned by the Ministry. There are

instances where it is difficult for the unions to obtain

sufficient evidence to prove their case. Quite a few

established trading houses have resorted to retrenchment of

higher paid employees with long service. Workers within the

age group of 40-45, with children still in secondary

schools, face the difficult task of getting alternative

employment at the same last drawn salary, in order to

support their families. As theme are no adequate safeguards

against the retrenchment of workers, I would like to put

forward the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



following proposals to the Minister for his consideration,

with a view to amending the relevant provisions of the

Industrial Relations Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provision for unions to seek the intervention of the

Ministry of Labour and to hold inquiries in cases which are

unwarranted and are suggestive of manipulation by

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The present limitation of retrenchment benefits for

employees with less than three years' service should not

apply to established trading companies with more than 10

years' trading in Singapore, taking into account take-overs, mergers and change of business names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provision for lay-off and reemployment of retrenched

workers, and lastly,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provision for appeal to the Minister under the same

procedure as section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations

Act, if the foregoing proposals are found unacceptable.





<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker. Sir, I think I can summarise what the

Member for Toa Payoh has said. His first point is his

concern about certain unfair practices in retrenchment

exercises over the last couple of years. His second point

is that he is unhappy about the restrictive provisions in

the existing legislation relating to retrenchment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his first point, we fully share his concern. The

managements of firms which intend to retrench workers have

been advised by the Ministry of Labour, and guidelines have

been given by the Ministry for such an exercise. They have

been told that efficiency, competence, industry, correct

work attitudes, specialised training in key positions are

the criteria as to who should be retained or retrenched.

They have also been advised to inform the unions of the

reasons for the retention of comparatively junior employees

over senior employees as a result of the implementation of

these criteria.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring closely the retrenchment

situation. We are satisfied that generally there have not

been abuses by managements. But unions of workers with

genuine grievances of unjust retrenchments could refer the

matter to the Ministry, and I assure him that thorough

investigations will be conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second point, in view of the general effectiveness

of the present system of safeguards against abuses of

retrenchment, the Ministry does not think that there is a

need at this juncture to introduce legislation on the

matter. However, let me hasten to add that we are not

unsympathetic to the genuine plight of retrenched workers.

especially those who have family responsibilities. We will

certainly introduce amendments if the situation warrants

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are no

adequate safeguards at all in the Employment Act regarding

retrenchment, besides the limitation of three years'

service. I must say that most employers do not follow the

guidelines set by the Ministry. The Minister of State

should know that in a recent retrenchment exercise by some

commercial firms, even salesmen with 20 years of service on

more have been retrenched while junior salesmen have been

retained in the service. Of course, as I have mentioned

earlier in my speech, it is very difficult to prove it.

That is the reason why I am asking for consideration

whether certain measures can be taken. Unless the Ministry

can give us an assurance that effective steps, like

imposing certain penalties on the management, are taken.

there is no point in sending a letter warning them that

they should not indulge in these unfair practices. But then

nothing further can be done. As I have mentioned in one

particular instance involving a trading organisation, the

Ministry did send a letter of warning, but that is the end

of the story.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, by and large,

managements do cooperate. But, as in every organisation on

establishment, there is usually a black sheep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



here and there. I do not think we want to bring in new

rules just to deal with one or two cases of unfair

treatment. But, as I have said, we would certainly

investigate into specific complaints and deal with the

matter in the interests of affected workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I am afraid I am not very happy

with the reply given. However, I beg leave to withdraw.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead ACA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to consider liberalising

the granting of applications for work permits by shop

assistants, barbers, cooks and certain categories of

factory workers. The complaints I have received from these

people are that it is difficult for them to apply for a

work permit. According to a storekeeper, he found it

difficult to engage local hands and therefore he has

applied for a work permit many times but all his

applications were turned down. So, it vexed him very much.

There was also the complaint of a restaurant owner. He has

a son born in Malaysia, and he has passed Secondary IV

examination. The father applied for a work permit for his

son to work as a captain in his restaurant. But this was

turned down. The reason given was that his son had no such

experience. I find this reason unjustified because it is

not difficult for a Secondary IV boy to become a captain in

a restaurant. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



work is not difficult. With a certain amount of training,

one can be very efficient in this sort of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rejecting the application for work permits for shop

assistants, the reason given by the Ministry of Labour was

that the salary was too low for this kind of job. But such

a reason is no longer applicable now because in his Budget

Statement the Minister for Finance has pointed out that

there should be restriction in wage increases otherwise our

wage rates would be the highest in Southeast. Asia after

Japan. Therefore, we should review and liberalise the

consideration for applications for work permits by such

people. It is a fact that shopowners cannot get local

hands. It is not that they do not want to employ local

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about the difficulty encountered by

garment factories and food packaging factories in applying

for work permits for the number of workers they require.

They have to wait from three weeks to one month before

receiving a reply as to whether their applications have

been approved. How are these factories, going to proceed

during this long wait? I would like to suggest to the

Minister that during the period when their applications are

being processed whether it is possible for them to engage

these factory hands so that they could continue with their

productive work. Once their applications have been decided,

they can then carry on with their work or they can be told

to leave, depending on the outcome of their applications.

With this sort of arrangement, it will help the

productivity of the factories concerned.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon is not here. Would the

Minister like to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I think the Member for

Sembawang had raised the question of shop assistants and

barbers during last year's Budget sittings. Members may

recall that my reply then was that, with Singapore's

continued policy of rapid industrialisation, it was of

vital importance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



that the manpower requirements of the industries should

first be met.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with this policy, the Ministry has continued to

accord priority to applications for work permits from non-citizens seeking employment in factories and other

industrial undertakings. As long as our economic objectives

and manpower strategy remain unchanged, non-citizens

wishing to pursue soft or relatively unproductive jobs,

like shop assistants or other white collar jobs like

salesman, etc., cannot be given priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect immediately ahead for our economy is not

expected to be one of high growth rate. In 1975, there was

only a real growth rate of 4.1%. At the same time, it has

been estimated that the number of students leaving schools

each year, without completing their secondary education.

would remain around 22.000. Many of these premature school

leavens would not be in a position to find meaningful

employment on account of their age, low educational

qualifications and lack of any marketable skills. Although

the Government is looking into various schemes to encourage

these youths to take up careers in industries, not all of

them will or can be successfully absorbed. Other job

opportunities such as shop assistants or restaurant workers

and so forth must be found for them. Under these

circumstances, it is unlikely that the Ministry would

consider relaxing its work permit policy in regard to non-citizens employed in such occupations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of barbers, the Ministry has not been unduly

restrictive in granting work permits to non-citizens

engaged in this occupation. The Ministry is aware that few

Singaporeans are interested in taking up such employment.

However, non-citizens wishing to secure employment as

barbers must at least possess the requisite skill for the

job. As such, work permits are only granted to those who

have passed a practical test conducted by the Adult

Education Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of female barbers, they must, in addition to

passing the trade test, have at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



least completed six years of primary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may wish to note that about 28%

of the barbers working in Singapore are work permit

holders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has

not answered the other point relating to the application

for a work permit by garment and food factory workers who

have to wait for three weeks to one month for a decision. I

made the request just now that we should allow them to work

while their applications are under consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I think the factories can apply

for temporary permission to employ non-citizen workers,

pending the final decision on their applications. The Work

Permits Office is quite flexible on this matter. If the

factories concerned are producing goods and services which

are given priority by the EDB, temporary permission of one

month is normally given to applicants while their

applications are being processed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, there are many teachers who.

because of the problem of domestic servants have to resign

from their jobs. We are losing teachers, and some of them

have high qualifications. But since they do not have

domestic servants, they have to resign in order to look

after the families. Will the Minister consider issuing work

permits to domestic servants, because Singaporeans do not

want to become domestic servants? Therefore. I hope the

Minister will consider issuing work permits to foreigners

who wish to become domestic servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I just like to take the

opportunity of asking the Minister whether, in considering

all these applications for work permits, he would also take

into consideration the situation on the place of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Jalan Kayu, for instance. I think the residents

there quite often find that local citizens do not wish to

take up jobs of tailoring and domestic help in that

locality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



because its distance from town is pretty fan. In most

cases, people do not stay on the job for very long,

especially local people. And as a last resort, they have to

go and try to get non-citizens. I have a few cases of

tailors who, in fact, have difficulty getting local people

to fill the jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, while appreciating the Government's

policy on the issuance of work permits for certain classes

of jobs, there is this problem that quite a number of non-citizens face. It is their problem of getting simple jobs

that do not require skill, like sales assistants and so on,

because the policy is not to issue work permits for such

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for these people, they have strong family

ties in Singapore and if they were to go back to their

country of origin they would have no one to depend on. This

poses a lot of difficulty for them and whether young or

not, they will have to lead rather lonely lives.' They have

their family ties in Singapore through no fault of theirs.

In addition, this will pose some sort of resentment in

Singapore citizens who are close to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appealing to the Minister to consider these cases on

humanitarian grounds, and I hope we can receive a positive

reply on that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I appreciate the difficulty of

getting domestic servants. In fact, I myself am without one

at the moment. For the information of Members, we have been

very liberal in granting work permits to people who wish to

become domestic servants for obvious reasons, because we

want to encourage women, especially those who are highly

qualified, to work. I do not agree that we have been rather

restrictive in issuing work permits to domestic servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tailors. I think I have mentioned earlier that we

are giving priority for the issuance of work permits to

those who want to work in industries, particularly those

industries that are engaged in production for export.

Tailors, unfortunately, do not come within this category.

But if it is a textile factory which is producing goods for

exports, then they will be given priority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members have to bear in mind that the interest of

our own citizens must come first. In those cases mentioned

by the Member for Potong Pasir, if those foreigners are

prepared to work in factories on in industrial

undertakings. I am sure their applications will be

favourably considered. But if they are only interested in

soft jobs which do not require much exertion, then I am

afraid we have to be rather restrictive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, my point has still not been

answered. The point I made was that the problem arises on

account of the distance away from town. No local citizens

want to take up jobs in Jalan Kayu. As I see it, it is not

a good idea to judge on the basis that if a garment factory

is export-orientated it can have the workers. I think that

is oven-simplifying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I see it is that we should also think of its

effect on the cost of living of the people. If we make it

unduly restrictive, then the cost of tailoring goes up.

Everybody knows that today if we want to make a pair of

trousers, it will cost a lot more and the reason is that

there is an acute shortage of skilled tailors. I emphasise

the word "skilled". I think the present approach seems to

be rather hard-and-fast without proper consideration given

to the circumstances. Take tailoring, for instance. There

are lots of little tailor shops. They do export. They might

not export directly but they sub-contract from bigger shops

in town which provide a 24-hour service to tourists. So in

a way this is an

invisible export.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contribution is just as great. The fact that all

these little shops are in the rural areas, their overheads

are kept low. Because their overheads are low, they are

able to sell at a competitive price, lower than that in

Hong Kong. I do not think we have looked into this problem

in sufficient depth. There seems to be the tendency for

civil servants to say. "Well, the rule says this type of

work is not on. No. That type of workers is on." As I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



say, that is not doing our economy and our standard of

living any good at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what is the difference between a

factory and a tailor? A tailor makes shirts and trousers

and sells them. A factory produces goods and sells them.

Contractors come to the tailor's shop to get 100 suits for

a ship's crew but the tailor cannot make the suits. So why

do we not give the tailor work permits? I applied for a

work permit for a tailoress, but it was turned down many

times. So the tailor shop had to close down because it

could not get enough help to run the shop.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the

Minister to reconsider my case. I agree with him that we

must look after our industrialisation scheme. We have

emphasised that our economy is a diversified one. Apart

from industries we must also look after the other aspect of

our economy, for example, the petty traders. Local

Singapore citizens are not interested and they are,

therefore, forced to employ non-citizens. If we want to

emphasise a diversification of our economy, we should look

after the other sectors of the economy too and not just

industrialisation alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I want to make one point clear. We

are not refusing to allow skilled tailors from coming in.

In fact, many work permits have been issued to skilled

tailors. It is only the unskilled tailors that we have to

consider very carefully. In case of doubt we always send

the applicant for a skill evaluation test at the Adult

Education Board. And in cases of refusal, the employer can

appeal on their behalf, and if there are good reasons why

approval should be granted, it would be granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oven the last few years, with industrialisation, the

whole economy has changed. In fact, one has to begin to

consider whether the traditional type of business, like the

provision shop, is desirable when we are faced with a

labour shortage. There has been a mushrooming of

supermarkets, shopping complexes, self-service shops and so

forth, and this is a response to this kind of situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>I do not think we can go on as before. I think We should

progress with time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

clarify one point from the Minister. Does he mean that in

the midst of a labour shortage these small provision shops

will not be allowed to continue to exist? Is this the wish

of the Government to see that these small shops are closed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is not my point. If they can find

the workers, they can go ahead. Nobody is going to stop

them from carrying on with their business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> My question still remains unanswered,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I thought I have answered the

question of the Member for Jalan Kayu. Skilled tailors are

not prohibited from coming in. In fact, we do issue work

permits to skilled tailors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> It is not so much the question of

tailors or barbers. The point that I was trying to make is

the question of distance. Jalan Kayu, or Chua Chu Kang for

that matter, is so far away from town that local people are

just not keen to work there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> If the Member for Jalan Kayu could

bring those cases to the

attention of the Ministry, we will look into it. In fact, there is an Appeals Committee to consider all

these cases. If the Committee thinks that the reasons put

forward by the applicants are acceptable, we will consider

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the

Minister's reply, I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AGA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sia Khoon Seong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I had occasion to query the Minister for Labour

regarding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



announcement by his Ministry on the proposed reorganisation

of the Ministry and the establishment of an Industrial

Relations Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I am happy to note that the Budget estimates

for 1976 in respect of the Ministry of Labour clearly

reflect the intention of the Ministry to create a high-powered Industrial Relations Division. For example, there

is provision for nine Division I Officers for the year 1976

as compared to the provision for only two Division I

Officers in 1975 and the previous year. Such increase is in

itself desirable in view of the importance placed by the

Government on the question of industrial relations in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may recall, the Minister for

Labour in his address at the opening ceremony of the SILO-PIEU Triennial Delegates' Conference on 27th February this

year at the Singapore Conference Hall has given emphasis to

the desirability of promoting harmonious industrial

relations in Singapore. Taken in conjunction with the

objectives of the 1976 budget, that is, to encourage

foreign investors and develop new projects in Singapore.

the importance of giving priority to industrial relations

in Singapore cannot be overstressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister stated in his speech. "There is therefore

a need for more professionally trained managers in industry

and better trained branch officials and HQ industrial

relations officers". The Minister went on to say.

"Industrial Relations Officers and union officials should

know among other things more about how the problems of

workers and management can best be explained to each side

and resolved effectively".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well happen that given the best of will and

ability on the part of the personnel management of the

employer and the Industrial Relations Officers of the

union, they still cannot settle a dispute. Here is where

the conciliation machinery created under the Industrial

Relations Act can help both parties to work out an

agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the officers who are to be recruited

for or posted to the Industrial Relations Division of the

Ministry are competent and trained civil servants. My only

concern is whether such officers are competent and trained

in industrial relations matters. I am not aware that the

Ministry itself has conducted any training courses or

schemes in industrial relations for its officers, nor am I

aware that any other Ministry or department of the

Government has conducted any training courses or schemes in

industrial relations matters for civil servants. I hope I

am wrong and that the officers who are to man the

Industrial Relations Division will be officers with

sufficient experience and expertise in industrial relations

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also help if the Ministry can ensure that due cane

is taken in the manning of the Division to prevent too

frequent turnover of staff in the Division. As I understand

it, there had been a change of the Head of the Division

within one year of its establishment. Even if it is

conceded that the change is unavoidable, the need for such

changes should be minimised for the proper and effective

functioning of the Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect it would be of interest to Members of

this House if the Minister can indicate whether the

Ministry has been able to resolve a higher proportion of

the trade dispute under conciliation since the setting up

of the Industrial Relations Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inclined to have my doubts about the effectiveness

of the Division. For instance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



when I inquired from my trade union colleagues about the

"Preventive Mediation Labour Assessment Section", I could

not receive any definite reply as to the function of that

Section. It would appear that both the officers in that

Section and trade unionists have no clear idea as to what

the Section is supposed to do. If there is a confusion oven

the respective functions or a duplication in the work of

this Sectior and the Conciliation Section. I hope the

Ministry will quickly look into the matter.
