<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the proceedings on the items of business set down for today be

exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until 12 midnight," -.[Dr Toh Chin Chye].

<div align="center"><b>PROCEEDINGS ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE NATIONAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>REFERENDUM BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings in Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill

shall  be brought to a conclusion at 12 o'clock midnight on the 5th July,  1962,

and that Mr Speaker shall, at that time, forthwith put every question necessary

to  dispose of any amendment or other matter then under consideration and in the

case  of any other amendments, new Clauses or new Schedules moved by any Member,

Mr  Speaker shall put only the question that the amendment be made or that  the

Clause or Schedule be added to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the third reading of the Singapore National Referendum

Bill  shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 o'clock midnight on the  6th  July, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been precedents in the past for applying the guillotine in

debates  in  the  House of Commons and, in fact, Mr Asquith, who  was  formerly

Prime  Minister in the United Kingdom and at the same time Leader of the Liberal

Party,  admitted that slowly and reluctantly he had come to the conclusion  that

"You  cannot carry on legislation here on large and complicated subjects without

treating  the time-table as part of our established procedure." More recently  on

the 25th January in the House of Commons two Bills were debated in the Committee

of  the  whole House. They were the Commonwealth Immigration Bill and  the  Army

Reserve Bill. The debate on the Commonwealth Immigration Bill had proceeded  for

three  days  without making any headway. The Army Reserve Bill had been  debated

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 546</b></font><br><br>



two  days without similar results. The consequence of it was that the Government

then  moved  a  motion to allot a further three days' debate on the Commonwealth

Immigration Bill and a further two days for the Army Reserve Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the case of the National Referendum Bill, we have had 12 meetings of

the Select Committee discussing various amendments which had been put forward by

both  sides of the House. Many of these meetings had gone right up to quite late

in  the evening. Now we are in a Committee of the whole House and this same Bill

has  already  seen through four midnight sittings. However, only 11  clauses  to

which amendments have been made have been debated. There are still 13 clauses on

the Order Paper to which amendments will be moved and debate on which will still

have to take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arguments on the amendments in the National Referendum Bill have not only been adequately aired in Select Committee but also outside this

House  as  well - through  forums organised by Radio Singapore  and  other  bodies

outside. The notice for the motion which I am moving now was given on Friday,  a

few  minutes  before 4 o'clock and I believe that notice was shortly  afterwards

circulated  to  Members of the House. Members of the House  had  ample  time  to

discuss among themselves how to allocate their times for debate on the remaining

clauses  to  which amendments are being moved. All I am asking the House  is  to

agree  that  the  debate in Committee on the remaining clauses of  the  National

Referendum  Bill be brought to a conclusion on the 5th of July. That  will  give

the House another three days of debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House to agree that the Third Reading of the Bill be allotted one

day. The reason is that we do not wish and, in fact, it will be out of order  if

we were to allow the Third Reading of the Bill to become a Second Reading of the

Bill.  Arguments which have been put forward during the Second  Reading  of  the

Bill and during Committee will be tediously repeated once more; Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 547</b></font><br><br>



will  agree that one day is quite sufficient for the debate on the Third Reading

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the analogy of the House of Commons given by the Deputy Prime Minister

is  inappropriate when we direct our minds for a moment to the size of the House

in  question  and the extent of the business it transacts. If we compare  ours,

Sir, we must recognize that we are not in a similar position as regards the need

for economy of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a story of the American who told a visitor, "Now let us

change subways. If we take a bus and take another subway, we will get there  ten

minutes earlier." And the visitor said, "After having made all that effort, what

are you going to do with the ten minutes?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons, Sir, has its work to do. This House would be defunct. My

understanding is that we will be, if not defunct, at least in suspension because

the  sittings  will be prorogued for this Session. If the Deputy Prime  Minister

says  they  need  time  for their own work, I must confess,  Sir,  we  have  had

examples,  and ample examples, of the capacity of a country to do  without  them

for long periods of time when they are elsewhere at public expense. I think that

first ground, Sir, is just a specious excuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ground is that this matter has been debated in Select Committee

for  12  days.  To  be  accurate, Sir, seven of those days were  given  over  to

representations and five for debate on the representations and  the  clauses  of

the  Bill.  Then let us not forget that we had to deal with the red  herring  of

this  being a general Referendum Bill from the first day to the last  in  Select

Committee; and now we are trying to tidy up the faux pas presented to us by this

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third reason given by the Deputy Prime Minister is that the arguments

in  respect  of  the  Referendum  Bill have been enunciated  outside.  Now,  Mr

Speaker,  that is correct. But what has transpired outside is not  in  itself  a

reason  why  the matter should not be adumbrated in this House. The radio  forum

cannot replace the Assembly, Sir, It is true, Sir, that through the radio  forum

perhaps  we  get  to the people directly and with less distortion,  particularly

when  we  recognise  the  fact  that not only has the  Government  sought  these

midnight  sittings in order to prevent adequate expression of the views  of  the

people  finding their way to the Press but also, Sir - I do not know  if  you  are

conscious  of  this - that there has been a complete change of  personnel  in  the

Press  box in so far as the Chinese newspapers are concerned. We no longer  have

the same political reporters-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that the Press box and the Strangers'

Gallery  have nothing at all to do with matters debated in this Assembly.  There

must  not  be  any direct reference to anybody in the Gallery, be it  the  Press

Gallery or the Strangers' Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged for your guidance, Mr Speaker, but perhaps you

will permit me to say that there has been a complete change of personnel of  the

representatives of the Press dealing with political matters and the  context  is

interesting,  Mr  Speaker, because until, let us say, yesterday  we  were  not

unconscious  (even those of us who do not read the vernacular  Press)  that  the

Nanyang Siang Pau, the Sin Chew Jit Poh, and the Utusan Melayu were three papers

that  were representing to some extent the Opposition points of view. As I  say,

my  understanding is that there has been a change of personnel of two  of  those

newspapers, the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the fourth reason given was that we must not permit the Third Reading to be a tedious repetition. There is a very delicate balance between the

need  to  maintain in this House the constitutional right of Members to  express

their views and the need to protect the Chamber from tedium.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think in fairness, Sir, that any of us can complain that in discharging

your particular responsibility in that field we have suffered  tedium. Surely  the  Government  can leave it to you, Mr Speaker,  to  prevent  tedious repetition. I would like to say for myself, Sir, that in so far as the Committee

sitting  up to Thursday night is concerned, I am not complaining that inadequate

time  is  given.  I do say I am unhappy at the suggestion of the  guillotine  in

respect  of the matter which indirectly affects our future, where the dishonesty

of  the Government has to he exposed and re-exposed, and where it is hoped  that

the  public reaction which comes through as a result of that exposure  may  have

some  effect  upon the Government's conduct. But what I am more than  disturbed,

Mr  Speaker, is that they are limiting the Third Reading itself to one day.  In

effect,  it may well take more, Sir, if the Second Reading ends before  Thursday

night. But the fact is there are two motions which, read together, suggest  that

they want to limit the Third Reading to one day. It may well be sufficient. But,

on  the  other hand, this is the point where you gather all the efforts together

and  you  try and present a coherent picture of how the provisions of this  Bill

are  going  to work in the context of a merger referendum, and how inappropriate

it is and how there exists the flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not unreasonable to suppose that there would be several Members on

both  sides of the House who would wish to speak at that stage. It may  well  be

that  eight  hours  would  be  adequate. But I say that  these  motions  are  un

necessary.  There  has been no indication that there has  been  undue  delay  in

dealing with the clauses so far. The Deputy Prime Minister speaks of numbers. He

must  also notice the gravity, apart from clause 29, Sir, which is now the major

clause  before us - clauses 28 and 29 - I cannot conceive that we should take  very

long  with  reference to the other clauses. In fact, Sir,  I  can  conceive  the

possibility that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

we  may  well  finish the Bill before Friday night. But I  do  say  that  it  is

unfortunate  to  approach us on the basis that the Government have  a  right  to

limit  the freedom of speech of the Opposition because they do not like what  is

taking place, and they are afraid of the effect outside, which seems to be  what

in  fact is motivating the Government in the context of this particular Bill.  I

would  say.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, even now it is not too  late  to  withdraw  this

motion,  and if necessary, Mr Speaker, to bring it again on Thursday  when  the

picture would be clearer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in spite of the excuses put up by the Deputy Prime  Minister.

there  is no justification whatsoever for the Government to want to put  a  time

limit on the debate on the Referendum Bill. There are only 13 more clauses to be

debated. Yet we find that the Government want to limit the time of our debate on

the  Bill.  We in the Barisan Sosialis deplore this attitude of the  Government,

and  we  consider that this is yet another attempt of the P.A.P.  Government  to

impose their -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Fascist!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - one-man majority parliamentary dictatorship in

Singapore.  Sir, considering the gravity of the Bill before us, one  would  have

thought that, on this particular occasion at least, the Government would give us

really  a  full  and frank discussion in the House. But what has  happened?  The

P.A.P. are now afraid that further exposures will take place, and they want  to

guillotine  the  debate. Sir, in view of the dishonesty and  distortion  of  the

P.A.P. Ministers-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Cannot you

change the record for once?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - we in the Barisan Sosialis want more time and facilities

so  that  the people can be properly and more fully informed. You have seen  how

the  Government rejected our amendments in clauses 6 and 13. We asked  for  more

time for canvassing







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 551</b></font><br><br>



so  that we could better inform the people. But the Government have unreasonably

rejected our amendments, in spite of the weight of evidence that we produced and

in spite of the precedents that we quoted the world over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget also the restrictions the Government intend to impose on

the  Opposition in the way of facilities for canvassing in clause 41.  And  now

while  we  are  still debating this important Bill, there  is  this  motion  to

guillotine  our  debate.  Where then is this full, free  and  frank  discussion

which  the  Ministers have promised? Not only promised but repeatedly promised.

In  the  first place, Sir, debate on the Bill has been unnecessarily pushed  to

the  late hour of 12 midnight every night. Now, the P.A.P. want to restrict our

debate  to  only another three days - less than three days now. It gives  me  the

feeling  that  if the P.A.P. could possibly help it, there would have  been  no

debate  whatsoever  on this referendum. But since the P.A.P. cannot  completely

shut  out publicity on the Bill, they intend now to cut down publicity as  much

as  possible.  For  us  in the Opposition, debate in the Legislative  Assembly,

Sir,  and  its  report  in the papers, is one of our most  important  means  of

communication  with  the public. The P.A.P. have limited our  rallies  only  to

divisions  where we have our Assemblymen. They have also limited  our  time  of

rallies  to  two hours, that is, from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock in the  afternoon.

Lately,  Sir,  the  Council of Joint Action asked to hold rallies  in  certain

areas,  but  we  have again been refused. The P.A.P., on the other  hand,  have

spent  large  sums  of public money on P.A.P. propaganda. They  have  also  the

radio, Rediffusion and other -

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of

order.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The motion I am moving is very simple. It relates to

sittings  in  this Chamber. I am asking for a guillotine to be  applied  to  the

debate  on  the Bill in this Chamber. We are not in any way stopping the  Member

for Queenstown nor the Barisan Sosialis from holding their meetings outside.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood from the Member for Queenstown that that is exactly

what  he  is complaining about - that the meetings are not being allowed outside.

Therefore,  the point made by the Member for Queenstown is that this Bill  needs

all the publicity it requires. Therefore, he is speaking against this guillotine

motion,  and one of his grounds for speaking against this guillotine  motion  is

that in his mind there has not been sufficient publicity I think he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

they had Malaysia Week and the Grand Prix. They are putting up banners, posters,

advertisements, shows-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are jealous.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister even spent $39,000/- of our State money

in order to publicise Malaysia to certain Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The same countries you were voting for before!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yet now the Deputy Prime Minister wants to guillotine the

debate so that we cannot fully inform the public of the utter dishonesty and the

cheating  of  the  P.A.P.  Sir,  we in the Opposition  do  not  have  all  these

facilities  which are at the disposal of the Government. We cannot even  put  up

posters without the kind permission of the P.A.P. Ministers. The Government want

to publicise their sell-out outside the country. But it looks as if we are going

to be denied the right of debate inside the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Four days!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, when there is a debate in the Legislative Assembly,

the  newspapers  at least will be able to inform the country of what  we  say - at

least  whatever they care to publish. But if there is no Assembly  debate,  even

our  statements  to  the Press are mutilated and completely suppressed.  I  have

already  related to you, Sir, how the circulation of the powerful Straits  Times

and the Sunday Mail was even threatened -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am watching this debate very carefully. If the hon.

Member for Queenstown goes into those details, then he is straying away from the

motion. He has, up to now, been relevant. But if he goes further into details of

that nature, then I think he will be irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not touch

on  that part of the debate again, Sir. Then the Deputy Prime Minister talked of

radio  forums  and discussions in other forums which certain civic organisations

may  organise. But I wish to say here, Sir, that this forum of Radio  Singapore,

Radio P.A.P., is all a sham and a humbug-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You attend all of

them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -because-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were the

sham and the humbug.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -while the

P.A.P.  Ministers and their henchmen have been allowed full publicity  over  the

radio  to  utter  falsehoods day in and day out, we have been  denied  the  same

privilege of-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Of what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -giving the other side of the picture to the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Uttering falsehoods.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Every day there is political propaganda over the radio,

blurting  out falsehoods. We have already given notice of a motion  to  condemn

the  Government for maliciously distorting the stand of the Opposition  on  the

merger  issue. But the only answer to our request for radio time  was  a  'no'.

The  P.A.P. always talk of open confrontation, yet -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The Member for Queenstown alleges

that his request for radio time has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 554</b></font><br><br>



been  refused. This is a highly inaccurate misrepresentation of the Government's

reply to his request.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order if voiced that way. But I was hoping

that  the Minister would indicate that it is irrelevant. It is, in fact,  irrelevant  to the motion. Now the Member for Queenstown is embarking on details which

will  open out a debate within a debate. It is wrong. He can just mention it  in

passing, and that is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I only mentioned it in passing, Sir, I did not go into

details, The P.A.P. always talk of open confrontation; yet in this House,  where

there  is full opportunity for open confrontation, our P.A.P. Ministers want  to

run away from the debate and want to stop us from talking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even in the radio forum, the P.A.P. dare not send representatives

other  than the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister was not here  the  other

day,  they  dared not have the forum. They dare not send the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  or  the  Minister for Health and Law, although they both  were  in  the

Select Committee on the Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought you wanted the pleasure of my company!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am just wondering if it is because the other Ministers

cannot twist with the same agility as the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to say this - that we are here as elected representatives of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Resign!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is our duty to



speak on behalf of the electorate -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and we stand here to claim that right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not let the

P.A.P. deny this basic right of Assemblymen in Singapore. I do not have to  pay

heed to those sneers from people who do not know what they are talking about,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 555</b></font><br><br>



like  chaps  from Geylang West, if he should go back to Geylang West,  he  would

lose his deposit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Queenstown?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. want to make it that if we speak here we speak

on  sufferance  and by the grace of their P.A.P. lordships. If it should  please

their  P.A.P. lordships that we sit, then we sit and be allowed to speak. If  it

should not please their P.A.P. lordships, then guillotine - no more talking.  That

is  their  attitude.  That  is  their one-man  dictatorship  in  this  Singapore

Parliament.  I  just want to ask the P.A.P. Why this hurry?  Why  this  indecent

haste? What have you got to be afraid about? Do you not like people to know what

this Bill is all about?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is too prone to lose his temper

in  this Chamber. He is addressing the Chair. I hope he is not losing his temper

with the Chair. If he remembers that, probably he will keep his temper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. Of course, every time I say 'you' I

mean the Ministers opposite. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are here, Sir, debating a very important Bill. This

Bill,  when passed into law, will be used to decide the future not only  of  the

1.7  million  people  in Singapore, but also of generations and  generations  to

come.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Like Abraham again!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And we are here to fight constitutionally and peacefully

for  the interests of the people. Yet the P.A.P. want to deny us this basic  and

inalienable  right of the people. They look as if they want to  insist  on  this

guillotine,  and that they do not want the people to fight constitutionally  for

their  rights. That is the provocation which I have mentioned many a time.  Sir,

even long before the debate started on this Referendum Bill, newspapers had been

predicting that possibly the debate on this Bill might well last 20 days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are going over all that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They definitely predicted a marathon debate, and why not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You want to break all records?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nobody is stopping anybody from speaking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Should we not have the fullest possible time to discuss a

Bill  of  the importance of the Referendum Bill? Should we not have the  right,

and  should not Government allow us the fullest opportunity for debate?  Is  it

not  the  duty of the Government to allow the fullest possible time for debate?



Why  are  the P.A.P. Ministers afraid of debate? Of course, they know  we  will

expose  them one by one. I have already exposed their original referendum  plot

to  pick  safe  seats for the P.A.P. Ministers -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That has nothing to do with this motion. I think probably the Member for Queenstown will have

perhaps  one or two opportunities more in mentioning that plot when we  go  into

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The thing is that the P.A.P. have many skeletons in the

cupboard  and  they are afraid of exposure. That is why they want to  cut  short

this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is why we extend it to midnight.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the P.A.P.

really  had the interests of the people at heart, they would not just  think  of

their  own selves, but must give full opportunities to everybody in this Chamber

to  speak  his  fullest.  All  this  talk of the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  about

repetition and repetitious arguments is sheer nonsense. How can the P.A.P. know

what the arguments will be until we come to the clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have it produced one by one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I suppose, Sir, this is typical of the P.A.P. arrogance.

They want to arrogate unto themselves even the duties of the Chair. They want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 557</b></font><br><br>



to  tell the Chair what arguments are repetitious and what are not. Sir, we have

complete faith in your judgment and-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest that the Member for Queenstown does not

drag  the Speaker into this controversy. I do not think the Leader of the  House

when he said what he said meant to cast a reflection on the Chair at all. He was

just  expressing  his  own view that the debate has become  tedious,  which,  of

course,  is  not the view of the Speaker. Up to this extent, it has  not  become

tedious repetition, but there has been repetition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we contend that this guillotine which the Government

wants  to  impose  on  the debate is both unreasonable and unnecessary,  and  is

merely an attempt to shut off public gaze from the debate in this Assembly. But,

Sir,  there  may be something more sinister than merely trying to  cut  off  the

public  gaze from the debate in this Assembly. It may be that the Prime Minister

is  working  on  a  set time schedule to sell out the rights of  the  people  of

Singapore.  We  all understand how eager and anxious the Prime  Minister  is  to

railroad merger. He has repeatedly said that the earlier merger takes place, the

better.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, of course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, of course.

Because  without merger, that will be the end of the P.A.P. Ministers, and  with

each passing day, the fortunes of the P.A.P. will be sinking deeper and deeper-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is the other way round.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - into the mud and mire of shame and dishonesty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where do you find such phrases?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We know, Sir, that there are certain forces that are

working on a set time schedule -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What are the forces?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to enslave the people of Singapore. If the P.A.P. -

especially  the Prime Minister - want to guillotine the debate on  this  Bill  in

order  that  they  may time the rigging of the referendum to fit  in  with  the

colonial scheme of things and to keep their word with the colonialists to  sell

the  rights of the people of Singapore on time -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I hear no more of neo-colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - then their crime and treachery will be the more

disgusting, and the more will they earn the condemnation of this generation  and

the generations to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge that the P.A.P. withdraw this guillotine motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Deputy Prime Minister moved two motions which were, in fact, unnecessary because

if  they were not passed, the Members sitting on our side might still enjoy  two

or three days more of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. have been boasting that the purpose of their Government is to enable the people to understand parliamentary democracy. But I

would like to say that they have not practised this during the present debate on

the Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Back benches, there is an elderly gentleman, the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister. He  has  more  than  once

advised the P.A.P. Government not to behave in the way they were doing - in a hot-tempered and impetuous manner.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know

how  this story has anything at all to do with the motion before the House.  How

can  the advice of a Parliamentary Secretary to his Government be related at all

to this guillotine motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

That  is  relevant,  otherwise I would not have  mentioned  it.  If  it  is  not

relevant, I apologise to you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like to know how that is relevant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  believe  that it must be relevant to the matter under discussion because  the

Parliamentary Secretary did say that if one wants to snap a bamboo stick one has

to  burn it to such an extent that it can be easily snapped. Of course, it would

he difficult to do so without using a fire to burn it first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope on the question of merger and on the National Referendum Bill, the

P.A.P.  Government will pay heed to the moral of the story given by the  elderly

gentleman to them.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member for Anson was the first one from the  Opposition  to

stand  up  and criticise the Government for introducing this motion  before  the

House.  In  a short but well-reasoned speech, he pointed out that there  was  no

necessity for introducing the guillotine motion because he believed that all the

remaining amendments would have been disposed of by Friday. I agree with him.  I

think  the remaining amendments would have been disposed of by Friday. The  only

amendment which is very controversial out of the remaining amendments is the one

that  is  now  before the House - the amendment on the blank and uncertain  votes.

Many  Members of the Barisan Sosialis have already spoken, and unless they  want

to  keep  on repeating what they have been saying, there would not be much  time

wasted. I would have supported the Member for Anson, but after listening to  the

lengthy speech of the leader of the Barisan Sosialis who at every step in  this

Assembly  turns every little thing into a political issue between his Party  and

his  ex-comrades, I find it difficult to allow any intention on the part of  the

Barisan  Sosialis to turn this House into a death struggle between them and  the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Queenstown had any sense of wanting to save time for

his Party to attack the P.A.P. on the important issues which he contends are  at

stake, he  would not have wasted about 25 minutes of valuable time  arguing  on

points  that could not hold water at all, other than for the reason that if  the

P.A.P. want to play funny, then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 560</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis will play funny. If the P.A.P. and the Barisan  Sosialis  have

any  monkey business, may I suggest that they take it outside this Assembly?  Go

and  do  it outside, but do not try to do it in an august Assembly whose Members

have to sit here and listen to nothing but-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Trash.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - attacks of

personal vindictiveness from one side against the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, for the expeditious disposal of the business before us, that

even the Government side should not try to interrupt unnecessarily any speech of

the  Barisan Sosialis. If they want to have as much fun as they want,  let  them

have it, and give as much as you want to give when it comes to your turn. But do

not try to prolong the debate unnecessarily by interrupting any speaker from the

Barisan Sosialis or from the P.A.P. Let us get down to the serious business of the

day.  We  still have many, many hours up to Friday and if we just sit  down  and

leave only the leaders to fight over the matter, it could even be settled before

Friday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  motion is of a procedural  nature  and  no  political

principles  are  involved.  Our  stand, from the  beginning  when  the  National

Referendum   Bill  was  introduced,  is  that  there  are  actually   two   very

controversial  issues to be fought out, namely, our amendment to clause  5,  and

the  controversial question of blank votes. We consider the other clauses as  of

lesser importance and consequence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, we feel that we will have sufficient time to discuss not

only  the Bill but also the motion of the Member for Anson which will be debated

later.  However, Sir, since there are other Members of the Opposition who  might

have new material to bring up in the next few days, we, as Members of the Opposition,  have  to support them because we want them to be given more time  to  put

forward their views.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> May I

just briefly say that I think it is wrong to consider this motion as one that is

essentially  procedural?  Sir, I think all of us realise  that  the  purpose  of

having this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 561</b></font><br><br>



guillotine motion is basically political. The Member for Queenstown has  already

stated the reason why the Government seeks to impose this guillotine. It  is  to

make  sure that not more than what is necessary is said in the shortest possible

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we oppose this motion for the reasons that the Member for Queenstown has

given,  and  I  do not propose to go over them again. I would like  to  ask  the

Government  to  explain why, in fact, they want to try and stop  the  debate  on

these  amendments  by Friday. Sir, we are all here to discuss matters  affecting

our  people,  and I am quite certain that all of us can find sufficient  time - if

the  Government  wants to sit up till midnight, we can sit up  till  midnight - to

discuss  matters fairly so that the issues are made clearer to  the  people  and

there will be no confusion and misunderstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has quoted precedents - like the Minister for Law who quoted precedents of referenda held elsewhere - which are irrelevant, from my

point  of  view, because the matter we are discussing at the moment is so  grave

that  I  think to use their majority to impose a guillotine is completely unfair

to the Opposition, and it is even more unfair to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are quite prepared to play the game according to the rules. The rules

are  made by the P.A.P. Government. Although they have a weak majority, they are

in  a  position to make whatever rules they want to make. But we tell them quite

plainly that whatever rules they make, we will play according to them. If we  op

pose  them, we may expose the unfair and unjust principle underlying them. Nevertheless,  we will play the game according to the rules they make. We tell  them,

Sir,  irrespective of the rules, irrespective of the extent to which  the  rules

are  unfair,  the  final  losers are going to be  none  other  than  the  P.A.P.

Government themselves.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, to my mind, parliamentary democracy does not mean  that  all  the

Members  in  an Assembly must speak on every possible point of issue that  comes

before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It does not mean that it wants you not to talk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir, it does not mean that one should not talk. It

also  does not mean that one should not be stopped from talking. What it  means

to  the  Member  for Thomson is his point of view, but to my  way  of  thinking[Interruption]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - parliamentary democracy means this, that every possible point of

view should be put to the House. And if that can only be achieved by a number of

persons speaking, then it is necessary that those persons should speak. But when

every  possible  point  of view on a particular topic has  been  presented,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, does parliamentary democracy necessitate all those  views  to  be

repeated ad nauseam until everything is so clogged and befuddled that the  whole

House is confused?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will have had today eight full hours of debate; tomorrow

another  eight, and the day after another eight. We will have had  24  hours  of

debate on the Referendum Bill. To my mind, the issue now before the House on the

Referendum Bill is possibly the only important issue left. The rest are relatively  unimportant, and I dare say could be disposed of in two or three hours.  And

when  this issue now before the House has been disposed of one way or the other,

the  heat  will be taken out of the debate. I predict it, Mr Speaker, Sir.  And

the  Barisan Sosialis, their interest in this Bill will vanish after  that.  Mr

Speaker,  I  have been listening to this debate. Without in any  way  derogating

from your authority, if I may say so and if I may be so bold as to say it, every

argument  has been repeated. I will not say it has become tedious,  but  it  has

been  repeated.  Does  parliamentary democracy mean  that  the  leaders  in  the

Opposition having spoken the rest of the Opposition get up and merely repeat  ad

nausea  in other words what their leaders have already said? To my  mind,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that is not parliamentary democracy. To my way of thinking,  that

is a sure way to bring to an end parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If I might ask the Member for Farrer Park whether he will agree with

me  that whether it is parliamentary democracy or unparliamentary democracy,  it

is  absolutely necessary that our people are fully aware of the pros and cons of

an  issue,  especially on an issue which affects their lives,  their  children's

lives, and the lives of generations to come?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely

agree  with the Member for Thomson that these debates are debates conducted  not

for  the  sake  of  conducting debates but in order that as a  result  of  these

debates people outside will read the debates and come to certain conclusions  on

the  debates, not necessarily the conclusions that we ourselves come to; but  at

least  the  facts will be before them, and they themselves can come  to  certain

conclusions  on them. Mr Speaker, Sir, the point is this: are we advancing  the

case  any further by repeating the same arguments, and the same facts, time  and

time  again? Parliamentary democracy, to my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, in a  debate

of  this nature is not to deliver long speeches written out by somebody else and

not understanding what it all means.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, in connection with the debate on the National Referendum Bill which

has been carrying on for five days - and  every  day  the  debate  has been reproduced in  the  newspapers  for  the

consumption of the people of Singapore - I am surprised that when I wake up in the morning I meet my friends in town and

elsewhere  and they tell me that they are getting fed up with the  news  in  the

newspapers  about  the proceedings in the Assembly, because according  to  them,

this  referendum  and  the  merger issue have been  fully  considered  by  them,

although  I  am not necessarily influenced by the views and opinions  of  people

outside  this Assembly. Mr Speaker, we should take into consideration the  fact

that we in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 564</b></font><br><br>



this Assembly are duty bound to debate all issue which affects the lives of  the

people  of  Singapore, but there are other matters which should be looked  after

too.  If we follow the debate which has been carrying on so far, it is really  a

matter  for regret, because the standard of our debates has lowered the  dignity

of  the  House to the level of coffee-shop talk, whereas, in fact,  we  are  the

elected  representatives of the people entrusted to look after their well-being.

Where  do  we stand if our standard of debates has been reduced to that  of  the

coffee-shop talk, as I said earlier on? Every speaker who has risen to speak has

risen  to speak just for the sake of speaking. So I sincerely hope that although

we  have  parliamentary democracy in this Assembly, we should not bring into  it

the opinions and views of the people outside and thereby become stooges. For  me

and  my  colleagues, Mr Speaker, this motion has our support. So we can say  we

have   exhausted  all  points,  whether  they  are  the  Government's   or   the

Opposition's.  They have no new points to bring forth. I hope we  will  preserve

the dignity of this House where debates are conducted according to the rules  of

the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I knew that when I moved this motion I opened

myself  to  the  charge that I was trying to gag Members of the Opposition  from

speaking. Nonetheless, we have to bear in mind that if the business of the House

is  to  proceed expeditiously, then it is obvious that Members who wish to speak

must bear on the point and not be repetitious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that the House of Commons procedure is not

applicable to this Assembly. He has forgotten, Mr Speaker, that a large part of

our  Standing Orders is based on procedure which has been in practice for  years

and  years in the House of Commons. In fact, I could even inform the House  that

in  the  Federation Parliament, the guillotine is always applied and that  there

are  allocated days for discussion on items on the Order Paper. That is the main

reason   why   business  is  proceeded  with  expeditiously  in  the  Federation

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 565</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as the Member for Thomson has said that it is the P.A.P. that makes

the  rules.  The Standing Orders are made by this House. There is  the  Standing

Orders  Committee drawn from both sides of this House, and we  are  just  moving

this motion according to the Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether there will be a total of seven days for debate on the National

Referendum Bill in Committee. Members will also be aware that in Committee stage

any  Member can stand up again and again to speak. There is no rule debarring  a

Member from standing up and repeating himself. In fact, during the past few days

we  have had a disgusting exhibition of the Barisan Sosialis repeating the  same

old tune like a gramophone record that has been so scratched that the needle has

now  got stuck in the groove. They have no more new tunes to sing. What I  would

say to the Barisan Sosialis is that they are trying to filibuster, to delay this

Bill from going through. If we go through the records of the meetings in the Committee  stage, I think - if I am correct - the Member for Anson must have stood  up

nearly thirty times during the past four days of debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They were never irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Members of the Barisan Sosialis side stood up more than

thirty  times also. Nobody has stepped them from speaking. In fact,  the  reason

why  the  sitting  has  been extended to midnight is to permit  Members  of  the

Opposition more time to state their case. We give them more time to state  their

case,  hut they say we are undemocratic. We allow them to hold meetings outside,

but  they say we are undemocratic. Such is the tortuous and crooked thinking  of

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finally, Mr Speaker, there must be a balance between the demand for time

so  that  this House can proceed with its business and the demand for  time  for

debate. There must be a balance. We agree to that. If I had sprung



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 566</b></font><br><br>



this  motion  as a surprise on the House, then I would have been guilty  of  the

charge that we are trying to stop Members in this House from speaking. In  fact,

this motion provides that the debate on the National Referendum Bill will end at

12  o'clock  midnight  on Friday. That gives us another  four  days  of  debate,

including  today.  The  Member for Anson himself has  stated  that  it  is  even

possible  that  the debate on the Bill will come to an end long  before  Friday.

Therefore,  I  do not see any reason why he opposes the motion. He  himself  has

admitted  that this motion provides that at the latest, the debate should  come

to a conclusion by Friday at 12 o'clock. He himself has agreed that it might end

long  before that time. So I see no reason why he should stand up to oppose this

motion, unless, of course, it is merely that because he feels that he is on the

Opposition side, so he just has to oppose anything that we propose.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the Minister, if the Minister had listened,

Sir,  he would not have made it necessary for me to repeat what was said. I said

that  it may well be in the natural course of events that the debate would termi

nate  well before midnight on Friday, that in the circumstances this motion  was

unnecessary, and that I do not like the approach of the Government whereby  they

arrogate to themselves the right to indulge in a closure motion prematurely  and

unnecessarily in a matter of such vital importance to the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am obliged to the Member for Anson for his clarification.

But I have also cited precedents that took place in the House of Commons. I have

cited  that only recently in January this year, the House of Commons  imposed  a

guillotine on the debate in Committee on the Commonwealth Immigration  Bill  and

on  the  Army Reserve Bill, and for the very same reason - that progress  was  not

being made on those two Bills. The Members were being repetitious. You yourself,

Mr Speaker, had at one stage during the debate in Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 567</b></font><br><br>



even suggested that a closure motion should be made. I think it was on the first

amendment.  I know that Members of the House like to hear themselves heard.  But

perhaps  they could be also more forbearing to other Members. If there  are  new

points  of view being put forward and new arguments which can be advanced,  then

we  are  quite prepared to listen to them. But when they become tendentious  and

repetitious with abuse creeping in between arguments, I do not think it is  fair

to  impose  upon Members of this House a recital of what has been  said  before,

again and again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I point out to Members of the House that in the Committee of

Supply, the Standing Orders specially provide for allocation of time. There is a

time-table  for debate on the items of expenditure, otherwise, Mr Speaker,  you

and I will not be getting our salaries and neither will Members of this House be

getting  their allowances. We could have debated in the Committee of  Supply  on

and  on  until  we  cover  365 days in the year and we  will  never  come  to  a

conclusion. It was precisely in order that the business of Supply should come to

a  conclusion that we have Standing Orders which specially provide for  a  time-table.  It  may be that in our present Standing Orders, we do not have  a  time-table in respect of other items of business. But it is fair to the House that we

should  also  try  to  be considerate to other Members of  the  House  who  have

responsibilities  outside.  Members of the Government  have  their  business  to

conduct besides attending sittings in this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, I really see little objection from the arguments put forward

by  the  Member for Anson or from the Barisan Sosialis as to why we  should  not

proceed with this motion. I think the most pertinent point that has been made in

this  debate  has  come from the Member for Farrer Park who has quite  correctly

pointed  out  that  if  we  were to go on at this rate,  it  would  not  elevate

parliamentary democracy, but it would kill parliamentary democracy.  As  he  has

replied  to  the  Member  for Thomson, parliamentary  democracy  does  not  mean

permitting a Member to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 568</b></font><br><br>



come  back to the Chamber reading scripts prepared by somebody else Outside  and

these are very lengthy scripts indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is on your side.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I respect a Member whether he is on this side or on the

Opposition side if he is a stable man.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Of course, if

the  Member  for Anson were equally stable, I would respect him. In fact,  until

only recently, I had great respect for the Member for Anson. But when on certain

occasions  he has gone into a tantrum, then I am afraid my respect for  him  has

somewhat  diminished.  But  if the hon. Member wishes  to  uphold  parliamentary

democracy - as I am quite sure he wants to - he should support the Member for Farrer

Park.

<div align="center"><b>REFERENDUM BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee.







<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 28.

An amendment has been moved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, to leave out lines 40 to 43 inclusive and insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified except the printed number on the back;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) which is unmarked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which is void for uncertainty."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated, this opens out a debate on what has been called the

"blank  votes" clause, that is the next clause, clause 29, and the  debate  will

also extend over the first two amendments to that clause - one in the name of  the Member for Anson,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out from "who" to the end of line 18, and

insert "is not in favour of any of the proposals posed by the referendum or  has

not understood the questions or the instructions for voting".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 570</b></font><br><br>



And the other amendment is in the name of the Member for Hong Lim,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out "accepts or is willing" and insert "rejects

or is unwilling".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the debate

yesterday  on the blank and uncertain votes, I would like to tell the Government

Members  that although they have raised many points, they have not been able  to

give  reasons to justify the provisions for blank and uncertain votes.  If  they

want  to do this without considering any of our amendments, then this referendum

has  lost its meaning. At the same time, this referendum is a democratic way  of

doing  things.  We all know in our society - that is, one elector, one  vote - many

unconstitutional things can be done in the name of democracy. We  can  say  that

the P.A.P. are guilty of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the

P.A.P. was elected as a democratic Party. Today, the referendum is put  forward

as a democratic measure. But is this a genuine or a

false  democratic  measure that now confronts us? We see  that  there  are  many

clauses  in  the  Referendum  Bill which are undemocratic.  But  the  democratic

measures  of  the P.A.P. have the support of only 26 elected representatives  in

this  Assembly. Mr Speaker, Sir, some people who have a bigger force ask  those

people who have a smaller force to vote for them;

such  a  democracy  is  just like the Lim Yew Hock Government's  democracy.  The

democracy  practised by the P.A.P. nowadays is no more different.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  let  me  say this. The P.A.P. put up their merger proposals and  use  this

Referendum Bill to force the people to vote for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me quote the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th April, 1962, regarding the Prime Minister's radio forum. It was reported in page 5 of the

local  news page. The Prime Minister, replying to a reporter's question  on  merger,  said,  "At the moment, we are only concerned with an All-Party discussion.

If  there are any plans, then the societies can raise such problems and  discuss

them." This was on merger. The Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 571</b></font><br><br>



Minister  said  that  this  was  a very good proposition.  Of  course,  all  the

societies  and associations should have an opportunity to raise problems  if  it

was necessary, and then they could send their memoranda on the Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Prime Minister said seemed very democratic. Many

societies and associations sent in their memoranda on this Referendum Bill.  Now

because time is pressing, I am not going to speak at length on this. I am  going

to  speak on just a few cultural societies. The memoranda sent in by such bodies

as the Nanyang University Students' Union, and economic and political societies,

have  three  points  which are worth considering. The first point  is  that  the

undemocratic  provisions, especially clause 29, should be  abolished.  Secondly,

there should only be one question posed-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think all Members of the Assembly have received this

memorandum.  All  the Member should say, I think, is that the  memorandum  urges

this, that and the other, but not to read from the memorandum. I do not think we

should be inflicted with that.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I will not quote it then. I am sure the Ministers  have  received the memorandum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this Referendum Bill, the provision for unmarked votes and blank votes

which  are  deemed to be in favour of the Government is very dangerous.  Let  me

quote an example. In the past the Lim Yew Hock Government sold Christmas Island.

If  Lim  Yew  Hock  had  been as smart as the P.A.P., he would  have  posed  two

questions:  "Do  you want to sell Christmas Island," or "ho  you  want  to  sell

Singapore?" Both questions would have been a sell-out. Of course, there would be

people who would have neither of these questions and therefore would cast  blank

votes.  Lim  Yew  Hock then could have utilised this provision and  would  have

taken these votes as in support of the question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. has shown itself to be undemocratic. The people of Singapore

do  not  trust  the Party any more. For instance, the fox, which  is  a  cunning

animal, is hated by all its kind and they do not want to befriend him. And  this

fox  put  on  a sheep's clothing to deceive the other animals, but  he  did  not

succeed.  In  the course of the debate over the past few days the  P.A.P. said

that  they  wanted to pose two questions to the people for them to  decide.  But

both  these questions are in opposition to the wishes and interests of  the  peo

ple.  The people, therefore, might cast blank votes or abstain from voting.  And

they  now  say  that such votes are to be taken as votes in favour  of  the  Government. This is not democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta, who is the wife of the Minister for Home Affairs, quoted

an  article in the local news-page of the Nanyang Siang Pau of today's date. She

quoted:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They have no way out. They have become the compradores of the colonialists.'



br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, if we were to unite all the people of Singapore and get  them

to  oppose  the Government's sell-out, then they could accuse us of  such  behaviour.  But in the past when Lim Yew Hock succeeded in a partial -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

must  know that he must not refer to a Member of this House by his name  but  by

his constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  am  sorry.  I am grateful for your ruling. In the past when the Labour  Front

Government had a Chief Minister in Mr Marshall, i.e. the Member for Anson  now,

he  organised an All-Party Delegation on the Constitutional Talks. At that  time

all Parties represented in the Assembly were included in the delegation, because

the interests of the people of Singapore had to be protected irrespective of the

views  of  political Parties. And so we must all unite together to  oppose  this

sell-out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Can the hon.

Member indicate what he means by a "sell-out"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is the talk that is going on in coffee-shops and  market

places,  the talk that the P.A.P. is selling out the country and the  people  by

merger  and  that this merger is detrimental to the interests of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Can the hon.

Member explain how all that is relevant to the blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, it appears to be unconnected with the blank votes, but if you

will  allow me to go a little bit deeper, I shall be able to show the relevance.

Let  me quote an example, padi planting. If you do not sow seeds, you cannot get

padi. That is why there is a connection. The connection comes here:

if  there  was no Paper Cmd. 33, there would not be a National Referendum  Bill,

and so there would not be so much debate now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just mentioned to you what the Member for Delta has

said.  She  has  accused us of this and that. It may be that we  have  political

differences with the Government Benches, but if a fire should break out on their

side we would carry water over and put out the fire. Therefore, if the basis  of

the  Government's policy is in the interests of the people, we will support  the

Government, but not otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P. were to introduce measures in the interests of the people, then

they should face realities. And if they were democratic, then they should change

their  attitude towards these blank votes. If a voter is very dissatisfied  with

their  attitude, then he might just draw a line across the voting  paper  or  he

might  even draw a tortoise on it. This action, therefore, reflects the attitude

of  the people towards this provision. The Government should face realities  and

not   waste  any  time.  They  are  afraid  of  being  exposed.  But  we,  being

representatives  of the people, struggle for the interests  of  the  people  and

relay  the opinions of the people in this House. I believe democracy means  just

this. I should emphasise that if the Government were to practise real democracy,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 574</b></font><br><br>



then  blank  votes  and uncertain votes should be considered void.  If  the  Government insist on such votes as being in favour of merger, then it is not right.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>     [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): During these last few

days  we have been debating the National Referendum Bill, in the course of which

everybody  can  see clearly that the provisions in the Bill are undemocratic  as

well  as  unreasonable, barbaric and dictatorial. The P.A.P. wants to adulterate

the  views of the people by means of the passage of this Bill and also by  means

of carrying out its phoney merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, everybody can see the exposure of the P.A.P.'s undemocratic National

Referendum Bill. The undemocratic provisions have appeared glaringly in the eyes

of  the  people. After the heated debates, the P.A.P. Government cannot  explain

and  cannot  advance  any arguments to substantiate their  points.  They  cannot

justify  themselves,  especially on the clause  which  provides  for  blank  and

uncertain votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday in the Assembly the Ministers and Members of the Government were not

able  to  explain, to substantiate and to justify such undemocratic  provisions.

Now,  let  me quote what they said. The Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Home Affairs said that blank votes belong to the category which support the

decision  of  the  Assembly. When people cast blank votes  it  means  that  they

support  the decision of the Assembly. Now that is not very democratic. He  said

that  this  was so, but what were the reasons advanced by him? He was unable  to

give  any  reasons  to  substantiate his arguments. How could  he  convince  the

people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health and Law said - let me quote his words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To let the voter choose from two or more questions and if he cannot make up

his  mind,  then  he  will be deemed to accept the opinion  of  the  Legislative

Assembly on the matter referred in the referendum. This is not undemocratic."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what were his reasons? He was also unable to give any reason. The

Government are only trying to turn things upside down. When something is  black,

they say it is white, and when it is white, they say it is black.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, we all know and all the people of Singapore know that there have never been such provisions in the world which provide that blank votes and

uncertain  votes  are  to be construed as votes in support of  the  Government's

phoney merger, because everybody knows that such blank votes and uncertain votes

should be construed as void votes or votes not in support of any measure. We all

know  that  in democratic countries, when people are faced with two unreasonable

or  unacceptable questions, the people will have the democratic right to abstain

from voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, I believe you also know that there were trade unions, rural organisations, hawkers' organisations and students' associations which gave

their representations to the Select Committee, but their views were not accepted

by  the  P.A.P.  Ministers. They also know that in the streets, in  the  coffee-shops,  everywhere  and  at every corner, people have been  talking  about  this

undemocratic  Bill. They all hate the dictatorship of the P.A.P.  We  also  know

that outside this House there are five political Parties - the Workers' Party, the

United People's Party, the Liberal Socialist Party, the Barisan Sosialis and the

United  Democratic  Party.  They form the Council of Joint  Action  against  the

P.A.P.'s  undemocratic National Referendum Bill in order to check  the  P.A.P.'s

evil actions, to explode the myth of the P.A.P.'s accusation that all those  who

oppose the P.A.P. are Communists or pro-Communists or their stooges, and also to

protest  against  the  Government's other acts, such as  pushing  through  their

National Referendum Bill and their phoney merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, you will also remember that on the 24th of June, the Workers' Party at an All-Party mass rally at Anson, the Secretary-General of the S.P.A.,

Mr Lim Kim Chuan, talked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 576</b></font><br><br>



about  the  undemocratic ways of the P.A.P. in regard to the National Referendum

Bill  and  about certain undemocratic provisions in the Bill. Mr Lim Kim  Chuan

said that the S.P.A. were not as stinking as the P.A.P. It would appear that  he

was also not satisfied with such a provision in the Bill. Those

S.P.A.  Members in this House - after you have heard the words of your  Secretary-General,  what  reflections  do  you  have on  those  words?  You  have  clearly

understood that this Bill is not democratic. Why then do you keep silent and  do

not  want  to  speak out, or dare to stand up to reflect the  feelings  and  the

opinions  of  your Party which has expressed its dissatisfaction with  such  pro

visions as contained in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, since the P.A.P. have said that the White Paper merger is in the best interests of the people, why then do the Government not want to pose only

one  question,  specifically on the merger issue for the people to  decide?  Why

should the Government provide such undemocratic provisions here and try to  pose

two  unreasonable questions to let the people make their choice? When the people

do not want these two unwanted things, they can only cast blank votes or abstain

from  voting.  Then  the P.A.P. would try to construe such  votes  as  votes  in

support of them, as though they want to win both ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Prime Minister has said that the P.A.P. come from the people

and  will go back to the people and be with them; but he has now forgotten  such

words. Were the P.A.P. not elected by the people in the past to become Ministers

today?  Now they are riding on the heads of the people, doing things  their  own

way and disregarding the views of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I will quote the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for National Development. He says there are three factors which go into

the  making of laws. First is usage; second is the objective circumstances; and,

third, the actual effect. I can explain thus: what is the use of this Bill if it

is to deceive the people and to pretend democracy? Now what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 577</b></font><br><br>



are  the circumstances and situations prevailing now? That means that at present

the  P.A.P. will no longer get the support of the people. They dare not face the

people  any  more.  They  can  only  resort to these  undemocratic  and  illegal

provisions to suppress the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the first point -what is the effect of this kind of law? It is to adulterate the views of the people in order to force through the P.A.P.'s phoney

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me quote the Member for Tiong Bahru, who said something

yesterday. I quote from today's Sin Chew Jit Poh,, page 8, local news. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The merger of the peoples of the two territories, Singapore and the

Federation of Malaya, is opposed by them. When the British sometime ago  divided

us, we all rose against them hut now when the people want to merge, they try  to

oppose  it.  The provision of blank votes is to encourage the people  to  vote.

These  people who oppose it can cast votes to show their opposition,  and  those

who agree to the question can cast votes in support of it. Is it not democratic?

The  success of the merger is the will of the people and the failure to  achieve

merger  is  also the will of the people. Do you mean to say that the people  do

not know what is right and what is wrong?"



<br><br>Now  I  will ask: Do you not allow the people to cast votes against the P.A.P.'s

White  Paper merger proposals? Since he has said so, perhaps he means that  they

have the intention to allow the people to do so.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Mammen, on this

question of unmarked and uncertain votes, I think it is necessary to go back  to

the history of this clause and the justification for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, when the Bill was tabled for First Reading, there was no such provision in the Bill. Soon after we saw amendments moved by the Barisan

Sosialis  and  the Member for Anson for the right of the voters to  destroy  and

deface  their  ballot  papers. They also demanded that  such  unprecedented  and

provocative action should go unpunished, as can be seen in their amendments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 578</b></font><br><br>



These amendments were clear documentary evidence confirming the information that

the  Government have had earlier, that the Communists and their stooges  in  the

Barisan Sosialis-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr

Mammen. I believe, Sir, that there is a Standing Order about people reading from

written speeches. The Minister should be able to deliver a speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Standing Order,

as  the Member for Anson knows, forbids a Member from reading his speech, but he

can make occasional reference to his notes. Mr Ong Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> At least I am reading my speech, unlike some Members

opposite whose speeches have to be given to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, as I was saying just now, these amendments were clear documentary evidence confirming what information the Government have had earlier that the

Communists  and  their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis were  out  to  wreck  the

referendum  on  merger. Therefore, the Second Reading of the Bill was  postponed

mainly in order to think of ways and means to frustrate this Communist intention

and  to  ensure  that  the  genuine wishes of the people  are  ascertained.  The

postponement of the Second Reading of the Bill was also to provide machinery for

the referendum petition raised by the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this evil design of the Communists and their stooges in the Barisan

Sosialis  to wreck the merger referendum became as clear as daylight during  the

Select  Committee debate. The Memoranda from the S.A.T.U. group of trade unions,

Old  Boys'  Associations, Hawkers and Rural organisations  only  confirmed  this

sinister intention. I shall elaborate on this a bit further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Barisan Sosialis demanded that only one question can be posed in a

referendum.  Now  this was contrary to the pro-Communist unions'  original  line

that there should be two questions. Now, the pro-Communists' original stand  was

that it would be unfair to put only the White Paper proposals to the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 579</b></font><br><br>



because  since everybody was in favour of merger, they would naturally vote  for

the  White Paper. To be fair, they argued that their stand of full and  complete

merger, like Penang and Malacca, should also be put to the people. Soon after it

was  decided in Djakarta by the P.K.I. that Malaysia was an imperialist plot  to

bring  neo-colonialism  to this part of the world. The  only  way  to  frustrate

Malaysia in Singapore was to wreck the merger. Thereafter, the original line  of

two  questions, "Do you want the White Paper merger" or "Do you  want  full  and

complete  merger like Penang and Malacca" was switched in favour of one question

on the White Paper only. The purpose of a national referendum-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification. Would the Minister be good enough to

indicate  where in any of the considerable debates in this House  there  is  the

slightest  mention  that  any  Member  of  the  Opposition - Barisan  Sosialis  or

otherwise - requested that there should be an alternative merger  like  Penang  or

Malacca? He has got the Hansards up till this morning's. Can he indicate support

for that statement?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I said that this was the original line of the pro-Communist

unions. It was circulated amongst the members and the cadres in the unions  that

that should be the case. I do not propose to waste my time further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of a national referendum is to ascertain the majority view of the

people on a matter of national importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> When it was demonstrated beyond all doubt in the Select

Committee  by  means  of illustrations and actual examples that  more  than  one

question  in  the  form  of  alternative choice is sometimes  necessary  if  the

majority  views of the people are to be ascertained, the Barisan  Sosiahis  then

stated  that  there  must be the right to say "No" to any  number  of  questions

posed.  Their purpose is obvious. The Barisan Sosialis hope thereby  they  could

instigate the people by means of malicious rumours and falsehoods and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 580</b></font><br><br>



fear  of  intimidation  to  vote  "No"  to  all  the  questions  posed,  thereby

frustrating the object of the referendum. To make sure that they would  succeed,

they  demanded  the unprecedented right to destroy ballot papers  legally.  They

thought  that  in securing this right the Communists and their  stooges  in  the

unions  could  mount  a campaign by exploiting communal fears  and  chauvinistic

sentiments  to  get  innocent  people  to  protest  against  the  referendum  by

destroying  and defacing ballot papers. Not satisfied with this, to  make  their

success  doubly sure, they asked that the people should be able  to  cast  blank

votes so that the true wishes of the people cannot be ascertained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having understood what the pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis were up

to,  it  is  only right and proper for a responsible Government to take  counter

measures to frustrate this Communist attempt to wreck the referendum. Therefore,

on  the  Second Reading of the Bill, an amendment was moved to clause  29,  sub-clause (1) which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person whose ballot paper is unmarked or is uncertain shall he deemed to

be  a person who accepts or is willing to accept the decision of the Legislative

Assembly on the matter referred for the referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why should the Barisan Sosialis want the right to organise a campaign to

instigate  the voters into casting blank votes? One has always to remember  that

in  any  discussion on matters that affect the future of the people, one  should

not  lose  sight of the political reality. It is useless to seek an  ideal  that

exists  only  in  fantasy  or  in the mind of the  Member  for  Anson.  In  this

particular issue of merger, the basic factor which everyone must not lose  sight

of  in  the heat of the argument is that no one in the Opposition, least of  all

the  Barisan  Sosialis, is against merger, or at least that  is  what  they  say

publicly. All agree that there should be merger between Singapore and  the  Federation,  but what the Barisan Sosialis are against is that the P.A.P. Government

have  not  gone  far enough to demand for a complete merger, so  that  Singapore

should become a constituent State like Penang or Malacca.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since all are agreed that there should be merger, the difference is in

the mode and manner of effecting such a merger. Obviously, the best and only way

to  ascertain the majority view of the people is to put to them the  alternative

as in the case of the Cameroons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to say "No" is inherent in the choice that one makes. If the Barisan

Sosialis  and their supporters think that the White Paper is unacceptable,  what

they need do is to vote for their brand of merger, which means "No" to the White

Paper.  There is no need, Mr Mammen, to cast blank votes. The Barisan  Sosialis

have  claimed again and again that they represent the people of Singapore.  Now,

if  the  Barisan Sosialis believe that they have the full support of the people,

not  just their support on paper, then why not ask the people to vote for  their

proposition, and secure their objective? Why ask the people to cast blank votes?

Are  they  not so sure of the support of the people, 38 trade unions  and  rural

organisations  notwithstanding? If the pro-Communists and the  Barisan  Sosialis

have  the full support of the people, as they claim, why should there be 40  per

cent blank votes in the example given by the Member for Thomson yesterday? Those

40  per  cent  blank votes should have gone to the Barisan Sosialis proposition.

The  question of 40 per cent blank votes should not have arisen at all. The acts

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis lead one to the logical conclusion that  the  pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis, in fact, do not want merger in any form,  other

than merger with Indonesia or when perhaps there is a Communist or pro-Communist

Government in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having made the first error of declaring for full and complete merger

like  Penang or Malacca, the Barisan Sosialis could not publicly repudiate their

stand; and even if they want to, they dare not for they realise that they cannot

stem  the tide of history and go against the wishes of the people. However, they

did not then expect the Government to take their proposition seriously, and that

the Federation, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 582</b></font><br><br>



any  case,  would not accept it. Here, we see how dishonest and  unfaithful  the

Barisan Sosialis are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the reunification of Singapore and the Federation -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen):

Order, it is time to suspend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of tile Committee and took the

Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The sitting is

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>





<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 28 - an

amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, before the House adjourned just now, I was trying to analyse the reason why

the  Barisan Sosialis want this right to cast blank votes when they in fact  are

in  favour of merger on the basis of the Penang and Malacca type, and I went  on

to  give  the  reason,  that although that was their stand taken  publicly,  but

privately in effect they do not want any merger. That is why they want  to  have

this right to cast blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker Sir, the reunification of Singapore and the Federation has

been  a  long  cherished aspiration of all nationalist and progressive  organisa

tions  in  Malaya, ever since the British colonialists divided  the  country  in

1946.  Since  that time, the merger of the two territories has never  been  lost

sight of by all anti-colonialists in their fight against colonial rule. However,

when merger is around the corner, and no longer just wishful thinking, the self-styled  anti-colonial Barisan Sosialis have done a somersault and  become  anti-merger.  They  do  not  wish to be independent by merging with  the  Federation.

Instead,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 583</b></font><br><br>



they prefer to retain colonial rule by their demand for internal self-government

under  the British. They would rather our country and our people remain divided.

In perpetuating the division of our country and our people and in prolonging the

colonial  rule, the barisan Sosialis and their Communist masters are  the  real

enemies  of  the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, the anti-merger stand  taken  by  the

Barisan Sosialis as evidenced by their strenuous effort to wriggle out of  their

complete merger stand is understandable because it is an open front organisation

through  which the Communists seek to expand their influence and to  co-ordinate

their  other  front organisations and also to open a new front on the  political

plane.  No one therefore need be surprised if he reads in the newspaper  that  a

Joint  Action Committee of the Barisan Sosialis and the pro-colonial  capitalist

Party,  the  Liberal Socialists, has been formed. The history and experience  of

Communist parties elsewhere have shown that the Communists are prepared  at  any

time,  if  it is in their ultimate interest, to sacrifice their lofty principles

and join forces with the most reactionary of political forces. No doubt, the pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis are well trained in the Communist tactics  of

the  united  front and have sacrificed whatever socialist principles  that  they

professed  publicly  to  join forces with a Party that is  noted  for  its  pro-colonial,  pro-capitalist  and reactionary interests.  It  has  been  said,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  by the Barisan Sosialis that we have distorted  their  stand  on

merger,  that  the  Penang and Malacca type of merger was a  concoction  of  the

P.A.P.  Now, it is an honourable practice of the Communists to tell a bare-faced

lie  if they are cornered. Similarly, I see this same tactic being practised  to

its  perfection by the Barisan Sosialis. I do not intend to go into  details  on

this.  What  the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger is will be the  subject  of  a

debate  later on. But it is necessary in discussing this amendment to clause  29

to touch briefly on this point because their argument is that the people will be

given two unacceptable alternatives and one of the unacceptable alternatives  is

our interpretation of what the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger was. Now, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 584</b></font><br><br>



have  here  with  me a copy of the manifesto of the Barisan Sosialis  dated  3rd

September,  1961, which states their stand on merger. I will quote the  relevant

portion:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Barisan Sosialis stand for a united

Malayan  State  comprising  the  territories now  known  as  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya.  The reunification of the Federation  and  Singapore  is

inevitable.'



<br><br>It  is  inevitable, and we are glad that there is now universal  recognition  of

this fact. Then they went on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The way ahead therefore for a real reunification of our people and our

country is in one of two directions: (a) an immediate, full and complete  merger

with  Singapore  joining the Federation as a constituent State  like  Penang  or

Malacca,'

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of

order, Sir, I would like him to quote the whole text, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think

that  is  a  point  of  order. I think the Member will have  an  opportunity  of

answering.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if it is wrongly put, he may correct me later on when I sit down. I  still

maintain that it is not a distortion of what was stated in their manifesto.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there was no mention whatsoever of automatic citizenship  rights.

It  is a categorical statement of the Barisan Sosialis stand on merger announced

publicly  to  the people and published in the newspapers as well. Subsequent  to

this, they have also written to the Deputy Prime Minister on similar lines; also

in  a  radio  forum  attended by the Member for Queenstown.  Perhaps  these  are

embarrassing statements to be reminded of. However, we have no doubt  that  they

made their stand on merger with all sincerity at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fundamental democratic right to vote is safeguarded in

this  Bill. No one is deprived of this right, be he a Barisan Sosialis,  a  Workers'  Party, or a United People's Party member or even a Communist. Now  no  one

believes that this fundamental democratic right to a secret vote is practised in

a  fascist  country. Is this fundamental democratic right available in Communist

countries  which  no  doubt the Barisan Sosialis regard as  democratic?  Is  the

fundamental democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 585</b></font><br><br>



right  of a secret vote available to every adult in the so-called People's Democracy?

The answer is "No".



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to vote is only accorded to the "people" and the people are those

who  support  the Communist ideology and accept the leadership of the  Communist

Party.  All the others who do not share the ideology of the Communists or refuse

to  accept  the  Communist Party leadership are classified  as  enemies  of  the

people,  and  as  enemies  of  the people they have no  rights  whatsoever.  All

fundamental human rights, including the right to vote, are deprived from the so-called  enemies of the people. And judged by the standards set in  the  People's

Democracy, the 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen would be classified as enemies  of

the  people. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are genuinely

interested in the fundamental democratic right of the people may I suggest  that

they attempt it in the People's Democracy? In the People's Democracy, even where

elections  are held and the people are allowed to vote, they can only vote  from

an  approved  list of candidates, all belonging to the same Party. There  is  no

choice for the voter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They can put in blank votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In conclusion,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to repeat that the fundamental democratic right  of  a

secret vote is not denied to any voter. He is at liberty to make his choice. The

purpose  of  a referendum is to ascertain the wishes of the people. It  is  only

right  and proper that he should go and vote properly. If he is confused by  the

malicious rumours and lies spread by the Barisan Sosialis and not able  to  make

up  his mind either way and would like to leave the choice to his elected  representative  in  the Assembly, I see nothing wrong in it. In fact, it  is  a  wise

thing to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the amendment on the blank votes, I have this to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 586</b></font><br><br>



say.  At present everyone in Singapore is concerned with the question of citizenship.  Citizenship  right means the right to vote, a right which  is  sought  by

every  person.  A  citizen is entitled to say "Yes" or "No"  to  any  policy  or

measure  to  be  adopted by the Government. Therefore, it should be  made  clear

under  what circumstances can the people abstain and so give up their  right  to

say  "Yes"  or  "No". We know very well that when the people are faced  with  no

choice  but  to  say "No", then they will abstain. Everybody agrees  that  in  a

normal general election or by-election, there will not be many abstaining votes.

Therefore, the Government now has realised this and is worried if there will  be

a  lot  of  abstention votes. It also realises that blank votes  and  abstention

votes  will mean a protest by the people, and it is their only way of expressing

their dissatisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the new clause to be proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs, we see

that  this  National Referendum Bill will be repealed after the holding  of  the

national referendum on merger. From this we can see that the Government realises

that.  The  present National Referendum Bill, especially the provision regarding

the blank votes, is contrary to normal reason and decency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, normally we should follow common sense whenever we want to

do  a  thing.  However,  on  this grave question which  affects  the  future  of

Singapore, we see that the Government have made use of certain measure  which

are  contrary  to common sense and decency. How can this behaviour  bring  about

good results?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National  Development  mentioned that when we make a law  we  should  take  into

consideration three factors. Firstly, when a law is drafted we must consider the

uses  and  functions of the law. Secondly, the making of that law should  be  in

keeping with the circumstances and situation prevailing. Thirdly, the making  of

that  law  should have regard to this - that is, what result will it achieve?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to point out to you that the P.A.P. has this  purpose  in

mind when introducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 587</b></font><br><br>



this  National Referendum Bill, especially clause 5 and clause 29 which  we  are

debating  now.  According  to the speeches made by  the  P.A.P.  Ministers,  the

purpose  is to make use of this Bill to fix the Barisan Sosialis. From  this  we

can see that the method of the P.A.P. in dealing with the question of merger  is

not in accordance with the interests of the broad masses. It is solely motivated

by the desire to deal a blow at their political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the present circumstances under which this Bill is brought up, we

all  know what are the circumstances and situation. The situation is that people

from  various  strata  of society and people who are holding  various  political

views  are  all opposed to the P.A.P. Government. Under these circumstances,  in

drafting this National Referendum Bill which embodies the provision about  blank

votes - now, what will be the result of the introduction of this Bill? I think not

only  can  they not appease the hatred and hostility of the people, but  it  may

anger them the more against the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. want to fix the Barisan Sosialis and they try to

use all sorts of means, even to sacrificing the rights of the people outside the

Barisan  Sosialis, in order just to achieve this purpose. I would like  to  tell

them  that the result of their effort will result in more people supporting  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  It will result in more people opposing  the  Government  and

hating  the  Government,  because the Government are going  to  sacrifice  their

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see that if the country is run on this basis, any government will not last for long.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in his speech gave

certain  examples which are illogical and inappropriate. To compare  the  Government posing several questions to parents asking their children whether they want

to eat meat or whether they want to eat fish is not proper. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

think  you  will  know  that a wise parent will know that under  certain  circumstances he can satisfy the request of his children. He can give them vegetables



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 588</b></font><br><br>



in  the morning and in the afternoon give them meat and at night give them fish.

But  under  the present constitutional arrangements, can we carry out the  White

Paper  proposals  today;  and tomorrow can we carry out  the  confederation  proposals;  and  the day after tomorrow can we carry out the White Paper  proposals

again? Then, after that, complete merger? Can we do that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta gave some examples which are not appropriate. She said

the  Government asked the people to decide certain questions, which is just like

a  maiden falling in love with two men. She said that under these circumstances,

one  man  is glamorous and the other is more suitable and so she cannot make  up

her  mind  which one to accept. Therefore, she leaves it to her parents  or  her

grand-parents to decide. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether her  experience

is  like  this.  But  to  compare  merger to this  sort  of  affair  is  totally

inappropriate.  Because  I  remember the original  Women's  Charter  Bill  which

stresses that before marriage the couple must be in a healthy condition and they

should  have  a  medical certificate from a doctor before they can  be  married.

Therefore,  in the examples given by the Member for Delta, if the maiden  cannot

make  up  her  mind, she should not consult her mother or her  grandmother.  She

should consult a doctor to see which one is stronger and more healthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Home Affairs has accused us by saying that there is no question of citizenship or question of equality in our

merger  stand.  He has also quoted our Party's manifesto. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

would  remind  him  and  other  Government Ministers  that  this  manifesto  was

published on the 3rd September, 1961, and before this, that is, on 28th  August,

1961,  a  few days before the publication of this manifesto, we had published  a

statement on our stand on merger which clearly pointed out the question of  automatic  citizenship and the question of proportionate representation  in  the  Federal  Parliament. This article was quoted by me when I spoke a  few  days  ago.

Therefore, when the Government said that we did not demand equal citizenship, it

is not correct to say so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs a while ago also mentioned the

fact  that we formed a Joint Action Council with the other political Parties.  I

would  like  to  remind the Government that before the 26th of July,  1961,  the

founder of the Barisan Sosialis published a statement, and in it we pointed  out

that the stand of the new Party is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'First, we should govern our country in consultation with the people and not

through order and command. Second, we should restore the basic democratic rights

of the people. Third, in the future constitutional talks we should safeguard the

interests of the various sections of the community.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half months after that, on 17th September, 1961, at the inaugural

meeting of the Barisan Sosialis, our Secretary-General, in his speech, also gave

the  same  view, that on the question of reunification we have to  shoulder  our

responsibilities  and  these responsibilities are not a  question  of  political

issues but are a matter of national importance. Therefore, the various political

Parties,  the mass organizations and other shades of public opinion should  come

to an understanding on this question of national importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to remind the P.A.P. Government that they should

realise  why,  before  they formed the government, when they  were  a  minor  Opposition  Party  in this House, the British had constitutional  talks  with  the

representatives.  They also advocated that the views of the  Opposition  Parties

should be respected in the Legislative Assembly, because the British people, who

are  clever  people,  know that any Opposition Party might one  day  become  the

government  of tomorrow. If they had a talk with the present Government  without

the  Opposition Parties and when an Opposition Party was voted into power by the

people,  the previous constitutional arrangements would have to be reviewed  and

altered.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On questions of grave importance it is important that we should get the unanimous views of the people. But the merger proposals as outlined in the White

Paper will not bring about harmony



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 590</b></font><br><br>



and  unity  among the various races in Malaya. I hope the P.A.P.  Ministers

will soberly and calmly consider the example of the United Arab Republic. In the

United  Arab  Republic the merger conditions were not as unreasonable  as  ours.

However, eventually Syria had to part from Egypt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government Ministers have told us that the Barisan

Sosialis will be finished when this National Referendum Bill has been passed and

after  merger  takes place. They also stress that the provision regarding  blank

votes  which allow people to accept but not to reject is intended to  deal  with

the Communists. I want to remind them that during the colonial era the Emergency

Regulations  were  also intended to deal with the Communists. However,  we  have

seen  that  the P.A.P., which advocated the repeal of the Emergency Regulations,

were  returned  by  the people and they have now resorted to the  same  tactics.

Today they also say they want to make use of these provisions of the P.P.S.O. to

deal with the Communists. But will the Barisan Sosialis be finished? I think the

governing  Party's effort will prove to be futile. I believe that  even  if  the

deceptive merger proposals are carried out, if in future any Party advocates the

abolition  of  this merger, this Party will get the support of the  people,  and

will  be  returned to power. They will become the Government and  the  objective

conditions  will be such. Although we in the Barisan Sosialis are  facing  great

pressure  from  the  Government which have adopted  all  sorts  of  measures  to

suppress  us,  yet we are confident of our future. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a

matter  for  regret  that the Prime Minister is not here. However,  I  hope  his

colleagues  will convey my message to him. If the P.A.P. Government introduce  a

fair  and  reasonable National Referendum Bill to ascertain the  wishes  of  the

people and allow them to say `yes' or 'no' to the merger proposals, and when the

Prime  Minister resigns and he meets the ordinary people on the road, they  will

greet  him,  "How  are you, Mr Lee?" But if he is trying  to  make  use  of  so

arbitrary a method to carry out his measures, then when he resigns and he is out

of office and he meets the people, the people will heap abuses on him. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 591</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister is a bright student in the study of law. His tactics  of  ruling

are  based  on legal juggling. For example, he tries to equate citizenship  with

nationality  and  says that the Penang and Malacca type of merger  will  deprive

half  of  our population of their citizenship rights under the present  National

Referendum Bill. This all goes to show that the Prime Minister carries  out  his

rule  depending on his legal juggling. Yesterday I told him that he  should  not

use laws to deceive or bully the people and the Opposition. There is one Chinese

saying, "Those who can climb mountains will fall to death and those who can swim

well  will  also be drowned finally." Therefore, I hope that our Prime Minister,

who  is so well versed in law, should not bury his own future with his legal  ingenuity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis contend that in

opposing  clause  29 they are acting in the highest interest of democracy.  They

say it is a fundamental and inalienable human right to say no, and they say this

basic right has been withdrawn by clause 29. Sir, are they as democratic as they

pretend  to be? Only the most gullible political innocents will take the Barisan

Sosialis'  statements at their face value. I want to go into some  details  into

the real nature of the Barisan Sosialis stand on blank votes. To do this I shall

have  to  refer  to the views which the other Communist open front organisations

submitted  to the Select Committee. The organisations in question are the  group

of 40 Old Boys' Associations, a group of

38  trade  unions and a group of the Rural Residents, the Country  People's  and

Hawkers'  Associations. On the question of blank votes, these three bodies  play

much  the  same  tune. It is the same as having three separate orchestras,  each

responding  to  the direction of one maestro. The Select Committee  had  the  ad

vantage  of examining under oath witnesses from the trade unIons and  the  Rural

and Hawkers' Associations.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not on oath.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your

pardon,  not on oath. The Old Boys' Associations displayed a degree of  prudence

not found in the other two groups, and stated that they did not wish to present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 592</b></font><br><br>



themselves  before the Committee. Hence, they escaped the  searching  examination  in Select Committee which brought to light the dishonest motive  behind

the  representations of the other two groups. On 24th April,  1962,  the  Select

Committee  examined representatives of the Rural and Hawkers' Associations,  and

on the 27th of April the trade union representatives gave their evidence. Before

I proceed to give the Assembly an account of the examination of witnesses in the

Select  Committee, I should first outline the common stand of blank votes  which

these  three groups of Communist front organisations took. The objection to  the

blank  votes must be related to two important points which they raised in  their

memoranda to the Select Committee. First, they wanted the referendum to  contain

only  one question with a 'yes' or 'no' answer. This, of course, is in line with

the  Barisan  Sosialis' amendment to clause 5 which was debated and defeated  in

the House last week. Now, the second point is that even with a 'yes' or 'no' one

question  type of referendum, they said that the referendum should be considered

carried  only if a certain minimum percentage of affirmative votes is cast.  The

Rural  and Hawkers' Associations placed this minimum level at sixty per cent  of

the  electorate. I repeat, Sir, sixty per cent of the electorate, and not  sixty

per cent of the total votes cast. This means, in effect, that the votes are dead

men - there are some 8,000 of them on the electoral register. Those who  are  away

from  Singapore  on Polling Day, their votes will be counted as  anti-merger.  I

would  have  thought that that in itself is sufficient to expose  the  nefarious

intentions  of  the  gentlemen  and  to disqualify  them  immediately  from  any

hypocritical statement made on behalf of the democratic system. Now,  the  trade

unions  wanted  a  minimum of 60 per cent affirmative votes of the  total  votes

cast; in other words, they are prepared to forgo the votes of dead men.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Rural Residents and Hawkers' representatives claim in all innocence

that  they want blank votes to mean that those who cast them are neutral in  respect of the proposition put in the referendum. May I quote from column 163





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 593</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Minutes of Evidence and this is what the representatives said [L.A. of

1962];



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If I am clear about the issue, of course, I can express my opinion direct by

voting  on  it  "yes" or "no". But if I am not clear about the  question  posed,

then,  of  course, there should be another way out for me, by letting me  become

neutral in respect of this question before me. What I mean is this. There should

be an opportunity for expression by those who are in favour of certain questions

and those who are against certain questions put to them. There should also be an

opportunity  for the neutrals to express their opinions to show  that  they  are

neutrals in respect of the questions put to them. If the proposed amendment were

to be incorporated and become law, then it means in the world there would not be

neutral countries and the people would he deprived of their opportunities.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will recollect that it was put to these gentlemen that if they

wanted  a minimum of sixty per cent affirmative votes for the referendum  to  be

carried,  then  it  automatically followed that blank votes and  negative  votes

would  be  excluded from this sixty per cent. In other words,  blank  votes  for

practical  purposes are counted as negative votes. To take a simple example,  if

fifty-five  per cent voted yes, the referendum will not be carried and  it  does

not  matter whether the other forty-five per cent all voted no or all cast blank

votes  or  some voted no or some cast blank votes. This proposition was  put  to

them  and  explained by you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as  Chairman  of  the

Select   Committee.  They  were  provided  with  pencils  and  paper;   numerous

arithmetical  examples were set out. There was much cogitation and wrinkling  of

brows  but  in  the end neither the country bumpkins nor the so-called  hawkers'

representatives could grasp this elementary proposition. When  it  came  to  the

turn  of  the trade unions, we witnessed a similar debacle. May I refer  you  to

Questions  Nos. 757 to 761, column 242 of the Minutes of Evidence? I  asked  the

trade union representatives as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They [that is, the trade unions] said just now that the blank votes,

uncertain  votes, are not considered as yes or no, is that true? Do they  affirm

that?'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Mr Tan Teck Wah on behalf of the unions answered yes. I then asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They also said that the blank votes or undecided votes should not be

considered as being in support of the proposition, is that true?'



<br><br>He again said yes. I then asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do they also not say that the blank votes or undecided votes should not be

considered  as opposing the proposition? - Yes. They should not be construed  as

opposing a certain proposition.'



<br><br>Then I asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, in the calculation of the results of the referendum, blank votes

should not be counted together with the "noes", is that right? - (All witnesses)

Yes.'



<br><br>Then I asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, under the 60 per cent affirmative requirement, does it not follow that

blank  votes  and unmarked votes would be considered together with the  negative

votes?-

(Mr Tan Teck Wah) No.'



<br><br>And  so  the Select Committee went into further arithmetic and finally convinced

the  trade unionists in the end that under any requirement of a minimum  percent

age  of  affirmative votes - whether it is 60 per cent or 51 per  cent  or  any

other  percentage - the blank votes count as negative votes, and they agreed  with

this proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Question No. 767 of the Minutes of Evidence you asked, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The neutral votes are out completely? - (All witnesses) Yes.'



<br><br>Now,  towards  the  end of the examination of these witnesses,  the  Member  for

Queenstown  gave  yet another example. He said, suppose out of  100,000  voters,

50,000  voters  said yes, 10,000 voters said no and 40,000 voters abstained,  he

pointed  out  that according to what they agreed, the referendum would  then  be

carried.  Now, the thought of the referendum being successful was too  much  for

the  trade unionists and they immediately went back to their original stand  and

maintained  that  blank votes should be counted with negative votes.  This  drew

upon  them a severe castigation from the Member for Anson and he said at  column

265:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Forgive me, Sir, I must put it with respect; must be quite clear myself. Do

the witnesses appreciate then that they are completely contrary to the logic  of

the  position that they took of the principle that blank votes, undecided votes,

ambiguous votes, should not be counted "aye" and should not be counted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 595</b></font><br><br>



"nay" - they said that. But now with 60 per cent of the total votes cast, it means

that the blank votes, the ambiguous votes, are all "nay".'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am glad that the Member for Nee Soon  has  just  arrived

because yesterday he denied that the Barisan Sosialis had any intention  at  all

of hijacking blank votes in their favour and here with this evidence quoting the

opinion  of the illustrious Member for Anson, that is precisely what the Barisan

Sosialis is attempting to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is a parliamentary-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Call him a weather-cock!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Call you the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know why the Minister for Law excites interjections when he ought not to. This is not the time. We have not got to that

heat  yet. I think the Minister for Finance used quite a parliamentary word when

he said that the Member for Anson is illustrious.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is quite appropriate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, I hope what I said is sinking into the mind of

the  Member  for  Nee  Soon and that he will before long realise  what  utterly

foolish  things he said yesterday. Sir, what conclusion can we draw  from  this?

First,  all this talk about neutrality, the right to abstain, is sheer  eye-wash

and hypocrisy. What the Barisan Sosialis want is to defeat the referendum at all

costs.  They are prepared to go to the extent that blank votes should be counted

as  anti-merger  votes.  So you see that all this pretence  of  defending  human

rights, this appeal to the human conscience and to democratic principles  is  so

much  humbug.  The  real purpose is to frustrate merger and they  will  stop  at

nothing to achieve their ends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second significant point is that they openly envisage the possibility

of  large  numbers  of  people  casting blank  votes,  even  in  a  one-question

referendum with a yes or no answer. The estimate of 40 per cent blank votes  was

decided by the Member for Queenstown. What does all this prove? It proves beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 596</b></font><br><br>



any  shadow of doubt their evil intentions. The Member is not following me in  a

single  sense;  I do not think I want to waste the time of the House  to  assist

people who have been inattentive. Now, in normal elections, blank votes will not

amount  to  .01 per cent. Why then this sudden concern for such a tiny minority?

The  answer, of course, is that the Barisan Sosialis have every intention to jam

the  referendum process by deceiving and confusing the people into casting blank

votes  which  they claim are votes for them. So the Barisan Sosialis  are  quite

happy  to  "hijack", to use their own word, and grab blank votes for  their  own

cause  and  they do so without feeling any moral indignation about the wrongness

of  this.  They  want to deny on moral principles others from  doing  what  they

themselves  wish  to do. So all their objections on grounds of propriety,  moral

principles, democratic procedure, in so far as they are advanced by the  Barisan

Sosialis - the  Government is completely and morally justified in rejecting  their

submissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in the course of the debate, the Barisan Sosialis attempted certain

intellectual  justification of their proposals, but on  the  intellectual  plane

their  case  is  hardly any better. Firstly, they object to  clause  29  on  two

grounds.  They say that this clause denies the citizens the freedom  to  choose.

Secondly,  they  say that the choices to be offered in the referendum  would  be

unacceptable alternatives. Now, Sir, let us examine these two arguments closely.

First  on  the  freedom to choose, they not only complain that  the  freedom  of

choice is seriously restricted, but they go further and say that the fundamental

human  right to say no has been taken away from our citizens. Sir, this  is  the

first  time  that  I have heard that there is in human affairs  any  fundamental

human  right to say no, and I find this constant harping on the right to say  no

both  fallacious in reasoning and dishonest in presentation. From this  repeated

assertion  of  the so-called right to say no, one would think that  the  Barisan

Sosialis are composed of bashful virgins in the act of being seduced and nothing

can be more absurd than this proposition. When they talk of the right to say no,

they mean they want freedom for themselves to prevent merger at any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 597</b></font><br><br>



cost.  Nor  are  they on firmer when they base their argument  more  general

principle of the right to freedom of choice.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have heard political dissertations of freedom of thought, freedom

of  speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the Press. Now, a new  freedom

is  being  conjured up - freedom of choice. Let us examine  what  these  words

mean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of choice in the literature is a concept which originated in the

laissez-faire  economic theories of the Victorian Age.  It  is  in  fact  the

central  dogma of the ideology of capitalism. How strange it is to find the

Member  for  Thomson whose admiration is for a regimented form of society  to

be  in  the company of the great Victorian exponents of free enterprise,  for

free  choice  is at the root of the free enterprise system.  It  means the

freedom  to buy the goods with the money you have, freedom to buy and  choose

without  Government interference - without a Government system  for  rationing.

It  means the freedom to choose your work and not to be allotted your work by

some  central  authority. It also means, for the boss, freedom  to  hire  and

fire  his workers. This is the real meaning of the freedom of choice in  the

literature

of economics.  But  even  in the realm of economic theory  whence  this  concept

arose,  freedom  of choice is limited by certain objective factors.  A  man's

freedom  to choose what he wishes to buy is limited in the first instance  by

the  goods that are available in the market and at second remove by what  his

income is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are all sorts of things in the market in Singapore, Mr

Speaker, Sir, Rolls Royces or Daimlers, and you may say that every Member  of

the  Assembly has the freedom to buy a $40,000 Rolls Royce. But this freedom,

in  fact, does not exist for persons who do not have the income or the wealth

to  make  such  a  purchase. Similarly, freedom to choose an  occupation  is

limited by the number of jobs going and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 598</b></font><br><br>



the  person's ability and qualification. And today even in economic  theory  the

concept  of  the freedom of choice has been relegated to a very secondary  role,

for we no longer have in any part of the established world today the freebooting

free enterprise system that you had in the Victorian era. There are controls, if

not  in detail, certainly in the aggregate which are exercised by any government

of a modern State to ensure that the economy is kept going on an even keel, that

the balance of payments problem does not get out of hand, and that a fairly high

level  of  employment is sustained; but I am not going into this.  My  point  is

this, that freedom of choice is not, therefore, an absolute concept, and when we

discuss  political affairs and borrow this concept from the economists, similar

limitations apply, and these limitations may well apply to a more severe degree,

for  politics  is  essentially the art of what is possible. Freedom  of  choice,

therefore, means freedom to choose from what is possible in any given situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what are the choices possible to the electorate in Singapore at the

present  moment in respect of merger? Let me answer this question. I may  answer

this question more easily by stating what is not possible, it is obvious even to

the meanest intelligence, and I would include the Barisan in this category, that

complete merger on terms superior to those enjoyed by any existing State in  the

Federation is not possible. And if this, in fact, is the choice that the Barisan

wants to present to the electorate in a referendum, then the choice must clearly

be  ruled  out  for  two reasons. First, on the simple ground  that  it  is  not

possible. Second, more to the point, because the Barisan Sosialis knows that  it

is  not  possible and therefore dishonestly asks for it in an effort to  prevent

merger.  There is therefore no breach in the principle of the freedom of  choice

if  the  Barisan's  claim  for super merger is not offered  to  the  electorate.

Indeed,  to  offer something impossible of achievement would be to perpetrate  a

fraud upon the electorate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter for consideration is whether the electorate should be free to

accept  or reject each and every type of merger offered for its choice, and  the

Member  for Anson insists that human decency demands that the electorate  should

have  the  right  to  accept or reject any form of merger offered  to  it  in  a

referendum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be argued that in the 1959 general elections, all Parties put

merger  on  their platform, and therefore when the candidates were elected -in  a

sense  it  can  be  said  that the electorate had made  up  its  mind  and  had

committed:

itself  to  a policy of merger with the Federation. It can therefore  be  argued

that  it  is  not  necessary to sound the electorate on this  particular point

again. Now, for myself I do not find this argument completely convincing, and  I

am  prepared to go a long way with the Member for Anson to understand his  point

of  view.  Now, if this were the only consideration, then I would say that  the

electorate should be given the option once again to decide whether on  not  they

want merger in any of the forms put to it at the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But, Sir, there is a more decisive consideration and it is

this. The Barisan Sosialis are fully committed to complete merger on the  basis

of  equality with any of the States of the Federation. They have said so openly.

They  have committed themselves in writing and in speeches in this Assembly.  It

is  only when they found out the real consequence of such a type of merger  that

they  tried  to, back out of this commitment, and then added further conditions

such as automatic conversion, immediate general elections in the Federation  and

in Singapore after merger, and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say that if the Barisan Sosialis are really honest in their desire for

more  merger than the P.A.P., then I say the citizens should be given the right

to  opt  out  of  merger if they so want. I go further and say  if  the  Barisan

Sosialis will campaign honestly and vigorously for complete merger on an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 600</b></font><br><br>



equal  basis  with  any of the 11 States of the Federation, then  I  admit,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that this clause on blank votes is unnecessary. And  I  will  go

further  and say that the electorate should then have a choice to say  "yes"  or

"no"  to  any  merger  proposal - any form of merger  proposals - submitted  in  the

referendum,  In  these  circumstances then, if we all  agree  we  shall  have  a

completely honest referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the referendum where many Parties participate, to have an honest

referendum  means  having  honesty  observed  in  respect  of  each  and   every

participant. When one of the Parties is dishonest, then you no longer  can  have

an  honest  referendum. When the Barisan Sosialis say they want complete  merger

and,  on  the  other hand, their ground level propaganda incites and  encourages

people  to oppose merger in any shape or form, then I say you will not  have  an

honest referendum, and the dishonesty lies fairly and squarely with the Barisan

Sosialis. How can they, on the one hand, pretend to want complete merger?  True,

they  have added this rider of automatic conversion, this, that and the other,

but  we  will regard this as dishonest appendages to the original and, real  and

genuine proposal. How can they claim to be honest? How can they expect an honest

referendum to be carried out when they themselves behave in such an outrageously

dishonest  manner? And we say it is precisely because the Barisan Sosialis  have

no  intention  to  honour their word that the special precautions  embodied  in

clause  29  are  necessary, but if the Banisan Sosialis are prepared  to  honour

their  word and campaign genuinely and honestly to get people to accept complete

merger on terms of complete, absolute, unconditional equality with any of the 11

States, then I say we can have second thoughts on this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Before the tea-break,

I  drew  the  attention of the Deputy Speaker to the fact that the Minister  for

Home  Affairs  was  reading  his speech from a prepared  document.  It  was  not

intended in any way to embarrass the Deputy Speaker who fielded it, if I may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 601</b></font><br><br>



say  with  respect,  rather well. But it was intended  to  highlight  certain

facts  which  are also pertinent to the speech of the Minister  for  Finance,

and  it is this, that these prepared speeches are not really intended for our

education  or  edification;  that  they proceed,  before  they  are  in  fact

delivered  here, to the Ministry of Culture, and the purpose of reading  them

here  is to obtain the Legislative Assembly's immunity seal so that they  can

be  issued by the Ministry of Culture to all the Press with full immunity.  I

understand that instructions have been issued that the Press are to  give  70

per  cent of all political space for the Government and not more thin 30 per

cent  for the Opposition. Apart from this, Sir, it will interest you to  know

that  the  Chinese  Press is treated to a special delicacy  in  the  form  of

statements  issued by the P.A.P. in respect of matters which they might  have

forgotten here or are too absurd for us even to entertain - issued by the

P.A.P.     Propaganda Bureau, and the poor Chinese Press  is  to  carry  all

this nonsense every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we consider clause 28 and clause 29, we must consider them in

the  context  of two basic facts. One is clause 21, Sir, which  provides  for

compulsory  voting and punishes a man who does not vote by  taking  his  name

off the

electoral  register  and leaving his name off the electoral  register  until  at

least to the next revision. That is a heavy punishment. Sir.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second basic fact is the rejection by the Government of my amendment

to  clause  20.  It is very brief, Sir, If I might refer you to  it - 'and  the

voter  shall record his vote in respect of each question by marking  a  cross

in  one  of  two squares against each question marked respectively "Yes"  and

"No".'.  Now  Sir, if there was no compulsory voting or - and I  do  not  say

'and',  I  say  'or' -  if  there was provision that each  question  could  be

answered  with a yes or no, the Government would not have sought  to  dredge

the depths of infamy to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 602</b></font><br><br>



produce  a clause which blatantly makes a man into a woman - because that is  what

this  clause  seeks  to do - it would not be necessary. Blank votes  are  normally

minimal.  Sir, I have drawn the attention of the House earlier and I  will  show

you - I  shall not read the provisions, but I shall merely refer to the  countries

where there have been referenda held and where it has always been the rule  that

blank  votes and ambiguous ballot papers are void. They do not count. Sir, first

and  foremost, I have read the Hansard of last night and I understand  that  the

West Samoa ballot paper was read to you which provided that these should be what

they  call  informal  votes, as we say, void. Jamaica,  West  Australia,  South

Australia  and  New  South Wales where they have ad hoc legislation.  Australian

Referendum Act. New Zealand - by the way, Sir. Samoa had its referendum provisions

under  the New Zealand Order in Council. British Columbia, Newfoundland, Canada,

Switzerland, France and, Sir, this will interest you. An infamous individual who

fought  an  election  on  the  basis that he was saving  the  country  from  the

Communists.  Hitler's  1932  Referendum Act.  Even  Hitler  accepted  the  basic

fundamental  issue  that  a  referendum, as has been repeatedly  stated  by  the

Government Benches, is a way to ascertain the wishes of the people. And if it is

blank, it is void. If it is ambiguous, it is void. Last but not least, Sir,  may

I  refer  you to section 48 (1) of our Legislative Assembly Elections  Ordinance

which was promulgated by an imperial Government through its colonial masters  in

1954? Sir, section 48 (1) refers to the void ballot papers and the amendment  of

the  Member  for  Queenstown seeks to restore to clause 28 the provisions  which

have  been  deleted  from it. It is a curious thing to recognise  that  our  own

people, our own citizens, our own elected Government can be more dishonest,  can

be  more  unjust  than the imperial government. But, Sir, the injustice  of  the

imperial government is never shown in direct dishonesty. The P.A.P. have reached

a stage where it no longer matters if the people are fully conscious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 603</b></font><br><br>



of  their basic, their radical and their absolute dishonesty. I ask you to  look

at  section  48 (1) (c) and compare it with the amendment we have. Sir,  in  the

Elections Ordinance the following is a void paper "on which anything is  written

or  marked by which the voter can be identified except the printed number on the

back", if  you look at clause 28 (1) (b) of the Referendum Bill, "on which  the

voter has indicated his vote and has written or marked anything by which he  can

be  identified". Sir, why that additional element? You will appreciate now  that

if  the  voter  has  written anything or marked anything  by  which  he  can  be

identified, that vote will count as a P.A.P. vote. I do urge Members, I do plead

because  I  do not think this has really been brought out. The Government  has

not  shown  why  it has changed. Section 48 (1) (c) of the Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance in this manner as it reads now in clause 28 (1) (b)  of  the

Referendum Bill, and it means this, Sir. That if a man writes on a voting paper,

"I believe in the P.A.P." and signs his name, that will count as a P.A.P. voting

paper and no doubt, in due course, he will receive his reward because he has not

marked the vote. "I believe in the P.A.P. I am a P.A.P. member. My P.A.P. number

is  such and such." There is nothing to prevent those people from doing it. I do

ask the Government, since they have made this radical change, why have they made

no explanation of this change at all? Mr Speaker, I do ask your Indulgence that

if  the  Member  opposite wants to mumble and grumble, could he do  it  outside

because it is disturbing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> How stupid.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is also the business of the Chair. I think the Hon.

the Minister for Law should contain himself. He has an opportunity of answering.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why this additional element so that a person who has written or

marked  anything by which he can be identified can still have his vote in favour

of the P.A.P.? I mean, supposing somebody writes, "I do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 604</b></font><br><br>

like  the P.A.P. I do not like any of these proposals." All this will count  for

the  P.A.P. because  he has not marked his vote. Before that  document  can  be

voided,  he  must  first mark his vote and then put some  means  whereby  he  is

identified.  The  two  are  not the same, Sir, but that  is  the  least.  It  is

nevertheless the point which no other Member seems to have noticed and which the

Government has completely glossed over today. Sir, the other paragraphs (c), (d)

and  (e)  of  section 48 (1) are the identical provisions which the  Member  for

Queenstown seeks to reintroduce into clause 28 (1) of the Referendum Bill.  That

is  to say, he wants to make void all ballot papers which are unmarked and which

are  void  for uncertainty. The Government tell you, and tell you quite rightly,

that  in  the original Bill as introduced in November, the provisions of section

48  (1)  (c) and (d) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  were,  in

fact, incorporated in clause 28 of the Referendum Bill and ballot papers were to

be  void if they had written or marked on them anything by which a man could  be

identified, or if they were blank, or if they were ambiguous. The mystery of the

change  in  the first one has not been explained. But as regards the  other  two

they suddenly awakened to the danger of the Communists mounting a campaign.  And

what  awakened them to the danger was that there was an amendment moved to  give

the  people the right to deface and destroy their ballot papers. Therefore, when

these amendments were moved by the Barisan - no, the phrase is "pro-Communists  in

the Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson" - The P.A.P. were suddenly awakened

to  the  fact that there would be a campaign mounted to tell the people to  cast

blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have asked for - and I trust you have it before you - Supplement No. 11 of the Legislative Assembly of the Third Session, and you will notice

that  the so-called arch-Communist who introduced the provision, whereby persons

need not be punished for defacing their ballot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 605</b></font><br><br>



papers  or for destroying their individual ballot papers, is none other  than

myself.  I am the person, and I would ask you to look at clause 31,  at  page

110  of  Supplement No. 11. You will notice that no other person was at  that

stage  associated with me in that amendment. It was sent in by me. The Member

for  Queenstown  had sent in several amendments. He did not notice  my  amendment  and it stood in my name alone. I seem to be the arch-Communist who  had

awakened  them  to a Communist plot. Let me first explain why  I  did  it.  I

would  not like to take special credit, Sir - and certainly not the Barisan  at

that  stage - but  most of us by then were conscious from the speeches  of  the

Government (the way it inflated and distorted the Barisan's stand  about  the

constituent  state), we were conscious that it was going to try and  use  the

Barisan's  stand as an alternative. And although I had not worked it  out  at

that  stage exactly how it would happen, nevertheless, it occurred to me that

some  voter, in accordance with his conscience, might want to say nothing  or

just  deface his ballot paper. And there was nothing more Machiavellian  than

that,  that a man should be entitled to deface his paper if he was offered  a

dishonest  alternative. I will say to you frankly, Sir, that in one  election

I

wrote  across  my  ballot paper, "I do not like my choice." I  cannot  see  that

could, or should, call for criminal penalties of the nature indicated.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely I was exercising a legitimate right to express my regret and

frustration  that  the  choice offered to me of  candidates  was  not  of  a

character  which  pleased me and that I was not going to vote  for  anybody.

That  was  the  arch-Communist scheme to mount a  campaign  to  confuse  the

people  into  casting blank votes. And I want to say this to you,  Sir.  The

arch-Communists  must  be  awfully stupid - I am  happy  to  note,  remarkably

stupid - to concentrate on the question of casting blank votes, because  if  a

hundred people go to vote,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 606</b></font><br><br>



ten  say 'P.A.P.'. three say 'Penang and Malacca', and 87 cast blank votes,  you

do appreciate, Mr Speaker, that the ten who voted for the P.A.P. proposals will

be  deemed to be the majority. There is no question about that. How stupid it is

to  mount a campaign that persons should cast blank votes, when the blank  votes

do  not  count,  even though there is a moral indication of defeat  of  the  two

propositions.  From  that point of view, they have some significance,  but  they

have  no legal significance, because the majority vote is, by virtue of the fact

that  ten  out  of  that hundred voted for the P.A.P. proposals,  therefore  the

P.A.P. proposals are accepted ten to three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole crux of any effort under this referendum is to give the people

the  right  to say yes or no. But why then is this Government seeking to  dredge

from  the  depths  of  infamy  this extraordinary  constitutional  but  infamous

approach of, "We by law declare that a man is a woman. "You can, Sir - legally

and  constitutionally, and completely inhumanly. You bring the law, the  process

of  making laws, and the process by which the law-makers are elected,  all  into

contempt. The merger proposals, that is to say, Command Paper No. 33  of  1961,

according  to the Government Benches, have been debated ad nauseam, and  I  will

agree at least to the extent that they have been fully debated in this Assembly.

And  there  has been a vote of 33 to 18 walking out. If persons are so  confused

that  they want to say to the Legislative Assembly, "We want you to make up  our

minds  for  us,"  Mr Speaker, is it not their duty to mark yes against  Command

Paper No. 33 of 1961? "We want the Legislative Assembly to make up its mind  for

us." Well, it has made up its mind. The Legislative Assembly by 33 to 18 walking

out has decided that Command Paper No. 33 of 1961 is good. Therefore, those who

want  the Legislative Assembly to guide them, according to the Minister for Home

Affairs, who, very patronisingly, said, "Of course, those people would be  quite

right in seeking our guidance." But the guidance is already there. Why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 607</b></font><br><br>



do they not say yes? What other guidance? For a change, silence is eloquence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would

suggest  to  the  Member  for Anson that when he asks a rhetorical  question  he

invites interjections. If interjections are forthcoming, then of course disorder

results eventually.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, it is a

rhetorical question, if you will, but it is a question which none of  them  will

seek  to  answer. It is a question that goes to the root of all the  smokescreen

and  hypocrisy about wanting to make provision for the poor confused  voter  who

does  not  know how to vote and wants the Legislative Assembly to  help  him.  I

repeat,  if he wants to follow what the Legislative Assembly wants, why does  he

not  vote  for  the P.A.P. proposals? He does not vote for the P.A.P. proposals

because he does not want them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why does the Government want to introduce this question of blank votes?

Because  it  has recognised that if it leaves it at one question, which  is  the

only  question passed by this Assembly, then you cannot say that the people have

had an alternative, or have had the right to reject. You have got to leave it to

yes or no, and there is a chance that the merger proposals would be rejected. So

what are they to do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have mounted this dishonest campaign of distortion about Penang and

Malacca, constituent States, being in accordance with constitutional provisions.

If  Singapore  came in on the same terms, Singapore citizens, or half  of  them,

would  not obtain citizenship. They then fixed it on the Barisan Sosialis.  Sir,

they claim the right not only to have their own dictionary of English words, but

to create a dictionary for the Opposition. The Opposition, in the Hansard on the

21st  of  November,  1961, at column 406, made clear their stand  by  moving  an

amendment  to  say  that we want to go in as a constituent State  with  complete

merger and with Federal citizenship to all Singapore citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 608</b></font><br><br>



That  was our understanding of complete merger as a State. Mr Speaker, I should

imagine  that  even the distorted mentality of the P.A.P. understood  their  own

phrase, "struggle for independence through merger" in the same light. And it  is

interesting  to  notice that in their "The Tasks Ahead" there  is  nothing  said

about  merger but just their original constitution where they will struggle  for

independence through merger with the Federation. Sir, did they not at that  time

conceive merger in the same way that we on this side, and I gather all of us  on

this  side, did, because the S.P.A. has actually stated what its view on  merger

is?  Was  it  not the view of the P.A.P. that complete merger means identity  of

citizenship? That is what we all understood. But no. They would have it that the

Barisan  Sosialis  meant  that it was going to deprive  the  people  of  341,000

citizens. That is what the Barisan Sosialis wanted. Therefore, they are going to

put the Barisan Sosialis proposal. Why this tenderness for the Barisan Sosialis,

Mr Speaker? Why this solicitude for the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker? Why this

sudden kindness to the Barisan Sosialis when they have repeatedly said that they

are  not a philanthropic organization, that the Barisan Sosialis are a Communist

front  organization,  and  they  are not going to  help  the  Barisan  Sosialis?

Because, Mr Speaker, it is necessary to have some excuse to have an alternative

question which would not be acceptable. That is the smoke-screen. And then  they

will  say to the people, "Well, we have given you a chance to reject the  P.A.P.

proposals, you can accept the other one." And then they realise that there  will

be a lot who may want neither. It is true that blank votes have no legal effect,

Sir.  But  can you not see the moral implications of a majority of  blank  votes

cast at this referendum? So my amendment about defaced ballot papers has nothing

to  do  with it, my amendment which they stuck on the poor Barisan Sosialis  who

have to carry my sins as well as their own. That has nothing to do with it, Sir.

It  is  the recognition that giving two alternatives would then force the people

into the position where their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 609</b></font><br><br>



conscience did not permit them to accept either, to cast blank votes, and if the

total  of  the  blank votes counted indicated that there was a majority  of  the

people who cast blank votes, it would be obvious that the majority of the people

did  not  want  the  merger proposals. So we had in March the amendment  of  the

Government to introduce the provision which, according to their own Minister for

Finance, is based on neither constitutional nor legal principles.



Sir,  the  Minister  for Home Affairs spoke touchingly about  inducing  innocent

people  to  cast blank votes and to wreck the referendum. Because the Opposition

asks for the right to say no, we have the curious spectacle of a Minister of  an

allegedly  democratic  Government, the Minister for  Finance,  saying  that  the

concept  of freedom of choice is not basic to democracy. No. We understand  more

and more how these Fascists in thought and in their way of life have camouflaged

themselves and utilised the democratic process to get into government.  Because.

Sir,  the  concept of freedom of choice is basic and is the very cornerstone  of

democracy - the  right  to choose a candidate or not to  vote  for  any  of  the

candidates on a list, and in a referendum, as has been repeatedly said  to  you;

the  right to accept or reject any proposal. To say that the concept of  freedom

of choice is one that has no place in human society is for the P.A.P. to condemn

themselves  publicly  as  essentially  a Fascist,  a  dictatorial  organization,

whether Fascist or Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is it that they fear in the right to say no? (And the right to say

no  implies the right to say yes.) They talk about "confusing the citizens";  if

in fact the Barisan Sosialis are capable of confusing the citizens to the extent

of  getting all of them, or the vast majority, against the merger proposals, Mr

Speaker, democratically they are entitled to benefit by that in the same way  as

the  P.A.P. when it came to office. The reason why a man casts his vote  is  not

for this Assembly. This Assembly gives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 610</b></font><br><br>



him a choice. We know there are people who do not understand the choice. We know

there  are  people who half understand the choice. We know there  are  some  who

fully  understand  the choice. We know that in accordance  with  the  democratic

principle,  on  balance, this is a healthy procedure and usually the  answer  is

normally  right, in the same way as you have juries, which the  Front  Bench  so

hates, in respect of grave offences, Sir. There may be some jurors who really do

not  understand  the  issue, but, on balance, it has been found  that  the  jury

system  is a wonderful protection for the rights of the individual. In the  same

way, the democratic principle whereby a man, no matter how stupid, no matter how

confused, and no matter how humble, has the same right to say yes or no  as  the

arrogant Prime Minister himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has asked, why does the Barisan Sosialis

not  want us to ask the citizens of Singapore to vote for their form of  merger?

But  surely the answer, Sir, is because they will not do it. Because the  P.A.P.

Government will not put that alternative. Immediately following the Minister for

Home Affairs, the Minister for Finance stood up and told you that if the Barisan

Sosialis  insisted on putting their own interpretation of their  requirement  to

the  voters, that would be dishonest. Because they know that they cannot get it.

They  know  they cannot get merger with the Federation with Federal  citizenship

for  all  Singapore citizens. Therefore, they are dishonest in putting it.  Sir,

the position is this. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Obviously right.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister

for Law is getting very disorderly. If he wishes to rise on a point of order  or

elucidation, he should do so.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. put as one of their principal grounds in

their Constitution that they would struggle for merdeka through merger. Sir, did

they think they could get merdeka or merger at that stage?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 611</b></font><br><br>



But it seems that on the interpretation of the Minister for Finance, you ask for

something which you know temporarily you cannot get is dishonest. We have got to

have  it and we have got to have it now. Anything that you seek which you cannot

get  now  is dishonest. So, were the P.A.P., on that definition, Sir,  dishonest

during election time in saying we will fight for merdeka? They were dishonest in

1954  and 1955 when they said they would struggle for independence because  they

knew  they  could  not get it. They were dishonest, as they allege  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  dishonest,  in  saying that the basic  minimum  for  the  healthy

development  of  Singapore is that there should be a common citizenship  of  the

people  of  Singapore and the people of the Federation both for our welfare  and

for the common welfare. Maybe we cannot get it today. If we cannot get it today,

we  will  wait until we get it. That, according to the Minister for Finance,  is

dishonest. That according to the Minister for Home Affairs is dishonest, as  the

Barisan  Sosialis  do  not want it put. Sir, it is true  that  the  two  written

speeches will find their way into the Press and into Radio P.A.P. What  we  have

to  say in reply will not. It is true that their votes, with the support of  the

Front  Bench of the Opposition, will carry this most dishonest measure that  has

ever  seen the light of day in this country, to my knowledge. It is unhappy  but

true,  but  I  say,  Sir, that we who seek to battle for  recognition  of  basic

decency  should not, therefore, keep quiet. I ask you to notice that this  legal

rigging  has drawn the courteous but passionate denunciation of the intellectual

youth  of  Singapore. You know, Sir, apart from the circular  we  all  received,

there have been statements issued in the name of the University Law Society, the

Singapore  University,  and  you yourself are aware of  the  passionate  unhappy

denunciation  by  another group of intellectual youth,  the  Nanyang  University

Graduates  Guild,  the  Nanyang  University  Students'  Union,  the  Polytechnic

Political  Society,  the Singapore University Socialist Club,  and  the  Nanyang

University Political Science Society. I am not going to read passages from them,

Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 612</b></font><br><br>



They  do  express acute unhappiness at the dangers to respect for the democratic

process  of our people, if perfidy of a character so blatant, of which all  must

be conscious, is permitted to be perpetrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told by the Minister for Finance of an extraordinarily large

number of Communist front organisations, although I gathered from the Government

that there were allegedly 300 Communists in Singapore. But he tells us that  the 40  Old  Boys' Associations are all Communist front organisations, the 38  trade

unions are all Communist front organisations, the Country People, whom he  calls

country  bumpkins, and I hope that for a change the Press, which is so  kind  to

the  P.A.P.,  will carry at least that part of his message and his contempt  for

the  country  people. The country bumpkins, according to him, and  the  Hawkers'

Association  are all Communist front organisations. You know, Sir, these  people

whom  he  contemptuously refers to as country bumpkins today were the people  he

assiduously cultivated not so long ago in order to be elected. He tells us that

they  are  all  Communist front organisations, and that they have  asked  for  a

nefarious  60  per  cent majority in order to render valid  a  decision  of  the

people.  You  know,  Mr Speaker, and in fairness he was quite  fair  there,  he

indicated that I was against that provision, and very strongly against it - to  me

it  is  illogical - but  the  fact that these organisations,  to  our  mind,  want

something  illogical does not make what he is doing logical. Two wrongs  do  not

make a right, Sir. Because the Communists, assuming they are Communists, do  not

like  clause 28, it does not mean it is good. I have no doubt the Communists  do

not  like  to drink poison. The fact that they do not like poison does not  make

poison good. We must be careful, Sir, because this is a specious piece of  logic

to  which people can fall prey. Because we do not like the Communists, therefore

anything the Communists want is wrong. Therefore, everything that the Communists

do not want is right. That sort of logic, Sir, would land us in an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 613</b></font><br><br>



awful mess. I have no doubt whatsoever that there can be occasions when what the

Communists do not want, I do not want either, as an honest democrat;  and  there

can  be occasions when what they want I want too, but for different reasons,  as

an  honest democrat. In this case, Sir, the only excuse the Minister for Finance

has to justify what he himself admits is a clause based on neither legal nor con

stitutional principles is the fact that the Communists do not like it; therefore

it  must be good. Sir, he said if the Barisan Sosialis would fight for a  merger

in accordance with the constituent States of the Federation, then he would agree

that  everybody would have the right to say 'yes' or 'no', and that there should

not be this nefarious clause. Is it not fair to ask the Minister for

Finance:   Are we running this country for the Barisan Sosialis? If we are,  why

do  we  not  hand  it  over to them? If we are not, why then  not  approach  the

referendum  on the basis that you agree is just. I cannot see how it can  matter

whether the Barisan Sosialis are or are not in favour of merger on the basis  of

a  constituent State. The trouble about a constituent State, Sir,  is  that  the

P.A.P. themselves have so sullied and distorted it that, though it may  at  one

time have been acceptable, by virtue of the interpretation which the P.A.P. have

put,  it  is  one  which  they know nobody now can accept.  But  what  I  cannot

understand  from  the Minister is what kind of assurance he  wants  which  would

enable us to have an honest referendum. He says, and says truly, where one party

to  a referendum is dishonest, you cannot have an honest referendum. Sir, I  say

truly,  with  this  modification, where a party to a referendum,  which  is  the

Government Party, is dishonest, you cannot have an honest referendum. Because it

is the Government's dishonesty which permeates and controls the entire machinery

of  this  referendum.  The  way the question is put,  the  way  the  people  are

compelled to answer it, and even the shameless way whereby the true results

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>

are  hidden, whereby the people are not allowed to know what is the  number  of

blank  votes, what is the number of ambiguous votes. It is the Government  which

is seeking flexibility for dishonest maneuvre and seeking a specious excuse that

the  Barisan Sosialis might confuse the people. No, Sir, it is not the  Barisan;

it  is not the Member for Anson; it is none of us who are seeking to confuse the

people.  If we could have an impartial commission - and it is my prayer  that  in

the  not  too distant future, when matters are still topical, there will  be  an

impartial commission to recognise dishonesty in high places and to punish  it - I

say  if there was an impartial commission, it would be clearly seen that  it  is

the  P.A.P. that have been acting dishonestly in the distortion which they  have

put  forward,  that  the P.A.P. are ruthlessly intent on forcing  through  their

proposals  irrespective  of  what the people of Singapore  want.  They  are  not

interested. They prefer that the people of Singapore should want it, but if  the

people of Singapore do not want it, "Well, we are in power and we are jolly well

going to see it through."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no words are adequate to express the deep revulsion at this public

exhibition of treacherous perfidy by trusted people. I have sought to expose the

blatant falsehoods of some of the specious arguments urged which will find their

way  into the newspapers, not because I have any hope that any argument, however

valid, would have any effect upon this Government, or, unfortunately, any effect

on  the Front Benches of the Opposition. They have made up their minds. I  stand

as  one who has seen the tragedy that is approaching. I refer to the tragedy  of

concretization of perfidy in the referendum, because I want to leave  apart  the

merger issue for the moment - its merits and demerits - and deal with the perfidy of

the  referendum. It is a tragedy, Sir, that 624,000 people, the majority of whom

are  new citizens for whose minds and for whose hearts we have struggled, and  I

have  been  part  of  that  struggle,  in sincerity,  through  dreary  Committee

meetings, through mass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 615</b></font><br><br>

rallies, through corner street talks, through house-to-house visits. For 7 years

and more, Sir, we have struggled to awaken in them a recognition of the glory of

the   parliamentary  democratic  process  and  its  validity  for  the   healthy

development  of the human individual. That they should now be able to  point  to

this  as the culmination of that glory is a tragedy which unfortunately it  will

be our successors who will reap.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>     [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, the Members in the Opposition have advanced

their  arguments clearly on the National Referendum Bill. We are of the  opinion

that there should be only one question posed so that the people can decide.  But

from  what  has happened, we can see that the Government is bent on  posing  two

unacceptable  questions to the people and thereby the Government hope  that  the

people may not have any choice to cast blank votes or abstain. The P.A.P. Government now want to provide that such votes be deemed to be votes in support of the

Government. Mr Mammen, Sir, the purpose of our amending this provision is to

expose  the  P.A.P's  dictatorship. The P.A.P.'s phoney parliamentary  democracy

will  be  a  laughing  stock of the world. In all the countries  in  the  world,

wherever  there is a national referendum Ordinance there has never been  such  a

provision. Even arch dictator Hitler never provided such a provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, that the electors would cast blank votes or uncertain votes

means  that there must be various reasons. For instance, they may have no choice

at  all.  Perhaps they may not understand the questions posed. Perhaps they  may

not want to express their views. So those blank votes and uncertain votes, as  a

result, should in no circumstances be construed as votes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 616</b></font><br><br>



in  support  of the Government's proposition. The P.A.P. have exposed themselves

very  clearly as regards their intention. They have used the Communist bogey  as

their pretext and, at the same time, they are trying to suppress the people. The

oligarchy  of the P.A.P. has made use of the propaganda machinery, such  as  the

radio  and so on. The oligarchy of the P.A.P. has raised the bogey of Communists

saying that they want to wreck the national referendum and induce the people  to

cast blank votes and uncertain votes. In fact, Mr Mammen, are the Communists so

strong that they wield so much influence over the people? According to the Prime

Minister,  there are only 300 Communist cadres in Singapore. At  the  South-East

Asia Correspondents' meeting the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said that the

Communists in South-East Asia have never been so isolated in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in view of the assertion made by the Prime Minister that the

Communists  are  so  very  isolated and that there are very  few  Communists  in

Singapore,  how  can  the P.A.P. justify their argument that  the  provision  is

introduced because the Communists are inciting the people to cast blank votes in

order to wreck the national referendum? What is the true picture? The

P.A.P., has raised this bogey of Communists in order to pass this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the P.A.P. oligarchy should

express  their thanks to the Communists because they hope to save themselves  by

raising  the Communist bogey as a pretext. We know that people in all  walks  of

life  have expressed their dissatisfaction with this Bill, but the P.A.P. still

have  the  temerity  to  use the Communist threat as  an  excuse  for  the  most

undemocratic  provision in the world. If the provision is passed as  it  stands,

then  the  people will have no right to express their free views and make  their

choice   at   the   national  referendum.  The  result  of   such   a   national

referendum - irrespective of what the result will be and how the P.A.P. may  claim

to have the support of the people - cannot represent the true views of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. The Member has finished his speech. It seems that there are no other

speakers on this very important clause.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Sir, on

a point of order. I wonder whether there is a quorum here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not present, Members summoned as if

for  a division pursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting resumed upon a  quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b>

Mr  Mammen, Sir, first let me explain to the House why and how this clause  has

to  be introduced. Members of this House will notice that the original Bill  did

not  have  this clause. It was only put in after the Communists gave us indirect

notice  of their evil intentions. First, you will remember the Member for  Anson

gave  notice  of  an  amendment to make it lawful to destroy  or  deface  ballot

papers. Now, nowhere in the world is there a precedent for this. The Member  for

Anson  is fond of quoting precedents. Just now he quoted a lot of precedents  in

respect of the law on referendum. Can he quote us an instance where it is lawful

to  deface  or  destroy ballot papers? Is this the kind of  democracy  that  the

Member  for  Anson and the Barisan Sosialis want? The Communists and  those  who

oppose merger know that they are in a fix.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You are in a fix.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> They have no way

out.  Therefore, they want to destroy or deface the ballot papers or  to  induce

the people to cast blank votes. In other words, they want to frustrate the democratic  process and frustrate the referendum. We are indeed thankful to them  for

giving  us  notice of their evil intentions. So the issue is this. Do  we  allow

them  to defeat the democratic process by defacing and destroying ballot  papers

and  casting  blank votes? Therefore, it falls upon us, that is, the Government,

to  make  suitable amendments in order to make it worth their while to  try  and

frustrate the democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 618</b></font><br><br>



process.  This  is very simple. That is why and how this new clause  has  to  be

introduced. If they had not tried to frustrate the democratic process,  we  also

would not have done this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Barisan Sosialis themselves want these blank votes

in their favour. That is, they want us to treat these blank votes as against the

White  Paper proposals. It has been said time and again by the Barisan  Sosialis

that  they  regard  this  amendment as an attempt at vote  pinching - deplorable,

disgraceful  and  several  other adjectives. They think  it  is  wrong  for  the

Government  to  regard  undecided votes as being in favour  of  the  proposition

accepted by this Assembly. But this does not prevent them from claiming that the

blank votes should he regarded as opposing the Assembly decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, during the Select Committee hearing of witnesses, we put this

question to the 38 trade union representatives: If you require the referendum to

be  supported  by  a certain percentage of affirmative votes  cast,  it  follows

automatically  that  blank votes and uncertain votes  are  counted  as  negative

votes. So, although the Barisan Sosialis say that it is wrong for the Government

to  treat these votes as supporting the Assembly decision, it is honourable  for

the  Barisan  Sosialis Opposition to engage in vote hijacking. That  is  in  the

words of the Barisan Sosialis leader, the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, let me first debunk once again this so-called mandate which the P.A.P. was supposed to have received from the people.

They  keep  on repeating it. And we have already debunked it on many  occasions.

But  it bears repeating. They were never given a mandate specifically on merger,

because  during  the general elections every Party had merger on  its  platform.

Amongst  the Parties that were strongest for merger was the S.P.A. In fact,  the

S.P.A. had, as its slogan, "If you want merger, vote S.P.A.". The fact that  the

S.P.A. was  so overwhelmingly defeated showed that when the people elected  the

P.A.P. to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 619</b></font><br><br>

power,  merger was not in their minds. In fact, as has already been pointed  out

by  the Member for Anson, and also pointed out by me during the merger debate in

November  1961,  merger had never been the target of the  P.A.P.  It  was  never

mentioned  in the bible of the P.A.P. - "The Five-Year Plan." If you  run  through

it,  Sir,  you  will not find a word of merger. Merger was only mentioned  as  a

distant possibility. Even in the policy statement of the first year - to an equal

and   just   society - and  that  of  the  second  year - the  year   of   so-called

construction - no  mention was ever made of merger. The P.A.P. has  publicised  so

much  about Malaysia. But Malaysia was never even mentioned, Sir, in any of  the

declarations of the

P.A.P.   I do not think I need go into

greater  detail. But if they want to talk of the mode and manner, let us  remind

them that if they had really wanted to consult the people on the mode and manner

of  merger, then the proper consultation should have been done before  the  fair

accompli  was  foisted  on the people. That is, before the  White  Paper  merger

proposals  were agreed to between the two Governments. If I may bring your  mind

back,  Sir;  at that time, there was a split in the Party. We had  asked  for  a

voice  in  the mode and manner of merger. It was because of that that there  was

this  split.  Immediately after the split, and because the merger proposals  and

the  merger  question  were  coming up to the forefront,  we  suggested  to  the

Government that since it would be proper to get the views of the people on  this

most important question, a general election would have been the most suitable in

order  that the people of Singapore might elect a government more representative

of  their views. Following that, if you will remember, Sir, after the Government

had  refused  to accept our suggestion, we asked for an All-Party Conference  in

order  that we might have a voice in deciding on the mode and manner of  merger.

And see now what choice is being offered to the people! It is not a case of mode

and manner choice. It is something already fixed; something which says, "Take it

or leave it." That is what is happening.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many examples have been quoted to you about marriage. When you talk of

marriage in principle, you must remember that you just do not marry any old girl

who  comes  along or marry any old man you happen to meet. There is  always  the

matter  of  finding the suitable partner, the proper timing and  place  for  all

this. Similarly, to use another analogy, if you are asked to cook food, it  does

not  mean that you are going to take arsenic or caustic soda served up  to  you.

However, I will not labour on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to answer a couple of questions raised by the Minister for

Health  and Law and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance  came  up

with  his  prepared  statement  and admitted that  clause  29  could  have  been

unnecessary.  He  tried to justify the dishonesty of the P.A.P. in  putting  in

clause  29  by linking it with the one-question amendment and the  51  per  cent

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has already drawn your attention to the fact that there

is  compulsory  voting  and the fact that the P.A.P. has  already  rejected  our

amendment of one question to be posed to the people - the question that requires a

simple  answer  of "yes" or "no". The Minister for Finance very  rightly  linked

this  up with this question, because if it was only one question that was  going

to  be  posed to the people, then this blank paper clause would not have arisen.

It  is  only  when  there  are two questions and when these  two  questions  are

unacceptable  that  this blank clause comes in. We can see from  this  the  plot

which  is  in the minds of the Ministers. They want to grab votes which  do  not

rightly belong to them. As I have repeatedly told you, their plot is to pose two

questions,  both  unacceptable,  and with the expected  reaction  of  the  voter

putting  in  a  blank vote, they want to grab this blank vote and  call  it  the

P.A.P. vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Minister for Finance tries to justify this blank vote clause by saying

that since the Opposition have claimed blank votes as negative votes, therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 621</b></font><br><br>



the  Government have every justification to claim these blank  votes  as  so-called  positive votes. Sir, let us say very categorically that  blank  votes

do  not mean positive or negative votes. They just mean non-supporting votes.

They  do not support the propositions "a", "b" or "c" that may be put  before

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of the P.A.P. is that since there is this provision of 51 per

cent,  therefore,  all the blank votes would work out to be  negative  votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 51 per cent provision is a principle by itself. I will go into detail

on this 51 per  cent provision when we come to the debate on the amendment of  the  51

per  cent.  But to counter this argument of negative votes, let us take  them

on,  for the sake of argument, that blank votes are negative votes. They  say

that  just because these blank votes are not supporting the Government votes,

therefore, they are negative votes. We have always maintained that  they  are

non-supporting  votes. If the P.A.P. calls these blank votes  negative  votes

to  the White Paper, say, for example, proposition "a", similarly, they  can

be

called negative votes to propositions "b", "c" or "d".



<br><br>8.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the present moment, the P.A.P. are offering two alternatives - one alternative is the White Paper merger proposals and the other alternative

is  the so-called complete unconditional merger or whatever type it is. If these

blank  votes  are supposed to be anti-White Paper votes, similarly they  can  be

considered  to  be anti-unconditional complete merger votes. So  how  does  that

argument fit in with the P.A.P. contention that we are claiming that these votes

are anti-P.A.P.? They can similarly be anti-anything if they want to consider it

that way. They can be anti a, b, c, d, e, f, or g, if as many alternatives  are

put  before the people. So they are not negative votes or positive votes as  the

P.A.P. claim. They are just non-supporting votes because when a person is  faced

with two or more unacceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 622</b></font><br><br>



alternatives,  the natural reaction is to cast a blank vote. And it  is  because

they   themselves  know  this  to  be  the  natural  reaction  that  the  P.A.P.

intentionally  want  to  pose to the people two unacceptable  alternatives  and

thereby hope to get the blank votes and call them P.A.P. votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument against their claim that blanks are so-called negative votes

is  this. You will remember, Sir, that the P.A.P. said the blank votes were  put

in  because  certain  people  claimed 51 per  cent.  If  you  trace  the  events

historically, you will find that this blank-votes clause was put in  before  the

Second Reading of the Bill. The Second Reading was on the 14th or 15th of March,

and  these  amendments were put in two or three days before, whereas the  unions

suggested  their 60 per cent only in Select Committee, and that  was  in  April,

fully one month later. My own amendment of 51 per cent was put in in May. So  if

they want to argue that it was because of the claim of the 51 per cent amendment

that  they put in the blank votes clause then historically their argument  falls

flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., through the Minister for Health and Law and the Minister for

Finance,  keep on harping on the same old theme that the clause on  blank  votes

had  been  put  in  to prevent the Communists from mounting a campaign  to, get

people to put in blank votes or to incite and confuse the people to put in blank

votes.  First of all, Sir, this presupposes that the voter is a fool. I am  sure

nobody  in  his right senses will listen to any person - be he Communist  or  non-Communist - to do something which is against his own conscience. If the Communists

were to ask you to put your hands into filthy matter and rub it on your face,  I

am  sure you will not do anything like that. It is only when you feel that it is

a  natural  and right thing to do that you do what you want to do. Moreover,  as

has  already  been repeatedly pointed out, there are only 300 odd Communists  in

Singapore.  In Indonesia, there are more than two million. They have  not  given

any trouble to the Indonesian Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 623</b></font><br><br>



Just  300 of them here and it is causing sleepless nights to our Prime Minister.

Therefore,  the real reason for this blank-votes clause is to pinch votes,  that

is,  to pose to the voter two unacceptable questions and then to cash in on  the

natural  reaction to put in blank and uncertain votes and to pinch  those  blank

votes which the voters put in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, every person in Singapore, in coffee-shops, villages and buses - the

hawkers, workers, farmers, office workers and the intelligentsia - all are  aghast

at  the undemocratic and dishonest way in which the P.A.P. Government are  going

about with this Bill. Whether they are Chinese-educated or English-educated  all

are  aghast  at  the  P.A.P. Even foreigners, who pass through  Singapore,  have

expressed  surprise that Singapore should want to introduce such an undemocratic

and  unheard  of unconstitutional provision. The P.A.P. themselves,  of  course,

know  it, and hence their trying to grab votes through this provision.  All  the

political Parties on the Opposition Benches - the Barisan Sosialis, the  Workers'

Party,  the  United  People's Party and even the S.P.A. - are against  the  provision.  And  outside the Assembly, there is the Council of Joint Action,  which

includes  the  Liberal Socialists, the Party Rakyat, and the  United  Democratic

Party.  Is it the suggestion of the Government that all these organisations  are

pro-Communist? The excuse they give is a very dishonest one. They say that since

the  Communists may encourage people to put in blank votes, so they must prevent

this  by grabbing those blank votes first. It amounts to a robber robbing a bank

on  the  excuse that another person is going to rob the bank; or to use another

analogy,  it  amounts to a person wanting to set fire to a house on  the  excuse

that another person may want to set fire to it. That does not make the action of

this robber or this arsonist democratic and right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister for Health and Law says that it is nothing undemocratic to

offer the voters two honest alternatives. The point is this: are they really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 624</b></font><br><br>



honest alternatives? We have repeatedly said that they have distorted our  stand

of  full and complete merger. Our stand of merger means automatic conversion  to

Federation   citizenship  and  proportional  representation   in   the   Central

Parliament. That is our stand of full and complete merger and any distortion  of

that stand cannot be called honest. Now they are asking people to become second-class citizens, or to lose half their citizenship. That is completely dishonest.

I  will go into further details on this when I come to the motion standing in my

name, condemning the Government for malicious distortion of our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one word now to counter what the Minister for Finance said. He says again

that automatic Federal citizenship is not possible. I have already proved it  in

this  House  that  it  is  possible. It is possible under  Article  22  of  the

Federation  Constitution.  But I will go into that  later  on.  Even  the  Tunku

himself admitted that it is possible. So there is no such thing as "impossible".

We  went to great lengths in the merger debate in November to explain this.  Now

they  say  that they want to put the distorted version of the Opposition  merger

stand  to  the people. That is a very silly excuse to justify their  wanting  to

pose  two  questions  in the referendum because on national  matters  you  never

consider  the  view of only one or two Parties concerned. If it  is  a  national

matter, you must make sure that the alternatives and propositions you put to the

people are truly national in character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by just commenting on one sentence of the Minister for Health and

Law.  He  said  that clause 29 is both democratic and necessary.  Democratic?  I

think everybody in Singapore knows that it is not democratic. Necessary? Yes, it

may be necessary to the P.A.P. because without this clause they will not be able

to  push and railroad through their merger proposals. But it definitely  is  not

necessary to the people of Singapore.

more  a  majority  Government. If the Minister - all the Ministers  are  not  here

except  one - were to look around he would soon find nobody left.  We  are  happy,

Sir,  that at least the Member for Bras Basah realises the importance of and  is

to  say  her  piece.  The Member has made his point. He has indicated  that  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  touch  upon what the Government Front benches and  Back  benches  said

yesterday.



The  Member  for  Delta said yesterday in this House that the Singapore  General

Employees  Union  requested the ether trade unions to sign the draft  memorandum

without  any  meetings being held by the trade unions so that  they  are  rubber

stamps  of  the Singapore General Employees Union. Such an accusation  was  also

made  by  other  Government benches. They all alleged that these  organisations,

trade  unions and cultural organisations are Communist front organisations.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are not surprised at this distortion by the

P.A.P.  When these organisations supported the P.A.P., they were not  considered

to be Communist front organisations.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b>

On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member will not

give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, you will recall that the 33 Old Boys' Associations  submitted

their  representation  (dated 5th April, 1962) to the  Select  Committee  giving

their  views  on the National Referendum Bill. The Select Committee  also  heard

evidence from the representatives of these 33 Old Boys' Associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of order. The Member for Choa Chu Kang said that

we in the Select Committee heard evidence from 33 Old Boys' Associations. We did

not call their representatives to the Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not really a point of order, but it is well taken. I do

not think we heard evidence from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Boys' Associations. We had their written representations but no evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Rural  Residents' Association,  the  Country  Peoples'

Association, the Singapore Hawkers' Union, and the Singapore Itinerant  Hawkers'

Association  on  5th  April  presented their  joint  memorandum  to  the  Select

Committee.  38 trade unions also presented their memorandum dated 6th  April  to

the Select Committee. In these memoranda they clearly and fairly presented their

views  on  this  undemocratic National Referendum Bill. At the  same  time,  the

Select  Committee  also heard their views. But their just and  reasonable  views

were  not  accepted by the P.A.P. in the Select Committee. Therefore,  when  the

Official  Reports  of the Minutes and Proceedings of the Select  Committee  were

published,  these organisations and unions were very dissatisfied. That  is  why

they have presented their views to Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 25th of June, 40 trade unions presented a memorandum to all Members of this House. In this memorandum they pointed out the portions

which  were undemocratic in clause 29. Because of clause 29 and other provisions

in  the  Bill,  they intended to convene a conference of all organisations.  But

this  conference  was prevented from being held by the Special  Branch.  Let  me

disclose  that the Chairman of the Singapore All Trade Unions Working Committee - this  is  a notice to all Singapore trade unions which were going to attend  the

conference which was to be held.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir.  The Member is reading from the memorandum of the 38  trade  unions

which  would be the subject for debate when we come to the motion moved  by  the

Member for Thomson. I do not think it is relevant for him to quote now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Speaker has not

even heard the Member quote. I have already indicated that opinions of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 628</b></font><br><br>



trade  union should not just be read out. If the Member accepts those  opinions,

then  he  can paraphrase them as though they are his own. I do not know what  he

wishes to read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  what I want to say is that they have  clearly  pointed  out

something  in  regard  to  the contents in clause  29.  Let  me  paraphrase  the

memorandum from the Chairman of the Working Committee to representatives of  the

various organisations. This is the passage concerning the provision relating  to

blank  votes and uncertain votes to be in support of the Government  and  to  be

included with those votes in support of the Government. What the representatives

of  the  various trade unions wanted to discuss is clause 29, which we  are  now

discussing.



<br><br>9.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of June, when the representatives of the various trade unions

wanted  to  go  to the Singapore Motor Workers' Union's premises to  attend  the

meeting,  they were prevented from doing so by policemen. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

can  clearly see these trade unions represent all their members. They  are  also

important  members  of  our  society.  On  something  which  will  affect  their

democratic right, they have the responsibility and right to voice their opinions

and  air  their views. But the Government has prevented them from doing  such  a

thing.  This  action of the Government is not at all surprising to us.  What  is

surprising is that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is perhaps drifting too far away from the amendment.

In  fact,  he is anticipating the motion standing in the name of the Member  for

Thomson. He can reserve all those remarks when we come to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Chairman, I accept your advice. When we debate the motion by the Member for

Thomson, I will give my views thereon. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me paraphrase  what

the 33 Old Boys' Associations presented to the Select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 629</b></font><br><br>



Committee  on the 27th of June. The 33 Old Boys' Associations gave three  points

of advice to Members of this House, and not to the Select Committee. One of them

touches  on  clause  29,  which is under discussion. Let  me  paraphrase  their

suggestions in relation to clause 29. They say, "We would like to suggest to the

Legislative  Assembly  that all unreasonable provisions, especially  clause  29,

should  be  abolished."  These cultural organisations and  trade  unions,  whose

executive members are elected from among their members, have full right  to  represent  their  members on views relating to the National Referendum  Bill.  The

Government have alleged that these trade unions did not hold meetings to  obtain

approval  for  sending  their  representatives to the  said  conference.  I  now

challenge  the  Government  to  say whether they consider  these  trade  unions,

cultural  organisations,  rural organisations and hawkers'  associations  cannot

represent the views of their respective members, in spite of the fact that  they

willingly  wanted to hold a rally to examine the contents of the Bill.  But  the

Government  said  that I cannot be a spokesman for them. But if  the  Government

have  the  guts,  let  them hold rallies and meetings just to  see  whether  the

members of these organisations support the views of their leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministers of the Government have made unprincipled

accusations  which  are contrary to the will of the members of  these  organisations  and which are also a sort of smear. You will remember that in 1956  there

was  a  Committee on Human Rights Convention. One of the leaders of the  P.A.P.,

Mr  Devan Nair, was an important member of this Convention. The Prime  Minister

had  a  very close connection with this Convention. This Human Rights Convention

also comprised organisations of Singapore. Will the Minister for Home Affairs or

the  Prime  Minister  say  that this Human Rights  Convention  was  a  Communist

organisation? Would the Prime Minister say that the actions, the work and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 630</b></font><br><br>



views  of  this  Human  Rights Convention did not represent  the  views  of  its

component parts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of order, Sir. What has the Human Rights

Convention got to do with it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. I would like to know that myself. I am wondering when the

hon.  Member  will  come  to the point. How is this  relevant  to  what  we  are

discussing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like to point out to you  that  the  Government's

accusation that these organisations representations to the Select Committee were

illegal were, in fact, not so. Because they were pin-pointing clause 29  of  the

Bill-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order, Sir, Is the Member for Choa Chu Kang allowed to read

out memoranda from various organisations?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not noticed the Member reading a memorandum for the last

five minutes. I have stopped him from merely reading the memorandum of the other

organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Mr Speaker,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have made my ruling. The ruling is such that the Member for

Choa Chu Kang is not at the moment out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  thank you very much. Today, when this House  is  discussing

clause  29, which will determine the democratic rights of the people, therefore,

as  members  of  society, these organisations have the right to  oppose  such  a

provision. We cannot tolerate the Government's attempts to smear their views  as

Communist.  If the Government persist in their smear campaign, then they  should

shoulder all the consequences.

intended  to put up a play at the Victoria Theatre called "A Bunch of  Monkeys",

ridiculing the whole process of the one man one vote system. Are they  the  real

champions  of  parliamentary democracy? Let us not forget how innocent  students

were prevented by force to say no to the boycott.

the  right to say 'no'. There is a Chinese saying, "Do not expect ivory to  grow

from a dog's mouth."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> How rightly you have said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> We have heard of examples - drain water, urine, beating the

wife,  or the mother, prostitutes, concubines - what is all this? I would say  the

best  example is, "Do you want to eat curry rice, chop suey or chapati?" When  a

person is hungry, he has a right, of course, to choose to starve, but it is  the

responsibility of the Government to persuade him not to do so. We  were  elected

into  this  Assembly on a merger mandate. This House has approved the motion  on

merger.  The question is, what type of merger do we want? A person has  a  human

right,  the  right to starve himself to death. Everyone knows that  whether  you

like  it  or  not there is going to be Malaysia. It is the duty of a responsible

government to see that Singapore is not isolated. We have decided on one  thing,

i.e. merger. The Barisan Sosialis have no guts to say, "We do not want merger."

So what are they complaining about?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 633</b></font><br><br>



It  is  a  matter  of whether we want the White Paper merger  or  a  complete

merger, it  is  like asking whether you want to eat rice or  chop  suey.  Of

course, you have the right to starve to death. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have pulled

up  Opposition Members for being disorderly time and again. It  seems  to  me

that  they are verging on being disrespectful to the Chair, which I will  not

tolerate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition Parties had their opportunity to voice their opinions.

At  least  they should show respect to the Chair and give a chance to  others

to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the failure of parliamentary democracy in this part of

the world is because certain countries think that wholesale transplanting  of

parliamentary democracy in their country would work. History has proved  that

we  have  to  adapt parliamentary democracy according to the  conditions  and

environments of our country, and with the conditions in Singapore we have  to

adapt  our  system according to local conditions. This talk of  parliamentary

democracy by the Barisan Sosialis is all eye-wash. What they really  want  is

a  'yes' or 'no' to the White Paper. If you say 'no' to the White Paper, i.e.

no  merger,  that is what they want. They broke away from us over this  issue

of merger. It is quite clear when their

leaders  went  round  to  the branches after the split that  they  were  arguing

against

merger.  The  Member for Thomson, if he could remember, told his  Branch  Executive Committee that he should have the right of choice in the marriage  and

the  Federation Government is not the right choice because it is a Right-wing

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir, I should be very much obliged if

the  Hon. the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education  could

he alleges that I have said things that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 634</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I could even quote the person who said all this. He was a

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He cannot

deny, Mr Speaker, that the whole idea is to sabotage the referendum and merger.

it is the duty of a responsible government to see that merger goes through.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> An old gramophone record.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, there may be others

who  still  think  that Singapore can stand on its own feet, whether  under  the

United Nations or otherwise. But everyone knows that Malaysia is inevitable and

it  is  our duty to see that the Barisan Sosialis do not engineer a campaign  to

have blank votes to block merger.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, once again so many heated words have been exchanged between P.A.P. and  ex-P.A.P. that one is beginning to wonder whether the whole of this Assembly is  to

be  confined  to  this struggle between them. Sir, I would ask Members  of  this

Assembly to give serious thought to the matter under discussion and in order  to

have a proper appreciation of the move that the Government is making and why the

Government  considers  it is necessary to make such a  move,  may  I  have  your

indulgence,  Sir,  if  I  endeavour  to go briefly  over  the  history  of  this

referendum that necessitates the present stand of the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the original intention of the Government to pose one question to

the  electorate. They knew that they were going to lose because  the  electorate

would just vote against the White Paper merger proposals not because they do not

want merger but because they want to see the end of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 635</b></font><br><br>



- the sooner the better. Therefore they got frightened and they tried to cook up

two  questions and in their cleverness they thought it would be better  if  they

could put them in such a way that there could be only one possible answer.  When

I heard of such dishonest manoeuvring, Sir, I was aghast, and I was naturally up

in  arms  against any attempt by the Government to impose on the electorate  any

dishonest referendum. Therefore, I was very, very much against any move  by  the

Government - to put it mildly - to cheat the electorate. When the Government  found

that  right  thinking  people would just throw in blank votes  in  protest,  the

P.A.P. began to see the error of their ways. At the time when they proposed this

particular clause, they had in mind two questions:

"Do  you want the White Paper merger with autonomy in education and labour?" Or.

"Do  you  want  Penang/Malacca type merger with 340,000 non-local born  citizens

losing  their  citizenship  rights?" We were naturally  up  in  arms.  We  spoke

vigorously  and without pulling punches; we called the P.A.P. dishonest  and  we

were  ready  to tear into them, to expose them for what evil they meant  to  do.

But, Sir, as a result of the debate over the past four days, the Government  has

agreed,  through pressure from us and from other Members of the  Assembly,  that

the  questions  must  be  straightforward and  honest  questions  and  that  the

questions to be posed in a referendum must first of all be fully debated in this

Assembly. They have accepted that. Therefore the charge that dishonest questions

would be put - thereby calling upon us to put in protest votes - is now remote.  The

questions  will  be  fully debated in this House. The Prime Minister  has  given

notice of a motion whereby two questions will be posed and the first question of

course will be Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961. The other question is going to be  com

plete  and  unconditional merger. That is a straightforward and honest  presentation.  There is no presentation of a Penang or Malacca type merger with  340,000

non-local  born  citizens losing their citizenship rights. I  have  said  in  my

speeches on this debate that there could be a third question. The third



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 636</b></font><br><br>



question could be "Do the electorate want Singapore to enter the new Malaysia on

terms  no less favourable than any one of the Borneo territories?" I propose  to

move an amendment along that line when the motion is debated in due course.



<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if honest and straightforward questions are posed to the electorate

to  get  their verdict, there can be little protest at all. In fact it would  be

right  and proper to ask the electorate to cast their verdict. They are  totally

free  to reject Command Paper No. 33, but in the rejection of Command Paper  No.

33  they would have considered which of the other two alternatives would  be  in

the  best interest of the people of Singapore. In deciding in their minds as  to

which form of closer association would be more in the interest of the people  of

Singapore,  the  political Parties represented in this Assembly would  be  given

every  opportunity  at referendum meetings to try and sell their  ideas  to  the

electorate.  Those  of  us who are against Command Paper  No.  33 -  the  Barisan

Sosialis, the Workers' Party, the United Peoples Party, and the S.P.A. - could  go

out  and  tell  the  electorate  that in their minds  complete  merger  is  more

desirable  and is more in the interest of the people of Singapore.  Or  if  they

like to take the line that what is offered to the Borneo territories should also

be  offered to Singapore, they are free to do so, and all the political  Parties

should rest content to leave it to the electorate to pass judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the P.A.P. say that they are aware that the Communists will be up to

their  tricks and that in an attempt to damage merger they would be  working  on

the people of Singapore to mislead them into casting blank votes. Sir, I, as one

who had been in the Government previously and had to contend with the Communists

and  their subversive activities, have this to say. The P.A.P. have worked  with

them; the P.A.P. have given them legal cover and the P.A.P. have helped them  to

grow into what they are now, and having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 637</b></font><br><br>



worked  with them, perhaps the P.A.P. are in a better position to know  the  way

they  would  work to wreck anything that the Government propose, in  fact,  the

P.A.P. had helped them to try to wreck me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would not like to say that I am having the last laugh because they are

trying  to  wreck  the P.A.P., but in all our deliberations  in  respect  of  accusations  by the Government of Communist activities and Communist  attempts  to

wreck  merger, one must be guided by the first principle - the interests  of  the

country. As a political Party in the Opposition, it would be a grand opportunity

today to kick as hard as we can against the P.A.P. and to call them all sorts of

names.  In  fact, they deserve those things. But is all this going to  help  the

country?  I  doubt  very much. There is already sufficient confusion  over  this

issue, and as the days go by there will be more and more confusion added  if  we

do  not try to bring sanity to the debate on a very important national issue.  I

have  said  to  the  P.A.P. many a time that if they  really  fear  that  their

erstwhile Communist comrades will be up to tricks to damage the interests of the

people  of Singapore, there is only one thing that they should do. But  they  do

not want to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is that?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They should

see to it that the opportunities are not given to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they feel that it would be difficult or maybe they consider it

undemocratic  to use the P.P.S.O. and so they prefer this method - an undemocratic

method of playing the same game. It would seem, Sir, that on this very important

national issue the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis are trying to play a game

- not  chess - but a game for the existence of their own political  Parties;  a

game  to  win the hearts and minds of the people of Singapore. At least in  this

particular instance, I can say that the P.A.P. are playing the game in  the  way

that they think they should play in the interests of the people of Singapore.  I

cannot say the same thing for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 638</b></font><br><br>



erstwhile  comrades who have been described by them as Communists and  Communist

front leaders. We do not like to see undemocratic methods being employed, but as

the  P.A.P. have  said, this is something which they want to use  to  beat  the

Communists  at their own game. As the Government have agreed that the  questions

to  be posed will be fully debated in this Assembly and as an assurance has been

given  by  the  Minister  for Home Affairs that this  Referendum  Bill  will  be

repealed  after the merger referendum, therefore, we feel that, in the interests

of  the people of Singapore, we will abstain. Much as we like to shout and shout

and  shout  at  the  P.A.P., much as we like to try and gain as  much  political

credit as we can out of this dilemma of the Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You want it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> New orders.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes. As I have

said  on many occasions, as I have said even during the time when I was  in  the

Government,  the  interests of the country come above everything  else - the  individual as well as the Party - and because of that, we are abstaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the questions are straightforward questions, where then is the fear

that  the  people will cast protest votes? There will be very, very few  protest

votes,  and  if  there are very few protest votes, why are we wasting  our  time

going hammer and tongs at one another? The fact that the Barisan are feeling  so

strongly  about this is that they intend to try and damage merger by calling  on

the electorate of Singapore to cast blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a question has been asked. The S.P.A. will be on the side of the people

of  Singapore  against  the Communists, against the subversives,  against  those

people  who are out to wreck the interests of the people of Singapore, no matter

what Party they belong to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been said, blank votes and uncertain votes during election time

amounted to only one per cent. Let the Government have that one per cent. I will

not grudge them, but I feel it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 639</b></font><br><br>



wrong.  But  the fact that there has been so much heat generated by the  Barisan

against  this attempt by the Government to stump them in what they  want  to  do

makes us feel that if the P.A.P. and ex-P.A.P. want to have their game, well, go

on,  have it. The sooner they have that game, and the sooner one of the  Parties

gets  knocked  out,  the better. It will be better still  if  both  Parties  get

knocked out. And it shall be our constant hope that both will get knocked out-



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Your friends!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - but if

both  do  not get knocked out, it shall be our duty and our pleasure  to  knock

them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> High hopes!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We knock the Barisan first.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The P.A.P. is dead. It cannot be more dead than what it was

at  9.15 p.m. tonight. It may become more dead, but I will wait for the day when

the funeral takes place.

That will be the greatest rejoicing to

the  people  of Singapore. The mess that we are in today is because of  the  mis

take,  the misdeeds and the evil deeds of the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P. Let there

be an end to this misrule.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, since the days of the colonial government, never have

we  seen  a law more undemocratic and unreasonable than clause 29 which concerns

the  question of blank votes in the Referendum Bill. It is difficult to  find  a

parallel  in any other law. The Government, despite its present majority  of  25

seats,  can  still  pass  any legislation by virtue of abstained  votes  in  the

Opposition.  But, Sir, for a law to be acceptable, it must receive  the  consent

and express the popular will of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the question of blank votes has received much adverse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 640</b></font><br><br>



criticism  from every section of our society, even from those who supported  the

White  Paper  proposals. The Government's proposal to consider  blank  votes  as

supporting  the  Government's  constitutional  proposals  is  most  absurd.  The

Government  want  the people to vote for the White Paper.  They  have  given  no

choice  to  the people to say "no" to the White Paper. The people can only  vote

for an alternative which will be worse than the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who accept the White Paper can put a cross in the appropriate column

in  the  ballot  paper. Those who reject the White Paper cannot  put  any  cross

anywhere,  except to leave the ballot paper blank. There will be  few  abstained

votes.  Few will vote for the second alternative, because the second alternative

will  be worse than the White Paper. It therefore boils down to this. The  voter

actually has two choices. If he supports the White Paper, well and good. He puts

a  cross  in the appropriate column. But if he rejects the White Paper, he  will

have  no alternative but to throw in a blank ballot paper. In other words,  all

those  voters  who  throw in blank ballot papers would,  in  our  analysis,  be

opposing  the White Paper and not merely being neutral or having no  opinion  at

all.  In  the  coming  merger referendum, the situation  is  different  from  an

election  where there are few blank votes. In an election the reason for blank

votes  is  that  a few of the voters do not know how to vote. Therefore,  in  an

election  we  would  agree  that blank votes should be  treated  as  void  votes

supporting none of the candidates. But in the coming referendum, we  are  faced

with  an entirely different position because the voters who wish to vote against

the  White Paper have no alternative but to throw in blank votes. They are  not

void  votes.  They are not votes which are neutral. They are  votes  which  are

against the Government's White Paper proposals. That is why we have to move  an

amendment  to  make  the votes as anti-Government votes. Sir,  here  we  have  a

Government  which is prepared to legislate anti-Government votes  into  becoming

pro-Government votes. Sir, I do not want to repeat old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 641</b></font><br><br>



and  stale  arguments  in this Chamber and waste the  time  of  Members.  The

people  of Singapore have understood full well the undemocratic and  disgraceful  nature  of clause 29. What they now require is not a further explanation

of  clause  29  but  an answer, a solution, a counter move,  to  Government's

shameful manipulation in the coming referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to clause 5 and clause 29 are the two vital issues in the

coming  referendum.  We  have  not  wanted to  side-track  issues  of  lesser

importance  in  the Referendum Bill. It was our intention  to  highlight  the

importance  and the far-reaching consequences of the two vital amendments  to

clause  5  and clause 29. The effect of clause 29, i.e. the blank  votes,  is

that  the Government could have a 99 per cent or even a 100 per cent victory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of such an undemocratic referendum is a foregone conclusion. If

this  Government are prepared to enact legislation such as clause  29, there

is  little left that they dare not do. What is left for us, Sir, is  to  seek

an  answer to this shameful and disgraceful manipulation of Government in the

referendum which is to come-.

who claim to defend parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you can recall. I am sure you will agree that the people who have been

saying that they are democrats, that they are here to defend democracy, to  make

democracy tick in this part of the world, and that they are here to fight forces

which  are  anti-democratic, are, in fact, those people who  today  sit  on  the

opposite Benches. Sir, I do not remember having claimed to be ever a champion of

parliamentary  democracy. This does not mean I am anti-parliamentary  democracy.

But I do not want to be a hypocrite.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You believe in democratic centralism. That is what you said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am quite used to listening to names and I do not mind what I

am  called.  You can call me a Fascist, a Communist, or what have you.  But  the

point I want to make is this: it is not people in the Barisan Sosialis who  have

hitherto claimed to fight evil forces, subversive elements, elements which  want

to  wreck the democratic system. It is the people who are in the P.A.P. now. The

very  reason why the Government Members say they have included clause 29 in  the

Referendum  Bill is, according to them, to fight the Communists; the  Communists

are  out  to wreck the parliamentary system. I think it is not only hypocritical

but  it  is  equally  naive for Members on the Government Benches  to  seriously

suggest  that they are the people who are going to defend the democratic  system

in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, I am a very simple man. I do not claim to be one of the pillars

of  parliamentary  democracy. For the information of Members on  the  Government

side,  I  will  read  to them what their own master has  said  in  the  past  of

parliamentary  democracy. I am sure nobody on the Government Benches  would  say

that their Prime Minister was a pro-Communist or a Fascist or was a man who  was

wrecking the parliamentary system. And later on, perhaps, if I might quote  some

interesting bits which the Prime Minister himself has said about democracy.  And

we can judge this talk of democracy-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 643</b></font><br><br>



that  the  P.A.P. Government want to practise by the standards which the  Prime Minister himself has set and preached about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity the Minister for Finance is not here. I must really congratulate

him  on  having  made  a coherent speech, a very eloquent speech  in  which  the

arguments  have been coherently made; but, unfortunately, very neatly fabricated

also. Sir, this is the problem with the Minister for Finance. He is basically  a

theoretician  and  an economist. Therefore, he is more often  in  the  habit  of

putting  forward highflown theoretical arguments and is inclined to  forget  the

practical  side  of the theoretical arguments he puts forward. He  referred  to

what I had said on freedom of choice, and went on to talk of the concept of free

democratic choice in the Victorian age. Sir, I have no intention whatsoever  of taking  Members  of this House to a few hundred years back, the Victorian  age,

nor  are Members of the Government Benches seriously interested in, I think, the

Victorian age and their concept of freedom of choice, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said that we were asking for a negative "no right". Sir, he

has  had sufficient time to have his speech thought out carefully with the  help

and  assistance given to him by able civil servants. I unfortunately do not have

the facilities of using Government paid stenographers and typists to prepare a

speech.  If  the Minister was able to put forward today an apparently  coherent

argument, it is because he has had the time to work out a speech well thought

out  and  well written, and with sufficient command of the English  language  he

sought  to  say all that we in the Opposition seek is a negative  right  to  say

"no".  And he said that in the affairs of men the negative right is not in human

affairs; that is what he said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are saying that they want to pose two alternatives, two totally unacceptable alternatives. This has been admitted by the Government Members

themselves. The Prime Minister himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 644</b></font><br><br>



has  already  given  notice of a motion. There is no doubt whatsoever  that  the

Government want to pose two alternatives to the people. And we feel that if  two

alternatives  are  to be put to the people, then the people must  be  given  the

right to accept or reject them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the P.A.P. we do not start from the premise that the people of

Singapore must necessarily choose one of the two alternatives they put forward,



<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trying to distort the Barisan Sosialis stand and say that the second

alternative  is, in fact, the Barisan Sosialis stand. That, Mr Mammen,  is  not

correct, and at the appropriate moment we will restate what the Barisan Sosialis

stand  is on the merger issue. But briefly, Sir, if they are going to say,  "You

choose unconditional complete merger or the White Paper type of merger," it does

not  take  too much of imagination that this is a distortion of the Opposition's

stand. We in the Barisan Sosialis have never at any time suggested that we  want

unconditional merger. I will be obliged if the Government Members can quote  any

relevant  documents where we say we want unconditional merger.  Sir,  you  will

know that the term "super merger" is one that is only recently coined. It has only  been coined after we have started harping on the fact that they are  going

to  pose two unacceptable alternatives. However, Sir, in the context where  they

are going to pose two unacceptable alternatives, surely the people must be given  the right to either accept or reject or, if necessary, to abstain. This to me

does not seem to be something unusual. There is

absolutely  nothing  unusual  about asking the Government  to  guarantee  these

rights  in the legislation. This has nothing to do with the Communists,  nothing

to  do  with the wrecking of the parliamentary system, and it has nothing to  do

with frustrating merger. It has been suggested that clause 29 is included in the

Bill  because the Barisan Sosialis want to frustrate merger. Why should we  want

to frustrate merger?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the Members from the Government Front Bench know for a fact that

merger  or  no merger, nothing affects the democratic movement of the people  in

this  country.  So long as the Barisan Sosialis is confident that it  represents

the  democratic  movement of the people in Singapore, there  is  nothing  to  be

concerned  about  whether merger of the P.A.P. type is going to  materialise  or

not.  The  Government's  theory has been that because the  Barisan  Sosialis  is

afraid  of merger, because the Barisan Sosialis thinks that it will be dissolved

perhaps,  because the Barisan Sosialis leaders believe that they may be arrested

if  there is merger, that we want to frustrate merger. Sir, I tell them once and

for all that our concentration is not on the dissolution of the Barisan Sosialis

or cn the arrests of the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis. We are not a political

organisation that is dependent on Government machinery for its survival. We  are

not  a  po1itical organisation that is dependent on individuals. We  derive  our

strength  from the people. We say, Barisan Sosialis or no Barisan Sosialis,  the

people's  movement goes on. And all the P.A.P.s in the world will not check  the

people's movement. We have no desire to frustrate merger in any way. But if  the

Government  means that our wanting to frustrate merger is in fact our opposition

to  the White Paper merger, then we say that is true. We have stated openly that

we oppose the White Paper merger. We have stated our reasons for our opposition.

Quite rightly, we expect the people to oppose the White Paper merger. It is  our

obligation to ask the people to oppose the White Paper merger. Sir, we have  put

forward  our  stand  on merger as complete merger where all  Singapore  citizens

automatically will be converted into Federal citizens on merger day and where we

will get proportional representation in the Federal Parliament. I tell them what

I  have  already stated once before. If the Government is sincere in wanting  to

put forward the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 646</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Sosialis type of merger to the people, then the obvious thing is to  put

forward  our official stand on merger. There can be no distortion about  it.  We

moved  an  amendment here in this House last year. We stated our stand in  clear

categorical terms, with no ambiguity and with no uncertainty. If the  Government

is  serious  in  wanting to put forward the Barisan type  of  merger, then  the

obvious thing to do is to say:

"(1)  Do you support the White Paper merger?; (2) Do you support complete merger

where  all  Singapore citizens automatically become Federal citizens  and  where

Singapore would have proportional representation in the Federal Parliament?"  We

say  that we expect a government with some decency left at least to do this  and

nothing  else.  But, Sir obviously the P.A.P. has degenerated to  the  position

where it does not even show the common decency of allowing us to define our  own

stand, it just wants to put forward a distorted version of our stand so  as  to

make  the proposition totally unacceptable to the people. We say that no  matter

what  question  is  posed  to the people - whether it  is  one  question  or  two

questions;  whether it is to be two alternatives - the free choice of  the  people

must still be uninterfered with. We say that even if the Government is going  to

put  forward the Barisan stand in just one simple question, because it  is  our

stand,  we are not going to tell the Government to count all the blank votes  as

votes for our proposition. We tell them to put forward our proposition requiring

a simple "yes" or

"no" answer, and blank votes are blank

votes,  and they cannot be recorded. This is because we believe in the  inherent

right  of  the people to have an uninterfered free choice. I am not saying  that

this  is not a negative right that we are seeking from the people. It is in fact

a  positive right. It is a positive right because what is going to be  posed  to

the people in the referendum are to be just two alternatives. The people are not

going  to be given 640,000 versions of merger to choose from. They are not going

to be given a proposition for them to decide after having, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 647</b></font><br><br>



ascertained  whether  the people are in fact in favour of the  proposition.  The

P.A.P.'s whole object is to pose two unacceptable alternatives and have  clause

29  in the Referendum Bill so that they could produce the result at the end and

say,   "So  many  per  cent  of  the  people  have  supported  the  Government's

proposition."  They know full well that if they pose just one  question,  asking

the  people to choose whether they want the White Paper merger or not, then  the

majority  of the people are bound to oppose it. It is because they are aware  of

this  that  they  want  to  pose  two  alternatives - not  only  two  unacceptable

alternatives but in addition, they want to have blank votes counted as votes for

the  Government  proposition. Sir, this perhaps is  the  appropriate  moment  to

examine  what  in  fact  blank  votes  would  mean  in  a  situation  where  two

unacceptable alternatives are posed to the people. In an election normally  the

blank votes are negligible. But here the situation is quite different from  what

would prevail in an election where the choice is between a number of candidates.

If  two  unacceptable alternatives are posed, then there are bound to be  people

who  are  going  to  find  both  unacceptable.  And  if  both  propositions  are

unacceptable, one has either the opportunity of putting in a blank  vote  or  of

putting in a vote which could be spoiled. Now, in this case, Mr Mammen, Sir,  a

blank  vote  is something that will be cast because one is uncertain  to  choose

between  two alternatives. The chances are that if the government pushes through

its  arrangement for a referendum on the basis of its utterances so far, it will

be  posing,  in  our view, two unacceptable alternatives, and in  our  view  the

majority of the people are going to find both unacceptable. Therefore, they  are

going to be unwilling to choose between two unacceptable alternatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You want complete merger!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if such votes are to be counted as votes for the Government

proposition, then the least I could say, at least in the diction of the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 648</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis, is that it is definitely not democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has suggested that the S.P.A. is going to

abstain. The Member for Cairnhill always interests me because he seems to  think

that  if  he  has a few S.P.A. speakers outside the Assembly attending  forums,

making fiery speeches condemning the Referendum Bill and attacking clause 29 and

so  on  and  so  forth,  and  yet still have their Assemblymen  supporting  the

Government  or, if necessary, conveniently abstaining while ensuring  that  the

Government would still have a majority to carry the decision, they could  easily

cheat the people. The Member for Cairnhill must be very naive.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people are not so simple as to be so easily cheated. Today the people

of  Singapore are watching the proceedings of this Assembly and the  conduct  of

every  Member  of this Assembly is subject to public scrutiny. One  can  in  his

speech condemn the Barisan Sosialis or condemn the P.A.P.;

yet  what counts is in which way he votes. The S.P.A. stereo abstaining in  this

particular  case is merely to save face because they have been openly  committed

to  opposing  clause  29  of  the Bill. Here in  this  Chamber  at  the  moment,

particularly  when the Government has only 25 Members left if the  S.P.A. joins

the  rest  of  the Opposition and votes against clause 29, then clause  29  will

indeed  drop,  and  the amendment to clause 29 made by the  Opposition  will  be

carried. Therefore, even for political expediency if they want to oppose  clause

29,  they  cannot do it because the very survival of the Government depends  on

their support. But then, Mr Mammen, Sir, to support clause 29 openly will be  a

very embarrassing thing because they have openly stated outside the Chamber that

clause  29  is  undemocratic.  So  the obvious  thing  is  to  abstain,  and  by

abstaining,  the  Government is, in fact, ensured of  a  majority  against  this

amendment. Sir, this is a cheap political trick and it does not take  a  man  of

great intelligence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 649</b></font><br><br>



to  understand  such trickery. The people of Singapore are  politically  very

sophisticated indeed, and if one could have bluffed like this  in  the  past,

then the first one to try it would have been the

S.P.A.  But  whatever  little effort they have made in trying  to  bluff  the

people  along similar lines has, in fact, been of no avail, and for  them  to

do  it  at  the  moment or for them to try it in the future, I  think,  would

equally be fruitless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arguments on clause 29 have already been stated quite clearly by

Members of the Barisan Sosialis. I do not want to go into the details of  the

arguments except to sum up what has been said of parliamentary democracy  and

democracy and so on in this Chamber. As I said when I started off, it is  not

my  intention to claim to be a guardian of parliamentary democracy; it is not

my  intention to claim to be a pillar of parliamentary democracy. Sir,  I  am

not  an exponent in these matters. Perhaps the Minister for Finance who  says

that  his  life is dedicated to preserving the democratic system could  be  a

greater exponent. But then as I have said.

the  tragedy of the Minister for Finance is that he is more an economist  and  a

theoretician  and, therefore, every time he thinks of political  problems  he

cannot  divorce them from the ABC of economics that he has learnt; and  every

time he talks theoretically on a political basis he forgets conveniently  the

practical side. Sir, I wish to just answer one or two points on this talk  of

democracy and parliamentary democracy and so

on.  Sir, the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Education have all said that democracy must be adapted  to  suit

local conditions. Their suggestion has been, in fact, that democracy must  be

accepted  conditionally. Sir, we know the sort of democracy that prevails  in Singapore.  We are not talking of individual rights to go to the cabaret  and

dance,  to  go  to  a bar and have a beer. We are talking of the  fundamental

human  right of the people to decide their future themselves. We  are  saying

that  merger  is a matter that will affect the lives of all our people,  that

it will affect the lives of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 650</b></font><br><br>



their  children  and generations to come, and we say that in a  matter  of  this

magnitude  and  of this significance, the right of the people to  freely  choose

must be guaranteed by whatever legislation this House passes and not be deprived

of consciously. Sir, the Minister for Finance has also said that in a regimented

society  there is no talk of the right to say no, etc. I do not think, Sir,  any

Member  from the Barisan Sosialis has ever suggested that the P.A.P. must  bring

about  a  regimented  society. I do not know what  particular  society  or  what

political  system he was having in his mind when he was talking of a  regimented

society. But knowing his inner thinking, I think it will be safe to assume  that

by  a  regimented society perhaps he means a Communist society or a  society  as

existed  in Nazi Germany. Sir, I just briefly want to say this, that even  in  a

Communist society, in Communist China and in the Soviet Union, the right of  the

people to say 'no' is guaranteed in an election, and this I am sure will be ipse

dixit,  if  the Members on the opposite benches choose to be honest, they  will

accept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is what you said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we are not advocating a regimented type of society. We are not

saying  you bring about a Fascist society tomorrow. But the irony is that  these

men  who  talk  of  democracy and so on do not realise  that  even  in  Hitler's

Germany, the right to say no was given in a referendum. What moral justification

can  these men have in wanting to criticise the Barisan Sosialis for asking  the

people  to be given this basic right? Sir, as I have said, we are aware  of  the

type  of  democracy that has been in existence in Singapore  for  the  past  130

years. We are fully aware of the type of democracy the P.A.P. wants to practise.

We  are not, as I have said, thinking of the individual right to go to attend  a

social here or a social there. We are not thinking of individual rights to buy a

blue  car  or a red car or a white car. We are thinking of more serious matters.

We  do  not claim, Sir, to be the pillars of parliamentary democracy. We say  we

are  what we are and we go by standards of fairness and reasonableness.  We  say

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 651</b></font><br><br>



Referendum Bill is unfair because it is unfair. It denies the people  the  right

of  free  choice. We say clause 29 is unfair because it seeks to interfere  with

the  right  of the people to have a free choice. But these men who claim  to  be

champions  of  democracy do not practise democracy - simple things  like  unions

wanting to hold meetings to discuss the Referendum Bill. Sir, more than  90  per

cent of the population of Singapore is composed of workers and their dependants.

If trade unions which are legally registered organisations which represent these

workers  are  not allowed to discuss a Bill which is going to affect  their  own

future, then what sort of democracy do we have? Sir, we are not allowed to  hold

meetings freely. What sort of democracy do we have? We are not allowed to  hold

meetings  outside  the  13  constituencies in  which  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis

Assemblymen represent. [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The democracy that the hon. Members on the Government side are

preaching, as I have said, is conditional democracy.Sir, I just want to end  up

by  reading  a  few interesting passages of a great exponent of  democracy,  the

Prime Minister himself. Sir, if I attempt to try and expound on democracy, then

the  Government  Members  will come and say that I am  preaching  Communist  democracy. I have already said that I have no intention whatsoever of claiming  to

be an exponent of democracy, or in any way attempting to expound democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is very relevant to the arguments put forward. Sir, the one big mistake the P.A.P. Members make is that they always forget what their master has

said.  If I were a good student of a master, who is taught to say 'aye' when  the

master  says 'aye', and 'nay' when the master says 'nay', then I will  at  least

read His Master's Voice, His Master's sayings, His Master's utterances. This  is

very unfortunate. Sir, I quote col. 59 of Hansard, Vol. 1, of 27th April, 1955-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> A long time ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, a long time ago.

When the Prime Minister was the -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You were carrying his bag then, were you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. I was still teaching at that time, and had nothing to do with

this thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to men who preach conditional democracy, it must be refreshing to remember this. This is what Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the then Member for Tanjong Pagar,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then we must say

categorically,  without  qualification, that no restraint  from  any  democratic

process, other than the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed. If a man

chooses  to carry a hand grenade or a revolver, or some other lethal weapon,  in

times when the Governor and the High Commissioner have proclaimed a statement of

emergency, then he takes the supreme penalty the law has laid down for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if a political party wants to hold at election meeting or even a post-election meeting after 7 o'clock, they are told: "We do not believe in democracy

after  the  election. We only believe in democracy once in four years,  for  one

month."  That  is not the kind of democracy that you can inspire  men  with,  to

fight  for and die for. That is not the kind of democracy that is going to  make

it  tick in South-East Asia, if you tell us that we can hold a public meeting in

the  heat of the sun at four o'clock or five o'clock when nobody would  come  to

listen  to  us,  when therefore there would be no real danger of any  democratic

movement  starting, but that we cannot hold a public meeting  after  7  o'clock.

when  by the habits of the workers they would have returned from work, the earth

has  got cooler, the walls have got cooler, the night is getting mellow and warm

speeches  can  be made. But, no! That is not allowed. And yet, we are  asked  to

believe that this is democracy.'



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even today the P.A.P. does not allow Opposition Parties to hold meetings

after  7 o'clock. In 1955 the Prime Minister criticised the Labour Front  Govern

ment for not allowing the P.A.P. to hold meetings after 7 o'clock. And today, we

are  not only denied the right to hold meetings after 7 p.m. but also the  right

to hold meetings where we choose to hold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at col. 60 there is one line - Mr Lee Kuan Yew again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 653</b></font><br><br>



And one more line in continuation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe that men should be free,

then  they  should have the right of free association, of free speech,  of  free

publication...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Members in the Government

Benches  make  it  a point at least to try and read up their master,  then  they

would  not come here and say that we are dangerous elements and that we want  to

wreck democracy because we ask for a fundamental right of the people - a right  to

freely say yes or no or abstain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that Government thinks it necessary to have clause 29 because

the Communists want to wreck merger.

I ask the Government Members: why do

the people whom the Government call Communists want to wreck merger, and why  do

they want to frustrate merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already dealt with this before. As far as the Barisan Sosialis are

concerned,  if  a simple question is posed to the people and if the  people  are

given a free choice for them to freely decide whether they want to accept merger

on  whatever  terms, then there is no need for anybody to go  round  frustrating

merger of one type or another.



<br><br>11.20 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because today the Government has clearly stated that it wants to

pose  two  totally  unacceptable alternatives,  and  it  is  because  today  the

Government  has  stated clearly that it wants to have blank  votes  recorded  as

votes  for  the  Government proposition that there is  this  resistance  to  the

Referendum  Bill.  If  it  were not for that, the Barisan  Sosialis  would  have

nothing against merger in principle, or the Referendum Bill in principle, and we

would  have  no necessity to go round canvassing people to vote one way  or  the

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that clause 29 is necessary because of the Communists. We are

told that it is necessary to deprive the people of the fundamental right to have

free  choice because of people whom they call Communists. Sir, we are  seriously

asked  to  believe that over 600,000 voters are going to be denied the right  to

freely accept, reject, or abstain from any proposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 654</b></font><br><br>



because  of the Communists. In brief, what we are  told  is  that  the

people  should not have democracy because there are Communists and,  as  I  have

already said a number of times in this House, and the Prime Minister himself has

also  said, there are only 300 Communists in Singapore. In other words,  on  the

P.A.P. logic, because there are 300 dangerous Communists the 1.7 million people

are to be denied their fundamental democratic right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to end by again quoting the great exponent of democracy, the great

exponent of parliamentary democracy - the Prime Minister himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You were his good student.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was never a good student, but I got facts. I only wish, Sir, that

devoted  followers of the Prime Minister read these things as often  as  I  read

them.  They are very inspiring indeed. This is from col. 215 of 16th  May,  1955

[Hansard], towards the middle of the last paragraph. He was addressing you, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is no use, Mr Speaker, Sir, to tell the people: "You cannot have

Democracy.  You are not fit for it. You will be devoured by the Communists.  Let

us first fight the Communists." It does not work.'



<br><br>This  is  exactly what we are being told at the moment. The people of  Singapore

are  not  fit to have democracy because there are 300 Communists. The people  of

Singapore  are to be denied their basic right to have a free choice because  the

Government has worked out this Communist move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member for Thomson that he has, in

fact, been repeating himself time and time again? Perhaps he will come back  and

wind up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I have nothing more to say, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the debate that has been going on on

this  particular clause, I was reminded of the trite saying that if you look  at

any  cloud however dark it may be, and look hard enough, you will find a  silver

lining.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will find a golden lining.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The silver lining that

seems to arise out of the darkness of clause 29, Mr Speaker, to my mind,  is  a

reassurance that all Parties in this House are united as one in the  defence  of

democracy, the precepts of democracy, and the basic principles on which we think

democracy should be worked.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> This year of grace 1962 (July) in Singapore is a very reassuring

one  indeed,  Mr  Speaker. Listening to the Member for Anson, whose  belief  in

democracy nobody has ever doubted ever since he got into politics, there is this

reassurance although some might say that others who are more adept at  political

machinations  sometimes use him. But so far as the Member for Anson  himself  is

concerned,  nobody can doubt, nobody has doubted, and I hope  nobody  will  ever

doubt,  his entire belief in and support of the democratic creed, faith  and  in

the particular form in which we try to administer democracy in this country. But

of  the  others, there have been serious doubts, and listening to today's debate

one  is seriously tempted to believe that whatever doubts one might have had are

all misconceived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Mr Speaker, that the basic objection to clause 29 is this:

that  the fundamental inalienable right of every democratic citizen to say  "no"

to  any  proposition has been denied, and that this clause seeks  to  deny  that

fundamental  inherent right which every citizen in a democracy  should  possess.

Now,  while  subscribing to that theory, I wonder whether in every  circumstance

and  in  every  manifestation  of the democratic  workings  of  a  parliamentary

democracy,  that is always so. Democracy is practised in Europe, in  Canada,  in

Australia, and in various parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, where I was

about   a  month  ago,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  the  opportunity  to   meet

Parliamentarians  from the House of Commons who are not quite so  familiar  with

the  workings of democracy in our country. When I mentioned to one of them  that

in Singapore it was not merely a question of a right to vote but a duty to vote,

that  the  right  to  vote  in  Singapore has been converted  into  a  duty,  an

inescapable duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 656</b></font><br><br>



to  vote he was horrified. "Oh, that is not right," he said. "How could  you  do

that?  How  could you force anybody to go to the polls if he does not want  to?"

That is a point of view, Mr Speaker, which has to be respected. And perhaps  in

the  context  of parliamentary democracy in the United Kingdom, it  is  correct.

Now,  no  Member of the United Kingdom Parliament could say that the  Australian

Parliamentarians  are less democratic than the United Kingdom  Parliamentarians.

And  yet in Australia the right to vote has been converted into a duty to  vote.

And  we here in Singapore started off by saying that there could only be a right

to  vote  and not a duty to vote. Now, because of the political conditions  that

prevail  here and of the various reasons which, if not looked after, would  have

wrecked  the  parliamentary democratic system, the right to vote  was  converted

into  a  duty to vote. I mention this, Mr Speaker, Sir, to show that  sometimes

what  one  conceives  to  be  a democratic right has  to  be  converted  into  a

democratic duty in order to save the democratic system.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a duty, Mr Speaker. Sir, then

no  question  of  a right to abstain arises. You simply have to do  it,  because

society  in  its own interest has decreed that to preserve itself  each  citizen

must be called upon to do certain things. In those circumstances, it is right to

impose  a  duty on each citizen, and if that citizen does not perform the  duty,

then  he has to pay the consequences. Now this is one instance which I can  cite

to the Member for Thomson where a right has been converted into a duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another case to the learned Member for Anson. I think this would

appeal  to  him. Jury service, Mr Speaker, Sir, It is the right of every  adult

citizen  in the United Kingdom to serve on a jury. When he is called  for  jury

service,  that  right is converted into a duty. He has to do it, unless  he  has

very  good  reasons. He cannot, when he is called upon by the Registrar  of  the

Court  to  serve as a juror, say, "No, no, I do not want to serve." If  he  does

that,  then he has to pay the penalty. If he is chosen as a member of  the  jury

and sits on the jury,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 657</b></font><br><br>



and the Judge poses certain questions to the members of the jury q uestion  A,

question  B,  question C; all facts are in the hands of the jury - it  is  not

the  inalienable right of the juryman to say, "I do not know. I  cannot  make

up  my  mind."  He  has  to make up his mind one way  or  the  other  on  the

questions  that are posed to him. That is his duty. If the jury  return,  and

the  foreman of the jury tells the Judge, "None of us have been able to  make

up  our  minds on the questions that have been posed to us," .the Judge  will

send them back until such time as they have made up their minds. If they  are

difficult,  the  jury will be dismissed and another jury will  be  empanelled

and the same questions will be posed to them until the answers are given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see the situation in this light. An attempt has been

made  by Members of the Barisan Sosialis and by the Member for Anson to  draw

an  analogy between an election and a referendum. It is contended, and  quite

rightly,  that  in an election the citizens have the right to  cast  a  blank

ballot  paper. Mr Speaker, Sir, in my contention, this is a:; it should  be,

because the manner in which the ballot paper is devised, the

manner  in which the elector is called upon to cast his vote is such that he can

only  say  "no"  to a candidate or by saying "yes" to another  candidate.  If

there  are four candidates, and if an elector wants to say "no" to every  one

of  the  four  candidates, he does so by putting in a blank ballot  paper  to

show   that  he  does  not  like  any  of  the  four  candidates.  In   those

circumstances, it is his right to reject all four candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the position the same in a referendum? A referendum, to my mind, is an

entirely different matter. It is on a matter of grave national importance  on

which  the Government go to the electorate. The government of the day  cannot

make  up  its mind. Although it might have ideas about a matter,  it  is  not

quite  sure  of  public reaction. Therefore, it might  on  its  own  put  the

questions to the electorate. And again it might come to the Assembly  or  the

House, as the case may be, and consult it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 658</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us now therefore come nearer home on the question of merger with the Federation. As far as I can make out, no single individual in Singapore

can  or  does  in fact deny that there should be merger with the Federation.  No

single  individual has denied that this merger should be brought  about  at  the

quickest  possible  opportunity.  We might  each  of  us  or  some  of  us  have

differences  of opinion as to the type of merger, or if I may put it  that  way,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, on the quantum of merger. But on the basic and vital question

whether  there  should be merger with the Federation there is no  difference  of

opinion  at  all. In those circumstances. I ask the Member for Thomson  and  the

Member  for Anson to try and look at this, for the moment at least, objectively.

If  the  Member  for Thomson will bear with me for a moment,  his  objection  to

clause  29,  Mr Speaker, is, it seems to me, a completely objective  one:  that

this  clause 29 is not democratic. Never mind the purposes to which it is  being

put. But the clause in itself is undemocratic and as such unacceptable. That  is

his argument. His basic objection to this clause is this. I have listened to the

Member for Thomson with great interest. Time and again he said this: 'If  there

are  unacceptable alternatives posed, then there will be blank votes.' In  other

words,  he  is  suggesting that if the alternatives posed to the electorate  are

unacceptable, then this clause becomes undemocratic, because it then denies  the

right of the voter to say "No" to all the unacceptable alternatives. Now, I  ask

the  Member  for  Thomson  in all seriousness: if it  were  possible  to  devise

acceptable alternatives

- I  repeat it again - if it were possible to devise acceptable alternatives, would

the objection to clause 29 disappear on the arguments-

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I think we have made

it  very  clear that whether there is to be one question, two questions  or  two

alternatives or two unacceptable alternatives, the right to say "yes" or "no" or

to  abstain  must be there. We have stated quite clearly that the  objection  is

because, in the first place, the extent of choice is limited, and, in the second

place, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 659</b></font><br><br>



right  of  free  choice is interfered with by clause 29. Our  objection  to

that  clause  is  not just because there are going to be  two  unacceptable

alternatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I believe the Member for Thomson and I are getting

closer

to each other on this particular issue.

I  think  we  are nearing the point of agreement on this particular  issue,

Sir,

if  not  on  the  other issues. On this particular issue of clause  29,  it

appears that

we  are  getting closer to understanding each other than was  possible  two

days  ago. It seems, therefore, that if it were possible by some  skill  to

devise  some  acceptable  alternatives, then it appears  to  me  that  the

objections,  of  the Member for Thomson at least - I do not  know  about  the

Member  for Queenstown - but certainly those of the Member for Thomson  would

appear not to be so violent-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Clause 29 - what

will come of it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you see the difficulties we get into.

Because  of  this  perpetual contest between the  P.A.P. and  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  nothing  is ever looked at objectively or  on  its  merits.  The

Barisan  Sosialis are asking, what is behind clause 29? And the P.A.P. are

asking,  what  is behind the Barisan amendment? Each one in an  attempt  to

outwit the other produces clauses which sometimes astound the rest of us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Leading Machiavellian in front of us!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown has been very quiet until

he suddenly wakes up! I am

wondering whether he is following the speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, possibly this is the moment for me to answer the Member

for  Thomson  on certain matters raised by him. He attacked  my  colleague,

the  Member  for Cairnhill, as being somewhat Machiavellian in his  speech.

He  also  attacked the Singapore People's Alliance for what they  had  said

outside  this Assembly in its attack on clause 29 and what the  Member  for

Cairnhill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 660</b></font><br><br>



has now said vis-a-vis clause 29. Perhaps the Member for Thomson will forgive me

if  I  use  his own argument. Once the Member for Thomson is satisfied that  the

questions posed are acceptable, then the objections to clause 29, from  his  own

point of view, disappear. Now, if that were correct in his own case, I think  he

should  concede  that  that  should be correct even with  the  S.P.A.  What  the

Singapore People's Alliance were worried about a week ago or before this  debate

commenced  was whether the questions that were to be posed would be  brought  to

this  Assembly and whether, in the view of the Singapore People's Alliance,  the

questions  would  be fair and reasonable. If, in the opinion  of  the  Singapore

People's Alliance, the questions were exhaustive, fair and reasonable, naturally

their  objections to clause 29 would disappear, in the same way as the objection

of the Member for Thomson to the clause would disappear. So why then-



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Thomson should try to restrain

himself.  He will be given another opportunity, if not today, then tomorrow,  to

expand on what he means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Even the Member for Thomson will admit that. If the arguments are

cogent  so far as he is concerned, I think the same argument must logically  and

reasonably apply to us. That is the situation in which we find ourselves  today.

The  Government have now made a statement - in fact, they have put in a  motion - to

the  effect that they are going to pose two alternatives. I think the Member for

Cairnhill  has given notice that he thinks a third one should be posed.  At  the

appropriate time, Mr Speaker, Sir, we will move the amendment to the motion. We

hope  that the Government will accept it. If the Government accept that  motion,

from  the  point  of view of the Singapore People's Alliance, all  the  possible

acceptable  alternatives which should go to the electorate  will  be  there.  It

could  be  that  from  the  Barisan Sosialis point  of  view  it  might  not  be

acceptable. Then it is up to them to pose the alternatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 661</b></font><br><br>



which they think are acceptable. If all the possible alternatives that could  be

agreed upon by the Assembly are then posed to the electorate, then I do not  see

why the electorate should not answer "yes" to one of the questions posed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is not allowed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If all the possible acceptable alternatives have been posed, Mr

Speaker,  Sir  -  I would remind the Member for Anson of this  phrase  which  is

familiar  to all of us - we have to cater for a reasonable man, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

not to a weak and vacillating man that cannot make up his mind. That is all that

one  can reasonably be expected to do. The questions must be posed in such a way

that a reasonable man will understand them and will not be puzzled by them. That

is  all  the  obligation  that exists on the person who poses  any  question  or

questions.  If the questions are posed in that reasonable manner,  three,  four,

five  or  six - as many as the Assembly thinks are necessary - and if those are  the

only  possible alternatives to this question of merger, surely there can he  and

must  be one answer. There cannot be six "noes", Mr Speaker, Sir, It could then

be  completely unreasonable. That is assuming that the six possible alternatives

have  been posed. If the only possible alternatives have been posed, surely  one

must be in a position to answer.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is as I see the problem. I do not say that this should

normally apply in every referendum. But in this particular referendum we are  in

the  happy position of all political Parties and all Singaporeans saying we must

have  merger. For if we had not reached this position, a solution by  way  of  a

referendum might have been extremely difficult, because then you would have  had

to  pose  the  different  types of association which one  could  want  with  the

Federation. The attempt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 662</b></font><br><br>



to  get an answer to that,and having got an answer to that to go on from that to

other  matters  would  have become practically impossible on  a  referendum.  So

having agreed that merger is the base to which we all are firmly anchored,  from

that  base we then go on to all the possible acceptable alternatives which could

be  put;  and  if  all such possible alternatives are put, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

myself, as a reasonable man, do not see why one of those should not be picked.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I intend to be brief. But I cannot let the impression of undoubted ability in advocacy give one a completely false view of the

basic facts. We have witnessed an exquisite piece of special pleading done  with

charm,  if I may say so with respect, Sir. Now, let us come to the meat of  what

the  Member for Farrer Park says. He says that when the right to vote becomes  a

duty  to  vote, then the right to abstain ceases to exist. Fortunately, Sir,  he

saw the fallacy of it and tried to cover up what he knows are the provisions  of

section 41, subsection (1) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance which

provide,  in the words of his own leader, the Member for Cairnhill,  though  you

are compelled to go to the booth you are not required to mark your voting paper.

That  is  nothing  illegal or improper. He says he does  recognise  that  in  an

election  there  is a right to reject because you are only given  four  or  five

alternative  candidates. Then he refers us to a jury. Here, if you  will  permit

me,  Mr  Speaker, he says in a jury, the jurymen have no right  to  abstain.  I

would like to tell you a little story, and a perfectly true one. Around the year

1934, the first and only time that I served as a juror, I happened to be foreman

of  the jury in a case of acid throwing where the accused had thrown acid on his

wife's lover and burnt his nose and his fingers. Well, we got into the jury room

and  I said, "It should be very simple. Are we all agreed he is guilty?" and one

man  started  on a religious track. It sounded like a religious track,  Sir.  He

said, "The Lord sayeth, 'Judge not and thou shall not be judged,' and it is  not

for us to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 663</b></font><br><br>



judge."  I  got rather angry about that and I said, "You are on the  jury."

So  I  went back to the court and asked of the Judge what was I to do with

this  person's vote? How would I record him, because he had not said  'aye'

and  he had not said 'nay'. The direction of the Court was that where there

was  a  juror who refused to come down on the side of "guilty" he  must  be

deemed to be voting "not guilty". That was the only

jury on which I served, and that was a case of a man who refused to vote because

it  turned out he had religious scruples - 'Judge not, and thou shall not  be

judged.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park pleaded that we should look at this clause

objectively.  By  all  means,  Sir.  He  says  that  if  all  the  acceptable

alternatives  could  possibly be posed after having  been  debated  in  the

Assembly,  then objectively is it not right? If the voter having heard  all

the  possible alternatives discussed in the Assembly, having understood all

the  alternatives, does not want any of them, that is  why  he  puts  in  a

blank  paper,  and to suggest - and this is what the Member for  Farrer  Park

glossed  over - that after having heard all the arguments,  and  particularly

the  Government's  arguments, when a man casts a blank paper  it  shall  be

deemed  to  be  in  favour  of the Government, that  is  the  crux  of  the

dishonesty; because, forgive me for making a very short repetition,  if  he

did  want the Government proposal, there was nothing simpler than  to  mark

his  cross  against  it, or if he is not allowed a cross,  to  do  whatever

tortuous act the Government seeks that we should do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great deal of merit in the Member for Hong Lim's

proposal  that those who cast blank papers shall be deemed to be  unwilling

to  accept;  it  goes against the grain for me though  to  permit  a  blank

paper, however unusual the circumstances, to have any value at all. If  you

will  see  my  amendment,  I  have  said  that  the  proposals  are  either

unacceptable  or  he  does not understand the instructions.  Because,  Sir,

nowhere in the world, and that is one of the answers to the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 664</b></font><br><br>



Farrer Park, nowhere in any of the legislation into which we have researched

- and we have ransacked the legislation of some 13 countries, Sir; - we have sought

and  obtained  the  assistance of the Diplomatic Corps to  a  very  considerable

extent - can you find a provision like this clause which permits the Government to

reap votes which are cast because they do not want the proposals that are before

them, in essence, although some of them, because of their ignorance, may well be

unaware of the exact means of voting. It is not a question, as the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Prime Minister has said, of a child who does not know  whether

he wants meat and does not know whether he wants fish and so he says, "Papa, you

decide  for me." That is fair enough. But here he has heard the virtues of  meat

extolled,  the virtues of fish extolled, and he could have chosen. But  he  does

not  want either, Sir. Maybe he is an incipient vegetarian. That is the  answer.

Now,  in  order to make his very smooth argument to cover the unhappy volte-face

of  the S.P.A. from their vigorous and manly words in Select Committee, when  we

had  the Member for Cairnhill fighting shoulder to shoulder with us in the cause

of  decency,  and  their  present incapacity to make up their  minds  they  will

abstain.  There is a delightful book by Peter Ustinov in which he  ticks  off  a

Russian diplomat. He says, "I am in two minds - one mind says 'yes' and the  other

mind  says 'no', and the two minds are equally strong and in between I abstain."

This  responsible Party of strong-minded, public-spirited gentlemen and lady - and

in  fairness to the lady, I would say that I have, in fact, found her very often

on the side of fairness and decency - but let us go on to the boast of the leader

of  this Party. He says they are a responsible Party. His colleague says this is

a  very good clause. He himself voted against it and now I understand the entire

Party is going to abstain. I cannot but express deep regret that in the field of

politics  we should have these changes which confuse the public image.  However,

to go back to the merits. May I remind the Member for Farrer Park



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 665</b></font><br><br>



-     the Prime Minister being present; it is all the more appropriate - that  the

Prime  Minister has repeatedly told us that if we ask each individual  voter  of

the  624,000  voters  in Singapore what kind of merger he  wants,  we  will  get

624,000 different types of merger. According to the Prime Minister himself,  not

one or two or three or four. So if we are to get 624,000 types of merger and  it

is  hardly  appropriate  for us to conceive or attempt to  conceive  of  a  plan

whereby all these types can be put to the electorate, is it not fair to leave  a

provision  whereby they can say yes or no? That is the crux,  that  having  been

defeated,  all  the  rest is sham. But it is more than sham here  it  is  parti

cularly horrible, Sir, because if in fact the questions have been discussed  and

decided  in the Assembly, the voter should know whether he wants it, and  if  he

wants it he can vote for it. But the Member for Farrer Park refuses to face  it.

He  says that in putting blank papers in, the majority of those voters, in fact,

are  saying,  "We do not like these options." "Where is the logic  of  it?",  he

asks.  Now,  let us look at the two questions posed by the Prime  Minister.  The

Member  for Farrer Park says that if all the acceptable alternatives are  put - it

is  a  very  large  "if"; if we count all the grains of sand in  the  world - what

objection  can there be? But here we have got two already. Will the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  not recognise that the way they are posed leaves  a  very  unhappy

lacuna and leaves the question open as to what those alternatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 666</b></font><br><br>



mean?  We  have had one alternative - the P.A.P. proposals - spelt  out,  but  the

Prime  Minister respelt it out by putting in education and labour. Then we  have

had  another  proposal which is as a constituent State under the  constitutional

documents - whatever that might mean

- but  it  leaves  completely blank the issue as to citizenship,  it  leaves  completely unfilled the picture. The Member for Farrer Park must be conscious  that

if  questions  are  posed  in  a manner where different  people  may  understand

different things, that question is not acceptable and can never be acceptable. I

will  say, Sir, that if, in fact, there is precision in the amendment to the  motion

suggested  by the Member for Cairnhill, he will have my  support  that  a

further  proposal  will be as indicated by the Member for  Cairnhill,  that  the

terms should be no less favourable-
