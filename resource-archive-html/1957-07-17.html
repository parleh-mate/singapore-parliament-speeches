<div align="center"><b>(Assents to Bills passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received three messages from

His Excellency the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first message dated the 25th June, 1957,

states that, in accordance with the provisions  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second message dated the 5th July, 1957,

states  that,  in  accordance with  the  aforesaid

provisions,  His Excellency had reserved  for  the

signification  of  Her  Majesty's   pleasure   the

following Bills : -





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Muslims Bill;

informs me that, having received instructions from

Her   Majesty  through  the  Secretary  of   State

authorising him to do so, His Excellency had  that

day  assented  to  the following Bill,  which  was

passed  by  the Legislative Assembly on  the  22nd

May, 1957:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divorce (Amendment) Bill.

<div align="center"><b>PRESENTATION STONE FROM PALACE OF WESTMINSTER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members will recollect

that   at  a  ceremony  held  at  the  Palace   of

Westminster on the 15th day of December, 1955, the

Secretary  of  State for the Colonies,  the  Right

Honourable  Alan  Lennox-Boyd, on  behalf  of  Her

Majesty's  Government, handed to  our  then  Chief

Minister,  Mr  David Marshall, a piece  of  stone

salvaged from the damage inflicted on the Victoria

Tower  in  the Palace of Westminster by air  raids

during  the last war. The Chief Minister  accepted

the  gift on behalf of the Government of Singapore

and I duly received it from the Chief Minister  on

behalf  of  Members  of  this  Assembly  for   its

incorporation in the fabric of this building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has now been done. The Stone lies embedded in

the wall behind the entrance to the Strangers

Gallery with the inscription : -



<pre>

<div align="center">



"FROM THE FABRIC OF THE<br>

VICTORIA TOWER OF THE<br>

PALACE OF WESTMINSTER<br>

PRESENTED BY<br>

HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT<br>

TO<br>

THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT<br>

15TH DECEMBER, 1955."<br>



</div>

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reporting the gift to this Assembly, the Chief

Minister referred to it as a "symbolic gesture  of

friendship and unity between the two Assemblies of

Westminster and Singapore in the traditions of the

democratic process".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say further that I would like to think of

the  Stone itself as a constant reminder  of  that

tradition  of  free and orderly debate  "garnered"

over the centuries in Westminster, the pattern  of

which  we  have adopted and are in the process  of

adapting for our purposes here in our Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>DR BENHAM'S ECONOMIC SURVEY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland</b> asked the Chief

Minister  why the report of Dr F. C. Benham,  the

Economic  Adviser  to  the Chief  Minister,  of  a

survey  conducted by him of the economic  position

of Singapore during 1956 which was reviewed in the

local  press on 28th June, 1957, was  not  in  the

first   instance  presented  to  the   Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the report referred to was  made  to

the  Chief  Minister by his Economic  Adviser.  It

attempts  to  estimate progress made  in  economic

fields  since 1954. It does not in any way contain

any  statement of policy. There is nothing in  the

Standing   Orders  of  the  Legislative   Assembly

requiring that such report should be presented  to

the  Legislative Assembly before it  can  be  made

public.  The  report has since  been  printed  and

copies  have  been  furnished to  Members  of  the

Legislative Assembly as a matter of courtesy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BODYGUARDS FOR MINISTERS AND COST TO GOVERNMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Minister

which of the Ministers and Assistant Ministers are

provided   with  bodyguards;  why  are  bodyguards

necessary for them; the dates from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



which bodyguards were supplied to each Minister or

Assistant  Minister concerned;  and  the  cost  of

these  bodyguards  to  the  public  funds  of  the

Colony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Commissioner of Police is responsible for ensuring

the  personal safety of Ministers and it would not

be in the public interest to disclose the measures

taken  by  the  Commissioner in his discretion  to

carry  out  this  duty.  No  additional  cost   is

involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Apart from bodyguards, can the

Chief  Minister tell us whether there  are  police

constables  attached  to  or  guarding  houses  of

Ministers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It would appear, Sir, that the

hon.  Member finds difficulty in understanding  my

answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S POST</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Minister

when the Government intends to Malayanise the post

of Attorney-General.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the post of

Attorney-General together with the posts of  Chief

Secretary  and Financial Secretary will  disappear

under  the  new constitution when it is introduced

next  year. If, in the meantime, the post  should

fall vacant, as happened recently, then it will be

filled  in  accordance with the  ordinary  service

principles   of  qualifications,  experience   and

merit. This is in accordance with the Government's

policy  on  Malayanisation as set out in Sessional

Paper  No. Cmd. 65 of 1956 on page 9 of  which  it

was  stated  that Malayanisation of  the  post  of

Attorney-General   was   dependent    on    future

constitutional changes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Minister aware

that  under the new constitutional proposals,  the

Attorney-General becomes the Advocate-General? Can

we  not  just say the Permanent Secretary  to  the

Minister for Law?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I said, Sir, that the post of

Attorney-General will be abolished under  the  new

constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If the Chief Minister does not

refute  what  I  said, is he  not  aware  that  by

promoting  an  expatriate to  that  post  for  the

temporary period between now and the next  general

elections, he is in fact enhancing the  amount  of

compensation to be paid to this expatriate officer

who will be abolished under the new constitution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it has been explained

that  the  filling of the vacancy created  by  the

retirement  of  the previous Attorney-General  was

filled   in  accordance  with  the  Malayanisation

policy  as set out in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  65

of 1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ACTIVITIES OF PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether he has taken steps to investigate

the   activities   of   private   employment

exchanges;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he is aware of any complaints made

to  the  Police  against private  employment

exchanges; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether he has taken or will take steps to

protect the public from exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, the activities of the

employment  exchanges  have been  investigated  by

officers of the Labour Department on an unofficial

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to (b) and (c) of the hon. Member's

question, I would refer him to the answer  I  gave

to  a  similar  question he asked on  24th  April,

1957. I have nothing to add to the reply I made on

that occasion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BENEFIT TO SINGAPORE OF ATTENDING RECENT I.L.O.</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONFERENCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



benefit    will   Singapore   derive   from    his

participation in the recent I.L.O. conference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the I.L.O.

is  the  first specialised agency associated  with

the  United  Nations and deals with  international

labour and social problems; the main aim being  to

provide a world labour-management government forum

in  which problems of social policy of concern  to

all  countries are discussed. There are  about  80

countries  represented. This  year  is  the  third

occasion  that  Singapore has been invited  and  I

took the opportunity to attend this conference  in

order to explain our views. At this conference and

indeed  at  all  such conferences,  Ministers  for

Labour from many countries attended. This afforded

me   opportunities  of  contacts  with  them   for

personal  discussions  on  policies  and  problems

relating to labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DISSATISFACTION OF SPECIAL CONSTABULARY MEMBERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Wong Foo Nam</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether   he   is   aware  of   the   feeling   of

dissatisfaction  among  members  of  the   Special

Constabulary  with their terms and  conditions  of

service;  and whether the Government is taking  or

will take steps to improve them.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Yes, Sir. I am aware that

some  members of the Special Constabulary are  not

entirely  satisfied with their terms  of  service.

Those  terms of service are being reviewed and  I

am  hopeful  that it will be possible to  make  an

announcement on the matter pretty soon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LAND BAILIFFS-CLASSFICATIONS AND DUTIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Chief Secretary-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether Government Land Bailiffs have been

classified as clerks; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) what are the duties of a Land Bailiff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The answer to (a) is yes, Sir. The

answer  to  (b) is: the main responsibility  of  a

Land  Bailiff is the supervision of Crown land  in

the fields.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does a

clerk do the work that has just been described?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter for argument.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>IMBALANCED LAND OFFICE ACCOUNTS-IMPLEMENTATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF RECOMMENDATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he has taken

or    will    take   steps   to   implement    the

recommendations  in  paragraph  6  of  the  Second

Report   from   the   Public  Accounts   Committee

(Sessional Paper No. L.A. 8 of 1957) in respect of

the  state of imbalance in the Land Office control

accounts;   and   whether,  in   particular,   the

investigation team recommended in paragraph 6  (a)

of the Report has been set up and is now at work.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> The answer is

yes, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST HOUSES SYSTEM OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ALLOCATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing  if  he  will

make a statement on the details of the system  for

the  allocation  of  Singapore  Improvement  Trust

accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  informed by the Singapore Improvement

Trust  that it has been decided to publish in  the

near  future  a  pamphlet  explaining  the  points

system  and  the  method of  allocation  of  Trust

accommodation for the information of  the  general

public. In the circumstances, I do not propose  to

anticipate  the Trust pamphlet by a  statement  in

this Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST HOUSES INSPECTION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS REGISTER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing if he is aware

that  the  register of applications for  Singapore

Improvement  Trust accommodation is not  open  for

inspection  by  the public, and  whether  he  will

explain why.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I am aware,

Sir,   that  the  register  of  applications   for

Singapore Improvement Trust accommodation  is  not

open  for public inspection. I am informed by  the

Board  that  the  reason for  this  is  that  each

application contains information of a private  and

personal  nature which was given by the applicants

on   the  understanding  that  it  would  be  kept

confidential  and  it  would therefore  be  highly

undesirable to make this information available for

public inspection. I am further informed that  the

general practice among housing authorities is  not

to  make  their  registers  available  for  public

inspection  although each applicant is at  liberty

to enquire about his prospects of success. This of

course applies in the case of the Trust also.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  tell  us  why is it  that  the  register

cannot  be  open  for  inspection?  It  is  not  a

question of asking details of the register; it  is

a  question  of the number of applicants  and  the

points awarded to each applicant.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from

the undesirability of disclosing information given

confidentially   by   applicants,   the   register

contains  other confidential information including

reports  of  investigations by Trust officers  and

the  final points awarded to the applicants  as  a

result  of  such  reports. The register  comprises

approximately  11,500 files and the administrative

arrangements needed to create a register  suitable

for  inspection  by the public would  considerably

hamper  the  work of the department concerned  and

would increase management costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Minister tell us

whether  the Trust can prepare a separate register

apart  from  the number of files that are  in  the

office  so  that  applicants  could  ask  for  the

opening  of  that register rather than  the  files

concerned?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> I think I have answered that,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> The reply, Sir, is 'No'. In

view of the Government's decision to hold the City

Council elections in December this year, it was  a

matter of urgency that the boundaries of electoral

divisions for the City Council elections should be

delimited in order that the electoral rolls can be

prepared   and   that  all  the  other   statutory

requirements can be fulfilled before the elections

in  December.  For  example, it is  necessary  for

claims  and objections on revision of the register

to   be   proceeded  with  in  August.  The  local

government   boundaries  were  delimited   by   an

official   committee  taking  into  account   such

factors as population, voters' strength as well as

community  interest. Government has  accepted  the

recommendations of these boundaries in  toto.  The

boundaries have, in fact, already been referred to

the  All-Party Committee to give it an opportunity

of  discussing them in relation to the Legislative

Assembly electoral divisions.

<div align="center"><b>SHORTAGE OF WATER IN RURAL AREAS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing whether he  is

aware that the people in rural areas have been and

are  suffering hardships from lack of  water;  and

whether  he  will  take steps to  alleviate  their

hardships.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of

the need for increasing the supply of water to

people in the rural areas and my Ministry has taken

and will continue to take steps to increase such

supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Coalition Government took office in

April,  1955,  there  were  all  in  all  only  213

standpipes in the rural areas of Singapore.  Today,

the    rural   areas   of   Singapore   have    347

standpipes - 134 more than when this Government  took

office.  In  addition,  39  more  which  have  been

approved  by the Rural Board are in the process  of

being  installed.  In  money  terms  in  1954   for

example, less than $450,000 were allocated  by  the

Rural   Board  for  water  supply.  In  1956,   the

allocation  is  slightly more  than  $1  million - an

increase  of  approximately 222 per cent  over  the

1954 figure. This year, the Rural Board intends  to

step  up  its  expenditure  in  this  direction  to

approximately $1,170,000. Both in money  terms  and

in  terms of the number of standpipes built, it can

be  seen that my Ministry acting through the  Rural

Board has greatly increased its efforts to meet the

demand  for  water supply in the  rural  areas.  In

addition to what I have just said, the Rural  Board

also  operates a scheme to supply water  by  wagons

during  dry  periods  to  outlying  villages  where

standpipes   are  not  available.  In   1956,   the

expenditure  in  this connection was  approximately

$58,000.

<div align="center"><b>PROGRESS IN UNIFYING PASSENGER TRANSPORT SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Works   with   reference   to

paragraph  10  of the White Paper (Sessional  Paper

No.  Cmd. 48 of 1956), what progress has been  made

in  the implementation of the various stages of the

Government's  policy  of  unifying  the   passenger

transport system; what stages remain to be  carried

out; and on what dates will they be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member will recall that in paragraph 8 of the White

Paper,   Government  agreed  with   the   principal

conclusions  of the Hawkins Commission  which  were

summarised in Chapter 27 of the report.  The  first

matter   for   decision   was   therefore   whether

preparations   should  be  made  for   the   direct

establishment  of public ownership by  means  of  a

specially  constituted public authority or  whether

as   an  intermediate  step  the  formation  of   a

statutory limited liability company should be aimed

at.  On this, the following progress has been made.

Enquiries   have  been  made  as  to  whether   the

necessary  capital for the formation of a statutory

limited   liability  company  was  likely   to   be

forthcoming   from   an   overseas   company   with

experience  of  transport  administration  as   was

suggested in paragraph 234 of the report. It  soon,

however,   became  apparent  that  a   satisfactory

solution  was  unlikely from  such  a  source.  Mr

Hawkins himself then held a series of personal  and

informal  discussions with members of  the  Chinese

Bus  Owners' Association. These members at one time

showed considerable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>



interest in the idea of amalgamation into a single

company  but the present indications are that  the

Chinese  bus  owners  are  not  yet  prepared   to

amalgamate  into  a  single  company.  They  have,

however, undertaken to prepare and submit to me  a

memorandum  containing alternative  proposals  for

amalgamation.  I  understand that this  memorandum

can be expected at any time. The proposals will be

carefully  examined and the Government  will  then

decide  whether  the alternative  of  a  statutory

limited  liability company must be abandoned  and,

if  so,  the pace at which unification  through  a

public  authority should be pursued. This decision

will be taken in the very near future and it would

be  made in the light of the demands made by other

important development projects on the funds likely

to be available in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stages which remain to be carried out will, of

course,  depend on the decision to  which  I  have

just  referred.  They will vary according  to  the

choice  made. I do not think at this stage  I  can

give any very useful information about them but  I

can,  however,  say  that  in  the  event  of  the

decision   being  taken  to  establish  a   public

authority,  the first step will be the acquisition

of  the  Singapore Traction company  and  we  have

commissioned accountants, with the concurrence  of

the company, to examine the records of the company

and  to submit a report which will form the  basis

of  any  subsequent negotiations for  acquisition.

The accountants have been pressed to complete this

report  as soon as possible. I am waiting to  hear

from them when the report may be expected. We have

also anticipated the event by making a first draft

of  the legislation which will be required for the

purposes  of  establishing a public authority.  In

the meantime, the statement in paragraph 10 of the

White  Paper  (that the assumption  by  a  unified

undertaking  of responsibility for  operating  any

bus  services  in Singapore will not  be  possible

before the middle of 1958) still stands.

1,373  acres of the Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve  for

prawn  cultivation. An application was made by  my

Ministry  to the Nature Reserve Board on the  13th

of February, 1957, but the Chairman replied on the

6th of June that the Board would not recommend nor

agree  to  the excision of the Ulu Pandan  Reserve

for  this  purpose.  On  this  the  Trustees  were

unanimous. No progress has therefore been made  in

expanding prawn cultivation in the Ulu Pandan area

because  of  this  unanimous opposition  from  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (b) is that the view of the Nature

Reserve Board on my efforts to seek the release of

1,373  acres of the Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve  for

prawn  cultivation is that nature conservation  is

more  important to the community than the  use  of

this  swamp  for  the proposed prawn  cultivation:

Singapore's flora and fauna must be preserved  and

therefore the Board is unanimous in its opposition

to my proposal.

<div align="center"><b>ARCHITECTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recollect that in June of

last  year, they gave their unanimous approval  to

the scale of fees which was fixed by the Board  of

Architects  and brought to them for  approval  and

that in dealing with that scale of fees I referred

also  to an Architects (Amendment) Ordinance which

we  at  that time proposed but which was withdrawn

as  the  life  of the Assembly was then  extremely

uncertain. In referring to these fees,  I  pointed

out  that  the changes in the scale of  fees  were

only one stage in a general reassessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, certain aspects arising from the

operation  of  the scale of fees have  called  for

study  and have received study and I now  move  an

Architects (Amendment) Bill which is significantly

different from what we proposed in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 2 we seek to remove from the Board of

Architects the power to fix a scale of fees and  I

think I had better explain the background to  that

a  little because Members may not be fully in  the

picture.  The  argument which  has  been  used  to

justify  a  scale  of fees fixed  under  statutory

powers  is  that the architects in  Singapore  are

required  to  give  a  degree  of  supervision  to

building works which is not required in many other

countries. If hon. Members have in their hands the

1956  scale  of fees, they will note that  it  was

then  laid  down that one-fifth of the total  fees

would  be payable on the completion of the  sketch

plans;  the  balance  up to  two-thirds  when  the

contracts  have  been let; and the remaining  one-third   would  be  paid  by  instalments  as   the

architect from time to time certified progress  to

his  client  for payment to the contractors.  This

implies of course that two-thirds (or 5 per  cent)

of   the  fee  is  appropriate  for  designing   a

structure   and  that  2½  per   cent   is   the

appropriate fee for supervision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>



We are here concerned with the supervision aspect;

that  is  the  aspect on which  the  argument  for

statutory power to fix a scale is based.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision is defined in section 1 of the 1956

scale and was previously defined in the 1932 scale

and it is linked with the local authority by-laws:

No. 20 in the Rural Board, I think it is No. 41 in

the  Municipal by-laws and deriving from a section

of the Municipal Ordinance. Briefly, the effect of

this is that the person who is responsible as  the

architect  must certify that the contractors  have

observed  the  by-laws during the building  works.

The  by-laws are now under revision and I am  told

that the revision will strengthen that requirement

that  the  certification is given by the architect

to  the local authority that the local authority's

requirements have been complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we all agree, Mr Speaker, that it is very

important that buildings should be good  and  made

of  good  materials. We must  avoid  the  sort  of

defects  which caused the Opposition  to  rise  in

some  irritation  to  try  and  stop  me  when   I

enumerated  a lengthy list of defects  during  the

Budget   debate  last  year.  Such   defects   are

obviously  undesirable  and  they  do   arise   if

insufficient  supervision is  given.  If  we  have

unsatisfactory buildings going up in Singapore, it

is  a very bad thing for the final occupiers,  who

are  saddled with a house which involves a lot  of

repairs and expense and worry and which may have a

much  shorter life than they had hoped  when  they

put  their money into it. Of course, it is also  a

serious  liability  to  the  country  if  we  have

unsatisfactory  buildings  going   up.   We   have

probably   a  considerable  shortage  of   skilled

manpower   to   do  building,  some  shortage   of

materials  sometimes  and shortage  of  money  for

spending  on capital development; and  if  private

development  is  of  a  low or  an  unsatisfactory

standard,  then  to that degree, scarce  resources

are  being wastefully used. That would be  a  very

regrettable thing. If there were collusion between

the contractor and the architect, there would be a

grave  danger  to the public interest.  An  unholy

alliance  between  architect  and  contractor,  in

which the architect cuts his fees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>



to  the  client  but  takes a  rake-off  from  the

contractor  in  return for  closing  his  eyes  to

nefarious omissions by the contractor, is a  thing

which should not be tolerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether by removing this scale of

fees  we  shall in fact open the way to  collusion

and   improper  practices  and  thus  weaken   the

position  with  regard  to maintenance  of  proper

building  standards. I do not think that we  shall

open  the  way to collusion. I do not  think  that

removal  will have any significant effect in  that

direction; and I will now give my reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, under the Architects Ordinance, there are

and always have been engineers who were registered

as  architects under the Ordinance  and  who  were

able to function as architects, to sign plans  and

to certify buildings to the local authorities; but

the engineers were not bound by this scale of fees

which  is applicable only to architects. There  is

an  obvious anomaly in this position. The Board of

Architects  has recognised it but they  have  been

guided  by expert legal advice and they  have  not

seen  their  way  to alter it; and  I  think  that

probably it is the case that the general  code  of

conduct laid down by the Board under the Ordinance

appears  not  to apply to engineers  who  register

under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the result of this, Mr Speaker, is that in

private practice in Singapore, there are something

like  72  architects  and 38 engineers  registered

under the Ordinance; and I am informed that in the

period  of  one year from June 1955 to June  1956,

there  were  261 building plans submitted  to  the

City  Council by architects and 123 by engineers - a

proportion  of about two-thirds by architects  and

one-third by engineers. In a major job such  as  a

block of flats, the proportion will be a good deal

higher in the hands of the architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is the actual extent to which the

anomaly exists. There are two ways of dealing with

it. The first is to bring the engineers within the

scale  and within the code of conduct and to bring

them  completely in parity with the architects  in

so far as they are registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



as  architects. That was indeed my first  thought:

the  alternative is to take the architect out from

the  scale and I have chosen that because  if  the

scale  were an essential protection in the  public

interest and if the scale were really necessary to

prevent  collusion and cut-throat competition  and

to  ensure  that proper standards are  maintained,

then we simply have to recognise that in fact  the

scale  has not been operating for a third  of  the

profession.  The  engineering  qualification   has

enabled a very large section of the people who are

actually  functioning  as architects  to  function

outside  the  scale. If it was  going  to  produce

collusion  or  cut-throat  operations, it   would

already  have produced those ill-effects  but  the

Institute  of Architects of Malaya have  shown  no

signs  of being aware that they are threatened  or

being  under-cut by the operations  of  registered

engineers. The Board of Architects has  not  drawn

attention  to  it  and said,  "This  is  producing

disastrous results. We must remove this  anomaly."

The  engineers - the Joint Overseas  Group - have  not

been  worried about it and I am bound  to  presume

from  this  that  the  architects  have  not  felt

themselves threatened nor have the leaders of  the

profession felt their standards threatened by  the

fact  that  that  scale  was largely  ineffective.

There  appears to have been no fear  in  the  past

that  the absence of the scale with regard to one-third of those working as architects had produced,

was  producing or would produce any  serious  ill-effects,  any tendency for the architects  or  the

engineers to yield to temptations to collusive  or

dishonest practices. It is that which leads me  to

think it is a very fair presumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also not wholly satisfied that in all cases

the  scale  is  adhered to by  those  to  whom  it

applies - the registered architects. We  should  not

have to go very far to find cases where a firm  of

architects undertake a charitable job - a  home  for

one sort or another of charitable organisation - and

in  one way or another does not in fact charge the

full  fee.  That  is very laudable  and  admirable

generosity  on  their  part  but  it  defeats  the

intention  of the Ordinance. It is a kick-back  to

the charitable organisation because they have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>



respect for the charitable organisation but it  is

obviously  a  means of defeating the operation  of

the scale fixed by statutory power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told - I cannot produce evidence needed

to  convince  a  court of law - that it  does  occur

sometimes that for an ordinary commercial building

job, a client makes a deal with his architect  for

a  lump sum payment of fee and this is not in  any

way  related to the scale of fees but it  is  just

fixed  to  suit  both parties. In  the  nature  of

things,  nobody  can easily tell whether  that  is

happening  or  not  and  I  do  not  know  of  any

effective machinery at present existing  by  which

one  could detect whether it is happening or  not.

If  you cannot detect breaches of the scale,  then

you  cannot take action to punish breaches of  the

scale  and the scale is in fact a decoration which

appears to provide a protection to the public  but

does  not provide it, The protection lies  in  the

professional pride, competence and standards which

are  maintained  by members of a highly  respected

profession.  The scale appears to put  them  under

penalty  if they fall below their proper standards

but  it does not appear to me that the scale would

be  enforceable if it was necessary  nor  does  it

appear  to  me  to  be  necessary.  I  think  very

strongly that unnecessary or unenforceable control

should  never  be  imposed.  If  they  have   been

imposed, then they should be removed as quickly as

possible and that is what I am seeking to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the removal require a word.

Professional organisations will now have  squarely

in   their   own  hands  the  responsibility   for

maintaining   proper  professional  standards   of

conduct  amongst their members.  I  have  had  the

opportunity  of  discussing this matter  with  the

Institute  of  Architects, Malaya,  and  with  the

Joint Overseas Group of Engineers and we also  had

a  certain amount of correspondence extending over

a  year or so. I am aware of their views and  they

have  said  that they will consider  whether  they

ought  to initiate any further action in order  to

ensure that codes of conduct and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>



standards   of  building  are  maintained   at   a

professional  level. I look forward with  interest

to hearing from the leaders of the profession what

they think is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, although I do not think it is

necessary  or useful or desirable to  retain  this

scale  of fees, I do not want to suggest that  the

maintenance of proper building standards needs  no

further  attention. I think it does  need  further

attention.    We    are    having    very    rapid

development - both private and public development - in

Singapore today. The economic survey reports  show

somewhere  around $100 million worth of investment

in  construction a year; population is rising; the

need  for houses is increasing all the time;  and,

in short, the building industry is being subjected

to new strains and stresses which did not exist in

the  much more spacious and less overcrowded  days

when  most  of  the legislation  and  by-laws  and

machinery of control were designed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government view is that the whole situation

with regard to private building standards needs to

be  examined and the Government is therefore going

to   appoint  a  very  competent  officer,   whose

appointment  is  terminating under Malayanisation,

to  make  a  full study and to report.  This  will

involve paying him a professional fee and I  shall

be  seeking  approval for this  payment  from  the

House  on  another  occasion. I  do  not  wish  to

prejudge in any way the findings which may  appear

in  his report, which I hope will be available  in

about  two  months - possibly a little  longer,  not

more than three months. We shall be quite wrong to

prejudge  what  may appear in the report  but  the

intention  is that the report will give a  general

gathering together of information of all types  on

which it will be possible to judge better how  far

proper building standards are being maintained and

whether  any  action is desirable to  ensure  that

they  are maintained in the future. It is possible

that  in  the general context of the report,  this

scale  of fees which we are now seeking to  remove

may  need  to be considered again. If it was  made

clear  that the scale of fees was a useful  weapon

and that it could effectively be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>



used,  that machinery could be set up which  would

make  it possible to detect breaches of the scale;

then  it should certainly be considered again and,

if  necessary, the weapon should be  sharpened  up

and  brought  into use. So much, Mr Speaker,  for

clause 2 (Scale of Fees).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pass on to clause 3. In clause 3 (a), there

is   a  slight  liberalisation  of  the  means  of

recognition for a young man who is qualified as an

architect;  for  instead  of  having  to  get  his

qualification against a prescribed  list,  he  can

bring  his qualification along and say, "Will  you

approve this qualification?" I do not know if  the

changes  are  profoundly significant but  it  does

liberalise the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are minor punctuation changes and then at

(d),  we  preserve to a single mechanical engineer

who  registered during the last year his  position

as  a  registered person under the Ordinance.  The

amendment (of which Members have had notice that I

propose  to  move, on the Order Paper) which  will

change "July, 1956" to read "July, 1957" in  order

to  preserve to this gentleman a status  which  he

has  acquired and which should not be removed from

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for higher registration fees

and  renewal  fees from those who register.  Those

fees  were  made in the past at a  time  when  the

dollar was worth a great deal more than it is now,

and  it is appropriate that they should be brought

up  in line with the income which an architect can

expect to earn and with the costs which the  Board

may  have  to  incur, for example, in  payment  of

legal expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 removes certain classes of engineering

qualifications. I do not want to go into  them  in

detail but I can do so if the House desires. But I

must  briefly  point  out that  this  is  only  in

relation  to those who wish to practise in  effect

as  architects.  The removal of the qualifications

does  not  mean  that a man cannot practise  as  a

municipal engineer or an electrical engineer or  a

surveyor, it only means that he cannot sign plans,

and  so  on, in relation to the Ordinance and  the

local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



authority requirements. I think in the past it was

probably a sound thing that wherever anybody could

be  held  to  be qualified, he should have  had  a

chance  to  come  in  and help  in  building  work

because there was a shortage of qualified men; but

I  do not think that that shortage exists now.  It

certainly,  I think, will not exist in the  future

with  the large number of students of architecture

and civil engineering who are at present overseas

and  who  will  be returning here in  due  course.

There is no reason to fear a shortage and I do not

think  that our young men or women when they  come

back from a taxing, difficult and expensive course

overseas should be exposed to possible competition

from, say, a surveyor who has abandoned his proper

work  of  surveying and, having registered  as  an

architect,  wishes  in  fact  to  practise  as  an

architect  for  which  he  has  not  really   been

trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point in connection with this, it

sometimes  happens to an electrical or  mechanical

engineer  that in designing a factory  layout,  he

finds it necessary to suggest that some additional

building - say   a   pump-house   or   an    engine-house - should be added to the building; or he needs

to  design a concrete floor on which an engine has

to stand; and it is a very convenient and sensible

thing   that   he   should  be  able,   in   those

circumstances,  to  put his  plans  to  the  local

authority to get them approved and not to have to

run  around and waste his time and everyone else's

getting  an architect to put his chop on  them.  I

should   not  wish  to  stop  the  mechanical   or

electrical  engineer from doing that  as  long  as

that was all he was doing. I have put the point to

the Joint Overseas Group and they are studying it.

I hope they will suggest a reasonable solution but

a  reasonable solution must, to my mind, be in the

terms  that the mechanical or electrical  engineer

is   not  able  to  abandon  his  proper  work  of

mechanical or electrical engineering and  take  up

signing plans for building estates. If we can  get

a  workable solution suggested, we can have a look

at  it  and  see  if we should make  some  further

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of clause 5 opens the door to a

very  valued class of students - those  who  are  at

present  in  Australia taking various  engineering

qualifications which are sufficiently indicated in

the  Explanatory  Note. Hitherto,  on  qualifying,

they  have  of course been able to come  back  and

practise as engineers but they have not been  able

to  register  under the Ordinance. This  will  now

enable  them to register. To put it in very simple

language,  we heartily welcome our young  men  and

women  taking professional qualifications  and  we

are delighted to have them come back again to lend

a hand in Singapore's much needed development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, those are very briefly the main points which I think I have dealt with in regard

to  this  Bill. There are of course a  great  many

other  points  which  are more  or  less  remotely

connected  and if any Member wishes to  have  them

dealt  with, I will be delighted to do the best  I

can  with  them; but I do not think that  we  need

take up the time of the House any further until we

know what hon. Members have in their minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to support this Bill  for  slightly

different  reasons  from  those  that  have   been

expounded to us by the Minister for Communications

and Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief reason, in a short analysis, he has

given  to  us for his wanting to withdraw  support

for  the scale of fees is roughly that this  scale

has  been more honoured by its breach than by  its

observance,  because  firstly,  one-third  of  the

number  of practising architects are not bound  to

observe  the scale and secondly, he has  heard  of

cases where the members who are bound by the scale

do  not  observe it. To my knowledge, Sir, I  also

agree with the second observation that in cases of

very  large  contracts, by some way or other  this

rule  has  not  been  observed by  the  architects

themselves and therefore for this House to support

a rule



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>



that is not fully observed is wrong and to my mind

unworkable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I come into this picture for a very

different  reason. This scale of  fees  was  fixed

about  30  years ago. No doubt, at that time,  the

scale  was 7½ per cent minimum and you could  go

up  sky-high. The only concession that we had been

able  to  obtain through last year's  negotiations

with  the Institute of Architects was the  waiving

of  any  fee  above 7½ per cent. It  may  appear

generous to the architects but, in practice, there

is no generosity at all because since the scale of

fees has been fixed, the cost of building has gone

up  at  least four times. Therefore the  scale  if

applied pre-war would be operating round about  30

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When this scale was

fixed,  no  one  visualised building  projects  of

building   estates,  public  buildings  and   even

private buildings running into millions of dollars

and  when  you come to apply the minimum scale  of

7½ per cent to a project which runs into from $5

million to $10 million, then we get a shock  as  I

am  sure  we  all  did when I queried  during  the

Budget sittings last year the allocation of half a

million  dollars for the Polytechnic. When applied

to this project of $5 million, not only have we to

provide  7½  per cent minimum fee but  there  is

also  another 2 per cent for quantity  survey  and

another  33 1/3 per cent on the value of reinforced

concrete  work which all added together makes  ten

per cent. So ten per cent of $5 million is half  a

million dollars and I for one feel that the public

cannot  be asked to pay such sums which in several

cases  have led to professional men being able  to

retire after three or four years' practice. We  do

welcome  people being well remunerated  for  their

work  but  I  do  not  think that  the  public  of

Singapore will support any scale which will enable

anyone  to retire at public expense, and I say  so

because I can visualise in the future that  we  in

Singapore  and in Malaya will have to depend  more

and  more  on private architects than on  our  own

public servants as the amount of work that has  to

be  done  is  really tremendous. We simply  cannot

recruit  enough men to be able to carry  out  that

work. As it is, we can see the slowing down of the

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>



Improvement Trust. Last year, we built  1,000

units  instead of 4,000 units. This year,  I  think

the  same  thing  will follow and even  our  Public

Works Department has not been able to catch up with

all the projects it has in hand. The only thing  we

have  to  do  now  is  to go  out  to  the  private

architect and ask him to do the work for  us.  When

we  do that, what happens to us? Yes, the scale  is

7½ per cent minimum. Whereas private persons have

been  able to make the architects depart from  this

scale,  the Government will have to pay that  scale

because this Assembly last June approved it. I must

say  that I was away at that time on leave. Are  we

going to support this rule? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: what I am very much

against  the  scale is the minimum  five  per  cent

withdrawal  fee. I will just cite one  instance;  I

know of several where a grave injustice was caused.

A friend of mine bought a house and he wanted it to

be  renovated. So he went to an architect and asked

him to produce plans to enlarge the house. When the

plans  were  submitted to him, he found  that  they

were very poor plans and he did not like them.  The

estimated cost of renovation ran into $80,000. Then

he  said, "No, no. Let us just forget about it." He

forgot  about it but he received a bill for  $4,000

and  that  was a bill based on a scale on which  he

had to pay. If he went to court, he would have lost

the  case. There are other instances but they  will

take  too long a time. Therefore I and my Party  do

support  the  amendment to section 2 by withdrawing

our support altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to clause 5 of the Bill. The

Explanatory  Note says that certain  qualifications

obtained   in  Australia  are  now  going   to   be

recognised  here to enable Malayans who hold  these

degrees to practise. That, Sir, I think, is a  very

good  move,  it has been very long overdue  but  it

does not go far enough. I am now speaking for those

of  our  Malayans  who  are holding  qualifications

obtained  in  foreign institutions,  qualifications

which in New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>



responsible  for the building of huge  skyscrapers,

ten  times what we have in Singapore, and  yet  not

one of them has been allowed to be registered as an

architect.  I have seriously considered  moving  an

amendment  to  the  Bill but on going  through  the

Architects Ordinance, I find that under section  6,

there  is provision for the Board of Architects  to

register  any  person who shall satisfy  the  Board

that  he  is fully qualified for having received  a

proper and recognised training in the profession of

architecture.  To us who are not  members  of  this

profession,  we wonder why it is that  not  one  of

these people is good enough. I refer to the ones  I

have  mentioned  as  being  able  to  put  up  skyscrapers, a hundred storeys high. Particularly more

so  when  I know that at least the applications  of

ten  people who have been qualified either  in  the

United  States of America or Hong Kong have applied

for  registration (some of them applied as long  as

two  years ago) are still being considered. Sir,  I

would  urge the Institute of Architects to consider

very rapidly the question of admitting these people

to  practise,  otherwise, rightly or  wrongly,  the

public  will form the impression that this honoured

body  of  professional men is unwilling to move  or

change  with  the times as has happened  over  this

question of minimum fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, I agree with the hon. Minister

when he said that we have to be careful to see that

our  buildings are not shoddily built and I for one

am  prepared to support any realistic scale with  a

reducing  minimum  after  the  first  $100,000   or

$200,000 when it is presented to us, because  I  do

feel   that  an  honourable  profession   like   an

architect's profession should not be subject to cut-throat rates; but let us have a realistic scale and

not  one  under  which a man can  retire  in  three

years' time.



<br><br>11.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  I am the only architect in this House,  I

feel  I  have to say something on this Bill  or  at

least to express my personal opinion on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is such a law in any part of the world as regards the question of minimum fees, that is, clause 4 of the Bill. I have made enquiries from the Federation, Hongkong and other parts of the world. I have found no evidence that

they  have such a law in those countries. In fact,

a  Minister  in the Federation told  me  that  the

Board  of Architects in the Federation have  tried

to  introduce that clause for the last five  years

and  that  every  time it went  to  the  Executive

Council, it was thrown out. Although such a law is

not in existence in the Federation or in Hongkong,

I believe that they have less badly constructed or

tilted buildings than we have in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance, I believe, was introduced in 1926

by  a  number  of  people, mostly  qualified  from

abroad.  They  must have come together  and  said,

"Since  we are only a few here, why do we not  try

to  extort  as much as possible from the  public?"

That  was their view then and I think that is  the

view  that is being adopted now. When this  matter

was  discussed  in  the Institute  of  Architects,

Malaya, one of its members said, "Why should we go

home  empty-handed? Why cannot we make  hay  while

the  sun  shines?" That is the attitude  they  are

adopting.  Those  so-called big firms  which  have

been  advocating  that  they  should  retain   the

minimum  charge  knowing very well  that  the  big

projects of Government will go to them because the

advisers  are their friends. The fee  of  $800,000

for  the Polytechnic is equal to 20 years'  salary

of  the  Chief Minister. Is that not a shame  that

this kind of robbery is allowed to go on?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Hear, hear.

Down with the white man!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I do not say that. That is the

way  they are doing it. With Malayanisation around

the  corner, I think there will be a lot  of  jobs

which  Government  has  to  give  to  the  private

architects, and if this minimum scale of  fees  is

not   removed,  every  firm  will  come   to   the

Government  and  say, "Even if I  wish  to  charge

less, I will not be allowed to do that. You do not

want me to commit an offence, do you?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is - as has been pointed out by

the Member for Paya Lebar - that, as the present law

stands,  whether a building costs $20,000  or  $20

million,  the  minimum fee is the same-  7½  per

cent.  Whether it is a warehouse or a cinema,  the

fee  is  the same although the former takes  about

less  than  half  of  the work  required  for  the

latter. Is this fair?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no such protection in any other

profession,  why should architects want  it?  They

want  such protection because they know very  well

that without it they will not have a chance to rob

the  public as much as they would like. If  a  man

wants  to  charge  less for his  work  why  should

Government  forbid him from doing so? Suppose  the

only  way  an  architect can earn a living  is  to

charge  less,  do  you  think  it  is  right  that

Government  should prevent him from  doing  so  to

earn  a living? I think it is rubbish to say  that

ending  the power to fix fees will result  in  bad

buildings  being erected. I do not see any  reason

for  an architect to say that the removal of  this

clause  will  result in a lot of corruption:  that

depends on the man himself. If that is the line of

argument, I think we should raise the salaries  of

all Government officers by three or four times  to

prevent corruption, but I do not think that is the

way to prevent it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part, that is section 5, on the

qualifications  acceptable  for  registration,   I

think  in  the  past  we  have  placed  too   much

confidence on people having British qualifications

and  that it has been the practice not to register

anyone with qualifications obtained from somewhere

else.  I can understand the attitude adopted then.

Nothing  could  be  done but with  self-government

around the corner I think we should reconsider the

whole   case.   What  is  wrong  with  registering

architects from China, Indonesia or Japan, or even

from  Communist Russia? If they are good  and  can

render  a  service to this country, why should  we

not admit them? Why should we limit qualifications

to  those obtained in England alone? Does it  mean

only the architect qualified in England can design

buildings?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>



As   the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar   said,

architects  in  the  United  States  design   even

skyscrapers  and  all  sorts  of  other  types  of

buildings, so why should not men trained there  be

allowed to practise here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to continue to be dictated to by the

Institute  of Architects of Malaya,  I  think  the

public will be fleeced to the utmost. So I suggest

that  if  the  Minister is going to  institute  an

enquiry  into qualifications acceptable under  the

Architects Ordinance, I suggest the members of the

committee should be those who have the interest of

this country at heart, not those who intend to  go

away at the first opportunity because then such an

enquiry will serve no purpose at all.



<br><br>11.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  glad that the racket  of  giving  big

business  big opportunities to make big  money  is

coming to a close.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Thanks to the Labour Front!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Labour Front has just

realised  it. The Labour Front has given  the  big

$5,000,000  Polytechnic  building  project  to  an

expatriate  firm - thanks to the Labour  Front!  The

amount  of  architects'  fees  involved  in   that

contract is only half a million dollars!  We  have

to thank the Labour Front for this!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us come back to this question. I am glad

the  racket is off. Whenever firms want  to  erect

buildings  for  the  Government,  they   send   in

tenders,  and  everybody will try to  put  up  the

lowest. And of course the officers deciding on the

tenders with the provision of the minimum of  7½

per cent, will have no choice but to say, "We will

have  to  fall back on these expatriate  companies

because they are big firms." With the removal of a

minimum  fee, I think the profession  will  become

more  competitive. It will enable  the  people  of

Singapore to save a great deal more because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>



firms which are not very big will be content  with

a  reasonable profit and therefore tender at lower

figures. This is good for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, whatever this Assembly wants to

do, it has always one motive in mind, and that is:

What  good  will it do to the ordinary  people  of

Singapore?  I  am  thinking,  Sir,  not   of   big

buildings   constructed   by   big   business   or

millionaires, but of houses for the small man  who

earns  a few hundred dollars a month and who wants

to  build his own house. I know in many countries,

for  example, New Zealand, Australia and  England,

where  the Government has drawn up a great variety

of  housing plans any person can obtain such plans

at  only a very small fee. In Singapore we do  not

have these. The best the Government can offer  are

a  few  plans for attap houses, many of  them  not

popular  with the people here. The Government  has

no  plans for concrete houses. It is high time  it

helps  the people construct such houses by drawing

standard  plans and make these available at  small

cost. The small man who wants to construct his own

house  can  buy and use such a standard  plan  and

will  need  only  a  little  supervision  from  an

architect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a very good way of helping the

people  save money and making full use of our  few

architects. If such plans are drawn up and anybody

can go and select one and build his own house, the

architects will also then be asked to work on  new

models,  not  old models changed here  and  there.

That  will  mean architects do not  do  repetitive

work, and can concentrate their efforts to put  up

new designs for houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Sir, I agree fully with my

colleague   when   he  asked  that   degrees   and

qualifications  from  countries  other  than   the

United  Kingdom  which  are appropriate  and  good

should  be  recognised. We have come  to  a  stage

where  we  must  make use of every  available  and

qualified  Singaporean to help contribute  to  the

progress  of the country. If Malayans  spend  many

years in a foreign land like the United States and

come  back  with  a  qualification  which  is  not

recognised by us but which is accepted in many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>



other countries, we will be denying ourselves of  a

source of valuable talent. These people can make  a

contribution to the progress of this land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support my colleague on that clause.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  House should take note that on  such  an

uncontroversial   Bill  so  many   skeletons   have

suddenly popped out of the cupboard. These are  the

inherent  contradictions in this colonial  society.

The  Member  for Paya Lebar has a keen interest  in

housing   because  he  is  interested  in   housing

estates.  At the moment I understand he is  engaged

in  a  thousand-unit estate at Sembawang Hill;  for

this no doubt a very large sum will come out of his

profits to go to the architects and therefore it is

with  unusual  vehemence that he has denounced  the

profiteering by people with whom he is associated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir. Is that not an

implication  on the character of a  Member  of  the

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just about to intervene when

the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar did  intervene.  That

statement  seems to imply an improper  motive.  The

hon.  Member for Paya Lebar was talking as a Member

and  I think the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  was

implying  improper motives. If that is so  he  must

withdraw his remark.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I impute to the Member for

Paya  Lebar the highest of motives, namely, to  see

that all those embarked on building housing estates

should  have  the cheapest of architects.  This  is

both  to  his  interest and to that of  the  public

because  no  doubt he will pass on the  benefit  of

lower  fees to the unfortunate consumer who has  to

buy from him on the hire-purchase plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Member for Pasir Panjang who

decided, presumably after having suffered for years

at the hands of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>



expatriates  who  controlled the Malayan  Board  of

Architects, to let off some steam against them.  We

in  this  House welcome these disclosures,  welcome

the  revelation that there are people in Malaya who

have  no interest in this country and who, when  it

comes  to  a  question of the public benefit,  have

been  known  to  exclaim that they  should  not  be

expected to go home empty-handed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think it must also go on record that

the  only person who spoke on this Bill who has  no

direct interest in the architects profession is the

Member   for   Serangoon.  Of  course   not   being

conversant   with  these  matters,   the   Member's

contribution  cannot  be said  to  have  been  very

concrete but nevertheless we did enjoy a discussion

on  the  general  principles of good  building  and

building designs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, the House had better

remember this: that all these little bits of reform

for  which the Labour Front wishes to claim credit,

are  well  and  good,  but reforms  alone  are  not

enough. It is not enough just to let in a few  more

architects  who  have  been trained  in  Australia,

Canada,  India, Hongkong or Indonesia. The rate  at

which  housing development should take place if  we

are  to cope with our population, both the existing

slum population and the growth in total number,  is

such  that  the  Minister had better  give  serious

consideration  to starting an architectural  school

producing   hundreds   and   even   thousands    of

architects.  We need architects who  can  not  only

design enormous skyscrapers for the benefit of  the

capitalists, or enormous housing estates for  those

who  are  members of limited companies and who  own

large tracts of land, but who can devote their time

to building cheap, economical, low-cost houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a discussion I had with the Member for

Pasir Panjang in which he told me of a business-cum-pleasure fact-finding survey of Brazil, Mexico  and

other  parts of the world, where enormous equipment

could  produce  low-cost houses  at  such  terrific

speed and such low cost that it could revolutionize

the whole concept of low-cost housing in Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

this speech on low-cost housing has anything to  do

with   the   Bill  before  us,  which  relates   to

architects' fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just

winding  up my speech with a peroration in  tribute

to  the Member for Pasir Panjang who deserves  high

praise today for his revealing disclosures of  what

is going on in the architects' profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, it seems to me that both the

hon.  Member's  exordium and  his  peroration  were

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> To go back to the relevant

then,  Sir; we support this Bill because  obviously

whatever  our  conflicting  interests  we  are  all

united in seeing: one, that European architects  do

not  exploit  local businessmen;  two,  that  local

architects  do  not exploit local businessmen;  and

three,  that  there is no exploitation  at  all  by

anyone.



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to

speak  in the debate on this Bill. I had considered

that  the  hon. Minister and the Member  for  Pasir

Panjang had said enough on it but I cannot let  one

statement  made  by  the Member  for  Serangoon  go

unchallenged  as it will be misguiding  Members  of

this  House. Let me assure the hon. Member that  he

has  nothing to thank the Labour Front  for  except

for bringing up this Bill which seeks to remove the

provision about fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the contract: that was given by the Board

of  the Polytechnic to whoever it was given, and  I

would  say  that that Board was appointed  in  1954

before  the  Labour Front Government  took  office.

Therefore we cannot claim any thanks for it; except

for  the action of the Minister in bringing up this

amending Bill here.



<br><br>11.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I was overwhelmed, Mr

Speaker, by the uproarious enthusiasm with which my

humble Bill has been greeted from all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>



sides.  There are just one or two little  points  I

would like to deal with in reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member of the Opposition referred to the

cost  to  Government  in paying private  architects

according to this scale. This was mentioned in  the

debate on the budget last year and of course I took

note  of it; but I must emphatically say that  this

has  not been the guiding factor which has led  the

Government to move this particular amending clause.

The  factor which has been and is in my mind is the

one   which  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar

referred to, firstly, the need for an expansion  of

building  capacity -  very many  more  buildings - and

secondly, very much better buildings at lower cost.

That of course means the building industry must  be

fully efficient and economic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the basis on which my mind has been

working, and is the broad problem. A particular job

will  need to be done to that end - a survey of  the

standards  of  private  building  as  they  are  at

present. That is what I propose - I mentioned  it  in

my  speech. And when the officer has been appointed

and  has finished his work we shall be able to  see

some  of the problems involved in creating a  fully

efficient and economic building industry which will

really  serve the needs of the people. This  little

clause on the scale of fees is put in just to do  a

little  tidying up, to put straight what obviously

is wrong and must be put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had several references to the

desirability  of liberalising our attitude  towards

the recognition of qualifications. This is a matter

which very easily engenders a great deal more  heat

than  light. We will find that anybody  who  has  a

qualification, however low it may be,  will  desire

it to be given the fullest recognition; but as soon

as  that  is  done he says. "Now I  am  registered,

recognised", and he will be able to get  his  hands

well into the money-making aspect of his work.  The

statement that all people who have qualified in any

way and who then come to Singapore do so solely  to

serve the country with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>



no thought of self at all is, I am afraid, not one

which  is  likely  to be borne  out  by  practical

experience.  Indeed  the  hon.  Member  for  Pasir

Panjang  indicated that some people who  have  the

qualifications were in his opinion making  a  very

good  thing out of them; so to get people  without

suitable qualifications and give them a chance  of

making  a  good thing out of the building industry

would probably be disastrous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Point of order, Sir. I did not

indicate   in  my  speech  that  a   man   of   no

qualification should be registered. I merely  said

that  we  should not limit registration to British

qualifications only.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a point for explanation, not

a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I was talking without notes

and  I think I expressed myself wrongly. I did not

intend  to  imply that the hon. Member  wished  to

give    people    registration   who    have    no

qualification,  but that there is  a  tendency  to

lower  qualifications. On that point  I  have  two

important points to make both connected  with  our

own  local  young men and women who are qualifying

themselves.  The  first  is  that  we  have  every

prospect  of  a  sufficient  intake  of  qualified

people  in the architectural and civil engineering

professions  in the next few years. I  have  asked

for,  though  I  have  not  yet  got,  the  latest

figures; but in general a year or two ago we had a

total  of 48 Government and 53 private engineering

and  technical  students  in  the  United  Kingdom

alone,  in Australia 23 Government and 45  private

students  and  in  the United  States  13  private

students, which gives you a total of 182 - a  fairly

handsome  intake if they come in during  the  next

three  or four years. We shall then have an  ample

supply  of  young  people who are qualified.  They

will  not  have the experience to do the big  jobs

but  they will have the qualifications. So  if  we

start   to  recognise  many  other  degrees,   the

prospects  for these young men and women  will  be

markedly decreased. They may find themselves in  a

flooded market. They do need a reasonable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>



measure    of   protection   to   get   themselves

established and get into industry. If  things  are

too  hard for them they may get a most unfortunate

impression. I am thinking in terms of a profession

as a function of industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of course is that we are

developing technical education here. In the nature

of  things you cannot set up a complete system  of

technical  education by waving hands in  the  air.

You  have  to acquire the staff and the buildings,

and  then the students have to go through  a  long

course of work. But when we do have our own  local

qualifications  we shall no doubt hope  that  they

will   be   acceptable,  recognisable,  in   other

territories, as our medical qualifications have in

fact   been  so  long  recognised.  If  we  accord

recognition to all comers now, we shall  have  no

bargaining power when in future we seek reciprocal

recognition for our own qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aspect of this question is that I personally

hope that this territory will become a centre  for

education   not   only  for  Singapore   and   the

Federation, but also for other territories  around

us.  It  may very well be that in future we  shall

have  the  capacity  to train a  large  number  of

students  from  Vietnam,  Thailand.  Indonesia  or

elsewhere who will welcome the opportunity to come

here  rather  than go to Australia or  the  United

Kingdom. And there will be an added attraction  if

they  know that the qualifications they  get  here

are widely recognisable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has been mentioned. I do not

know  if I should place the U.S. high on the scale

of  strictness  in recognition but I  am  informed

that  there,  a  man  who may  build  a  beautiful

skyscraper in New York may be unable to build  one

in  San  Francisco because even between the States

there  is  no  mutual recognition of each  other's

qualifications. So I feel that until we have  gone

a  bit further into that it will be unwise to  say

that  any  American qualification can be accepted.

No doubt they may be very valuable ones but they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>



must  be  scrutinised in relation to syllabus,  the

actual  work done, the period taken and the quality

of subsequent training. The Board of Architects has

already  referred this matter to the  Institute  of

Architects  of  Malaya  which  is  not   a   wholly

expatriate  body  but  has  highly  competent   and

experienced local men on it. We shall no  doubt  go

forward gradually in this but it is not a matter on

which we should rush ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not foresee any immediate shortage of newly

qualified men for Singapore. The shortage  will  be

of   men   with  ten,  twelve  or  fifteen   years'

experience who are competent to direct the work  of

the newly qualified men, and that shortage will not

be affected significantly by the proposal which has

been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given an explanation of the

purpose  of  this amendment in my  speech  but  the

seems  proper  that the single mechanical  engineer

imposed  only  on registrations after  the  present

date and not made retrospective and so deprive  him

of what he has already achieved.

be charged against the General Revenue Balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the

Appropriation Bill, 1957, in November last year,  I

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arising also out of a consideration of the

Statement of Assets and Liabilities, is a  proposal

that  existing  long-term loans  to  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  and  other  bodies  should   be

charged  to expenditure and not shown as assets  in

the   Statement.  This  proposal  is  made  at  the

suggestion of the Director of Audit on the  grounds

that it is established financial practice that  all

transactions, including loans, which  diminish  the

colony's free surplus of revenue should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>



recorded  as  expenditure at the time  payment  is

made.  In  Singapore, the practice of  showing  as

assets  long-term loans, which in the case of  the

Singapore   Improvement  Trust  are  repaid   over

periods of up to 60 years, has sprung up since the

war. The position has now been reached where these

assets,  which are in no sense of the term liquid,

total  about $126 million and, by being  shown  as

assets in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities,

paint   an  entirely  erroneous  picture  of   the

strength  and liquidity of the colony's  finances.

It  has  therefore been decided to  agree  to  the

Director of Audit's suggestion and to charge these

long-term loans to expenditure. This will be  done

by  resolution  of the Assembly  as  soon  as  the

accounts  for 1956 have been closed and the  exact

totals involved are known. It will be appreciated,

of  course, that this is purely a matter of  book-keeping.  No  additional expenditure is  involved.

The  result will be that the Statement  of  Assets

and  Liabilities  will give a much  more  accurate

idea of the strength and liquidity of the colony's

financial  position.  A Statement  of  Assets  and

Liabilities drawn up on this basis is, as  I  have

said, shown on page 8 of the Estimates." [Vol.  2,

No. 9, Col. 600-1.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proposal met with the approval of hon.

Members. The only comment came from an hon. Member

who  suggested that a footnote should be added  to

the  Statement of Assets and Liabilities appearing

in  page  8 of the Annual Estimates to the  effect

that  these long-term loans, previously  shown  as

assets,  were now detailed in an appendix  to  the

Estimates.  Hon. Members will see  that  this  has

since been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, that I need give any

further  explanation  to  that  which  I  gave  in

November last and which I have now repeated. There

is only one point which I should mention. When the

draft  Estimates were drawn up in August 1956,  it

was  thought  that  these  long-term  loans  would

amount  to  about $126,000,000 by the end  of  the

year,  and  I mentioned this when I spoke  in  the

Assembly.   In   point  of  fact,  the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust  drew  about  $7,000,00()  less

under Loan Programme No. 6 during the remainder of

the   year;   and  the  City  Council  drew   only

$3,000,000  instead  of $4,000,000  in  connection

with the loan for the Kallang Bridge roadway.  The

total  to  be  charged  to  expenditure  on   31st

December, 1956, was therefore only

I  would  like to have some explanation  from  the

loaned. Is not that money an asset? If it is,  why

should it be written off or debited to the General

Revenue  Balance? As the loans will eventually  be

returned why should not the amounts remain  to  be

shown as assets?

explanation to that which I gave in the memorandum

which accompanied the Estimates last year, to  the

explanation   which  I  gave  in  presenting   the

really  nothing  which I can  add.  The  questions

which  the  hon. Member for Telok Ayer has  raised

have  been answered in the memorandum and  in  the

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in

my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Local  Government Elections Bill, as contained  in

Sessional  Paper No. L. A. 1 of 1957, be  adopted,

subject  to the recommittal of the Bill in respect

of  clauses 1, 2, 11, 22, 27 and 34 to a Committee

of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members of this Assembly are aware, the

Local  Government  Elections Bill  and  the  Local

Government Bill are complementary, and  that  with

the  enactment of these two Bills it will then  be

possible    under   the   new   local   government

organisation  to proceed with these  elections  at

the earliest opportunity which, in the case of the

City Council, will be in December this year and in

the case of the District Councils sometime about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>



March  1958. Members will have observed  from  the

Report  that  only  a few written  representations

were  submitted  and that no oral  representations

were  made. Members will wish me to draw attention

to  the  main  amendments to the  Bill  in  Select

Committee and this I will proceed to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning clause 5, a new paragraph (c) has

been  included  to enable citizens of  the  United

Kingdom  or  Colonies,  or  persons  born  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya, Sarawak, North  Borneo  or

Brunei  to  vote  after one year's residence.  The

reason  for  this  is  that  while  the  Bill  has

extended the right to vote to alien nationals with

five  years'  residence,  adult  persons  who  are

citizens of the United Kingdom or who were born in

Malaya, etc., were barred from voting because they

have less than five years' residence in Singapore.

Nevertheless  those  same persons  with  only  one

year's  residence  can  vote  in  the  Legislative

Assembly elections. By this amendment they can now

also  vote in the local government elections after

one year's residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the machinery for elections,

amendments  have  been made to clause  9  to  meet

representations  which have been  made  advocating

improvements to polling arrangements.  Sub-clauses

(3), (4) and (5) give discretionary powers to  the

Returning Officer regarding the number and kind of

polling stations, and for guidance in the exercise

of  his  discretion the provision of  one  polling

station   for   every  2,000   voters   has   been

recommended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment to clause 10 is a little

technical.  Briefly, the purpose of the  new  sub-clause (1), being a telescoped version of old sub-clauses  (1),  (2),  (3) and  (4),  is  to  enable

arrangements  to be made for preparing  the  Local

Government  Electoral Rolls corrected  up  to  1st

April,  1957,  instead  of  1st  April,  1956.  In

anticipation  of  the  City Council  elections  in

December,  electoral  rolls corrected  up  to  1st

April, 1957, are now under preparation. Claims and

objections  will  of course follow  the  procedure

given in clause 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, Sir, to clause 66, the purpose of

the provision which has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>



added to paragraph (a) of sub-clause (1) is to make

it clear that either payment for or contract to pay

for  any petroleum used for vehicles which  may  be

lawfully used for the conveyance of electors to and

from  the  polling booths is not constituted  as  a

legal  practice.  It expressly provides  that  such

payments  shall be regarded as expenses within  the

meaning  of  clause  65  which  limits  the   total

expenses which may be incurred by candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the amendments which I have already

described, Members are aware that I have  a  number

of  further  amendments to make  as  given  in  the

Notice   of   Amendments.  These  are   all   minor

amendments except those to clauses 22 and  34.  The

purpose of the amendment to clause 22 is to rectify

an omission by making express provision for filling

a  casual vacancy within two months. Concerning the

amendment  to clause 34 this simply is designed  to

ensure that the date on which the poll is taken  is

not  less than 16 days from the date of the  notice

of election. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, I rise to second the motion and

reserve my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move an amendment to the motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, after "2," to insert "8.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, clause 8 at present reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may, from time to time, by

notification published in the Gazette  specify  the

names and boundaries of the electoral divisions  of

any local government area for purposes of elections

under this Ordinance."



Sir,  this  means  that  any  alterations  to   the

boundaries  in  the  electoral  divisions  or   any

demarcation   of   the  boundaries   of   electoral

divisions in any local government area can be  done

by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>



Minister without reference to this House or without

notification  through  the  Government  Gazette  or

through   newspapers,  or  without   reference   to

representations and objections by  members  of  the

public.  Now  Sir,  this morning  in  answer  to  a

question by the Member for Serangoon [Mr Lim Choon

Mong]  as  to  whether an All-Party  Committee  was

going  to  be  set up to consider the all-important

question of these electoral divisions in the  local

government  areas, we heard the answer was  in  the

negative   except  possibly  that  these  electoral

divisions which have already been worked  out  will

be  referred or have been referred in the last  few

days to an All-Party Committee for its observations

and   for   some  reconciliation  of  the  proposed

boundaries with the limits of the general  election

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we object to this in principle. You will

find  if you refer to clauses 5 and 15 of the Local

Government  Bill  with which we  shall  be  dealing

later, that it is provided there that no alteration

shall  be  made to the limits of the  City  or  the

Districts  unless  and until such alterations  have

been  notified in four successive Gazettes  and  in

the newspapers of four different languages with  an

invitation to persons to make objections. We intend

when  we come to the Local Government Bill to  move

amendments  to add a proviso that these alterations

should be notified in respect of the new limits  to

the  City and the Districts which are of course the

most important ones of all and of very considerable

proportions.  It  is our view, therefore,  that  if

this  is  to be found in the Local Government  Bill

with regard to the City limits, the same principles

should  be  applied to the electoral divisions,  to

the Bill now in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, an All-Party Committee is not

going  to  be  set up to consider these  boundaries

despite a request that this be done, and the result

is  that  Government does lay itself  open  to  the

charge  of manipulation of the electoral boundaries

to  suit  party  interests if  the  boundaries  are

imposed  on  people  and  are  not  open  to   such

representations. Any government, I  am  sure,  will

not wish to make themselves a party to that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>



suspicion.  It  is therefore in our view  essential

that  this  matter  should  be  considered  in  the

Committee  stage. I do not propose, Sir,  to  speak

further on it at this stage.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  second the amendment. I  believe  that

under  clause 8 of this Local Government  Elections

Bill the Minister is given considerable powers, and

that this clause should be read in conjunction with

the intention of Government trying to force through

what  seems to me to be something in the  interests

of the governing Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put a few instances before you, Sir. I

have just received information that Government  has

already   set  up  a  Committee  to  consider   the

divisions  of  the City Council  and  that  it  has

already made up its mind as to what it should be. I

understand  the recommendations have  already  been

accepted  by  the  Minister for  Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing  (Inche Abdul  Hamid  bin  Haji

Jumat)  as  well as by the Council of Ministers.  I

take it, Sir, that in the matter of elections,  not

just  the interests of one Party are involved,  nor

even  the  interests  of the governing  Party;  the

interests of all political Parties are concerned. I

have  glanced through a little part of  the  Report

and  I  am  alarmed, Sir, at the way the Government

has fixed the divisions. At best, it can be said to

be  political  manoeuvring. There is  the  case  of

Tanjong Pagar being given three representatives  in

local  council elections, but Cairnhill  is  to  be

given  only  a little more than one, say one-and-a-half  to  two,  and Tanglin also one-and-a-half.  I

have  noted the reasons given. The Report says that

this  is  based on the estimated electoral strength

but I cannot understand, from what I have seen, why

in  one  area with about 30,000 people  the  voting

strength is calculated at 18,000 while for  another

area  with  about  the same number  of  people  the

voting  strength is put at 12,000. How  were  these

figures established? Did Government have statistics

to  support its calculations of estimates of future

votes? Is it that one area consists mainly of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>



children, or in another that there are more aliens?

The  disparity in the figure is too great  to  make

them true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has also stated that one line it

followed  is community interest but I fail  to  see

this  being  followed, especially in the  Cairnhill

area  where one section of predominantly local-born

people,  in  Emerald Hill Road, is carved  out  and

included  with  other  divisions.  Where   is   the

similarity  of community interest in this  grouping

of  different peoples? The statement  is  just  not

convincing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can quote more examples of how things are

being manipulated. In the case of Whampoa, we  find

that  the area is going to sprawl over to Serangoon

Road  and  to embrace Kallang right up  to  Kallang

Road,  instead of going East into Potong  Pasir  or

west into Rangoon Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such are the inconsistencies suggested by the

Committee  set up by the Government. The Government

may  say  it  is  a  Committee consisting  only  of

Government officials and that no Party is  involved

and  not one single Party is represented on it. Let

me  say, however, that Government servants have  to

carry  out the policy of the Government;  they  are

the  servants of the Government and the  Government

in power is that of the Labour Front Coalition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the elections provided for in this Bill

should be carried out in the most fair manner, fair

to   all   Parties  concerned,  and  an   All-Party

Committee should be set up to give its views on the

matter. As matters stand, the Government is using a

very  unfair way of getting a favourable  position.

The Liberal-Socialist Party wants the elections  to

be  fair and nothing else. It feels that Government

should be a responsible one, that it should not try

to force other Parties to accept what it feels will

be  good  only to itself. If the Government  thinks

that  in  the  elections it needs  a  handicap,  it

should  ask for it - probably it would get it. If  the

Government  feels that it can fight  the  elections

only after tying up its opponent's hands, it should

declare  its  intentions. But it will really  be  a

shameful matter if it seeks an advantage by  hiding

behind a so-called non-Party Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel, Sir, that clause 8 should be

included for reconsideration in Committee, in which

we  will  explain fully our stand. Sir,  I  beg  to

second the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> it has been moved as an amendment to

the  original Question, after "2," to insert  "8,".

The  Question is, "That the figure proposed  to  be

inserted, be there inserted."



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

notice  with some interest that this "very serious"

matter  now  brought  forward  by  the  Member  for

Tanglin [Mr John Ede] and his colleague the Member

for  Serangoon [Mr Lim Choon Mong] was apparently

not  in  their  minds at all when this  clause  was

considered  in the Select Committee on  this  Bill.

For  according to the Report this clause was agreed

to with no particular discussion and there was only

one fairly minor technical arrangement. That is not

altogether  surprising on second thoughts,  because

it  does  seem  to  me that there  is  a  very  big

difference  between  the  boundaries  of   District

Councils  and the City Council, and the  boundaries

of  divisions.  When the Select  Committee  on  the

Local   Government   Bill   was   considering   the

boundaries  between  the  City  Council   and   the

District  Councils, there was, as the  hon.  Member

for Tanglin said, a great discussion, and that is a

matter  on  which  I have no doubt  there  will  be

further  debate. Now a decision whether or  not  to

put  a  certain area within the boundaries  of  the

City Council or within the boundaries of a District

Council is a matter which must affect very directly

every  person living within that area,  because  in

the  one case his affairs and rates and taxes  will

be  in  the hands of the City Council, and  in  the

other case those affairs will be in the hands of  a

District  Council. But I see no  parallel  at  all,

Sir,  between this and the division of an area into

constituencies for the purpose of polling. I  would

hazard the opinion, Sir, that the ordinary voter in

Singapore has very little personal interest whether

he  goes  to  a  polling station in a  constituency

called Cairnhill or one called Tanglin,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>



whatever name you would like to suggest. The  first

concern  of  the  voter surely is  merely  that  he

should  be  able  to  exercise his  vote  with  the

minimum  inconvenience, that is  to  say  that  the

polling station should be reasonably near his place

of residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons who are concerned with the division

of  the  City Council into electoral constituencies

are, of course, the political Parties, and that,  I

think, is the rub of this issue, and the real  case

for  recommitting clause 8 is the case that was put

by  the hon. Member for Serangoon. I regret that he

should  feel  that  he must regard  the  boundaries

which   have   been  drawn  up   as   having   been

manipulated.  He  said he could  not  believe  that

these  boundaries had been drawn up in an objective

way   without  Party  bias  and  without  a  policy

directive  from the Government. Sir,  I  cannot  of

course deny him his beliefs or his views, but I can

say  that  this task of dividing the new City  area

into  32  constituencies was a task  tackled  by  a

Committee  of  officials with no  policy  directive

from  Ministers other than the basic  directive  to

draw  up 32 areas on the basis of the franchise  as

laid  down  in  the Bill. And it was  very  much  a

technical  problem. In fact I think if  members  of

any  political Party were to try to divide the City

area  into  32 constituencies in order to  rig  the

elections they would have very great difficulty  in

doing so without arriving at an answer which would,

on  the  face of it, be absurd. It is not  an  easy

task  to  divide  a City area into  constituencies.

There  are  a  number of considerations  which  are

decisive,  The  first is to try to  get  boundaries

which    do   have   some   natural,   self-evident

justification, such as the line of a stream or  the

line  of  a  water  channel or some  other  natural

boundary: and the second consideration is to try as

far  as  possible  to  get approximately  the  same

number of voters in each division. That latter task

cannot of course at the moment be based on definite

figures.  The  hon. Member for Serangoon  indicated

that  he thought the figures on which the Committee

worked  were not reliable ones, implying that  they

had not been properly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>



estimated. Now it is impossible to prove  how  many

voters we shall find in any given area. All we  can

do  is to take the total number of people living in

an area, which we can get, and having regard to the

number  of  present  voters in the  area,  look  as

intelligently as we can at the make-up of that area

and  then estimate what effect the introduction  of

aliens  who  have lived there for five  years  will

have on the rolls. It was because an allowance  was

made for an uneven incidence of voters coming on to

the  rolls  that  you find that  in  some  existing

constituencies, the subdivision is greater than  in

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no attempt whatsoever to make the

Tanjong Pagar division into three divisions because

we think the three new divisions will be won by any

one  political Party; it has been done entirely  on

objective   considerations   of   trying   to   get

approximately  the same number of persons  in  each

division,  following  as far  as  possible  natural

boundaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been several cases where the

natural  boundary,  and in particular  an  existing

boundary which is known, gave us a result which did

not seem to be acceptable. One case was that of the

Cairnhill  constituency. We had too many people  in

the  proposed Cairnhill division and not enough  in

the neighbouring division to the West. The solution

adopted  was to remove a certain number of  persons

who  now live in the Cairnhill area and switch them

to  the neighbouring area (I forget the exact  name

of  it). The reason this particular area was chosen

was  that  it  seemed to be the area  most  closely

related to the other division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that hon. Members opposite should

adopt  the  view  that the Committee  worked  to  a

political directive and was not being objective.  I

can  only  assure you that that was not  so  and  I

would add one last word, Sir, which is that if hon.

Members  contemplate any considerable  revision  of

the boundaries of divisions at this stage, then  it

will not be possible to have City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>



Council  elections in December.  I  am  not  for  a

moment denying this House the opportunity, if it so

wishes,    to   revise   the   electoral   division

boundaries.  If  it wishes to do that,  let  it  be

done.  But what I would say is if that is  done  to

anything more than a very, very minor extent,  City

Council elections cannot be held in December.

the  Independents being snubbed. I cannot  see  why

that Report should not be circulated to Independent

Members as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has said that it is

not  the  duty  or responsibility of voters  to  be

concerned in the fixing of boundaries. I  think  he

is  entirely  wrong and I do not  agree  with  him.

Voters  in  each division, whether  attached  to  a

political  Party or not, are greatly  concerned  in

the  demarcation of boundaries as they may wish  to

put  up their own candidates who may not belong  to

any  Party. They have a right if they want  to,  to

nominate  their own candidates as Independents  and

it is therefore their concern that they should know

where  their electoral boundaries are.  I  am  very

glad  that the Chief Secretary (or is it the Member

for   Serangoon?)  has  said  that  it  is  not   a

demarcation by the Government Party. It  is  a  few

Government officials who have been directed by  the

Government Party to demarcate such divisions. There

is  all the more reason why the Report should  have

been   brought   to  this  Assembly   rather   than

circulated  to  all  Parties  concerned.  In   this

Assembly we have the Government Party which  is  an

alliance government of three political Parties, and

on  the  Opposition  benches we have  the  Liberal-Socialists and the P.A.P. I am quite sure  that  in

Singapore we have more political Parties than  what

we  have  here. There is the Party Ra'ayat and  why

should  not this Party be consulted then?  I  think

the Government may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>



consider  that  the Party Ra'ayat  is  a  political

Party,  and  if that be so, why then register  that

Party  as  a political Party? The Independents  are

always  snubbed  for one reason  or  another.  This

concerns the elections and it affects not only  the

Members of this Assembly but also the whole  public

as  well.  I  would  therefore like  to  record  my

protest  at  the way in which the Independents  are

treated in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleague  the  Chief Secretary has  explained  the

working  of this official Committee that  has  been

set up by the Government. It answers the allegation

made  by  the  hon. mover  and  seconder  of   the

amendment that there has been manipulation  by  the

Party in power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It does not answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I would like to refute

that allegation, and the only thing I would like to

say  at this stage is that such an allegation could

only come from the mind of somebody who, if he  had

been in the position where we are today, might have

thought  it  possible and practicable. We  on  this

side  of the House, Sir, did not even think of  it.

An official body was appointed comprising the Chief

Statistician, the Deputy Secretary to the  Ministry

of   Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing,   the

Planning   Adviser   to   the   S.I.T.,    and    a

representative of the Survey Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government accepts the amendment by the

Members  of the Liberal-Socialist Party to recommit

clause  8 of the Bill, and as this clause  will  be

fully  debated during the Committee stage,  I  feel

that it will serve no useful purpose for us to have

a  lengthy  debate on this now and thereby  prolong

the debate on the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the points raised by the Member for

Queenstown,  Sir, I have had occasion this  morning

to  say  that  the  hon. Member had  difficulty  in

understanding the English language. I find. Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is not my language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I find that the same position

still  obtains in the remarks that he has  levelled

at  the speech of the Chief Secretary. He says  the

voter  is  of  course interested in  the  electoral

division  in  which he is to be placed.  The  Chief

Secretary has not said so. What the Chief Secretary

has  said is this: that the voter is interested  to

see  that  he  has a vote and he is not  interested

whether it is to be this part of Cairnhill or  that

part of Cairnhill. He can still exercise his vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member, referring to the Report of

this official Committee on demarcation, stated that

it  had  been given to all members of the All-Party

Committee. Sir, it is an All-Party Committee set up

by  the  Government to consider the demarcation  of

Singapore  into 51 divisions, and it is  to  enable

them  to  make  a  proper study of  the  facts  and

figures as gathered by this official Committee that

the Report is handed to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Government has decided to accept this amendment  to

the  motion  by the Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing,  there  is  very  little  that

remains to be said except this. On principle it  is

advisable to have the work of this Committee placed

before all political Parties. If there has been  no

gerrymandering  it would be obvious  to  everybody,

and  everybody  would  then  be  quite  happy.  But

whether  or not there has been an unconscious  bias

in  the  work of any official so as to justify  the

allegations  made by the Member for Serangoon,  one

can   only   judge  from  the  vehemence   of   his

allegations and the corresponding vehemence of  the

denials  of  the  Chief  Minister  and  the   Chief

Secretary. Nothing would be lost if the reasons for

the  delineations  are placed before  an  All-Party

Committee. If the Committee is fully aware  of  the

fact  that  any radical alteration to the  boundary

lines  may  well  lead  to a  postponement  of  the

elections, that is a responsibility which  will  be

shouldered by every political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, as amended, put, and agreed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Local  Government Elections Bill, as  contained  in

Sessional  Paper No. L. A. 1 of 1957,  be  adopted,

subject  to the recommittal of the Bill in  respect

of  clauses  1,  2,  8, 11, 22,  27  and  34  to  a

Committee of the whole Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee on Thursday, 25th July, 1957.

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing  in

my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Local  Government Bill, as contained  in  Sessional

Paper  No. L.A. 10 of 1957, be adopted, subject  to

the  recommittal of the Bill in respect of  clauses

21,  67,  68, 81, 102, 108, 152, 154, 169, 256  and

285 to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members will have observed, the Report

from  the  Select Committee is very voluminous.  In

acknowledgement of the importance of this  Bill,  a

great deal of time and effort has been given to it.

Many meetings of the Select Committee were held, in

the    course   of   which   written    and    oral

representations   from  the   City   Council,   the

Singapore  Ratepayers Association, the Chambers  of

Commerce  and  others were considered  and  several

hundred amendments were studied. A great number  of

amendments have been made to the Bill as  a  result

of  these  representations. Conversely,  Government

found that it was not in agreement with a number of

the  proposals put forward and was therefore unable

to vary the clauses in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will expect me to apprise  them  of

the  main amendments which have been made and  also

to   refer   to   the  proposed  amendments   which

Government  was unable to accept. I hope  you  will

bear with me as this will be a lengthy business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the definition "City" in clause 3,

also  alterations  to  boundaries  referred  to  in

clauses  5 and 15, and the description of the  City

boundary in the First Schedule, objections  opposed

the exclusion of part of Katong from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>



City  on  the  one hand, and the expansion  of  the

western  boundary  on the other. Various  arguments

were  applied. In the case of Katong, it  was  said

that  the Merdeka Bridge and Nicoll Highway brought

Katong closer to the City; that residents in Katong

now paid City rates and would lose the benefits  of

City   services  and  such  amenities;   and   that

residents of Katong would be mulct by the  District

Council  in favour of the less developed  areas  of

the District.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a further argument that the

present  division of Katong into two parts - along  a

small   canal - only  achieved  a  splitting  of   an

otherwise homogeneous community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the western boundary, Sir, it was

said  that  a  purely rural area was wrongly  being

brought  into the City and that its interests  were

dissimilar  from those of the City, and  also  that

there  was  a  danger of increased  rating  and  so

forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government disagrees with these views. Government

has   taken  into  account  much  wider  and   more

substantial   considerations.   The   division   of

Singapore  Island  into  City  and  District  local

authorities  takes  into  account  not   only   the

desirability  of  having  three  (and  later  four)

equally  balanced Districts, but in doing so  takes

into  account future proposals as envisaged in  the

Master  Plan by which new towns will be  developed,

one  at  Jurong, one at Bukit Panjang, and  one  at

Serangoon,   each   with  fairly  evenly   balanced

populations. At Katong there is no proposal  for  a

new  town. Instead, the urban population will  form

the centre of the new District. It is thought that-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister

is referring actually to Changi and not Katong.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> It is quite evident, Sir, that

for the purpose of further clarification to Members

of  this Assembly that I am referring to it in  my

speech as Katong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, it is thought that Katong

will  develop  sooner and reach full status  before

the  other Districts, and thereby provide  a  model

for  them. As regards services, the suggestion that

these would be less beneficial consequential on the

change is not accepted by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also if hon. Members will turn to the

transitional  provisions of clause 323,  they  will

appreciate that these can be applied in  the  early

stages  of the changeover, which may probably  only

last,  say, six to eight months. Nor is it  thought

likely  that residents of Katong will be  mulct  by

their  own District Council and on which they  will

presumably  be  properly  represented.  As  regards

community interest at Katong, it is agreed that the

more  densely populated urban population which will

form   the  nucleus  of  the  Katong  District   is

homogeneous, but it is doubtful if the  urban  part

has  an  over-riding community  interest  with  the

residential  area of Katong which is to  remain  in

the  City.  The boundary - the canal - is an  old  City

boundary and may be regarded as an extension of the

line of the Green Belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the western boundary, again this is

the line of the Green Belt beyond which City, urban

and  industrial development is restricted  to  stop

indefinite  sprawl.  Again  it  forms  part  of  an

overall  plan.  These new areas  are  not  strictly

rural - they are not agricultural - they are, in  fact,

urban    or   suburban   and   include   industrial

development  along the West Coast Road,  the  large

areas  occupied  by  the Armed Forces  and  housing

estates of Queenstown and the residential areas  of

Holland  Road  as  well as further  similar  future

developments. This area should not, for example, be

compared  with the rural areas of Ulu Pandan  which

lie outside the City boundary. Government considers

that  these wider and planned measures considerably

outweigh   questions  of  rates  and  fears   about

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the constitution of the City and

District   Councils   in   clauses   6   and    16,

representations were made to increase the number of

Councillors from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>



32 to 48 in the case of the City, and from 12 to 18

in  the  case  of  the District Councils.  Further,

suggestions  were also made that  there  should  be

Aldermen  appointed to the City Council. Government

was  not able to accept these proposals as  it  was

not  convinced  that  these increases  were  either

desirable or necessary. It considers that  a  great

improvement  on the "City and Island  Council", as

envisaged in the Rendel Constitution with  only  32

members,  has been made since there will under  the

new   constitution  be  a  total  of   68   elected

Councillors, plus three Chairmen and nine nominated

Councillors, plus a fourth Council later  on.  With

the  adoption  of  these further  proposals,  there

would  be the danger of over-representation,  since

it  should  be  borne in mind that  the  people  of

Singapore are also to be represented under the  new

constitution by 51 Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small island like Singapore there is bound

to   be  an  overlap  of  interests  between  local

government   and  State  business  and   there   is

therefore  a real danger of creating a multiplicity

of    authorities    and    of   over-organisation,

particularly as the electoral boundaries for  local

government  and  the Assembly in the  City  may  be

coterminous. It was also represented that increases

would  enable  the  City  Council  to  conduct  its

business  more  expeditiously  and  efficiently  by

enabling  it to appoint larger Standing  Committees

and  to  delegate authority to them. Government  is

not  aware  of  inefficiency in  the  present  City

Council on account of inadequate numbers and in any

case the numbers are to be increased from 27 to 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would perhaps be of assistance if the City

Council  made  use  of the provisions  of  the  new

clause  47  (old clause 49) which gives  powers  to

delegate  authority  to  a Committee  and  also  to

delegate  authority to its employees.  As  the  new

Councillors become more experienced, they may  wish

to consider these provisions, since it appears from

what  the  Member for Tanglin had to say in  Select

Committee  that about 80 per cent of the  decisions

in  the  City Council require confirmation  by  the

full Council, and that authority is not delegated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Aldermen, Government takes the view

that this system, under which the persons nominated

probably  share the political views  of  the  Party

which  nominates them, is less attractive  than  an

all-elected representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the qualifications of candidates

for  election  in clause 21, I said at  the  Second

Reading  of the Bill, Sir, that Government intended

to  follow  the policy which is laid  down  in  the

White  Paper to the effect that in the City Council

the ability to speak "Mandarin or Malay or Tamil or

English"   would  be  the  qualification  required,

whereas in the Districts the ability to speak  "any

Chinese dialect or Malay or Tamil or English" would

be  the qualification required. Government has  not

agreed  that in the City area "any Chinese dialect"

should take the place of Mandarin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, however, Sir, Government is following

the  Legislative  Assembly language  qualification,

taking   the   view  that  in  an   urbanised   and

sophisticated  local government area  such  as  the

City,  beset  as  it is with modern  and  technical

problems,  an  unlimited range  of  dialects  could

seriously   impede  business.  In  the   Districts,

however, where the tempo of business will  be  much

slower  in  comparison,  and  where  insistence  on

Mandarin    would    seriously   hamper    adequate

representation,  this  was considered  to  outweigh

expediency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed, Sir, with regard to

paragraph (d) that the restriction on candidates in

Districts having to stand for the division in which

they  reside has been removed. Under the amendment,

a  candidate can stand for any division within  the

local authority in which he resides. Government did

not  agree to a proposal to debar a candidate  from

standing for election on account of blindness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government was in agreement with the Member for

Tanglin concerning the original clauses 31 and  35,

both  of which have been taken out of the Bill.  It

was considered that clause 31, which gave provision

to  the  local  authority to  grant  gratuities  in

special cases, was open to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>



abuse.  Concerning  clause 35,  by  implication  it

would  appear that employees of the local authority

can  run businesses in addition to their employment

with  the local authority. This clause was  thought

to  be highly undesirable and accordingly has  been

taken out of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rates, Government was not able

to  agree with the proposed amendment to sub-clause

(3)  of  clause  108 by the Member for  Tanglin  by

which  the 30 per centum ceiling for rates  in  the

City   should   also  be  applied   to   Districts.

Government took the view that the original wording,

slightly  modified, would be more appropriate,  and

that  in  so  far as Districts were concerned,  the

rates  shall not exceed fifteen per centum  without

the sanction of the Minister in writing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government held the view that clause 109 was

necessary and should be retained in order  to  meet

the  need for differential rating in the new  areas

affected   by   the  changes  to   boundaries.   By

amendments   to  paragraphs  (a)   and   (b) ,   the

provisions  of this clause will not only  apply  to

the  new  areas  but also to any part  thereof.  In

other  words,  in the case of Katong District,  for

example, it need not follow that the whole new area

which  is  transferred  to  the  District  will  be

required  to  continue  to pay  City  rates - a  part

thereof  could pay less, depending on the  services

provided and other such factors. Government did not

agree  that clause 109 (b) could be dispensed  with

as was suggested simply because of the amendment to

clause  108  (3). Clause 109 specifically  concerns

the  change-over. The proviso to clause 108 (3) has

general  effect  and  is not concerned  with  those

areas specifically covered under clause 109 (b).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions relating to the

building  of  streets, an important  amendment  has

been  made  to  sub-clause (15) of clause  142  the

effect  of which is that unless the local authority

does  not approve plans within two months of  their

receipt or resubmission, they shall be deemed to be

approved. This amendment meets criticisms of delays

and  should  ensure  that  business  is  done  more

expeditiously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar amendment has been made in respect of

the  approval of plans for buildings in clause 169,

by  which  a  similar time limit of two  months  is

imposed under sub-clause (18). The reasons are  the

same - to expedite business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 170 is completely new. It supplements the

powers  already  given under sub-clauses  (11)  and

(13)  of  clause  169 and also clause  172  and  is

designed  expressly to enable the local authorities

to  take  action through the Courts to bring  about

the  speedy  demolition or removal of  unauthorised

buildings which are in the process of being  built.

The procedure is speedier since it does not have to

await  a  conviction as in the case of clauses  169

and  172.  Such  measures are deemed  necessary  to

enable  the  local authority to put a stop  to  the

unauthorised  buildings  which  are  springing   up

everywhere  regardless  of  planning  or   building

approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 188 is also new. It makes much fuller

provisions than the clause which was disagreed, for

taking  immediate action, subject  to  the  Court's

direction, to prohibit persons remaining in ruinous

or   dangerous  buildings.  In  extreme  cases  the

building may be demolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of clause 202, representations both

for  and against the City Council having the  power

to  sell various kinds of electrical, gas and water

apparatus   and  appliances  were  considered.   On

balance,  Government decided in favour of the  City

Council  having the power to sell. This is not  the

first  step  in nationalisation, Sir, as  has  been

suggested.  The  real  reasons  are  not   at   all

sinister.  In  so far as electricity is  concerned,

the object is to reduce the cost of electricity  to

the  consumer by increasing consumption - especially

in the non-peak periods in the day time and late at

night.  When  prices  are  artificially  high,  the

public  is  not inclined to buy. When equipment  is

sold by the City Council at reasonable prices, more

such  equipment  is bought and more electricity  is

consumed.  The  object  is to  offer  the  consumer

reasonable terms for consumer appliances  and  good

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council's object is not to trade in non-consumer appliances such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>



as  electric  bulbs  and electrical  wiring.  As  a

matter  of  interest  it may  soon  cease  to  sell

electrical  cookers  and fans because,  so  far  as

these   are   concerned,  the  trade   prices   are

reasonable.  It  may also be of interest,  Sir,  to

note that the British Electricity Authority in  the

United  Kingdom, which is a public  body,  has  the

power not only to sell consumer appliances but also

to  manufacture them. It is also believed  that  in

the  Federation the Central Electricity Board  have

the power to sell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards gas appliances on the other hand, it

appears  that the City Council is the  sole  trader

and it is therefore in the public interest that the

City  Council should continue to hire its equipment

and  also,  as it does in some cases, to sell  such

equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin sought to add a number of

new  clauses  with  which  Government  was  not  in

agreement.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been a bit concerned

at  the Minister's expressions, "Government did not

agree" and "Government agreed." I take it that what

is really meant is that Government, since receiving

the  Report of the Select Committee, has agreed  or

disagreed with the views of the Select Committee. I

would   hate  to  think  that  Government,   as   a

Government,  does or should endeavour to  influence

the proceedings of a Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Yes, Sir, thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first new clause which was suggested by the

Member  for Tanglin in the Select Committee  sought

to  give  the District Councils power to appoint  a

Secretary,  Treasurer,  Health  Officer,  Assessor,

Engineer, Architect and other such appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new clause is similar to the first in

that  it  provided  for  the Chairmen  of  District

Councils  to submit to their Councils each  year  a

list of posts which are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third new clause provided for the District

Council  Fund and properties vested in it  to  come

under  the  direction and control of the  District.

Also that all payments to and out of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>



the Fund should be made by the Treasurer (appointed

under the first new clause).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since receiving the Report of the Select

Committee, Sir, Government feels that it  does  not

disagree  with  the principles envisaged  in  these

proposed  amendments  and, in fact,  endorses  them

since  it is intended that District Councils should

eventually be independent. At the Second Reading of

the  Bill, I drew attention to the Explanatory Note

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provision is also made for District Councils to

be  run,  during  an  interim  period  after  their

constitution,  on lines similar  to  those  of  the

Rural  Board, particularly with regard to  finance,

staffing,  vesting of properties,  acquisition  and

disposal of land and other immovable property. When

these Councils have been set on their feet and have

become  financially  viable,  amending  legislation

will  be  introduced  to enable  them  to  function

independently like the City Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members will appreciate, Sir, that it is  not

possible  to  create independent and 100  per  cent

self-sufficient   District   Councils    overnight.

Membership  of a local authority is  a  job  to  be

learnt.  The  weight  of  responsibility   we   are

proposing to place upon these Councils is,  as  the

McNeice  Report points out, very considerable,  and

experience in the management of weighty affairs  is

not  immediately evident in these areas. It is  for

such  reasons, as well as financial considerations,

that  a  measure of guidance of these  Councils  in

their  early  years  is necessary  for  a  strictly

limited period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless it is agreed that District Councils

should  be as independent as practicable of control

by  Government.  The Committee on Local  Government

sought  for  a  system of financial  assistance  by

Government  which would preserve local authorities'

independence, and it was thought that a  system  of

equalisation grants would offer the best  solution.

This  matter is also referred to in paragraph 6  of

the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these matters concerning the duties and

responsibility    of   District    Councils,    the

feasibility  of  a  system of equalisation  grants,

staffing, and all such considerations regarding the

machinery to establish District Councils are being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>



studied  by  a Working Party, the establishment  of

which was referred to at paragraphs 210 and 211  of

the   McNeice  Report.  In  due  course,   amending

legislation  on the lines envisaged by  the  Member

for  Tanglin  will be introduced, but  Government's

view is that at present it is premature to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minor amendments have been made to the

description  of District boundaries in  the  Second

Schedule  which have also been illustrated  on  two

maps, Map A and Map B, attached to the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first minor amendment which appears on Map A

was  simply  to draw the boundary to bring  in  the

Royal  Malayan Navy together with the  Naval  Base,

rather than to have them artificially separated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment, in Map B, was to include

Nee  Soon Village in the Serangoon District Council

instead of in the Bukit Panjang District. Nee  Soon

is comparatively remote from Bukit Panjang Village,

and the lives of the residents of Nee Soon are more

closely  linked with those of the residents  living

along Sembawang Road and Thomson Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the whole of these boundaries

described in the First and Second Schedules, it has

been  represented that they should be subjected  to

the  procedure  laid  down in  clauses  5  and  15.

Government's view is that this procedure should  be

applied to all subsequent amendments, but in so far

as  these  major changes are concerned, forming  as

they  do  part of a new Bill, the proper place  for

consideration of them and debate on them is in  the

Assembly alongside with all the other proposals  of

the  Bill.  The  Report of the Committee  on  Local

Government,  showing  in  "map  form"   the   first

boundary  proposals has been available since  early

in  1956.  The White Paper, Cmd. 30 of  1956,  with

firm  boundary  proposals, was  published  together

with  a  map  a  few  months later,  and  the  same

boundaries  have been described in  the  Bill.  The

proposed boundaries have, therefore, been  given  a

thorough  airing  and  it is not  agreed  that  any

further airing under clauses 5 and 15 is necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, many hundreds of

amendments  to  this Bill have been considered  and

made.  Many  of  them  are minor  improvements  and

corrections.   Others   take   into   account   the

representations  which  have  been  made.  I   have

already     mentioned    the     more     important

representations and amendments. The  final  results

are,  of  course, incorporated in the Bill attached

to  the  Report.  There are a few  more  amendments

which I shall move. Members will have observed from

the  notice of amendments that all these additional

amendments  which I propose to move are minor  ones

and  that  those which are to be made to  the  more

controversial  clauses 21 and  108  are  of  little

importance  and  have little or no bearing  on  the

main issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members of the Assembly are conscious

of  the  importance of this Bill, particularly  its

special provisions for the establishment of several

more  democratic institutions in Singapore  Island.

The early enactment of the Bill is chiefly dictated

by   the  urgent  and  widespread  desire  to  hold

elections to the local government Councils as  soon

as  possible and, more particularly, to  hold  City

Council elections in December. Nevertheless Members

of  the  Assembly may well feel that a little  more

time  should be given to consideration of the Bill.

For  this  reason, therefore, Sir, I shall  shortly

propose that the Committee stage should be deferred

until  Thursday,  25th July, for  which  purpose  a

special sitting of the Assembly will be proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I should like to take this

opportunity to thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir; but for

your  guidance  and assistance the Members  of  the

Select Committee would not have completed their job

within  the time which we had been able to  do  so.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I second the motion and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I beg to move an amendment to the

motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "285", to insert "and clauses 3, 5, 6, 15,

16, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 31, 39, 40, 41, 45, 60, 109,

143, 159, 168, 216, 245, 284, 287, 293, 323, two new

clause  after  clause 101, the First Schedule,  the

Second Schedule, the Third Schedule, and the  Sixth

Schedule".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before the Member for Tanglin

proceeds, perhaps the Chief Minister would like  to

inform the House whether he agrees in this case  to

the adoption of the practice which will, I hope, be

evolved whereby, if a Member wishes a clause to  be

discussed,  the Bill would, as a matter of  course,

be recommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly

to  enable a discussion on that clause to  be  gone

into in greater detail?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes Sir, the Government

welcomes   a  debate  on  any  points   which   the

Opposition may care to raise in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to

answer my friend the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and  Housing in full on all  the  points  on

which he has touched this afternoon. I am sure  the

House does not want to hear me make a comprehensive

answer which would only be a repetition of what can

be said at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are only one or two points that I wish

to   make.  This  is,  as  the  Minister  said,  an

immensely  complex  Bill of  324  clauses  and  six

schedules  which  affects the  man  in  the  street

considerably, because the local government  is  the

man  in  the  street's government to a  very  large

extent.   It  has  already  been  said  that   many

amendments  were  moved  and  accepted  in   Select

Committee and many more were negatived. Many points

have  come to light in the Select Committee  as  to

the  Government's  intentions  which  were  not,  I

think,   appreciated  by  this  House  before   and

certainly  not  appreciated by me;  and  there  are

other  points in which the Government's  intentions

are  still obscure, if not to themselves, at  least

to others. I only want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>



give  one  single example of this kind of obscurity

as  I see it. It is with regard to the position  of

the  area  of Katong, Siglap and that part  of  Ulu

Bedok and Geylang Serai which it is proposed to put

into  a District Council. I do not propose to argue

the  advantages or disadvantages or that move  this

afternoon; but there is one point - and it refers  to

clause  323 - which  is extremely confusing.  If  you

will  refer, Sir, to the Explanatory Note  at  page

199  of  the original Bill in the fourth paragraph,

it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transitional provisions (see under clause 323

below) have been included to enable the Rural Board

to continue to perform its present functions in the

Rural  Board area and, pending the constitution  of

the District Councils, to administer those parts of

the  present City area which are to be merged  into

the new District Council areas."



<br><br>The Rural Board should administer those areas going

out of the City into the District Councils. That is

the  explanatory note in the Bill which is what one

understood  before it went to Select Committee.  In

the  Select  Committee  during  the  gathering   of

evidence  from  the representations,  one  got  the

impression that if in the Katong area the  services

supplied by the Rural Board eventually deteriorated

or  they were not able to carry them out, the  City

Council  would be asked to step in and assist.  But

when  we  got through the Bill clause by clause  we

discovered that that was not the case, but that the

City  Council  would  look after  the  district  of

Katong  until  such  time as  the  Changi  District

Council was able to provide the services that  that

area should have. That is to be found in column 343

of the Official Report where the Minister stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The provisions of clause 324, I should like to

stress  to  the  Committee,  are  transitional  and

discretionary. Read in relation to sub-clause  (4) ,

it   clearly   indicates  that   this   is   purely

transitional legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear, Sir, that the Government feels

that at least during the first term of the district

council,  there should be this sort of arrangement.

It  also  thinks that the transitional period  will

not  last  the  full  term of  office  of  the  new

district council, that it is not going to last  for

all time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  in  one sentence the Minister said "at  least

during the first term of the district council" this

will  be in operation and then he corrected  it  to

say  that  it  "will  not last  the  full  term  of

office",  and I believe I understood him to  say  a

few  minutes ago that it is now to be six or  eight

months.  So  what  the  real  period  will  be   is

anybody's guess, but I think I should read  to  the

House  that  particular sub-clause to  which  I  am

referring - clause 323 (2) - to justify my argument:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this

Ordinance  or the repeal of the Municipal Ordinance

the  Minister  may,  in  his discretion,  by  order

published  in  the  Gazette  and  subject  to  such

directions  as the Minister may from time  to  time

give  to  the City Council, authorise, empower  and

direct the City Council or any of its employees  to

continue   to  have,  exercise  and  perform   such

functions  duties, powers (including the powers  to

levy  rates  and  to charge fees), discretions  and

authorities  or  any  of  them  had  exercised   or

performed  by  the  City  Council  or  any  of  its

employees  under  the provisions of  the  Municipal

Ordinance  and may likewise authorise, empower  and

direct the City Council or any of its employees  to

refrain  from  exercising such  functions,  duties,

powers, discretions and authorities...".



<br><br>But  one was given to understand that, in point  of

fact,  the City Council would administer this  area

going  out of the District Council for a period  of

three  or  four  years. Now, Sir, the  position  is

this:  that  this new area will be in the  District

Council.  It will have electoral divisions  in  the

Changi    District   Council.   It    will    elect

representatives  from  this  area  to  sit  on  the

District Council, but the City Council will perform

the  administration. So you will have the  position

of  your representatives of Katong, Siglap, part of

Ulu  Bedok and Geylang Serai sitting on one Council

and  the  administration of that area being carried

out by another Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have stated, there are very fundamental

issues  involved in this Local Government Bill  and

we  are  not  satisfied that  they  are  all  being

tackled in the right way - I have only given you  one

example.  But  the  other  problems  to  which  the

Minister  has  referred are very  big  problems - the

limits  to  the  City and District boundaries,  the

powers and functions of District Councils, the size

of the Councils and their languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>



differential rating, the status of the  Mayor  and

so  on. These all need proper ventilation in  open

meeting,  so that both the Members of this  House,

the  electorate  and the ratepayer can  understand

what is involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I second the amendment.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support   the  amendment  and  to  add  a  further

amendment to the amendment, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, to add "and clauses 214 and 255".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 214 deals with the

licensing and the controlling of hawkers. One  big

problem  in  the  City  area  is  the  problem  of

hawkers. A great deal of oppression by minor  City

Council  officials  and  sometimes  by  Government

officials  is  constantly going on, not  with  the

connivance of the Government or the City  Council,

but  simply  because  of the lack  of  ability  to

control   the   lower  officials  of   the   local

government  authority.  I will  at  the  Committee

stage propose certain amendments as to what is  to

be  done  when  the property of hawkers  is  being

detained  by  the  police,  or  by  City   Council

officials. The present procedure in the  detention

of  the  property of hawkers pending the trial  is

unsatisfactory and it would be beneficial to clean

administration and to the hawkers if a  system  is

devised  whereby when property is seized a receipt

is  given.  At  present no receipt is  given,  and

although  part of the goods may subsequently  find

their  way to the Social Welfare Department to  be

distributed to the poor when they are  ordered  to

be confiscated by the Police Magistrate, it is not

altogether  certain that all the  articles  seized

are eventually put through the proper channels. An

abuse  of  this nature can be prevented if  it  is

specified beforehand that when goods and  property

are sized, a receipt should be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to clause 255 I should like at the Committee

stage  to  propose that the Government should  not

extend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>



powers  of the Rural Board to require a permit  to

be  obtained  before  a well  is  dug.  One  could

envisage circumstances where a well having already

been  dug is considered unhygienic or a danger  to

either  health or person, and it may be  necessary

to  order its closure. But to demand that a farmer

or  a squatter should go through all the elaborate

process of getting a permit before digging a  well

is, in my opinion and I think in the opinion of  a

great number of rural dwellers, an unnecessary bit

of bureaucracy. Therefore at the Committee stage I

propose  to move that this innovation of requiring

a  licence  before digging a well  should  not  be

accepted and included in the Bill.

<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the motion

in my name, namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 174 of

the  Labour  Ordinance,  1955  (No.  40  of  1955),

resolves   that  the  Labour  (Procedure - Reciprocal

Provisions)   Regulations,   1957,   published   as

Notification  No.  S 166 in the Gazette  Supplement

No.  48  of  28th  June,  1957,  as  contained   in

Sessional Paper No. S.L. 13 of 1957, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations, the subject of my motion, have

been  made by the Governor in Council under section

172 of the Labour Ordinance. This section gives the

Governor  in  Council the power to make regulations

to  prescribe the procedure for sending  summonses,

warrants and orders to the Federation of Malaya for

service,  and  to make similar provisions  for  the

service, execution and enforcement in Singapore  of

summonses,   warrants  and  orders  made   in   the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a similar provision in the Federation's

Employment  Ordinance and the Federation Government

has made similar regulations to those contained  in

Sessional  Paper S.L. 13. If my motion is  adopted,

Sir,  it is proposed to bring both regulations into

force on 1st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the regulations themselves.

Regulations 3 and 4 provide for the service of  the

Singapore  Commissioner for Labour's  summonses  in

the  Federation and of the Federation  Commissioner

for  Labour's summonses in Singapore. It  sometimes

happens  that employees residing in the  Federation

employ  workmen  residing in  Singapore  and  these

regulations will enable the Commissioner for Labour

to  summon  the  employer to the  Labour  Court  in

Singapore should the workmen employed by him lay  a

complaint there and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 enable orders made by

the  Commissioner  for Labour to be  registered  in

either territory for enforcement by the appropriate

sessions or civil district courts and lay down  the

procedure  for the payment of monies due under  the

order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations 10 and 11 ensure that employers who

abscond  from one territory to the other  to  avoid

payment of workmen's wages may be apprehended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>



and   returned  to  the  territory  in  which   the

complaint against them has been made. Mr  Speaker,

<div align="center"><b>GENERAL ORDERS AND RIGHT TO STRIKE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BY GOVERNMENT SERVANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, in

the  past two weeks there has been one strike by  a

group  of  Government servants, namely men  in  the

Customs  Branch, and a threatened strike by another

group  of  Government servants, namely the  English

school-teachers.  In  both  these   instances   the

Government issued strong warnings in the Press  and

in  letters  to  the  Unions that  it  intended  to

exercise  its powers under General Orders  207  and

208. General Order 207 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any officer who, without leave or reasonable

cause,  is absent from duty for any period of  more

than  7  days  may  be  held to  have  vacated  his

office."



<br><br>And General Order 208 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) Absence from duty for any period whether

more  or  less  than  7  days,  without  leave   or

subsequent sanction, constitutes a break in service

and  no  officer may be paid salary for any  period

during which he is so absent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Head of Department is responsible for

ensuring that the proper deduction from salary  is

made."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the uncertainty which this step has

created and was designed to create in the minds  of

Government  servants who were either on  strike  or

intended  to  strike, I think  we  should  clarify,

first  the  legal position, and second,  the  trade

union position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not suggesting, as the former Member for

Cairnhill did at one stage, that a strike should be

legalised in the form that it is a lawful breach of

a contract. The position in English law is that any

strike  constitutes a breach of the contract  which

an employee enters into either orally or in writing

with  the  employer. But the Trade Union  Ordinance

says  that no union can be held responsible  either

for  conspiracy or for any other tort  in  bringing

about  the  breach of this contract as a result  of

collective action by the Union. Therefore,  in  any

strike  by  any  group of employees there  are  two

aspects to consider, first, that of the union,  and

second, that of the individual members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as a union is concerned, there is no

offence  either in law, criminal or civil.  But  as

far as a striking union member is concerned, in any

strike  he goes over from the province of law  into

that  of  politics; he is fighting it out with  his

employer. It then becomes a tussle of strength,  of

bargaining  power,  between the  employer  and  the

employees  collectively. If the  strike  fails,  as

sometimes  strikes are known to have  failed,  then

the  employees are sacked. In law he  can  be  sued

individually for breach of the contract of  service

for  not  having  given  the  required  notice   of

termination of service which may either be  implied

or   expressed  in  his  contract.  If  the  strike

succeeds, then the union bargains collectively with

the  employer not only that its members  should  go

back  without incurring any penalty for  breach  of

the  individual contract, but also that they should

go back on better terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it is with the Government, and for

Government to introduce General Orders 207 and  208

into   a  trade  dispute  is,  in  my  opinion,   a

deliberate attempt to queer the pitch of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>



Government  workers. Every Government  servant  who

goes  on  strike,  acting  collectively  through  a

union,  runs  the  risk  of  having  breached   his

personal contract of service with his employer, and

that breach may not only bring about the forfeiture

of  pensions, but also the right of the employer to

sue  for  payment  in  lieu of notice,  implied  or

expressed,  in  his contract of service.  Therefore

there  is  in fact no difference in a strike  by  a

group  of workers be they in the Government service

or in private employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once you have accepted that, the Government,

which  should  conduct  itself  as  a  model   good

employer,  should not go out of its way to  try  to

brow-beat  its employees by threatening  them  that

their  pensions will be lost, or that they will  be

assumed to have vacated their posts, just in  order

to  prevent  collective action by a  group  of  its

employees. If the Government takes this stand,  the

bluff  will  sooner or later be called because  one

group of Government servants will go on strike, win

that  strike and compel the Government not only  to

take  them back with no break of service  and  with

pensions  secured, but also with better  conditions

of service and enhanced remuneration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should imagine, therefore, that it would be a

good  policy on the part of the Government  not  to

try  to  introduce  a  red  herring  into  a  trade

dispute.  Government knows what the legal  position

is. So do some, but not all, of the employees. What

the  Government is seeking to do is to make  us  of

this  ignorance of some of its servants to  try  to

intimidate  them  into giving  up  their  right  of

collective action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not consider this matter vital enough to be

the  subject of a motion. I was approached by  both

the  Unions  involved to raise this matter  in  the

Assembly,  and  I  think it should  receive  proper

ventilation  in  this House. If the  Government  is

going  to act in this high-handed and authoritarian

manner,  it  will be setting a bad example  to  all

other employers. I therefore ask the Government  to

consider  seriously whether it is wise,  first,  to

make a threat, and second,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>



having made it to provoke its employees at a  later

date to call its bluff.



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

welcome this opportunity to explain the position of

Government  servants who go  on  strike  and  I  am

grateful  to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  for

his  courtesy  in  giving  me  ample  time  to  say

something in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the position is fully understood by the

Staff Side of the Civil Service Joint Council and I

think it is also fully understood by the leaders of

the  big Staff Associations, but I do agree in part

with  the  hon. Member there are other sections  of

the  public  service,  particularly  those  led  by

persons who are not themselves Government servants,

who do not yet understand this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before explaining the position, I should like

to  deplore the continued emphasis in the terms  of

the  notice  given  by the hon. Member,  on  rights

rather than duties, on the right to strike.  If  we

would  all apply ourselves wholly to our duties  to

others  and to the community, I think our so-called

rights   would  look  after  themselves  and   that

Singapore would be a better place. Public  servants

are the servants of the public. They have a duty to

serve the public and we should never forget that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, a Government officer holds office

at  the  pleasure of the Crown and can be dismissed

at  any time. That is the principle, the theory. In

practice,  his employment is safeguarded  by  rules

and  regulations designed to give him  security  of

tenure  of  office, subject only to good behaviour.

Government servants cannot be sacked arbitrarily by

a  senior  officer, as employees  in  industry  and

commerce can be and are. And as the hon. Member for

Tanjong   Pagar   indicated,  trade   unions   have

developed because of the exploitation of labour  by

bad employers. It was because the individual worker

had  no remedy against the boss that workers banded

themselves together into trade unions and through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>



trade  union  organisations were  able  to  bargain

collectively with their employers from  a  position

of  strength.  It  was because of  this  that  they

adopted the final weapon of the strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar rightly

pointed  out, a strike is the withdrawal of  labour

by  employees  designed to compel the  employer  to

make  concessions, and it amounts to a  termination

of  a contract of service. It is a cruel weapon for

the  striker because he deliberately terminates his

contract  of service with his employer and  depends

on  successful  negotiations,  on  victory  in  the

strike, to get his job back again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Government servants have never been in the

same  position as other workers. They  have  always

been  protected  by  a code of service  regulations

from  victimisation and unfair treatment. They have

always   had  security  of  office,  a  fundamental

characteristic  of  responsible  employment  by   a

government and indeed one which is often criticised

by   members   of  the  public.  The  greater   the

responsibility which a Government officer has,  the

more   protection  does  he  get   from   arbitrary

dismissal  or  unfair treatment.  Officers  on  the

pensionable establishment can only be dismissed  in

accordance   with   a   complicated   semi-judicial

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasised these privileges and the

particular position of Government servants  because

these  privileges  and  safeguards  in  the  public

service   must  carry  with  them  a  corresponding

obligation   of  loyal  and  conscientious   public

service, a duty to serve the public and to put  the

public  interest first. The public rightly  expects

this  loyal  service.  Now  to  strike  is  clearly

inconsistent  with loyal service to the  public.  A

strike puts the interests of those on strike before

the interests of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask what about genuine grievances? How

are they to be put right if Government servants are

not  to  strike? And again I say, Sir, that  public

servants  are  in  a  specially favoured  position.

First   of  all,  they  are  employed  not  by   an

individual  boss  but  by the Government,  and  the

Government is answerable and responsible to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>



this  Assembly  and  to public  opinion.  Secondly,

every  officer  has the right of  appeal  from  his

immediate  superior  right up to  the  Governor  if

necessary.   Thirdly,   we   have   strong    Staff

Associations  able  to  talk  with  authority   and

influence.  Fourthly,  we have  the  Civil  Service

Joint  Council  which  is  able  to  discuss  staff

problems  and grievances at the highest level;  any

Staff  Association which gets the full  backing  of

the  Staff Side of the Civil Service Joint  Council

is  certain  of  the utmost consideration  for  its

claims. And finally - and most important of all  in

this context of striking - the constituent members of

the  Staff Side of the Civil Service Joint  Council

have   the   right  to  take  the   Government   to

arbitration, the right to compel the Government  to

submit a dispute to impartial arbitration, a  right

which  several Staff Associations and  Unions  have

exercised and are today exercising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, Sir, that a strike should be the last

resort  of  any  association  of  public  servants,

remembering  both their primary duty to  serve  the

public and the very special means at their disposal

for settling their grievances without resorting  to

strikes.  But  in  the  last resort  if  Government

servants  insist on taking strike action, they  are

of course at liberty to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the proposition of the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar that a Staff Association or a  Union

which  calls  a strike of Government officers  does

not, providing it observes certain limitations, lay

itself  open  to any charge of having  committed  a

criminal or civil offence. The Government stated in

this  House  on  22nd May that  it  recognises  the

fundamental  right of a trade union to strike.  But

when a Government servant goes on strike, like  any

other  person  going on strike  he  terminates  his

contract  and employment. He breaks faith with  his

duty  of  service to the public who  pays  him  and

safeguards  him from arbitrary treatment.  He  also

faces certain peculiar consequences which flow from

his  position as a public servant whose  terms  and

conditions  of  service are governed  by  statutory

rules and regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that all Government servants,

before  they  resort to strike  action,  should  be

fully  aware of these consequences which flow  from

their special position. A Government servant who is

absent from duty on strike breaks his service, just

as  any  other person on strike breaks his service.

And  it follows that if a Government servant breaks

his service, he forfeits his pensions and his other

service  benefits  will  be  seriously  prejudiced.

Government pensions are governed by law and the law

quite  rightly  says  that to  count  for  pension,

service  must be continuous. Therefore a  break  in

service   caused  by  striking  will  automatically

forfeit all previous service for pension purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious consequence indeed. It

follows   from  the  provisions  of  the   Pensions

Ordinance  and from General Orders. And  it  is  to

make  sure  that Government servants do not  go  on

strike forgetting that they stand to forfeit  their

previous service that recently we have always tried

to  issue  specific warnings. The hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  interprets  them  as  threats   and

intimidation. I say we issue specific  warnings  to

remind  them  that  if  they  do  carry  out  their

intention to strike, there will be a break in their

service, they will be deemed to have vacated  their

offices  and  they  will  therefore  forfeit  their

pensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make sure that they realise that their

position  is  not the same as that of employees  of

bus  companies or rubber factories. The hon. Member

for   Tanjong  Pagar  stated  that  there   is   no

difference between an employee of a private concern

and  a  Government servant going on  strike.  That,

Sir, I submit with all respect, is a most dangerous

misconception.  There  is a fundamental  difference

between  them  and the difference is this,  that  a

public  servant and his conditions of  service  are

governed  by  the  law.  In  the  case  of   public

servants,  it  is  not a matter  simply  of  direct

bargaining  between a number of  employees  and  an

employer. Their conditions of service are  governed

by the law. So I do not feel any remorse, Sir, over

the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>



that  warnings were issued. I have the notices  in

front  of  me here. What we did was to tell  these

officers    in    the   Customs   and    Education

Departments - let me read the one which  was  issued

to the Customs Department:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are reminded that if you strike, you lay

yourselves   open  to  dismissal   under   General

Orders."



<br><br>And  what do the General Orders say? They say that

if you are absent from duty for any period of more

than  seven days, you may be held to have  vacated

your office, and that absence from duty will be  a

break in service for which no pay can be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is to bring home to public

servants  that if they go on strike they do  stand

to  lose  a  great  deal  more  than  an  ordinary

employee.  And  it  is  not  easy  or  necessarily

possible  for  the  employer, the  Government,  to

remedy  any consequences which may follow  from  a

strike.  I  am told, for example, that some  years

ago  in  Nigeria it was necessary to enact special

legislation in the Legislature to enable a  period

during which railway workers had been on strike to

count for pension purposes. I mention this to show

that  very  serious difficulties  will  stem  from

strike  action  by  Government  servants  who  are

pensionable.  I myself think that it  is  fitting.

When  a  man is a pensionable public servant,  the

strike  should  be his very last  resort,  and  he

should  remember that if he does adopt it he  does

so at his peril.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  spite of all  the  explanation

given by the Hon. the Chief Secretary, I think  he

has not even answered the argument put forward  by

the  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar.  One  simple

illustration I can point to is that of the postmen

who  went on strike sometime ago; they were  taken

back into service and did not lose anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Sir, for

the  information  of the hon. Member  the  postmen

were not pensionable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They were; most of them were.

[Interruption] I need no clarification, because  I

was negotiating with the then Chief Secretary, the

Colonial   Secretary,  and   the   present   Chief

Secretary  is  probably unaware of the  facts  and

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The point at issue, Sir, was whether

they should be made pensionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing if he will  supply  a

list  of  the  names of successful  applicants  for

S.I.T. houses during the period January  to  June,

1957,  showing,  by  names  of  streets  and  house

numbers,  the  accommondation  allotted,  and   the

number  of points awarded to each of the successful

applicants.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I am informed

by  the Singapore Improvement Trust that the  Trust

has   let   no  new  premises  during  the   period

January/June,  1957, and that any  lettings  during

this  period have been to fill casual vacancies  or

in connection with transfers only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trust considers it highly undesirable to

divulge  information as to the names of  applicants

who have been successful in obtaining accommodation

in  vacated  premises or the names of  tenants  who

have been transferred to other premises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing  if  he  will  give

complete   figures  pertaining  to  the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust  flats in Albert/Prinsep/Short

Streets   showing  how  the  amount  of  Government

subsidy in respect thereof is calculated.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> The method of

subsidy by Government on S.I.T. housing is outlined

in  the Government White Paper, No. Cmd. 6 of 1957.

The subsidy is not related to any particular scheme

but  is in fact the amount required to make up  the

annual  deficit in the Trust's Housing Account.  It

is   not  possible  therefore  to  give  any  exact

calculation of the subsidy in respect of the Albert

Street/Prinsep  Street/Short  Street  scheme  for

which  there can be in any case no complete figures

until  the buildings are completed. The approximate

figure  of  $30 to $40 given in oral  answer  to  a

question by Mr Lim Choon Mong at the last  meeting

of  the Legislative Assembly as the subsidy for the

$35/30  p.m. two-room flat is  the  best  estimate

which can be given.
